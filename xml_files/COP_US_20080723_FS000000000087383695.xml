          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the ConocoPhillips Second Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.  My name is <mark type="inaudible" /> and I will be your coordinator for today.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of today's conference.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the presentation over to Mr. Gary Russell, General Manager of Investor Relations.  Please proceed sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" />, and welcome to all who have joined us on the earnings conference call for ConocoPhillips for the second quarter of 2008.  I have with me today, Jim Mulva, our Chairman and CEO; and John Carrig, our Executive Vice President of Finance and CFO.  Jim will be taking us through a slide presentation that's been prepared to help you understand the financial and operating performances of the company, during the second quarter of this year.  This presentation along with other supplemental information can be found on our website, www.conocophillips.com.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page two now, you'll see our safe harbor statement, and this statement simply says that there will be forward-looking statements made during our presentation today, in the conference call and these forward-looking statements represent our management's current expectations.  Actual results may differ materially from these expectations, and if you'll take a look at our SEC filings, you'll find information on items that could cause these material differences.</p>
          <p>So, at this point, I'll turn the call over to Jim Mulva.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you and I appreciate all those who are participating in our conference call.  I'm going to start off on page three.  You see in the second quarter, our income was 5.4 billion, that's $3.50 a share.  We generated 5.4 billion in cash from operations.  Our debt-to-cap ratio is 19%, the same as it was at the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In our upstream business, we've produced 2.2 million BOE a day, and that includes an estimated 448,000 BOE a day from our LUKOIL investment segment.  On the downstream, crude processing capacity utilization was 93%, that's up from the 89% in the first quarter.  As we have told the market, we purchased 2.5 billion of our stock in the second quarter &#x2013; $2.5 billion of our stock in the second quarter, reducing average shares outstanding to 1.555 billion shares, that's 103 million shares lower than the second quarter 2007 average</p>
          <p>Share repurchase programs had a favorable impact on our per-share metrics and you can see that on the next slide, slide four. <mark type="inaudible" /> slide from last quarter, on the left hand side you can see the 103 million share reduction, I just referred to.  On the right side of the chart, you can see second quarter 2008 earnings per share were $0.60 higher than the same quarter last year.  Now, that's after adjusting for the Venezuelan impairment for last year.  And $0.22 of that improvement is directly attributable to our share repurchases.</p>
          <p>Now we will update you on our future share repurchase plans for 2009.  We'll do that most likely in December, when we come out and announce our capital spending program for 2009.  So, you can expect us to be doing between 2 and 3 million &#x2013; between 2 and 3 billion of share repurchase in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to page five, second quarter net income was 5.4 billion, and this is 1.3 billion higher than the previous quarter of 4.1 billion shown on the left hand side of the slide.  As you move from the left to the right, you can see the contribution from our asset rationalization program.  The first quarter was higher than the second quarter by $114 million.  Prices, margin, and other impacts improved second quarter by 2.1 billion, it's the green bar.  Lower net sales volumes in our LUKOIL and E&amp;P segments, partially offset by higher volumes in our downstream and midstream segments, reduced income 97 million.  As a result of the current price environment production taxes, the second quarter were 264 million higher than the last quarter, and most of this relates to Alaska.</p>
          <p>Operating costs were about 276 million higher than the previous quarter and we will go into more detail on that in subsequent slides.  And there were other items that, in the aggregate, reduced income 85 million in the second quarter and most significant of that was the LUKOIL true-up which was outlined in our interim release earlier this month.</p>
          <p>And moving to page six, total company cash flow, we start with gold bar on the left, you can see we generated 5.4 billion cash from our operations in the second quarter.  Then you combine that with our beginning cash balance, so we had 6.9 billion of cash available for the second quarter.  So, as you move from left to the right, you see we also had additional cash from asset sales of 362 million.  We used the cash to fund 3.6 billion of capital programs, 719 million of dividends and 2.5 billion in share repurchase.  And a slight increase, 432 million in our debt balance and that has a lot to do with respect to the timing of substantial tax payments that we make in the U.S. as well as in Norway.</p>
          <p>Moving to page seven, total company cash flow, pie chart on the left shows total cash available during the first half of the year at 13.6 billion.  88% or 12 billion comes from operations, remaining 12% from asset sales and reduction in cash balances and small increase in debt.  So, looking at the right, what did we do with the 13.6 billion?  We spent 7.2 billion in our capital program, repurchased 5 billion of our stock and paid 1.4 billion in dividends.</p>
          <p>Now we go to page eight, starting on the left hand side of the slide, we grew our equity to $94 billion, our debt balance shown in the middle was 21.9 billion, and you can see on the right our debt-to-capital ratio remains at 19%.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide nine, talk about E&amp;P quarter-to-quarter.  Realized price for both crude oil and natural gas were higher in this quarter.  Our realized crude oil price was $118.01 at $25.13 per barrel higher than the previous quarter and our realized natural gas price was $9.87 per Mcf, that's $1.84 per Mcf higher than the first quarter.  As we indicated in our interim E&amp;P's production, volumes were lower than the previous quarter and we will talk more about this in other slide. We had higher production taxes mainly in Alaska and that had a negative impact on earnings.</p>
          <p>So, I go to page 10 and talk about our production sequentially quarter to quarter.  Production in the second quarter from our E&amp;P segment that excludes LUKOIL was 1.75 million BOE a day, that's 44,000 BOE a day lower than the first quarter which was 1.79 million BOE a day, that's shown on the left hand side of the slide.  So, we move across from left to right, you can see that production is lower in Norway, Canada, United Kingdom and Alaska. All of that total 61,000 BOE a day.  Now, the vast majority of this reduction is due to planned maintenance and seasonality.</p>
          <p>Production in the lower 48 was 17,000 BOE a day higher as we had reduced production due to planned maintenance in the second quarter and that was more than offset by the impact of restoring the production in the San Juan Basin that had quite a negative impact on us in the first quarter and that related to the non-operated natural gas processing plant in San Juan Basin.  Then you add our equity share of LUKOIL production and that takes you up to 2.2 million BOE a day, shown on the right hand side of the slide.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 11, E&amp;P net income for the second quarter was $4 billion as compared to $2.9 billion in the first quarter.  So, we start with the green bar on the left, prices and other market impacts improved income 1.5 billion.  As you move to the right, you can see that sales volumes negatively impacted income 47 million in the second quarter.  Now, this includes an adverse impact from inventory changes that does reflect the regional mix and the divergence of effective tax rates, rather complicated but it's all in this $47 million.</p>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, production taxes were 264 million higher in the second quarter in Alaska.  Operating costs were higher primarily due to increased planned maintenance, and we had also higher lifting cost and this reduced our income $107 million compared to first quarter.  There are some other items in the aggregate improved income 32 million; that's how you get to the 4 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 12, downstream.  Our realized <mark type="inaudible" /> refining margins were higher than the first quarter.  Our U.S. margins were $10.29 a barrel, and that's $2.29 a barrel higher and then the international margins were $6.70 a barrel and that's higher by $0.28 a barrel in the second quarter compared to the first.</p>
          <p>As we outlined in our Interim Update earlier this month, we do not fully realize the improvement in refining margin in the second quarter and this is due to the significant negative impact from secondary products such as fuel oil, natural gas liquids, and petroleum coke.  These secondary products represent about 20% of overall refined product production in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Our global capacity utilization was 93%, that's up 4% from the 89% in the first quarter.  In the U.S., utilization was 94%, that's 4% higher than the first quarter as our Gulf Coast refineries ran much better.  International utilization was 88%, it's down &#x2013; it was 2% higher than our first quarter, but we really move our hydroskimming margins have quite an impact with the Wilhelmshaven refinery, so when we have pretty good hydroskimming margins, we run it and when we don't, we shut it back on terms of production and this impacts the international utilization rate.</p>
          <p>If we look now to page 13, you can see downstream second quarter income was 664 million, 144 million higher than the first quarter income of $520 million shown on the left hand side of the slide.  And moving from left to right, you can see the contribution from asset rationalization was 114 million lower in the second quarter than the first.  Prices, margin and other market impacts increased income in the second quarter by 249 million, primarily driven by higher realized margins partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and higher utility prices.</p>
          <p>Overall, our downstream, we improved our volumes, which is a result of the higher U.S. utilization and that improved the income 84 million.  We have higher operating cost mainly due to turnaround activity in the second quarter and that reduced income 102 million.  And there were other items in the aggregate improved income $27 million, the largest of that 27 million was higher equity earnings from affiliates.</p>
          <p>So, now I go to slide 14, all the other segments we cover in this slide; our estimate of second quarter equity earnings from LUKOIL of 774 million, higher than the 710 million in the first quarter, primarily due to higher realized prices for crude and refined products partially offset by the true-up that we previously reported.  Now, on the downstream, income was 162 million compared to 137 million in the first quarter, mainly due to higher realized NGL prices.  Our chemicals joint venture, the income was 18 million, that's lower than the previous quarter, in the first quarter it was 52 million.  And this is mainly due to the lower benzene and polyethylene margins, which were negatively impacted by the higher feedstock cost.  And further in the chemical business, we had the utility and turnaround costs were higher in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Emerging businesses contributed 8 million in the second quarter compared to 12 in the first which reflects the lower U.S. spark spreads and then we also had some planned maintenance.  And our corporate costs were 186 million and that's 7 million higher than the first quarter, primarily as a result of lower interest income on cash balances.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Slide 15.  If we look at E&amp;P metrics, you can see the chart shows our E&amp;P income and cash per BOE.  Go back to year 2003 and then through the first two quarters of 2008.  While we don't have the period data obviously for the second quarter for the peer group, we would expect the effect of purchase accounting to continue to impact our earnings per BOE when compared to our peers but when you look at our cash contribution per BOE, we continue to be a very competitive and we expect to be in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Go to next slide, Page 16 which is the downstream and you can see both on an income per barrel and a cash contribution per barrel.  We continued to be competitive and expect to be in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Then I go to page 17 which is a Return on Capital Employed. By the way, the shaded area on the peer group there is made up on the largest integrated publicly traded companies, that's Exxon Mobile, BP, Shell, Chevron, and Total.  This bar chart reflects the company's return on capital employed with no adjustments for purchase accounting but we do make adjustments with peer group to reflect purchase accounting for them for their transactions that they've done in prior years and that's shown in Table 3 which is attached to the presentation.  Our annualized return on capital employed for the second quarter of 2008 was 20%, that's 6% higher than the year of 2007, 5% higher than the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>And I'll go to the last slide, 18, the outlook.  As you know, we recently signed the interim agreement with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company [ADNOC], to develop the Shah gas field in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere in the Mid-East we approved the continued funding moving forward on the development of the Yanbu Export Refinery Project with Saudi Aramco.  We are pleased to be working with both ADNOC and Saudi Aramco on these world class projects that helps to meet the growing demand for energy, not only in the Middle East but also around the world.  We recently signed a MOU at Petrobras, as you know, the largest Brazilian energy company and with this agreement we hope to sort through opportunities to work together in our core businesses, upstream and downstream as well as energy opportunities such as ethanol in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In North America, our joint venture with TransCanada, we plan to expand the Keystone crude oil pipeline system, providing additional capacity of 500,000 barrels per day from Western Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast.  Then we look ahead into the third quarter, we expect our E&amp;P segment production will be similar to the second quarter.  We expect full year 2008 production will be consistent with our operating plan, which we announced beginning of the year and that is 1.8 million BOE a day excluding the LUKOIL segment.</p>
          <p>We expect exploration expenses to be about 375 million in the third quarter. In our downstream refining business, we expect continued negative impacts on market capture due to the secondary product margins that I covered when going through the downstream part of the company. We anticipate our worldwide crude oil capacity utilization will be similar to the second quarter, reflecting continued lower utilization at our Wilhelmshaven refinery due to the weak hydro-skimming margins.  Turnaround costs in the downstream are expected to be $100 million before-tax in the third quarter, and then we expect our share repurchases in the third quarter to be between two and three billion, which supports our objective of doing $10 billion in share repurchases for 2008.</p>
          <p>So that completes going through the prepared comments and so we're ready to take whatever questions that those participating on our call may have of us.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Jen, could we go ahead and line up our questions please.</p>

    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir.  <mark type="Operator instructions" />.  Our first question will come from Michael LaMotte of JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks good morning. Jim, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the memorandum of understanding with Petrobras?  How that came to pass and sort of ultimately where you think it can go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously we are quite pleased with starting to work with Petrobras.  We've worked a little bit with them in the past, but they are &#x2013; we very much respect what they've done around the world and certainly in Brazil.  We're merely looking at the opportunities of how we can participate in exploration production, both in Brazil as well as outside Brazil.  And then we also, with our large refining segment in North America, we kind of explore with ultimately there having more crude oil production, while there's opportunities for us to be working with each other in the downstream part in the company and then for both companies.  And then, we also are looking at &#x2013; we need a lot of ethanol ultimately to blend into our gasoline and so we look at the opportunities of being such a large ethanol producer in Brazil and how Petrobras participates in that, whether it is opportunities for us to be working with each other.  So, to go any further than that, we're really in the initial phases of this study work of the MOU but we're really pleased to be working with Petrobras.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it possible that &#x2013; I know it's early days, but is it possible that the relationship would even involve JVing on hard assets or do you think at this point it will be left to project specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really don't know.  I mean, we're going to explore all the different opportunities, but it's just too early to come out and furthermore, this is always a sensitive area, so we'll just have to wait and see how this develops with time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I can ask you to sort of &#x2013; I know you have good access and contacts in DC and if I could ask you to &#x2013; on two issues kicking around Washington now, the windfall profits on the super majors and also the <mark type="inaudible" />, if you have any comments on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we know that public opinion is really been moving here &#x2013; in the just in the last few months certainly understanding the challenge and initiatives with respect to energy and the high cost of oil and gas and so to the extend that the Washington and the states are working at opening up more acreage, we think that's something that the industry has always been looking for. And we know there's a lot of resources that are indigenous to the United States that we can develop without any compromise to the environment and so that's very, very encouraging so hopefully we're going to see continued movement on that.  With respect to windfall profits tax, we know that with the high prices and all and the financial performance of companies, that's an easy one to talk about.  But on the other hand, the companies are reinvesting their income back into development of energy and that's upstream and downstream, and you know, we really need this cash to reinvest to fund our opportunities, everything that we do, it costs a lot more than the barrels that we produced in the past.</p>
          <p>So, we really don't think windfall profits tax is warranted given the huge cost, the capital cost, operating costs that we have to continue to re-price what we've produced.  And furthermore, as a company or as an industry we know that windfall profits tax in the past has been tried, it really hasn't worked, it has actually led to less supply and actually higher impact on cost of energy.  So, it's really important for us to get that message out and continue to do that, we just don't think it's warranted but we understand that it is talked about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The sense that the swing in public opinion towards more drilling et cetera sort of zaps the momentum for windfall profits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's difficult to say on that.  They're really in some ways two different issues.  But I mean it is encouraged, I think the American public, it's just such an important issue to them and we recognize the hardship it has, the cost of energy on everyone, particularly those with less income.  And so to the extent that we can be adding supply and moderating the impact on energy is something &#x2013; price of energy is something we really need to do. The American public &#x2013; I think the media is becoming more balanced on all of this, the American public understands this although it's such a challenge and it is difficult, we need to add supply. And I think that's what's happening with public opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great.  Thanks, Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from Paul Cheng with Lehman Brothers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey gentlemen good morning.  Jim on the solid gas project, any kind of a preliminary production schedule or development plan you can share and what kind of reserve booking that we may be looking at in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's premature to be getting into production levels or anything on the Shah project.  Obviously, we've been working as pretty closely with ADNOC for quite some period of time and we're very pleased that we've come forward with our agreement with dedicated teams from both ADNOC and ourselves, we're working well together, it's a challenging project.  We've taken quite an innovative approach toward how to do this, one with ADNOC and I know there's quite a number of issues with respect to value creation from the gas production, value creation from the liquids, since that is pretty innovatively put together and it's just premature for us to get into reserve bookings or expected production levels.</p>
          <p>I think that will come probably more likely when we meet with the analysts in the early part of next year. But, I will say that using reasonable expectations on values of cost and values for oil and natural gas prices or whatever, we see that in no way have we compromised &#x2013; in going forward with the Shah project &#x2013; have we compromised our hurdle rates and what we expect for returns on investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Jim I know it's early days, should we assume that you will be able to book some reserves this year?  And also do you have a percentage what is the H2S gas...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that you can expect us to be looking at booking reserves in 2008.  I think it's in subsequent years that we will be doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you have a rough idea, is it 30% H2S gas or that is less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't we come back to you on that, but it has &#x2013; it's pretty sour gas and that's why it is challenging, and we've got to really make sure we do our technical work and all in a way that this is done that in no way &#x2013; and I know ADNOC feels very strongly about this &#x2013; in no way do we compromise environmental or safety performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I think that the next two questions, one is BP and Shell recently had moved into the tight gas in North America through acquisition.  Wondering, Jim, when you are looking at your portfolio, what's your appetite on those non-conventional gas <mark type="inaudible" /> in the U.S.?  You already have some in your portfolio, any appetite that you will substantially increase it <mark type="inaudible" /> as the other two guys did?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got a nice portfolio, both conventional and unconventional. What we need to do is really exploit it which we certainly intend to do over the next number of years as we said in all of our conference calls and presentations.  We spread this out in a way so that we make sure we do it well.  We don't give up any opportunity of drilling the wells ultimately; it's been a question of how fast we go, but we've got a really great portfolio, conventional, unconventional.  And when we look at getting more aggressive, it's exploitation but it's also &#x2013; we do continue to pick up acreage, and so our approach really is picking up acreage.  And so, we quietly do that and we're always looking for not only in the existing areas, but then what we think will become the new areas, the new hot place in the future.  So, that's really our strategy and where it's directed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, Jim, based on what you just say, I suppose that we should not assume you are going to make any multi-billion dollar acquisition there trying to drastically expand you're just going to be more evolution kind of gradually I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your assessment is correct.  Making large acquisitions of assets is, we've done that in the past but we just don't think the environment is right to do that in creating value for our shareholders.  So, we are really doing &#x2013; our growth is really directed towards organic growth as I just outlined.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Two final questions.  One, Alaskan gas pipeline I think, the Alaskan legislation just gave the approval to one of your competitive proposals.  Wondering if you can give us an update what exactly that means, does that mean that you guys go with that one or that that doesn't really mean anything to your current proposal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Well...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last question is for John, looking at the international O&amp;M, not sure why there we have 140% tax credit and it's not in your special items.  So, can you just give us some idea that what is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  First on the gas pipeline in Alaska, we know that in the State of Alaska, the legislature is considering approving the <mark type="inaudible" /> process of the state working with TransCanada.  We'll have to see how that sorts out.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Denali project that we're doing with BP, irrespective of what takes place with the approval or not by the state legislature, we continue to go forward with BP on the Denali project, doing our fieldwork this summer and moving right through a process of open season that we expect here in the next few years.  So, it doesn't change at all the aggressiveness in the plan that we've announced with respect to Denali and our work between ConocoPhillips and BP.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, on that, did Exxon has indicate whether they're going to join you guys or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean ultimately we'd like to see everyone participating in the pipeline, all the producers and whether a pipeline company participates in that, all that remains to be seen.  I really shouldn't be speculating or indicating for another company like Exxon.  I think that's really appropriate for them to answer.</p>
          <p>Now with respect &#x2013; as I said ultimately I think everyone needs to participate.  The question you had on the downstream for John, I'll let John answer.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The negative international tax rate primarily is due to an out-performance by equity companies, which don't record any tax on the equity earnings, because that's just by nature of the structure.  And then there were losses in some of the marketing and other businesses that we have internationally that produced a tax benefit in the consolidated accounts and that resulted in a negative tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's no tax adjustment or anything, that's why you didn't put it out as a special item.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning.  It feels like a couple of the big ticket, if you like, guidance items are bang in line here.  Obviously you're absolutely in line on buyback and we're looking at I guess levels of CapEx, if you could confirm that are exactly in line with what you've guided.  The one area that you seem to be falling a bit short or at least based on what you're saying seem to be falling short is on volumes.  I guess the previous guidance was for a full year 1.8 million barrel today ex-LUKOIL.  You talked about flat in Q3.  I guess we can reasonably expect a bounce back in Q4, but could you just talk a little bit about where we can expect volumes to pan out at the end of the year?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  On share repurchase I did comment on, and so market can expect we're going to do 10 billion a share repurchase in 2008.  It's been going at a rate of 2.5 billion a quarter.  Capital spending is going to be around 15 billion, maybe a little bit more, but 15, 16 billion.  But what we said we are going to spend this year is about where we're going to be.  On volumes, we said 1.8 million BOE a day ex-LUKOIL.  So we're a little bit below that, so you can expect with a flat second quarter or third quarter that the fourth quarter comes up and we still stand behind the 1.8 million BOE a day for 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's good news.  The second thing I had Jim was on Saudi.  You've said that you've agreed to spend more for the continued funding for the development.  Could you just clarify firstly what that means in terms of capital commitment?  And secondly, could you give us a date around which you expect that maybe we might see some volumes out of that project?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is a long project, I think we come back to you with -- I think it's about 2012 when we really get going, somewhere in there.  But we are in the process of actually going into the marketplace with bids for the large units of that refinery.  We expect to have a lot of interest and we &#x2013; hopefully it'll be within our ballpark guidelines and what we think the bids should be.  And then assuming that's all in place, then we announce we go forward with the project.  So that's where we are.  We are working really well with Saudi Aramco.  It's a challenging project, but it has &#x2013; once it's done and built, it creates a lot of value for both Saudi Aramco and ourselves.  So that's where we are right now in the marketplace with our bid packages.  And if we don't see big surprises, any real big negative surprises and it fits the guidelines and we'll be going forward and announcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great on the date.  Jim, any hints you can give us about what kind of prices you're looking out for that refinery of that scale?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Well, we were quite pleased that we won the acreage and we're working through.  It's a tough area that we have to do a lot of planning, but we know that we've got 10 years I believe on these licenses, and so we have to get going pretty quickly.  I don't have right at hand, I don't think you're going to see drilling anytime real soon, because we've got to do a lot of planning and get a lot of permits and approvals to do this.  But, we are working the schedule pretty aggressively and this is one that I'm just going to have to get a little more time before we give you more substance of just how this is going to be done.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, good morning.  First question by way of clarification, these adverse inventory effects, Jim I believe you referred to one in the upstream; the press release refers to one in the downstream.  Could you quantify these effects and explain a little bit more what gave rise to it?  I think the downstream one internationally was associated with an inventory build, but we'd still love some quantification?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, John maybe if you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the downstream inventory build, we don't &#x2013; I don't have a precise number at hand, but it relates to just an inventory cost and that resulted in an inventory charge in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to the upstream, that's more of a mix issue where we &#x2013; it has to do with under-list and over-list quarter-to-quarter and the mix of those between relatively high tax-rate jurisdictions and less high tax-rate jurisdictions and that mix resulted in an impact to the sales volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mark I would say further that when we look at the downstream inventory impacts, we would expect that to be a temporary impact, because it was related to an inventory build in the second quarter and we would expect that to be liquidated before the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary, that's why I was asking for the quantification.  I expect it's temporary also.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay if I could try another one, this one for John Carrig a little bit off the wall, your first quarter 10Q indicated that you chose to defer the implementation of FAS 57 fair-value accounting.  With respect to business combinations, John, can you tell me why you exercised your option to defer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to get more time.  We don't have any large business combinations that we are dealing with, so there's no sense of urgency to get that in place.  It's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But wait a minute, doesn't that relate to BR in particular and others?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not materially.  There's some residual impact that you might have like some impacts related possibly to taxes, but those are not &#x2013; those were not the drivers in that decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one more if I could.  Are you yet incurring take or pay obligations with respect to your commitments on Freeport and can you give us an idea of what that might be if you are unable to utilize the capacity which you contracted for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we will incur take or pay charges related to Freeport.  As you may recall, we signed up for a term to process LNG and then we are also &#x2013; because we funded that, we are also &#x2013; we will receive some of that &#x2013; some of that &#x2013; some amount of that back.  So, the net impact, I don't have an annual number, that's something that we can work to try to provide if not in the next quarter, certainly at our Analyst Meeting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>But, isn't it John something that's rolled in every month.  It's not something that's expected to be a one-time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Yeah, that's right.  Yes, it will be &#x2013; it's an executory and if we have the volumes they will offset the transportation or the processing charges. If we don't then we will have the typical take or pay arrangement where you have an expense in the month where you don't utilize the capacity.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning.  Couple of quick questions from me.  Firstly on the proposed Keystone expansion, can you elaborate what exactly it would mean for Conoco?  Do you expect to have any volumes &#x2013; either shipping volumes or at the receiving end and if we should anticipate any near-term impact on CapEx as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on Keystone the expansion, yes.  We expect to use it by taking Canadian crude all the way down to the Gulf Coast.  It gives us good optionality to be feeding our refineries in Mid Continent and the Gulf Coast both from Canada as well as from say Venezuela and other crudes that we can get from Mexico and other places around the world.  So, we expect to do that.  In terms of capital spending, it's already been geared into our capital spending for this year and for subsequent years.  It's going to be an equity investment, but all of the costs and all of the capital will be just part of our capital program.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And can I ask you about your joint venture with EnCana and were there any change to that joint venture from the corporate changes at EnCana and in the event that there were to be &#x2013; say there were to be a change of ultimate control of the EnCana part of the joint venture would you have preemption rights?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't see any change in our EnCana joint venture.  Obviously, EnCana is splitting into two companies, but the joint venture will be in the &#x2013; not in the pure gas company.  We are working and know the management well and they were part of the formation obviously of the joint venture.  In terms of once it's completed, which is going to take some time, we don't have preemptive rights on things with respect to this joint venture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And can I ask quickly on refining marketing, you mentioned there was an asset rationalization with a net costs of, I think, it was $140 million, are you able to elaborate exactly what that rationalization was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that rationalization related to the sequential difference, so there was a gain in the first quarter that didn't show <mark type="inaudible" /> quarter because we didn't have any material asset sales in the second quarter and so that variance is reflected in that $114 million difference in the R&amp;M chart.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Jim, you had made reference earlier to your strong positioning in non-conventional resource in North America.  I was hoping you might be able to expand a little bit about what your activity levels look like currently in the Bakken Shale and the Montney Shale?  And then possibly even rank where you see the best prospectivity between those two plays and may be put the Piceance and Barnett into that as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's probably better we comment back to you offline on that because really I don't have right at hand just what our position is in terms of today and what we expect to do, so maybe Gary can do that.  In terms of whether how we rank them, what's more prospective than others, that's more of a competitive issue and I don't think we'd like to share that with others.  But in terms of position and all, maybe Gary you can do that offline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then one more if I could.  Lot of the macro statistics are indicating sort of a 2.5, 3% decline in U.S. demand for refined products.  With your own experience as a marketer tend to confirm those numbers, do you think they are too high, too low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are seeing demand down in all the markets, particularly in the West Coast.  So we have to configure our operations and all to make sure that we've run the right &#x2013; have the right inventories.  Don't want to have too much, certainly want to have the inventories you need to supply the marketplace.  But yet, on the other hand, the way we operate we continue to expect that we are going to operate our refineries with the exception of Wilhelmshaven because of it's a relatively unsophisticated refinery in the mid 90% level, all in probably the low 90s.  So, yeah, we've seen the demand falling off more on the West Coast than the other paths.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, maybe if I could just ask one last question on a strategic level, you have taken ownership in the pipeline infrastructure that would generally have attracted utility rates of return.  Can you really expand a little more on the optionality you see in ownership of assets like Rex and Keystone and I think you've already touched on Keystone a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, we can see in terms of the capital invested. Obviously there is some external financing in most of those and so the return on capital investment is pretty good and acceptable, but it doesn't take away necessarily our flexibility over time to do something else with it if we would like to, we can always do that.  But, when you make a commitment, your economic commitment then why not &#x2013; why pay someone else to do some of the financing for it on the basis of your commitment to use the pipeline.  So, we look at that and say, unless we see something that's really attractive in terms of someone else &#x2013; use of someone else's funds or financing, then we might as well do it ourself , but yet not give up the option or the flexibility to refinance it differently in the future.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Hi, thank you.  Jim, can you give us a bit of the update about the EnCana joint venture?  I mean, how well is the production ramp-up and also I think you are having some difficulties receiving the permit for the Wood River, or any update on there and also where are we in the Surmont and also the YK production level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a number of questions, first EnCana.  This joint venture both upstream and downstream is very integrated.  We work upstream and downstream well, separately as well, but really has worked well.  From the top down to all the operating people, it's a joint venture that has gone as well as any. We are pleased with that.  In terms of the production, we had some issues on our production with some mechanical problems in the first quarter, but yet we seem to be doing a lot better and so, for the year we might be down a 1000 or 2000 barrels a day net on this, but we seem to be doing pretty &#x2013; much better than we did in the first quarter in terms of volumes coming from the EnCana joint venture.</p>
          <p>The permit for Wood River of course we are working that business pretty closely with EPA as well as the State of Illinois and I think we would like to think &#x2013; I am always an optimist; so I think we are going to get this sorted out here in the next few months.  We are working very aggressively on it.  We are working with all the right people, so hopefully we'll have some news on that sooner than you might think.  It is important for us to get it sorted out.  We think we will get there.  On the YK field, we did start up production and I think maybe John or Gary could tell you, but it's come on pretty smoothly. We're really quite pleased with what's going on with respect to YK and hopefully we will see some different fiscal &#x2013; some of the impact to the Russian fiscal tax changes will have some beneficial impact on the return for that project.  But in terms of volumes, it's already starting to ramp up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's just actually starting up with its first lifting and so it changes from day to day as we sort this out, but Gary &#x2013; we'll certainly have more info on our conference call next quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about Surmont, are we still looking at just 20,000 barrel per day at this point?</p>

          <p>Surmont. Surmont is actually running really quite well and Gary maybe you have the numbers, I don't have them in front of me for Surmont.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; we were looking at a gross of about 100,000 barrels a day at peak, and so the ramp up is going really well.  We just started production earlier this year, so you wouldn't expect us to be at peak yet, but it's certainly within 15 or 20,000 barrels a day net to us I think is what we are looking at.  So, I will get back with the actual numbers.</p>
