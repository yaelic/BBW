          <p>Good morning, and welcome to Telenor and to the presentation of Telenor's fourth quarter results for 2008. My name is Scott Engebrigtsen, and it's my pleasure to guide you through this morning's presentations. We hope that everyone has the material that we have made available, that is our press release, the quarterly reports, and a copy of the presentation to be used here in a minute. As usual, you can also watch this presentation live or in recording on either the Internet or on mobile phone and you may also send in your written questions during this transmission and you will find the instructions on our website.</p>
          <p>There will be a Q&amp;A session directly after the presentations here, first from the audience present, then from the ones participating on the phone and finally, the opportunity to do individual interviews. To present the figures today, we have our CEO, Jon Fredrik Baksaas, and our CFO, Trond Westlie. And first, I'll leave the floor to you, Mr. Baksaas.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Scott. We have the fourth quarter figure on a splendid winter day here in Oslo today. So let's get started. First of all, I want to say that the fourth quarter is once again an all-time high revenue reported figure. It was so in the third quarter and it is so for the fourth quarter as well.</p>
          <p>The organic growth is at 4%, in line with the third quarter in fact. We have to say though that there are positive currency effects in this amounting to NOK1.3 billion. So the reported growth comes to 11% for this quarter. We have managed to keep the strong margins in our Central and Eastern Europe operations, and we're very happy that Pakistan and Grameenphone now sees quite much stronger figures than what was the case after third quarter. CapEx in Q4 is drained by network projects and spectrum acquisitions in particular in Pakistan, where we had extra spectrum delivered in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As we see it, we are delivering then on our guidance for 2008, with 5% revenue growth for the year on a reported numbers and 6% including Kyivstar. And Trond will come back to the outlook for 2009 later on in the presentation.</p>
          <p>We have also been able to add 5.5 million new subscribers in this period, which we also feel is a fairly substantial amount under the present circumstances around in the world. Number one contributor to this in this setting is VimpelCom in fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If we then move on to the different markets of Telenor, I start with the Nordics. In our Nordic operations, we have maintained our market positions and margins in this fourth quarter. I am particularly happy with the Mobile Norway, which we saw a very strong growth figure of 8% in the business segment, coming on top of the fact that we have added another wholesale customer, Network Norway, coming in and not fully compensating for the fact that Tele2 contract left us more than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Despite the loss of these wholesale revenues from Tele2 in early 2008, revenues have then declined throughout the year of 2% in 2008, which is in line with our guidance, which we put up in Capital Markets Day of 2008.</p>
          <p>Also for Fixed, I'm happy to say that the downward trend seemed to be a little bit easened off this quarter, 3% down. We have though included also then revenues from Datametrix, and there are some growth in global wholesale services, which have lower margins on average attached to it. So there is a certain dilution effect, but despite this, I think that we could say that Fixed Norway is leaving behind the 2008 at expectations and pretty good also on all market parameters.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Sweden and Denmark are impacted primarily by the decline in fixed line voice services, which we see sort of all as a reducing product line going forward, as mobility and broadband is the core of our activities. We are starting then also to see the positive impacts of the integration work coming from our fixed line mobile operation in Denmark after we acquired Tele2 some time ago.</p>
          <p>We are standing by the 10 billion operating cash flow target that we set mid-term back in, I think it was Capital Market Day 2007, and I think that we are closing in towards that target in 2009. Here, we have to see that the restructuring effects, both in Sweden and Denmark, takes form and delivers according to plans, and so far that looks good.</p>
          <p>Then some words on Central and Eastern Europe. The number one consideration here is of course Ukraine. The Ukrainian economy has been severely hit by the global economic crisis with a significant drop in industrial production. And as a consequence, a weakening of the national currency, but we have to say Kyivstar is doing very good also under these circumstances. So there are minor effects only from the weakened Ukrainian economy on mobile spending, at least for fourth quarter. In fourth quarter 2008, Kyivstar upheld its margins at mid-50s and it is another strong year of operation from that organization.</p>
          <p>Looking forward though, we will have to expect some indirect effects also to the mobile spend. But as in many markets, mobile services has proved quite resilient up against the turmoiling effects coming from the financial crisis, at large. The sad fact about this is of course that the currency effect is negative since we've had this significant weakening of the grivna in the period.</p>
          <p>Then move to Pannon. Pannon has delivered very strong figures on customer acquisition this quarter, having restructured its go-to-market strategy on the prepaid. And can look at a customer growth figure, also, more than 250,000 in the quarter, which is more than we've ever seen for quite a number of quarters in Ukraine.</p>
          <p>Also for Serbia, it's a very, very solid quarter. Margin is up quite strongly as you can see to 49%; 34 in same quarter last year. And the Serbian organization has been able to keep costs down, and also remember here that 2007 was a very special year because that was the quarter in which we had the third entrant coming into the market. But both usage and average revenue per user have increased by 10% in Serbia in fourth quarter, and we're quite happy to see that coming through.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we are very pleased to see that Grameenphone and Telenor Pakistan seems to rebound strongly in this quarter. There are though two festivals of Eid in the countries in fourth quarter, which contributed positive to this as the festivals use up activities in the mobile usage. Low subscriber growth but no dramatic change in usage indicate that the mobile sector also in these markets are quite resilient up against the macroeconomic development.</p>
          <p>In Pakistan, a high deployment of own backbone infrastructure has reduced the leased lines cost and bringing the margin up, and this is in line with what we expected and also have communicated at an early stage. And here, we are looking at Telenor Pakistan reaching for probably the 20 million customer line within four years of activities in the marketplace, which I feel is particularly strong, putting Telenor Pakistan as the number two in the market.</p>
          <p>In DiGi in Malaysia, there is a good momentum on postpaid. Here, mobile number portability has been introduced, and we see that as a positive contribution. In Thailand, Thailand has had a very difficult fourth quarter, remembering back to what happened on the political scene. My personal impression is that the present government in Thailand really has been able to establish a platform and are looking forward, also seeing that their tourist activity is at the earlier weeks in January of about 80% of capacity. So maybe this is to show some promising sign for this but still it's very difficult to be very exact on the forecast for that economy.</p>
          <p>Then, events around Kyivstar on corporate governance has been positive for Telenor in this period. After more than three years of staying away from the Kyivstar shareholders meetings and Board meetings, our partner showed up at the last key Kyivstar shareholder meetings in December and also now in January. And at the first meeting, the annual accounts for 2005 and '04 were approved and dividend declared.</p>
          <p>And I'm also happy to say that all the dividends for these years have been paid and received in the other end. And as a consequence, we have as the major shareholder received $230 million, as we speak. And that means dollars delivered to Norway.</p>
          <p>The audit then of 2006 and '07 and '08 have started and dividends for these years will be declared. We anticipate for the two first years within the first half-year of this year and then 2008 coming a little bit later into second half-year.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to see that our efforts here long time has brought some results and that it now seems to be on the track of running the company more in a normal fashion. The question then about re-consolidation of Kyivstar will be addressed by us later on.</p>
          <p>Currently, there is an appeal going on in New York. And later this month, there is a hearing on the Farimex case, which is scheduled in Omsk at 19th of February.</p>
          <p>Then for India, another aspect, which has got a lot of attention. On the Indian transaction, the tower access and transmission agreements is expected to be closed within short time. That means also that the overall agreement package is expected to close within this first quarter. The funding here is, as you have been advised, changed from a capital issue, a rights issue to be done through cuts in dividends for 2008 and 2009 in combination with debt instruments.</p>
          <p>The progress on and the work that has been going on in this project since the time of informing this to the market is of course to hunt for better terms on the very vital call structures based on equipments from vendors on tower structures from tower suppliers as well as on the IT. And when this is clear, we will immediately call for a conference to identify deeper the details of this project.</p>
          <p>Then the operational focus for next year 2009. We are living in uncertain times; there is a challenging macroeconomic environment out there. The impact of this on our industry seems to be at least for now fairly minimal at the early stages of a possible recession and at the same time, this is an industry where we're able to tune our efforts and our resources according to market development.</p>
          <p>We cannot see overall sort of material signs of weaknesses around in our companies, potentially in Thailand, if fourth quarter trends sort of come through as a full year in 2009. But on the other hand, with a new government in place, I think activities domestically will pick up. But there will be a challenging business environment out there and in such an environment, we will adjust our priorities. We will focus on cash flow from operations. There will be a thorough cost control regime in place, looking for cost efficiencies and tight CapEx control along with market development.</p>
          <p>I don't think we're sort of in that sense giving a recipe, which will be very different from the peers of the industry. However, communications is very important for every aspect of daily life about the recession or a growth environment. So we're fairly optimistic on also how the telecom companies including Telenor can maneuver through such a period of greater challenges because of the economic slowdown in the world.</p>
          <p>That leaves my presentation for now. I'll then leave the floor to Trond who will take us through the financials. Trond.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'll guide you through the fourth quarter results for 2008 in this financial turbulent times, hopefully, not as turbulent the next few minutes.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter, as Fredrik said, an organic revenue growth of 4% and top-line reported revenue growth of 11, up to almost NOK30 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. You see the trend line here basically moving upwards as has been expected. The EBITDA number of almost 10 billion, NOK9.9 billion, at a margin of 33%, the same margin as we had in fourth quarter and it follows the same seasonality as it has done the last couple of years.</p>
          <p>Going to the revenue growth, you see from the slide here that we have a revenue growth of 11.2% and an organic growth of 4.3%. As a part of what Fredrik said, the development, the underlying development doesn't show a consistent trend in all our countries.</p>
          <p>So if we go through all the countries and see how actually the reported and the currency effect is on the reported revenue, you see that it's a variety of difference between the underlying organic development and the reported development. Specifically, positively, we see Pakistan, Bangladesh with an organic growth of 20 and 17% together with Kyivstar of 15% and we also see a downturn specifically in DTAC and also in Sweden of that. When it comes to Sweden, there are some market elements that goes there and was also our decision not to enter into basically sell DSL on Skanova line in Sweden. So this chart underlines the element that Fredrik says that we don't see a specific trend coming out of fourth quarter into 2009 as such in the development.</p>
          <p>Then going to the CapEx figures, CapEx for the year of 2008 were in line with our guiding, a bit higher than expected maybe in the fourth quarter, but that was basically as a result of a low quarter three figures and some rollover effect. Some completion of networks as usual at the end of the fiscal year that seems to be important both to our suppliers as well as ourselves, that actually catches up a bit in the fourth quarter, leaving us at the 6.7 billion on the CapEx side and the 485 million is the spectrum fee in Bangladesh. To the right side, you see the development, some additions in Asia and some reductions in Central Eastern Europe of 243, that gives the bridge from fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>But if you then look at the development of CapEx on a fourth quarter rolling basis and look at the more long-term development of Telenor in the cash flow scenario, you see that this quarter, we had an operational cash flow of 3.2 billion, going up from last year fourth quarter of 2.2 billion. But if we turn to the trend line to the right column here, you see the fourth quarter rolling operational cash flow excluding then licenses of spectrum, you see that the ongoing trend in Telenor has been moving upwards and you see that the pickup has been coming in Q3, Q4 basically as a result of the development in Asia as well as the CE.</p>
          <p>So if we go for the compounding elements of this cash flow development, you see that going in to the left here, you see the quarters, quarter-by-quarter segregated by the different mobile areas. You see that Asia came into a breakeven point in around the first quarter of 2008 and have been moving steadily upwards. So the development in the cash flow margins has been positive during the period and we expect that to continue into the year, into 2009. I'll come back to that in the guiding section.</p>
          <p>Then looking at the reported figures, we're reporting revenue of 26.4 billion in revenue, that is not including the Kyivstar; therefore, the almost 30 billion is down to the 26.4 and an EBITDA of almost NOK8 billion. For the year, we're delivering, well, a bit more than NOK97 billion in revenue and EBITDA before other items of just over 30 billion and that is basically in line with the guiding for the year of reporting growth of 5% and if we include Kyivstar, it's the 6% and it's above the 34% margin.</p>
          <p>There are a few specific elements in this that I want to highlight. The other element is basically a bit of housekeeping, it's three elements, it's some lost contracts that has been provided for of totaling 257 million.</p>
          <p>Another important element is the associated company. That is lower as a result of our estimate on the VimpelCom number. The Kyivstar number is just short of one billion plus in this number. And as usual, we are taking the analyst estimate on VimpelCom and used that. But we have evaluated that considering the information VimpelCom gave after their third quarter release relating to their currency exposure on their debt, we have not only used the analyst consensus, we have added another NOK1.7 billion as a result of currency costs due to the fact of the positions in VimpelCom. In addition to that, we had a correction as a result of that currency effects of 300 million. So in this number, the negative effect from VimpelCom is approximately NOK500 million. That is also &#x2013; the 1.7 billion is actually NOK1 a share on our EPS.</p>
          <p>Then going to the net financials of 694, it's basically in line. I will come back to that on our net financial cost. It's basically in line, and that is due to that we have a very good hedge in the accounts. And thereby, we have a very marginal effect on the P&amp;L. There are translations effects of course in the balance sheet and on the equity side. But other than that, it's just a marginal effect on the P&amp;L side. It's actually less than NOK100 million.</p>
          <p>In total, we see that the earnings per share is 1.33 but that also includes the additional cost as we have put on the currency effects of &#x2013; or the currency loss on VimpelCom of 1.7 billion. That actually comprises of just over NOK1 a share.</p>
          <p>The net interest-bearing debt increases from 39 to just above 45 billion. The major element in that number is a currency change and accruals. So at the bottom of this on the table to the right, you see the currency effects of 5.7 and the accruals of 2.0, actually comprises more than the growth in the debt in Norwegian kroners. And as I said, the hedging is working perfectly. So the P&amp;L effect of that is marginal.</p>
          <p>Going then to some of the focus points for last quarter and that has been the development of the interest cost. You see it from this graph that we have being steadily picking up as a result of the interest rates and the market has been picking up. From fourth quarter, we are having an average of 5.8% cost and this year, we have an average of 6.8%.</p>
          <p>Even though our maturity on our debt is much longer, is longer than the duration of our fixing of the interest cost, we have a duration of our fixing of our interest cost less than one year. And as a result of that, our interest cost has already gone down as a result of the interest that has gone down in the beginning of 2009. So as a result of how we see the interest curves go right now, we foresee that the interest cost is also going to be reduced during 2009.</p>
          <p>Then going to another element there has been some questions about, it's our debt maturity profile. I can also say then that we have fully updated websites on these issues, both on interest as well as debt profiles. So I do think that you will find most of the information there. But as you see on the maturity profiles, we're spread out. We have a short-term debt of NOK10.8 billion in 2009, very limited in 2010 and some in 2011. The difference between the colors here, the blue ones is the Group numbers and the shaded ones is the numbers in our subsidiaries which we don't wholly own, it's companies like DTAC, DiGi, and so forth.</p>
          <p>So in that sense, we are fairly evenly distributed. In addition to that, we have now in the beginning of 2009 committed facilities undrawn of approximately NOK28 billion. That is just as a backup facilities in the event that the money market is not coming up to speed, so that we're not able to refinance these elements in the money market. If that happens, we're then able to draw on the backstop facilities of approximately then NOK28 billion. So effectively, we do see that we are covered for a long period of time, and that also includes the element of including India into this equation.</p>
          <p>Then coming to the outlook for 2009. When we look at the macro elements and the trend coming into 2009, we must say that it's definitely a higher uncertainty than before. And therefore, we're more uncertain on the development when it comes to the top-line structure. But the best effort and the best estimate we have right now is the organic revenue, meaning the underlying revenue not taking into consideration the currency changes that happened in 2008. Then we see an organic revenue in line with 2008. If we convert that to how the currency development have been doing during 2008, and use the currency numbers at December 31 for 2009, that will mean that we will have a reported revenue growth of approximately 5%. So an organic 0% with a currency rate at January 31 implies a reported revenue growth of 2009 of 5%.</p>
          <p>Moving from there, we see that we are continuing the level of EBITDA and guiding on around 34% level, and we're also guiding the CapEx downwards to a level of 15 to 17%. That is the group as of 1st of January excluding India.</p>
          <p>Coming to India, as a result of the delay and what we previously announced, we see that India effect for 2009 we now expect the revenue portion to be marginal. We do see that the EBITDA loss will be around two to NOK2.5 billion and that CapEx levels would be in the range of 5.5 to 6.5 billion.</p>
          <p>And as I said, the elements when it comes to the top-line development is of course of some uncertainty. But we do believe that the focus we have on the KPIs, both when it comes to operational excellence as well as the CapEx focus we had, allows us to have the necessary focus on the cash flow and the cash flow improvement that will come as a result of this guiding.</p>
          <p>And that concludes my part.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Martin Hoff from Arctic Securities. I was wondering, are you reiterating a lot of the other guidance you gave for India in Q3 like you said 40,000 towers for the first year, is that still your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since the potential startup of the project will be later in the year to reach that full level in the months then available is a too high figure and as a consequence of this, the CapEx figure and the EBITDA figure are lower than what we had on the slides in October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But do you still expect 40,000 towers for the first year of operation and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the first year of operation, we are looking for the same amount of towers, yes. But we are also since we started and as I said we have spent this period to hunt for improvements in the basic cost parameters of both the towers, the vendor's side as well as the IT side and as a consequence, the figures will be better or stronger than what we had in the October setting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any further questions from the audience present? If not so, I think we will turn over to those participating on the phone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, first, Patrick Maurice (sic) [Maurice Patrick] , JP Morgan. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, it's Maurice Patrick from JP Morgan. Clearly the focus on free cash flow here is what's important. You've talked about the India delays mean that free cash flow will be stronger than you previously guided at the third quarter. Can you talk a bit about the repatriation of cash from your subsidiaries? I mean DiGi and DTAC dividends are known, but can you talk about how you've repatriated cash from your other operations in emerging markets, and also talk a bit about how you expect your net debt to trend this year given what you're saying on the CapEx and free cash flow numbers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, relative to the repatriation of cash, going forward, I do think that we're actually going to see that most of our &#x2013; or all of our operation except Pakistan going into 2009 going to be cash flow positive. That means that the repatriation of cash is done on a continuous basis on our 100% owned entities. For our partly owned entities like Kyivstar, Grameenphone, DiGi, DTAC, it's on sort of a decision basis relative to how dividend is &#x2013; we're able to actually distribute dividends.</p>
          <p>When it comes to DiGi and DTAC, they are public. So you know about that repatriation. When it comes to Grameenphone, I don't expect any major repatriation from Grameenphone in 2009. And Kyivstar, we have announced that basically we have received $230 million already and we are about &#x2013; we have the process on deciding on dividend distribution on the later year and that's basically how that is done.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the other companies that we have 100% ownership of, is basically Serbia, Montenegro, Hungary, and all the others, is basically done on a continuous basis in a cash management system that we have. And we are following up that with the normal decisions domestically, so that we complete the formalities.</p>
          <p>Coming to the debt development going in 2009, it's always a currency element, but disregarding the translation on the currency development, I do think that we're going to see a flattish or a somewhat improved net debt structure. As a result of even though we see a postponement in the Indian cash flow investments, it's still going to be flattish to slightly improved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've taken the step to not pay dividends for this year and probably also for next year. So given what you've talked about the focus on cash flow, to what extent are you confident that you can fund the first two or three years of the Indian transaction through organic cash flow and not have to go to the equity markets again or to refinance?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that, we have done our scenarios and our sort of sensitivity analysis and we're comfortable that that will be done. The Indian investment will be done on our operating cash flow, as it has been scheduled out and that includes the dividend cuts in 2009 and 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one final question on the revenue growth. You talked about the flat revenue growth. You did 4% in the fourth quarter, I think four in the third quarter, a bit higher in previous periods. Are you taking a conservative &#x2013; I mean you talk about the uncertain outlook but are you taking what you'd say the conservative view on how the macro environment will impact the revenue development in these markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; I think it is pretty impossible right now to actually say whether we're conservative or not. I do think that the fundament in the macro says that we're uncertain. So it's the best guess that we have relative to how we see the development in the different markets. I do think that we fundamentally think that telecom or mobile sector is more resilient than other consumer sectors and we see that as we have experienced so far but the elements say that we're more conservative or not is quite impossible to put a sort of a rating on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Because in terms of current trading, you actually saw an improvement in the trends in Pakistan and Bangladesh, admittedly, Thailand seemed to go worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically the comment to that was on &#x2013; when you see the report, the organic revenue growth from each of the countries, as I said, you cannot take a consistent view after that sheet or schedule and say that the trend goes this way or it goes that way. It's basically domestic issues that drives each one of them. So Pakistan was some element in the third quarter, Thailand had some challenges, Sweden has their own, and the growth in Pakistan as well as here in Bangladesh comes as a result of other trends. So basically I do think that it's impossible for us to say that this is the trend. So we actually have to go country-by-country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Three quick questions if I may. Firstly, could you comment on the trends in the Norwegian fixed business? It looks to me as if the total DSL market is now in decline. Secondly, carrying on from Maurice's question on cash flow, what's the impact from VimpelCom zeroing its dividend on your thinking, and are you comfortable with where the forecasts are for 2009 for associates income? You mentioned in your presentation that you've made some revisions to the Q4 numbers. And finally, at the Capital Markets Day last year, you spoke about the need for additional spectrum and some of the developing markets to launch mobile broadband. Is there anything in your CapEx guidance to cover that cost? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start then on the trends for fixed. I think that we can say that the DSL market in Norway has reached sort of at least a temporary kind of a maturity. The significant or most visible growth element in broadband connection is actually through the cable TV systems of Telenor rather than the DSL. However, on the mobile side, the interest for the mobile broadband service offering has been quite impressive, I'd say.</p>
          <p>We have now more than 150,000 customers on this. This is still a supplementary we feel broadband connection to that of fixed connection. We might expect that there is a migration issue coming up here into the future. But it does also demonstrate that to have the lost potential users of broadband connections on DSL to have them connected is not simply an exercise that is can be driven be applications alone because obviously some people think that they don't need that broadband connection at home if they are sufficiently covered through work or school or whatever.</p>
          <p>Then for the mobile broadband, we're still optimistic. We think this is a phenomenal good service offering for mobile broadband. It has of course inherited in itself the challenges on capacities needed up against volume consumed which is sort of a major question for the whole industry how to cope with in the long run.</p>
          <p>As for additional spectrum, maybe you address the dividend question related to the VimpelCom front. As for additional spectrum in the guidance, there is no element of sort of direct transactions. There are of course some Group leeway on how we guide on this but there is no sort of specific spectrum. As you know, there were three spectrum transactions in our accounts last year and they more or less come on top on our direct guidance for the year. Jon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to the VimpelCom decision on dividend, I mean as an owner, we agree that the priorities is to develop the long-term value of the company and therefore those kind of decisions we agree with. When it comes to the actual cash flow element of that, that is within sort of the elements that we put into our buffers when we actually see that the need for cash relative to what's going to come, and that's a part of the evaluation that we do. So it was kind of expected as we saw it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of where the consensus is for VimpelCom given the ruble devaluation, are you comfortable with those numbers speeding into the net income forecast for Telenor this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, what we've used is to look at the analysts. We're taking the update on the information that VimpelCom themselves gave after their third quarter release. We evaluated what we thought we could see in the analyst numbers. And then we took a decision that we &#x2013; to be on the right side of the currency development in the fourth quarter, we needed to take an additional NOK1.7 billion to the associated line. And we are comfortable with our evaluation on this, but that is totally on a market evaluation basis, and no information from VimpelCom has been used, and they have not been sort of in discussion in our evaluation of that number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks very much. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, as Trond said, you're guiding down your CapEx expectations for '09. More specifically, in its own way so that you're now seeing a lower CapEx than previously expected?</p>
          <p>And second, at the time of the announcement of the India acquisition in late October, you obviously motivated the rights issue by the fact that you would expect a credit downgrade, potentially a serious one, if you were to fund the acquisition and the investments through debt which you will do now. What are your sort of initial indications from the credit agencies in terms of your credit rating?</p>
          <p>And my third question would be obviously you were hit by several factors in Pakistan in Q3, and you've improved, recovered materially in Q4. How have you managed to present this improvement, what is it that has improved in Pakistan? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When it comes to the CapEx, I mean as a result of the organic growth on zero, that means that it actually &#x2013; the underlying element is that the number of minutes is not going to increase that much. And so fundamentally, the lack of further increase of minutes is actually going to reduce the pressure. So that's the fundamental element. So that's basically over the board.</p>
          <p>And as well as other industries, we are recognizing that the uncertainty of the macros, and therefore, we have put more elements on hold and sort of prioritized more on the needs &#x2013; or the short-term needs than the long term as we see the long-term development of each of the operations. So it's actually is a very generic element going into this.</p>
          <p>And also I might add that in this number of 15 to 17%, we also have another satellite in broadcast this year that actually comprises of 1% in addition. So actually we do think that we have the necessary focus, but it will be widespread relative to that, and I do think that if we go back to the presentation we had during how you saw the fourth quarter rolling development on the operational cash flow, I do think that you're actually going to see an extended trend how that is developing.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the credit rating, the updated rating so far has come as we have expected. Moody's have downgraded us to A3, and Standard &amp; Poor's have confirmed their BBB negative outlook. So in that sense, I do think that the measures and the decisions made by the Board relative to how to fund the Indian investment is actually going accordingly to our plans, and we see that the rating is as expected actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to the operational question related to Pakistan, third quarter in Pakistan was a very challenging quarter. We've seen at that point of time that in both the usage &#x2013; average minutes of usage per user went down, and both the average revenue per user moves up as well as minutes goes up in fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So this is a usage buildup, and the single most item on the cost side is that of an extended usage of own backbone for transportation of data between the base stations, and they're all in the country. So we are very happy that the economy in Pakistan seems to give this kind of activity compared to what we felt was at risk after the third quarter in Pakistan.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Next, Jakob Bluestone, Merrill Lynch, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. Three questions, please. Firstly, can you just update us on any discussions you've had with Altimo regarding ownership of Kyivstar, and also just generally, I mean given the severe economic strain in Ukraine just to confirm that you're still interested in control of that asset?</p>
          <p>And secondly, can you just clarify, and you might have addressed this earlier, I jumped a little bit late onto the call. But the two billion of CapEx for India over three years, can you reconfirm that guidance as well? And then finally, just in terms of your CapEx, what currencies &#x2013; can you maybe give a split of what the currencies for your CapEx is, or is it often just local currency denominated? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that will be a bit of split between two of us again. As to the ownership question on Kyivstar, I have to say that we are a majority owner of Kyivstar, and the court process in U.S. has confirmed that very solidly. And corporate governance of the company seems to now move into place again. So from that perspective, a structural deal isn't that required basically as we felt it earlier. However, on the other side, if there is a possibility here to think structurally, we are of course maintaining our ambitions to take here to start further. And if that implies a willingness to participate in an engagement from the other side, we are happy to engage to that question within fair evaluations of the assets involved in this, of course. Trond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With account to the guidance of India, as Fredrik mentioned in his presentation, we have been hunting for elements of both when it comes to the transmission towers, when it comes to the CapEx in general as well as the IT systems in this period, and when we'll &#x2013; what we will do when we actually have the completed package in place, we will call for a webcast or a call like this to make sure that we give you the updated guidance. So for now, we're not ready to give you any new guidance on India. We'll update you immediately after we have closed the commercial order part that comes into India for that position. So as of now, we're not giving any other indications than what Fredrik has just said that we've been sort of hunting for efficiencies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have the last &#x2013; the third element of your question was related to currencies on the CapEx profile, wasn't it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, if you could give maybe give a split what dollar, euro, NOK, local currency, I don't know if you have that to hand, just in terms of understanding. Obviously, we've had a lot of currency movements over the last 18 months, actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It actually varies from &#x2013; depending on the dollar/euros element, it varies from 12% to 67% company-by-company. But I do think that if you can please take that &#x2013; Jakob, if you can please take that with the IR, I don't have to go through all 13.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fair. Can I just ask one follow-up on Kyivstar? I mean, you said the Board is functioning. Have you put any safeguards in place now, changed any aspects of how things operate to avoid a potential issue such as you had in the past regarding quorums and so on? I mean is there a risk that suddenly we go back to where we were pre-December?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have to raise that question with our partner basically. A new Board is in place. Mr. <mark type="inaudible" /> has been elected Chairman. These are valid decisions and valid events that has taken place. And the Board is constructively working to also getting the accounts for '06, '07, and '08 audited and approved. And we're looking forward to participating in that process according to the new setup. And hope that, and reckon that our partner will do likewise based on the solid platform that was established in the United States over the ruling that we had in November.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, guys. Three questions, please. First, just coming back to the ratings agencies, can you give us a flavor of the adjustments they make when looking at your leverage? Because clearly, I guess they don't look on a consolidated basis, they will make adjustments for your partly owned subsidiaries. Will be helpful if you could enlighten us to what those principal adjustments are.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Unitech, your Indian partner, I notice they were downgraded last month by the ratings agency. I just wanted to sort of get your updated thinking on financing the Indian venture and your partner's ability to invest proportionally in the venture?</p>
          <p>And finally, just on the margins overall, I mean looking at consensus, I think the consensus including Kyivstar is for about 29, 30% margin, so the 34% guidance is obviously well above that. It would be helpful if you could give us an idea of why you think consensus particularly wrong? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the rating, the different bureaus is having different sort of techniques in how they actually adjust, but they basically evaluate the different non-investment grade countries and take out some of the earnings and cash flow coming from them and not put that into the equation of how they actually do the EBITDA to net debt evaluation.</p>
          <p>I do think that instead of me having sort of a deep dive in that, I do think that Standard &amp; Poor's is now issuing a long form any day now. I do think that you will have the necessary evaluation on that when it comes to that and the update on Moody's actually. So instead of me actually going through that, the element what they do is that they &#x2013; the off balance sheet financing like long-term leases, an element like that, they add on to the gross debt.</p>
          <p>They take out non-investment grade countries, and sometimes they put percentages on those cash flows that goes into that equation. So it's a bit art wise that they actually have evaluations on how they do it. So I do think that, but as of now, the book rating or the book metrics that we have on EBITDA to net debt is much less than the rating agencies, and that is due to that they increase the debt as a result of off balance sheets elements and they take out some EBITDA numbers as a result of non-investment grade countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do they actually exclude the debt of partly owned subsidiaries, so DTAC, well, DiGi's got cash, I guess. Will they strip that out, and should we just do that and then include the dividends coming in or is it even more arty than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's bit more arty than that. But I actually do think that the best way you actually get it is to get the updates from Standard and Poor's and Moody's...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there were some more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was one on the Unitech downgrade and the ability to follow up. That question has been there for quite some time. Unitech is in the midst of restructuring their balance sheet. They will be &#x2013; as per date, they will be required to participate in this according to our agreements after the first year of operation basically. And within that timeframe, they are in expectants of having achieved the refinancing of their balance sheet. As to the guidance part of your question, I think that there is a bit of a misunderstanding on that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the element on that is that &#x2013; as we have acknowledged on the guidance &#x2013; or the average in the market, the consensus including Kyivstar is around the 34% level. So I don't think that our guiding is very much different from the market guiding. The element is if you exclude Kyivstar, then it is a lower number as a result of that. And then just to be very clear on that, our guidance on 34% is excluding India and the number on the EBITDA negative number nominally is then 2 to NOK2.5 billion, comprises of roundabout 2 percentage points.</p>

          <p>Yes. Next, James Britton, Nomura. Go ahead, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. First question on maybe some further M&amp;A, I think you suggested back in June last year that you were interested in investing in transmission infrastructure in your existing markets. Can you just update on these plans and would you consider acquisitions in the Ukraine and Hungary in particular, or does your balance sheet make this a bit more difficult now? Secondly, what needs to happen before you would re-consolidate Kyivstar and do you see this happening by the end of 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't quite get your last part of it, but as for the transmission question, the interest &#x2013; the transmission is of course something to do with how these markets develop data wise, how much traffic will there be to be handled and what's the price of that, digital having a control of that kind of infrastructure yourselves as opposed to work with others and there were some possibility on that in Hungary last year, which we did not entertain. This question will probably come back to us at a later stage.</p>
          <p>As for now and as for the potential of the India transaction coming through, the acquisition side of this will of course be that our activities in that field will be limited in the first years of now getting our efforts towards doing the transaction as such. We haven't mentioned though also the possibility then of selling assets, which are considered non-core but that will of course also be part of our future valuations on the event that the Indian transaction comes through as we have said expected to happen shortly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the re-consolidation of Kyivstar, that is sort of a open-ended evaluation. It basically comes down to the evaluation when that we're comfortable that corporate governance is working and we as the major shareholders can use our power as the major shareholder to actually take decisions and move the company forward as a result of the percentage ownership we have.</p>
          <p>So it is a continuous evaluation on when that will happen. I do think that the concern that we have in taking that conclusion is that if we do re-consolidate it, and the situation arises as the same as we had in the last three years, then we would have to de-consolidate again. So we're sort of evaluating it on the basis of the long-term performance and how we do it. We don't think it is of dramatic importance to the market due to the fact that we are reporting numbers for Kyivstar on a continuous basis anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Yes, hello. First, a follow-up on an earlier question. It is regarding Pakistan where you managed to bounce back your margins from the low 11% in the third quarter. Do you believe that you are now back on track to deliver on your old guidance of mid-30s in 2010, 2011?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in Bangladesh, you reported an extremely solid margin at 57%. This was obviously helped by lower subscriber intake. This is a level that we haven't seen since the fourth quarter 2006, and in 2008, you've been around 47%. Do you expect lower intake also going forward and should we then expect a margin above 50% for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions into the crystal ball. As for Pakistan, I think, Pakistan is still at a 50, 55% penetration. There are obvious new segments to come in to sort of to promise a margin development in the direction you indicated. Then market environment has to be quite positive. I think there will be rallies for new customer segments in Pakistan. And when they come, we'll compete for that market position. We've reached a 20% market share, and we intend to stay there.</p>
          <p>For Bangladesh, I think to a great extent, you could say the same. The penetration in Bangladesh is lower and is bound to climb, lower than Pakistan, I think is around 20-ish. So there will be growth elements and in periods where the market grows in number of users, the margin will take a hit in those kind of periods. But Grameenphone is fantastically well positioned to handle that with its huge distribution network as well as a high quality type of network and with frequencies in place in Dhaka. I think I mixed that up saying Pakistan in my initial remarks here today, but the frequencies that we got in fourth quarter was for Bangladesh and it helps us a lot to handle the traffic volumes in Dhaka area in particular. So we're positioned to handle that. So that indicates that the margin in those kind of periods will fluctuate.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, next, David George, Credit Suisse, go ahead please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Could I just come back to the revenue guidance for '09? I wonder if you can provide any more details there. If I look at the trends in Q4, it does appear organic revenues are clearly getting better in Norway, may well be positive overall, certainly on mobile for '09. Denmark's improving as well. And obviously, you're guiding to kind of slow down in growth which would point to significant slowdowns in the other assets. You touched on that to some degree, but I wondered is there anything in Q1 trading to date in some of these markets which show any further impacts from the macro slowdown on the revenue growth in those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And it will be sort of to go a little bit over the same question again. But we could also all hope for that there are unexpected growth elements to happen in these markets, but there is nothing special on the regulation side, on competitive intensity that has changed basically. So this is a reflection on what &#x2013; on the uncertainty that we do expect coming from the economic times that we're heading into.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so could you comment I mean just on what you might expect in some of the Nordic markets, whether we could expect to see certainly Norway positive organic revenue growth in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, then you're diving into sort of said elements of these top-down guiding, and I'm not ready to entertain that kind of thinking right now, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Next is Soomit Datta, New Street Research. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, it's Soomit here at New Street, just one question at this stage, please. There was quite a lot of talk about food price inflation last year and negatively impacting a number of the major market mobile businesses, perhaps including your own. Is it sort of a bit too far to say some of the Asian businesses in Q4 have benefited from the fact that you've actually seen some moderation in food price inflation? And in 2009 in a way, we can, I think at this point expect to see perhaps some deflation in food prices. Would that make you a little bit more optimistic in markets such as Pakistan and Bangladesh for 2009? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are sort of two elements that plays into that, and that is not only food but energy as well. They are what sort of triggered this off. Last year was the rise in energy prices, then spilling over into the commodity pricing of food and rice, in particular. I think that specific subject is not as visible on the radar screen as it was last year.</p>
          <p>How it will play out in mobile spend longer-term? Well, of course, people would generally speaking have all other factors equal, a better equation in their private wallet to also allocate to mobile spend. So from that perspective, yes. Then, will the general activity in these markets pick up? Personally, I'm of the opinion that to get the uncertainty away from the table on the new government in Bangladesh, I think that's positive. I think it's positive that the elections went as they did.</p>
          <p>And that there is a government there with aspirations for the country in the years to come is good for the economy. And I think the same can be said for Thailand. How and with what strength this will play out in the local economy is of course related to the world economy and more so for Thailand than for Bangladesh, actually. I'm sorry for being general on your question.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Next, Justine Dimovic, BNP Paribas. Go ahead, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Few questions, if I may. Firstly, I'm sorry to come back on the cash repatriation question. I'd like to know if you can clarify for us or give us an idea of, in 2008, how much of the operating cash flow generated in the several divisions, overall, you were able to repatriate to the mother company as a percentage?</p>
          <p>My second question is about the cost of drawing on the different credit facilities, if you can provide some disclosure there. And finally, I heard that the government in Norway has taken some measures to help the lending in the real economy. Could we expect you to benefit from that when you need to refinance your debt maturing in 2009? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, we're not disclosing our cash flow prognosis or cash flow accounts relative to sort of when and where we repatriate the cash. When it comes to the 100%, it is in cash pools or we actually repatriate all the excess cash on either a daily, weekly, monthly basis.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the subsidiaries like Kyivstar, the partly owned subsidiaries, as I said, none has been repatriated from Bangladesh during 2008, none from Pakistan. Dividend has been declared in DTAC and had been received, and DiGi has also declared payment to their shareholders and have been received as well.</p>
          <p>So basically everything is up in the market as such. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but you can call Investor Relations if you want to have that detail. So basically as a generic understanding, I do think that most of the numbers or the cash flow from the operating entities are either in our control or disclosed relative to repatriation. I didn't quite get your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was about usage of available credit lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it was about the cost of drawing on the several credit facilities you said are committed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the cost is &#x2013; I mean it's a standby credit fee that we are paying, which is roundabout everything from 30% to 50% of the margin on the loan, and basically if we draw, we pay the margin premium of the loan, and basically it's market terms for all those commitments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As for the last element of your question, the lending package, the Norwegian government released this weekend a package consisting of two elements, NOK50 billion as a potential capital strengthener for the equity part of banks in Norway and 50 billion to be handled by Folketrygdfondet as a lending package for refinancing needs in the marketplace in general based on market terms.</p>
          <p>The detailed terms around attached to it hasn't been clarified yet, but both of these means are, the way we see it, very efficient means for maintaining the liquidity part of the Norwegian economy toward its corporates. And the lending package is of course a contribution into those companies that has refinancing needs, including that of Telenor, basically, depending on the terms compared to what's available in other sources.</p>

        </plist>

          <p>Maurice Patrick, JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry, just, we've spent a lot of time talking about India and cash flow. On the more sort of boring subject of Norway and the Nordic region, can you just talk about how trends developing in the market if you're seeing pricing pressure continuing, if you're seeing synergy trends impacting or overall competitive intensity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boring, we're not bored here in Norway. Are we? Well, on the other hand, the intensity in the marketplace is still there. But it's been concentrated then to the bigger players, Telenor, TeliaSonera, Tele2. I think the smaller players, which have had more or less an aggressive approach to it from periods of time where funding was more readily at hand, will have some challenges in bringing that business proposition forward. So that competitive landscape is pretty well structured and the regulatory framework around it is also spelled out despite the fact that the asymmetric system has been maintained in Norway at least until 2010. And of course, that is contrary to our advice and what we're used to from other markets.</p>
          <p>In Denmark, consolidation happened on both one and two occasions last year. I think that's to the longer benefit of the Danish market. In Sweden, the four players are there, plus some additional ones of course, but there is no restructuring sort of around the corner, the way we see it. So I don't expect that significant changes in the competitive structure in Sweden. Mobile broadband is considered to become the new driver and we will of course very carefully scrutinize our market decision on this and be part of that game.</p>
