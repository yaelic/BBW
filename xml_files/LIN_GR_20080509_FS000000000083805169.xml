          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Linde AG Q1 Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Just to remind you all, this call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to handover to today's Chairperson and CFO, Georg Denoke. Please begin your meeting, and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, <mark type="inaudible" />. Hello and welcome everybody. Thank you for attending our first quarter results conference call on this Friday afternoon. Around the table with me today are my Board colleagues; Aldo Belloni, as well as Harry Roegner and Thomas Eisenlohr from Communications and Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Let me start with the highlights of the first quarter on page three of the presentation. Despite the economic uncertainties and notably the currency movement, we have seen in our operations a solid start into the year. Excluding the translational effect of currency movements, group sales have increased 7.5% to 2.917 billion euro and group operating profit is up by 11.1% to 602 million euro. The adjusted EPC (sic) [EPS] has risen 20.6% to 1.29 euro. I also want to mention that the ramp up of our synergy program is fully on plan.</p>
          <p>We have seen significant contract wins in the Gases Division from Corus in the first quarter and from Arcelor Mittal in April. And furthermore we have received with the ADNOC contract another major tonnage scheme and significant order intake in Engineering, which will be reflected in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Based on our solid start to the year, we can today fully confirm our short and mid-term outlook.</p>
          <p>Turning to the components of our group sales growth on page four. On the left hand side, you see the reported numbers, but more important are on the right hand, the comparable growth figures for the Gases Division. Excluding the currency effect, the natural gas price impact, and the consolidation effect, the underlying growth of the Gases Division was 7.5%. Note that this underlying growth would be 13.6% if we include all bolt-on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>The comparable sales growth of the joint ventures, which is not included in our top-line growth, was 13%. And as you know, joint ventures are significant part in our business today especially in Asia but mid-term also in the Middle East. Sales growth with the Engineering Division of 8.8% was right within our mid-term range of 8 to 10% growth. We are progressing well here in working through our order backlog and the market environment remains well supported.</p>
          <p>Page five, shows you the divisional contribution to our operating profit. Group profit advanced 5.8% to 602 million euro reflecting a year-on-year margin improvement of 17 basis points. The Gases Division recorded an operating profit of 586 billion euro, up 5.4% on reported basis or 10.7% excluding the currency impact. The Gases Division showed an underlying margin increase of 80 basis points to 25.5% margin.</p>
          <p>The operating profit growth of 6.8% in the Engineering Division reflects the strong project execution of our experienced teams. Despite the tight market, we managed to deliver on our project while running the cautious contingency policy. At 8.7% the margin is therefore once again above 8%, which as a target level is considerably above the market average in this kind of business.</p>
          <p>Looking in more detail into our Gases Division; we start with the sales bridge of the components of our gases growth on page six. The key figure is, as I already mentioned, the comparable growth of 7.5%, which is excluding the currency impact, the natural gas price impact, and the consolidation effect. The currency effect of 5.7% minus reflects that in comparison to last year's first quarter, the euro strengthened not only towards the U.S. dollar, but also towards the British pound and the South African rand. Just to remind you that the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar was 1.50 in this quarter and last year it was 1.31. And this is similar for the British pound and the South African rand.</p>
          <p>The consolidation effect was also net negative for the first quarter at minus 1.1%. This is mainly due to the disposals in the U.S. business, which were still in the consolidation scope in quarter one last year. Even though the consolidation effect is rather small on a net basis, you will see that the impact in the regions Americas and Asia and Eastern Europe is more significant.</p>
          <p>The increase of the natural gas price contributed 1.6% to the top-line growth. As you know, this is a pass thru item. There is no additional contribution to operating profit from this contract feature but rather an implied negative effect within our reported operating margin.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the sales overview of the operating segments on page seven. Comparable growth rates are favorable across all operating segments. Our largest operating segment Western Europe grew 5.6% on a comparable basis with sales rising to 1.030 billion euro. Here, we benefit from our strong industrial gases business in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and Northern Europe. The comparable growth of 8% in this operating segment Americas is driven by strong <mark type="inaudible" /> sales at our major tonnage site in Chile and the U.S.</p>
          <p>New tonnage projects at oil and steel customers in North America additionally contribute to the year-on-year increase. Just to remind you that the sales impact of the U.S. disposals was 139 million euro in the first quarter 2007.</p>
          <p>With the solid performance across all countries, sales in Asia and Eastern Europe increased on a comparable basis by 9.7% to 464 million euro. In Greater China and South and East Asia, the growth is driven by an overall strong customer demand and ramp up of new projects. In Eastern Europe, we benefit from strong demand at our tonnage customers mainly in Romania, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. New projects will further strengthen our leading position in this region.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we benefited from the acquisitions and consolidation. To remind you this was the Malaysian Oxygen, Lien Hwa and Hong Kong acquisition. On a reported basis, the growth in Asia and Eastern Europe was therefore 48.2%. On a comparable basis, growth in South Pacific and Africa was strongest at 10.3% with sales rising to 297 million euro. In this operating segment, we had profited from a strong cylinder business, mainly LPG and burning equipment. Key regions with the operating segments remain Continental and Northern Europe with sales of 767 million euro and the comparable growth of 7.8%, and North America, our second largest region, with sales of 399 million euro and a comparable growth of 7.6%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the development in our joint ventures on page eight, joint ventures are as you know an important strategic cornerstone of our gases business, especially, in developing the growth markets in Asia, but also mid-term in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>On a comparable basis, the proportionate sales which is not consolidated grew 13% to &#x20AC;139 million. The main adjustments here are the currency impact and the consolidation impact resulting from the structural changes in our joint ventures in the last year.</p>
          <p>Our share of net income contributing to the operating profit in these joint ventures advanced from &#x20AC;5 million to &#x20AC;9 million in quarter one of this year on a comparable basis, adjusted for these consolidation impacts.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the operating profit of the Gases Division on page nine. As promised, we showed you the segmental split of the operating profits now on a quarterly basis. Overall, operating profit in the Gases Division grew by 5.4% to &#x20AC;586 million. Adjusted for the unfavorable currency effect, the operational growth rises to 10.7%.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, our largest operating segment, grew 3.7% to &#x20AC;283 million. The positive development in Continental Northern Europe has been adversely impacted by the negative currency impact of sterling from region U.K. and the scheduled maintenance shutdown of the major tonnage scheme.</p>
          <p>In the operating segment Americas, the deterioration in operating profit reflects the weaker U.S. dollar and the prior year's divestiture. If we take all the consolidation effect, growth would be 9.8%. Asia and Eastern Europe is the operating segment with the highest growth. All regions within this segment showed encouraging double-digit growth in their operating profit.</p>
          <p>Key drivers are strong GDP growth within the regions alongside the consolidation of former Asian joint ventures, Lien Hwa and Taiwan and the Malaysian Oxygen business. The operating profit grew 47.2% from &#x20AC;89 million to &#x20AC;131 million. Excluding the impact from the new consolidations, growth was still very strong at 19.3%.</p>
          <p>In South Pacific and Africa, the operating profit grew 3% from &#x20AC;66 million to &#x20AC;68 million. In the appendix, we have documented for you the negative embedded finance lease impact on the operating profit.</p>
          <p>Turning to page ten, you will find the operating margin development of the Gases Division. With an operating margin at 25.5%, the profitability of the Gases Division improved by 80 basis points compared to last year. The operating segment Americas shows the highest growth with the margin increase of 90 basis points from 18.8% to 19.7%. After adjusting for disposals in quarter one 2007, the margin has improved by 220 basis points. The operating margin in South Pacific and Africa is slightly favorable compared to prior year at 22.9%. The reported margin in Asia and Eastern Europe decreased by 20 basis points to 28.2%, however after adjusting for consolidation effect, the margin actually improved by 210 basis points. The margin in Western Europe retreated 20 basis points, but remains on a high level at 27.5%.</p>
          <p>The increase in natural gas prices is negatively impacting the margin in Americas, Western Europe, and Asia and Eastern Europe. The margin in Western Europe was also impacted by the stronger LPG business in quarter one and the already mentioned plant shutdown.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the split by product areas in the Gases Division. For the first time on a consolidated basis, please note that the comparable growth is adjusted for currency, natural gas price and consolidation effect. Taking each area in turn, I start with the cylinder business, our largest product area. Growth was a solid 8%. Greater China, South and East Asia and Africa show the strongest growth in that business, specially increased prices and volumes for helium and LPG are drivers. The largest absolute contribution to the increase in sales comes from Western Europe. Sales in bulk grew 6.2% driven by good volume and prices in Continental and Northern Europe and Greater China.</p>
          <p>We also continue to see strong pricing in Americas. Our tonnage sales increased 7% to &#x20AC;578 million. Again, key contributions to the increase come from good underlying performance in Continental Northern Europe as well as North and South America. New facilities in Europe and the U.S. have augmented this growth.</p>
          <p>Healthcare has shown the highest growth at 9.9%. The rise in sales results from solid performances in North and South America along with strong growth, especially in the U.K. Healthcare business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to page twelve, our Engineering Division posted sales of &#x20AC;542 million. The increase of 8.8% is in line with our indicated growth expectations of 8 to 10% for this business over the next year. But please be aware that the quarterly comparison within Engineering is very difficult because the business is all project based. As noted earlier, the 8.7% margin reflects another strong performance in terms of operational execution by our teams in the field.</p>
          <p>We are continuously working off our order book and order backlog have hence slightly come down to &#x20AC;4.152 billion from 4.39 billion at year-end. Looking at our order intake, you should keep in mind that the year-on-year comparison is difficult and it is sometimes influenced by the timing of the projects.</p>
          <p>Quarter one illustrates the impact that such large orders can have. As last year's order intake of roughly a &#x20AC;1 billion included Ruwais' two ethylene plants ordered by the Borouge joint venture. The low order volume in quarter one is thus reflecting the cut-off at the end of March. We see no signs of weakening in the underlying business. Quite the contrary, demand for ASUs has proven particularly strong this year and we expect further projects to come in this product segment.</p>
          <p>As announced yesterday, we have received an U.S. $800 million order for two air separation units that our Engineering Division will build for our gases joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. With this early intake, we are catching up with the order level of the strong pervious year.</p>
          <p>Let me use the opportunity of having you all on the line to give you some more details on this important project that we announced yesterday. You can see some key figures on page thirteen. We have won a new major tonnage contract to run an "Enhanced Gas Recovery" scheme for ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. This is a landmark tonnage project win which underpins the business synergies between our Engineering and Gases divisions.</p>
          <p>Within our customer joint venture with ADNOC, we will build and run two large air separation units with a total capacity of 13,000 tons per day of nitrogen. The total investment made by the joint venture and hence the order intake for our Engineering Division is around 800 million U.S. dollar. The scheme is set to go on-stream at the end of 2010. This contract marks the second step in our customer joint venture with ADNOC.</p>
          <p>We created this joint venture in December of last year <mark type="inaudible" /> tonnage contract serving ADNOC new acetylene plant in their Ruwais cluster and to get 100% of the liquid product to supply the merchant market in that region. Our customer relationship with ADNOC dates back to the late 90s when the first plant was built for ADNOC.</p>
          <p>Besides leveraging a customer relationship we are also building here on our technology <mark type="inaudible" /> and the expertise in the energy sector. We have been running the world's largest "Enhanced Oil Recovery" scheme for Pemex in the <mark type="inaudible" /> for more than 10 years now. This project serves as a strong reference for their contract win. In the light of the ongoing oil price increase "Enhance Oil &amp; Gas Recovery" is of course one of these technology with a strong market potential within the so called energy mega-trend.</p>
          <p>Looking at this broader context of the energy mega-trends you can see on page fourteen that we have made several interesting signings since the beginning of the year. They all underpin very well our strong technological expertise. The tonnage contract with ADNOC in the "Enhance Oil &amp; Gas Recovery" field but of course then <mark type="inaudible" /> its sheer size. Besides that we have also pushed forward our positioning in the renewable energy field. We have entered a joint venture agreement with a U.S. company Waste Management to build the world's largest plant converting landfill gas into environmentally friendly biogas.</p>
          <p>In the field of bio-ethanol we have concluded an exclusive cooperation this S&#xFC;d-Chemie for the joint development of third generation bio-fuels that will not compete with food products.</p>
          <p>In the photovoltaic market, we have finally signed the contract with Malibu &#x2013; a joint venture between E.ON and Sch&#xFC;co. Under this agreement, we will supply the full range of photovoltaic gases and run a joint product development for this promising market segment.</p>
          <p>Turning back to our quarter one figure, let me take you through our cash flow overview on page fifteen. Please be aware that these figures are not fully comparable due to the significant structural changes from the disposals in quarter one last year. As far as other changes, our increase in operating profit is litigated by a deviation in the change of working capital.</p>
          <p>This is due to timing related issues which we do not expect to occur in the upcoming quarters. One further issue in the working capital was the bigger prepayment in quarter one 2007. This total proceed including in quarter one 2008 are the proceeds for the BOC Edwards pharma business.</p>
          <p>In quarter two, we will book in addition to this the proceeds from the sale of the Cryogas business in Columbia. As a reminder, main disposals in quarter one of last year were part of Linde's former U.S. business and the Asian joint venture. Even the significant lower disposal proceeds, the free cash flow had also gone down from 1.948 billion to 112 million euro.</p>
          <p>Before I finish let me give you on page sixteen, a quick update on where we stand in our integration process. On the synergy side we are progressing on plan with the implementation of the program measures. Regarding our achievement so far we are in line with our target. So I can confirm once more today that we are on track towards our target of 250 million euro bottom-line effect in 2009. We are fully committed and working hard towards this target.</p>
          <p>Next to this however, we are also already putting together the basis for a follow up program. As such we are currently identifying and preparing further initiatives that will offer additional improvement potential for the years beyond 2008 and '09. With our significant deleveraging progress since the closing of the acquisition net debt is now down to 6.251 billion euro. We have successfully refinanced this major transaction. Significantly lower interest payments in quarter one are the result of the lower debt level.</p>
          <p>This is the major effect in the reduction of the financial results that have improved by 31% to minus 79 million euro. With the current net debt level we expect to remain in our net debt EBITDA target range of two to three.</p>
          <p>And finally as you know we received very late in the integration process the requirement from the Colombian antitrust authority to sell BOC's former Colombian company Cryogas. This business was sold last week to Indura for an enterprise value of 90 million euro.</p>
          <p>As a conclusion to our quarter one developments, you can see that we are well on track towards our short and mid-term financial targets, despite the somewhat more uncertain economic environment. We confirmed for this year our guidance of an increase in sales and over proportionate growth in operating profit; we also reiterate our mid-term target of above 3 billion euro operating profit in 2010 within return on capital employed of at least 13%.</p>
          <p>For the Gases Division, we are confident to increase sales above market growth. We are also committed to an overproportionate increase of the Gases operating profit. This is well supported by our synergy program. With regards to investments in the gases business, we expect to see an average CapEx sales ratio of 13% over the years. But let me remind you that depending on opportunities, we definitely have the financial strength to take them and are ready and happy to be invested above the 13% mark.</p>
          <p>The market environment for the Engineering Division remains well supported. We see no sign of slowdown. Based on the step change in sales that we have seen last year and the scheduled progress processing of our order backlog, we expect this business to grow at 8 to 10% range going forward.</p>
          <p>And we are able to benefit from Linde's business synergies between our Engineering and Gases divisions. On top, we are extremely well positioned to exploit existing opportunities for growth in emerging markets. With the superior set up of our company, we are confident about our future and therefore strongly believe that we will deliver on our short and mid-term targets. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>
          <p>I will hand over to the operator now and we are very happy to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Denoke. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Rhian Tucker. Please announce the company name and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. It's Rhian Tucker from Credit Suisse. Three questions; first of all on currency effect; can you please take us through what you think of your 6000 partner share with some Dollar related currencies what was from Rand related issues and what Sterling? And if possible, can you give us any sensitivities you've calculated to those three currencies?</p>
          <p>And secondly, looking at cylinders, the 8% growth looks pretty impressive in what is a slightly slower demand environment. How do you see the outlook for pricing and for volumes in cylinders in the three regions or in the four regions for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And then my third question &#x2013; I'm sorry, can you take us through again what caused the strong movement in working capital in Q1? I didn't quite catch the reasons behind that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you Rhian for your questions. What was the first question, this was the deadline <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Working capital, okay. Well, coming through the currency effect of course as you know best this is in translational effect &#x2013; I think that is very important to understand, and if we would do the exercise today, end of April, say it that way, and then with today's currency it would look a little bit less dramatic. On the asset base for example, the dollar and the pound exchange rate of today would give up additional 100 million of euro value and the asset base in the balance sheet as an example. So when we look into the future of course, we expect that the currency impact that if we assume that the dollar not further deteriorates, but under this assumption of Dollar and Pound as it is today in a way, we assume that the currency effect is over the year a little bit smaller because when you look into 2007, you see that the dollar and the pound mainly weakening in their fourth and third quarter of their distance becomes a little bit shorter between &#x2013; between the quarters of the year. So, probably the first quarter was the most significant impact here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I assume from that that what you said that the Dollar is the most important exchange rate, not the Rand or the Sterling, or is it equally split between the Dollar and the Sterling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think it is more equally split; I mean UK is an important business for us. As you know, it's more than &#x2013; from a total perspective, more than &#x20AC;1 billion in sales, so it is significant too, and of course the US business is a little bit bigger but definitely the most important currencies for us are Dollar, Pound, Australia Dollar and South African Rand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the Cylinder business I think you are right; the 8% is continuing strong growth as we always presented at the end of last year, the above 8% number. At that point of time we still see a strong development in all the regions; of course the third quarter in South Africa and in South Pacific was driven by additional demand of LPG, and I think here that was positive. Also, in Germany, the winter in Western Europe was a little bit stronger than last year, so we also participated here from some additional LPG business on a sales perspective but we are rather confident of the development in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And pricing of cylinders? How has that been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, pricing is in regional perspective, but overall as you know, the demand situation at that point of time in Western Europe, also in Eastern Europe for example is a very tight one, and we are developing that market from that perspective. So, also pricing looks strong when we look into the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Andrew Stott. Please announce your company name and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Merrill Lynch, London. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick things; on the prepayments, I just wonder if you could be more specific on the year-on-year effect and where that actually comes in the line item in the cash flow.</p>
          <p>Second question was depreciation; I just wonder why it's still trending down sequentially, given your CapEx depreciation ratio.</p>
          <p>And finally, pretty impressive performance on the cost ratio; the marketing to sales the year-on-year I think is about 90 basis points down. Is there anything in particular in the Q1 number or you're happy with that sort of cost performance as a run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for these questions. On the prepayments of course, I think in any given comparison is normally much easier because of the project-related business in engineering. And as you know, when we look now at the end of April, of course, we have included our end of May; we would include then the big contract with <mark type="inaudible" /> and then it is again on a very similar level already after this fourth quarter &#x2013; this assumption often 3 billion &#x2013; around 3 billion order intake, we see that this is very similar to the previous years. Of course, it is also different from the content of the projects, but it looks very positive and of course, the negative impact in the first quarter which you see in the working capital section of the cash flow statement &#x2013; this was one of your other question &#x2013; is impacted in the first quarter and looked different then already in the second quarter. So, that will be overcompensated in quarter two.</p>

          <p>The pre-payments come in, in the working capital sectors; so when you go to page of the presentation where you have the working capital and cash flow statement which is on page 15, you see this is the change in working capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So from a CapEx perspective, I think we have, let's say a weak start in the year from an overall perspective, so we of course keep our guidance at an average of 13% and we see the other quarters more busy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the cost ratio is here of course in positive development in the first quarter. I would not over-stress that at that point of time, but definitely it is an additional part out of our synergy program, which you will see in the combination of some areas where we have a stronger footprint together. So, that is I think &#x2013; and slight visibility, but I would not overestimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when might you be in a position to announce something beyond the 250 million cost savings?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as we've said at the year end, I think we are working through this year delivering and then communicating the new program with new targets. I think that is still the intention, and we are proud to confirm our targets even from a translational impact in currency all what we can deliver here. So overall, I would not see us in the next quarter to communicate an additional target for additional improvement. So, let's deliver first and then let's increase.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Peter Clark. Please announce your company name and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yeah. It's Peter Clark, SocGen [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale], in London, again. A few questions, again. The margin effect particularly in your &#x2013; you mentioned a number of effects weighing on it, including the shutdown. I was just wondering if you're prepared to put a number on the effect of the shutdown. But also, if energy costs are weighing on the margin at the moment and need a bit a catch up in terms of the merchant operations there.</p>
          <p>Going back to Andrew's question on depreciation amortization, the underlying rate in Europe and North America &#x2013; or the Americas &#x2013; seems to have fallen quite significantly. I was just wondering what's behind that.</p>
          <p>The UK business, you had very strong performance in cylinder and on the medical side; don't know about the merchant; obviously, our products were alluding to the fact they saw some weakness there. Just &#x2013; if you could give us a few comments on the UK business, so those are the questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter, for your questions. On the margin effect, I think that the biggest dilution impact really in this quarter is definitely the natural gas price impact overall, and that is also visible in Western Europe. And the other impact was that we have a slightly higher LPG business in this first quarter because of a stronger winter in Western Europe compared to the winter of 2006. These are the main items. The shutdown impact, we don't give a number on that but it has some margin points impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So not really an energy impact in terms of merchant operation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really an impact of energy costs on your merchant operations; not a weighing on the margin effect that you've seen in terms of the higher energy costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think we don't see this and at that point of time, as I said earlier, on pricing perspective, we see good pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the depreciation amortization, I think you have to have in mind that first of all, there has been change in consolidation in some of the segments and the other issue is of course the PPA, the purchase price allocation impact is, when you include that, coming down significantly now year-by-year. I think that is the biggest impact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So excluding that...</p>

          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a change in the consolidation.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So because &#x2013; as you know, we have disposed the PGP business, the cylinder business and this former cylinder business in the U.S. and that has the biggest impact then from that perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So UK was a positive development in that first quarter and I think we'll be seeing &#x2013; especially as I mentioned, also in the healthcare market and the homecare market, a very good development in that arena and there is more pricing than volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I just ask on the UK as well &#x2013; obviously, just it seems like the margin there improved. You obviously saw the forex hit on the sales, down 9% or so, but it looks like the margin improved which surprised me given what's happened with fuel costs and other sort of costs. I know you're doing a lot of work there. I mean is that a trend you'd expect to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think on the gist side, of course, we had some extraordinary impact in the first quarter of 2007, because of the change of control after the acquisition of BOC and I think the quarters are not fully comparable.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Norbert Barth. Please announce your company and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Norbert Barth from WestLB speaking. I have three questions. First of all, what you provided with your new segmental &#x2013; the operating margin in the gas business by region, because we have only this at the moment on a quarterly basis &#x2013; to have the feeling how it looked like in the past on the history to show if there is seasonal difference from quarter-to-quarter first, and if that also &#x2013; the absolute level for example Western Europe is the 27.5%. Is that stable? If you look a little bit on the history and how it should develop a little bit going forward for 2008; the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question also on the gas business, one of the old competitors going back in the business is Messer. So how you deal with this situation? Do you feel something because still it's quite small in regional business but do you fear that there could price pressure from that point of view?</p>
          <p>And the third question concerning the tax rate. You have in this quarter 28%. I know it's quite difficult on a quarterly basis to give &#x2013; there could be lot of implications, but you guided 30%. This should be &#x2013; not too much under 28 or how can we look on the 2008 tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you Norbert for your questions. I think let's start with the tax rate. The 28% is of course a positive development but we keep on our guidance which was 30%. The segmental comparison over the year and the quarter of course you have some seasonal impact. As I was mentioning, for example, when you look into the northern hemisphere, for example, in winter you have in winter if it is a cold winter a stronger LPG business. In the summer, you have the stronger CO2 business for the food and beverages <mark type="inaudible" />. So there are cyclical impacts and then you have the margin impact through the dilution of a positive or negative natural gas price impact. So overall, there are seasonal impacts.</p>
          <p>I think what we have on top is in the gases arena and of course in the gases central functions, we have some impact of the synergy program that we will hope to see the 250 million bottom line 2009 with some impact in the margin improvement on the gases division overall. I think as I said at the year-end I mean we are proud now to present the segmental split with the operating profit and the operating margin. I think you should give us some time to give you here a more longer term guidance because also from our internal perspective, this is in segmentation which is in a way brand new. So I do not want to give you now a guidance where we have also from our internal development not the longest history in place, so from that perspective I would answer that question in this direction.</p>
          <p>Messer, of course, Messer is reentering the German market. You have read the newspapers and you have seen there the expectations of their sales volumes over the next years. I think that is something which had at that point of time no big impact and we have to see the &#x2013; really the next years how this will be developing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />. Please announce the company name and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. <mark type="inaudible" />. Well, I only have a very few questions left, so I'm going to be very quick. The first one if I may is, I was wondering what would be your approach in margin in the gas division? What <mark type="inaudible" /> stated for the natural gas in price &#x2013; natural gas <mark type="inaudible" /> closes.</p>
          <p>Next question will be on the onsite segment. You said that your full year <mark type="inaudible" /> confirms that you were expecting 22 startups of new plants in 2008. Will it be possible to have the number of facilities started in Q1, '08 and maybe an idea when the other plants are supposed to come on stream in 2008? I mean, if it's &#x2013; whether in H1 or in H2 that we can expect the growth duration with this ramp up. Maybe another question on the disposal of Cryogas in Columbia. Could you please give us maybe an idea of what will be the <mark type="inaudible" /> on the cash impact you expect in Q2, '08 out of this 90 million euros enterprise value? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions, <mark type="inaudible" />. Why don't I start with your last question on Cryogas. Cryogas, there will be no visibility in the top line and the operating profit because we already deconsolidated that business. So from that perspective, there will be no additional impact. So from an embedded &#x2013; from a natural gas price impact &#x2013; the natural gas price impact, as you know, were around 30 million top line, so it's in point something impact which is on margin, I would say, 30 basis points or so. So a little bit dilution of course from a margin perspective if we wouldn't have had that impact then the margin improvement would be around 30 basis points better, I would say. So from an onsite development, as you heard, of course, we have 22 projects in the pipeline and we expect a ramp up of the onsite business from an overall perspective in the second half of the year. Not too much in the first half I think but in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay very helpful, thank you. And maybe another one if I may, on the &#x2013; regarding the existing stock of the options regarding the convertible bond, what was the outstanding amount at the time of the repayment, I mean maybe you can give us the impact on debt, equity, outstanding shares; that would be very helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I think the convertible bonds, we have this in the documentation of our quarterly report. At the &#x2013; so the main trigger came after the end of this quarter, of course I think they turned something 3 million in the first quarter and the remaining part was around, I think additional 50 million or so. We have to come back to that point. But it is rather minor, there is no significant outstanding convertible bond impact in April. But of course now it's all gone, I think we have it in the documentation of our report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Our next question comes from Neil Tyler. Please announce your company name and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah hello, it's JPMorgan in London and two questions please. Firstly on growth, you mentioned that your target is to outgrow the markets; can you confirm whether that is by division, by healthcare, tonnage, bulk, cylinder and also therefore reconfirm what you view as a sustainable long-term market growth for each of those businesses and i.e. the threshold that you are going to beat?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, coming back to the deferred revenue, the pre-payments on the engineering business, you seem to be implying you are not expecting your order backlog to decrease in the foreseeable future which I can fully understand, but I wonder if you would be able to give any rule of thumb or guidance as to for instance what impact a 500 million Euro drop in the order book would have on the working capital? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Coming to this engineering business, I think there was a misunderstanding. What I was referring to is that an order intake of around 3 billion in 2008 is what we expect, as it was in 2007 and in 2006. So we keep very high order intake as an assumption here for the business because of the energy-related development in the market segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. Thank you, I understand that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from an order backlog perspective of course you have seen the strongest growth of the engineering business in the last year, where we came from slightly below 2 billion to 3 billion which was an about 40% growth. So, from that perspective I think this is the reason why we see a slightly coming down order backlog but nevertheless with an additional 3 billion on a yearly basis order intake of course, this is not that way that you fall down in the order backlog immediately. I think if it is balancing out, in the end it's all 3 billion, right? So from that prospective I would say that is the impact how I can describe it. From a 500 million order, now theoretically I think this is a rather difficult example for a telephone conference, to be very honest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have seen here this impact in a way with the <mark type="inaudible" /> contract of the last year in the first quarter. It was of course a bigger contract, it was more than 700 million, so from that perspective you'll see quarter for quarter in difference and if this is the normal contract and you have related prepayment in that quarter and that makes then the difference. But from an overall perspective, I think we do not see that drop to be very honest over the year we are rather confident in the development of the engineering business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's understandable. Thank you. And just on the growth for the targets, the growth for the division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we keep with our growth target for the division as one piece. I think it is now difficult to cut it out. Our main view is the operating segment view from a regional perspective and then I think, as we always said we've seen a very strong growth driver in the favorable setup of Linde's market position in the emerging markets, in Eastern Europe, in greater China, South and East Asia and we have also a very strong position in South Africa as you know, and then number two position in South America. From that perspective you can assume that this is a major growth driver and today and yesterday you have seen that also the Middle-East is something which has significant growth impacts.</p>
          <p>Of course we have to separate here when we look into top line if all of the revenue is visible top line or if this is linked to joint venture structures. And as we know, in the Asian market, the joint venture model is a very successful one. We have a market share here based on joint ventures which are significant and then also the Middle-East project with ADNOC now is within a joint venture. So, the top line visibility will be not there but definitely cash flow visibility.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Andrew Benson from Citigroup. I just wondered if you could just clarify the embedded finance leases in terms of the impact as sales and EBITDA and just to explain &#x2013; because it went down in the first quarter I thought it was a lot of tonnage contracts. Why, because you would punish profitability? I'm not sure that's true, but if you could just clarify that situation, how you see it developing over the medium-term. Can you give us an idea of what you think for your interest in minorities is likely to be and where you see net debt developing? And lastly just in terms of the level of if you like long-term the tonnage of business, whether the order interest is on a rising, flat or declining trend now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay let's start with the recent net debt and growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And net debt for this year as we said, I mean, we do not see an &#x2013; strong deleveraging and further deleveraging on the level if you are rather comfortable. And as we said, we are looking for the investment opportunities and we are happy to take the investment opportunities. From that perspective, we rather grow EBITDA operating profits and have our net debt EBITDA ratio coming down slightly through the growth of the EBITDA but not through the further reduction or significant reduction of the net debt. On the full-year impact on the interest level, I think there will be &#x2013; guidance here is that we are looking for around 5.8 to 6% pre-tax interest rates and based on that you can do the calculation that this is a level which is slightly below 400 million.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Below 400. This is only for point risk interest right. You also have the interest impact related to embedded financial leases that you know, but I'm talking now about interest payment related to debt. And...</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We also would like to add on the previous question of &#x2013; particularly I think I was mentioning the convertible bond impact of 50 million, the number is around 100 million, which was outstanding at end of March, that's now all gone in April, so from that perspective, the impact is 100 million; only to correct that.</p>
          <p>On the tonnage business, I think we would talk here on a separate basis with you. As I said, it's a little bit too much for the call. Overall, as we've seen the tonnage business is very much a growth business for us. And you also see that a lot of growth can be in these joint ventures structure. So, that is one item which is important, so we always have to give clear guidance on the cash flow here.</p>
          <p>From a margin perspective, I think of course the tonnage business as you know is not the cylinder business in Eastern Europe. So, from that perspective, margins are more stable on the one hand, but they are not in the same ballpark as in very profitable cylinder business. And mid-term the top line impact is therefore depending on if this is a joint venture impact, is depending &#x2013; difficult to forecast but I see a guidance, when you nail me down here, which is definitely above the 7% which it was in this quarter, so it's clearly above that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Actually, on the embedded finance, you've got expected impact in 2008 minus 137 million, so you're saying that that's the EBITDA elimination?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That was the EBIT and revenue elimination out of contracts which we do have already and which are treated under embedded finance list. Then you do correction for the top line and operating profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just for sales, so you're eliminating 137 million of sales?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. UBS in London. I have got a few questions I'm afraid, as well. First of all, don't shoot me on a Friday afternoon, but the Gas's EBITDA from the fourth quarter into the first quarter was slight. Now I appreciate product mix and translational currency impact and shutdown, but the corporate cost was up as well, so I'm just wondering, trying to identify what you see savings in absolute terms? Was there &#x2013; is there any guidance you can give how much incremental savings you had in the first quarter? And why the corporate costs are trending up and not down, given that some of the savings should be seen there. Are there consultants still hanging around or what is &#x2013; what is still sticking in terms of costs there? That is the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question, all the fuss about the prepayments &#x2013; I mean you gave an earlier guidance that, on a typical order, you get 10 to 15% of the amount as a signing fee. Isn't that what we should calculate on the order backlog or order intake, so as to get a feel, for example, for the $800 million contract that you just won yesterday, does that mean you get in around about an 18 million signing fee, which goes through the trade payables, or is that too rough an idea?</p>
          <p>The third question is what do you expect in terms of the consolidation effect, so the net of disposal and acquisitions for the second quarter, please? And then finally, maybe a bit of a question to a region you do not often talk about. I am just going through your annual report for BOC India and it continues to perform very poorly, I think there are operational issues. BOC has been there for decades, and yet Praxair, just entering the market 15 years ago, is bypassing you very quickly. I'm just wondering what Linde can do to run the BOC India business and what outlook do you have for this business? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh thank you, Thomas for all of these questions on this Friday afternoon. I think I will start with the most easiest one, which is the prepayment on the engineering contract. I think this is the right assumption, still the right assumption and so the 10 to 15% ratio of contract volume for prepayment is an okay figure, which you can work with. On the corporate side, I would say that is really here, when you do the comparison, this is related to one-time issues only and that is no significant impact out of the &#x2013; out of any underlying assumption you should make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just interrupt and ask you for a guidance run rate for the corporate cost, and for this year, and also once the integration is complete, what you think is the correct run rate for the corporate costs, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think when you &#x2013; when &#x2013; when you do the &#x2013; this analysis, you should take into consideration that that we now have to discuss in a very detailed manner, if you include, for example, the Gist business here; if you include the consolidation impact between gases and engineering; if you include some other small businesses. Therefore, I am a little bit hesitating now to &#x2013; to give you here a long term number and then would rather have this discussion on a separate basis, but overall, I mean it is around &#x2013; it is the range is a little bit boarder, it is around 120 plus, 20% this is the range I think if you want to have the range, 120 million to 140 million that is something I would go for corporate costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it is moving into a real analyst session now. What was your first question, again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question about &#x2013; no we had the question on the consolidation effects that you expect for the second quarter, and I think that the BOC India question left and that was it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the consolidation impact for the second quarter is related mainly to the impact which is the Malaysian Oxygen business, if you do the quarter-to-quarter comparison, this is something which took place on 1st of June last year, where we got majority. So, from that perspective, that will be the biggest impact, and my guys are working here on a number. So, I'll answer first the BOC India question, I think on BOC India, as you know, we are confident with the development of our Indian business. We have increased our participation in India with a preferential allotment which we started beginning of the year. So, we have now 74.9% participation, so from that perspective you can assume that &#x2013; that we will develop that market. And the other part, of course, is that we see a lot of tonnage project there, of course, with &#x2013; within the sectors of steel and I think, I also can handover to, Aldo Belloni here, who is responsible for that reason to &#x2013; that region to give you a little bit more insight of the development of the market there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thomas. Indeed, the market in India is always a big challenge, the fact of the matter is that the BOC leadership has actually neglected this market for a long time, starving it in terms of capital. It's very important in India to have product available at the right spot and this is &#x2013; was not the case. Now we are rectifying the situation, we're also going after interesting and higher margin niches. We have recently announced that we have won the supply for the bulk and cylinder gases of the portable type business with the <mark type="inaudible" /> buyer. These are of course the contracts of a better quality than the typical zero petrochemical Indian business. So we have to as I say we have to invest in product capacity at the right place, be selective of tonnage business and identify potentially higher margin accounts in India.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for that, can I just ask the existing asset ratio are they now running smoothly or still operational issues from there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have fixed &#x2013; you remember last year in January 2007 we had the big shutdown at the Jamshedpur facility that is fixed and now all plants are running at full capacity.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So from us, coming back to the consolidation impact of the second quarter, I think it will be around &#x2013; mainly around 50 million or so. 50 million plus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>Next question comes from Jean. Please announce the company and your location and go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, this is Jean <mark type="inaudible" /> Lehman Brothers. A couple of questions. Firstly on cash flow, Mr. Denoke I think you said in your presentation that the reason for poor working capital was firstly because of lower advance payments, I think we understand that. And the second reason was a timing issue on working capital. I wonder if you can quantify this and tell us how much we should therefore expect getting into Q2. Second question on cash flow, I mean last year was a kind of difficult year because of all the delays on payments of capital gain taxes and there was a lot of other items in your cash flow. Can you pass through any other item that we should take into account for the next three quarters please? And then getting into the business, coming back on the margin issue. Indeed the margin is strongly up year-on-year, slightly down versus Q4. Can you just come back on seasonality, I mean if we look at Linde Gas alone, Q4 was always much stronger and also when you look at BOC, INST and PDS, we also have some kind of seasonality. Is that still true that we should look at your business, gas business higher margins in Q4, I think that's related to some excellent revenues. And then the last question is to come back on Abu Dhabi contract. I just would like to understand a little bit what is the next step strategically after that significant investment you will do. Can you get into the merchant liquid business in Abu Dhabi or that will be a separate agreement? Can you extend the business outside Abu Dhabi? is there any other contracts for natural gas recovery in the region that you are currently negotiating? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Jean for your question. Why don't we start to see Abu Dhabi question and then I again hand over to Aldo Belloni here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Abu Dhabi business is composed by at least two pieces. First of all we have the base business with the founding of the company Elixier. This is in the middle, it's embedded in the petrochemicals site of Ruwais where we are currently building a merchant plant. We announced this late last year and this of course, is a source of product available for the entire Emirates and also for the neighboring countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second piece of Elixier now is this major contract for the injection of high pressure nitrogen in the <mark type="inaudible" />. This is also extendable, just to give you the order of magnitude at the moment, ADNOC is pumping 2.2 million cubic liters hour of natural gas of methane into this reservoir. Now we are substituting only 670,000 <mark type="inaudible" /> per hour of this 2.2 million. And so, there will be a for sure a second and maybe a third phase for this project. Over that, furthermore of course, there is also the oil fields, I mean, the lifetime of this oil and gas reservoir also in the gulf has to be extended and now we have made the first step for nitrogen injection, and I'm sure there will be future opportunity also elsewhere. But I think, the <mark type="inaudible" /> project is very, very real one in terms of extendibility, in terms of capacity. So, we start with two plans, I can vision that at the end of the day we will have 4 or 5 plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And there are no further negotiations at the moment in the region out of contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you that now. No comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on the &#x2013; on the margin development, I think, I have given in a way this answer in one of the previous questions when people were asking to split this according to the product areas. Overall we see an positive market development also in the first quarter. If you exclude especially the &#x2013; especially the natural gas price impact then you see immediately even an positive development when you compare fourth quarter with the first quarter or from that perspective as there's a development which is not visible in this point from an development on the cost side. From that perspective it is going in the right direction. And we are really confident here to further improve the margin in the gas business. I think when you do the comparison with the Linde Legacy and the BOC I think we allocate our gas functions into the regions of course, so those numbers are not really fully comparable. On the cash flow development I think you are asking here for too much now to discuss the consolidation impact of the first quarter of 2007. I think we have given this information to the market in the last year on a <mark type="inaudible" /> basis I think the first quarter impact on the disposal taxes side...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Excuse me to interrupt. I think there is misunderstanding &#x2013; the question was particularly you raise upon on the timing issue on working capital in Q1 '08. And I was wondering if you could quantify that? And the second question is was not to go back in '07. It was more about, is there any other items we should expect for the rest of the year 2008. I am not looking at '07.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that's fine then. I think the timing issue here is something which is around, I would say, plus 30, is the timing issue plus 30 million I would think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From an <mark type="inaudible" /> and so from an perspective <mark type="inaudible" /> on disposal taxes, it's rather minus which will come in this year so from that perspective I would say you they are no extraordinary things which are coming in the next quarters in the cash flow statement to taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, can I just follow up with one clarification on your answer on seasonality if I understand correctly your answer, the seasonality that we have seen historically on Linde is no more valid and therefore we should not expect everything being equal a step up of margins in Q4 for the next years again literally everything being equal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No I think it is when you do this comparison on the seasonality, I think it's important that we have expanded our &#x2013; when you see seasonality it's related to for example winter and summer. There are some seasonality and now with our expansion in the Southern Hemisphere through the BOC acquisitions, with Africa and South Pacific, so there are some <mark type="inaudible" /> in that seasonality that is my point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. I understand, so it's a smaller seasonality than we've seen because of different expansions, and if I can &#x2013; just a last question you were talking about the strong LPG. Can you just quantify the price increase impact of LPG, I assume it has been very strong even the evolution of the oil price and how big is that business now for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, this business is different from region to region. So, when we look into our operating segment in South Pacific, if you do have the biggest LPG business but that is not visible because it's in a joint venture structure. So from that perspective that is <mark type="inaudible" /> business and the second business LPG business is in South Africa and then we have all over the place some small LPG business and from pricing perspective, pricing is up plus 10%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For that business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean the size of the business is in the joint venture, you don't see it so if I include joint ventures, right, the size of the business is around 400 million I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah thank you. It's Morgan Stanley in London. Can I ask three questions please? I think you mentioned additional synergies beyond current targets, can you just talk about what you are looking at and what your main targets are for the cost cutting? And do you have a timescale for the calculation of that number? And then secondly looking at page 21, can you talk about the size and the timescale of the opportunity for the energy project, we're particularly interested in comp measure. What do you think about the size of that market? And then thirdly in terms of engineering, can you just talk about in terms of timescales If I am to order <mark type="inaudible" /> today for world scale projects, the time lag compared to 12 months or 24 months ago in time as opposed to in order intake.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, I start with the &#x2013; with let's say synergy question and the question related to the timing when we are ready to communicate additional synergies. I think it is then not about synergies of course; it is about improvement potential for our existing business and as you know, when we look into this first impact of the BOC and Linde integration, we are looking to overhead structures, to management structures, headquarters and these kinds of stuffs, which are coming rather sooner than later. And then you look into a piece which has a timing impact when you bundle for example, procurement and when you do standardization to bundle these procurement volumes. And then you have standardization first and then you're prepared to bundle volumes from an procurement perspective. These are things which will come. Additional things are also in area like IT for example, where we are running different IT systems and when you do here standardization across the regions, across countries, you have a different &#x2013; additional synergy potential. I think, our attitude which we want to implement is an continuous improvement attitude which we take always with our leading culture from a Linde legacy perspective. I think, when we bring this into the business, and see that we want to bring it down to all levels of the organization then we talk really about an interesting potential. But, it is too early to communicate as I said, we are here in the process of doing and bottom-up exercise and I think earliest is after delivering the 250 million that we are increasing number. I think let's deliver first and then let's communicate an increased target. Overall as you know, we were running in continuous improvement processes in all parts of the organization to give you here an historical number, in Linde legacy which was less than half of our business, now we were running on an 150 million cost reduction basis on an yearly efficiency rates. So compared perspective &#x2013; I think it is what we are thinking about, and we now we would like to hand over to Aldo Belloni.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well, as you know, this industry is at the moment at its inception; however, Linde extremely engaged in many, many different projects and fields. As we speak we have already piloting a carbon dioxide injection in the region of the Eastern Germany. This project will be retrofitted very soon, actually in June. With the carbon sequestration step from a oxy fuel coal based power plant owned and operated by <mark type="inaudible" />. This is a very important demonstration project for all of us. We are also been selected for the &#x2013; in the UK for a project by RWE again for the same purpose of sequestering CO2 and &#x2013; from a coal based power plant. We are developing together with RWE with BASF a new solvent for the absorption of carbon dioxide, this is very important because it will be a first combustion process; that means we can apply this technology to existing power plant. So, huge market.</p>
          <p>We are since more than three years sequestering CO2 from a Shell refinery and piping it into greenhouses in Holland, we've more than 500 customers in Holland, which are served with CO2 via pipeline, which we are feeding with a <mark type="inaudible" /> stream from a one of the largest refinery of Shell. And we are also negotiating at the moment I cannot disclose the name of the customer in this side, but we are negotiating a real sequestration of CO2 from a refinery, which will be fed into a depleted natural gas field. So, we are working on many, many sides and I think we are very well positioned once this industry will really pick up and this of course with these subjects also to some legislation in the different countries, which will be applied to this topic.</p>

          <p>I think it's too early to have any sort of thought about potential... <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only significant sales is from this greenhouses project, but the rest is still to come. Now, the second question was the time lag, which now applies to the delivery on a turnkey basis of an <mark type="inaudible" /> plant as opposed to say a couple of years ago, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, well. Everybody knows that the industry is resources stretched, not only the gas companies or the engineering companies but also they are and primarily they are vendors. So there are bottlenecks for the supply of rotating equipment. Bottlenecks for the variability of manpower for construction, so if we wouldn't do anything against that the time delay could be anything between two and four months. But, what we are doing at the moment is to in order to counterbalance this delay is to push projects more and more into the repeat type of projects the standardization or just carbon copy plants.</p>
          <p>And for instance, these Abu Dhabi plants which now we have to build, they are exactly identical to the five plans which we have built in Mexico. So, we can skip the basic engineering and the detail engineering time and go directly into procurement, publication and construction. So it is true, there is a constraint on resources which would cause a significant time delay as opposed to the past but I think there are let's say methods to counterbalance that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Cazenove in London. Just a very quick question getting back to the gases division outlook comments, where you say the you would like or are hoping to grow faster than the market. And then you say you believe the market growth some 7% in 2008. I mean I'm not being pedantic but could you possibly give me the basis for that certain spend calculation &#x2013; is that a sort of precise volume price figure or have you essentially just &#x2013; your competitors and come up with average growth rate of around 7 which strikes me as it wouldn't be that difficult to beat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I think what we can give to you is what we presented since a while in the market that this just a historical view as the market was growing in an overall positive economical environment in the last five years now by an average of 7% and that was the basis for the outlook as we compared the historical development of the last recent history of 45 years and in a positive economic environment was 7% and that was the basis also for the future. Of course, the growth can be different and I think there is something which we can't see now and this is all the analysis you find in the market but <mark type="inaudible" /> which we have seen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's very helpful. And just very quickly on your comments on the general economic environment, page 2 of the original press release you talked about only time will tell to what extend the newly industrialized countries in particular will be able to offset the expected slowdown in the global economy. I mean, this is obviously a fairly obvious statement but are you essentially referring to Europe in your operations there and sort of making a point that they are largely untested in the event of an economic downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think of course it is difficult here to discuss all the impacts of the financial crises. I think if there is a de-coupling, say in that way, then we do have definitely <mark type="inaudible" /> potential because we have favorable market positions in these emerging market. I think that is the point. If there is no de-coupling taking place then of course it's really not the case but definitely our much, much more favorable set up in these emerging markets including Eastern Europe is, or can be, here an advantage.</p>
