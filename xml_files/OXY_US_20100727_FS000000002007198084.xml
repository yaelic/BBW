          <p>Good morning. My name is Christy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Occidental Petroleum Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you. Mr. Stavros, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Christy, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Occidental Petroleum's Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us on the call this morning from Los Angeles are Dr. Ray Irani, Oxy's Chairman and CEO; Steve Chazen, our President and CFO; Bill Albrecht, President of Occidental's U.S. Oil and Gas Operations; and Sandy Lowe, President of our Oil and Gas Business.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter earnings press release, investor relations supplemental schedules and the conference call presentation slides, which refer to Steve Chazen's commentary, can be downloaded off of our website at www.oxy.com.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to turn the call over to Steve Chazen, who will review our second quarter and first half 2010 financial operating results. Steve, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chris. Net income was $1.1 billion or $1.31 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 682 million or $0.84 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Here's a segment breakdown for the second quarter. Oil and Gas second quarter 2010 segment earnings were 1.9 billion compared to 1.1 billion for the second quarter of 2009. Improvement in 2010 was driven mostly by higher commodity prices with additional contributions from higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Realized crude oil prices increased 36% in 2010 and domestic natural gas prices improved 46% for the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these gains were higher DD&amp;A rates and higher operating expenses partly resulting from fully expensing CO2 costs in 2010.</p>
          <p>Worldwide Oil and Gas production for the second quarter of 2010 was 743,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 3.5% compared to 717,000 BOE a day in the second quarter of last year. Second quarter of 2010 production was lower than our guidance due primarily to shortfalls in California and adjustments resulting from the mechanics of production sharing contracts in the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Our production in California continues to be affected by the gas plants and related infrastructures inability to process all the gas that could be produced. Also, this affects the liquids that are associated with this production.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year production was negatively impacted by 29,000 BOE a day in the Middle East, North Africa, Long Beach and Colombia, as a result of higher oil prices affecting our production sharing and similar contracts. Second quarter 2010 production includes volumes in Bahrain of 3,000 barrels of oil, 161 million cubic feet of gas and 16,000 BOE a day higher volumes in the Mukhaizna field of Oman. Our domestic operations added 11,000 BOE.</p>
          <p>Volume gains in the Kern County Discovery area were moderated by production declines in Elk Hills, which was caused by gas gathering and processing issues. Exploration expense was $73 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Oil and Gas cash production costs excluding production and property taxes were 9.90 a barrel for the first 6 months of 2010. Second quarter 2010 per barrel production costs were slightly lower than this figure. Last year's 12-month costs were $9.37 per barrel. The increase reflects $0.30 a barrel higher CO2 costs due to our decision to expense 100% of injected CO2 beginning in 2010 and somewhat higher field support operations and maintenance costs.</p>
          <p>Taxes other than income were $1.80 a barrel for the first 6 months of 2010 compared to $1.60 per barrel for all of 2009. These costs are sensitive to product prices and reflect the higher effect of the higher crude and gas prices this year.</p>
          <p>Chemical segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were $108 million. Second quarter results reflect improvement from the first quarter in 2010 in margins and volumes across most product lines. Midstream segment earnings for the second quarter of 2010 were 13 million compared to 63 million last year. The decrease in earnings was mainly due to a pre-tax $104 million, $0.07 per share after taxes loss at Phibro, the bulk of which results were making &#x2013; for marking its quarter-end open positions to market. This was partially offset by higher margins in the marketing gas and processing pipeline business. The worldwide effective tax rate was 43% for the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Now let us turn briefly to our first 6 months results. The net income was 2.1 billion or $2.61 per diluted share for the first 6 months of 2010 compared to 1.1 billion or $1.29 per diluted share for the first 6 months of 2009. Capital spending for the second quarter of 2010 was about $865 million and 1.7 billion for the first 6 months. The year-to-date capital expenditures were, segment by segment were 81% in Oil and Gas, 13% in Midstream and the rest in Chemicals. Our total year capital expenditures is estimated to be about $4.5 billion. The capital spending rate will increase in the second half of the year largely from Iraq, Bahrain and California.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations for the first 6 months of 2010 was $4.3 billion. We used 1.7 billion of the company's cash flow to fund capital expenditures, $460 million on acquisitions and $300 million on foreign contracts. These investing cash flow uses amounted to $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We also used $540 million to pay dividends and $300 million to retire debt. These and other net cash flows increased our $1.2 billion cash balance at the end of last year by 1.1 billion to $2.3 billion at June 30. The first 6 months free cash flow after capital spending and dividends, but before acquisition activity and debt retirements, was about $2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The weighted average basic shares outstanding for the 6 months of 2010 were 812.3 million and the weighted average diluted shares outstanding was 813.7 million. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio was 8% at the end of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead to the current quarter, we expect Oil and Gas production and sales volumes to be in the range of 750 to 760 BOE a day and about current oil prices. Volume increases in the third quarter are expected to come from California, Oman's Mukhaizna field, and Dolphin. With regard to prices, at current market prices a dollar per barrel change in oil prices impacts Oil and Gas quarterly earnings before income taxes by about $37 million. The average second quarter WTI oil price was $78.03 per barrel.</p>
          <p>A swing of $0.50 per million Btus in domestic gas prices has a $30 million impact on quarterly earnings before income taxes. The current NYMEX gas price is around $4 an MCF, $4.80 an MCF. Additionally, we expect exploration expense to be about $90 million for seismic and drilling for our exploration programs.</p>
          <p>For the Chemical segment, modest volume and margin improvement is expected over second levels for chlor-alkali and vinyl products. The Chemical segment is expected to provide earnings for the third quarter of about $125 million. While the domestic market continues to be lackluster, export volumes are up about 13% compared to 2009. Chlorine exports are averaging about 42% of total production.</p>
          <p>We have successfully renegotiated and extended our hydrocarbon concessions in Santa Cruz province of Argentina, increasing our Oil and Gas reserves from $129 million barrels to 202 million barrels. The current quarter DD&amp;A expense reflects the resulting decrease in the DD&amp;A rate. We have recently negotiated a number of asset acquisitions in the Oil and Gas business that in aggregate would be about $1.5 billion. We expect these acquisitions are mainly from private individuals largely in the gassier parts of the Permian Basin where there have been several much more expensive deals recently announced.</p>
          <p>When the acquisitions are concluded, they will add to production mostly in the Midcontinent business unit, which include these parts of the Permian Basin. Virtually all the improvement in the production rate will be in subsequent years. We expect our combined worldwide tax rate in the third quarter to be about 42%. Our second quarter U.S. and foreign tax rates are included in our supplemental schedules.</p>
          <p>During the first half of the year we drilled 6 conventional exploration extension wells in California. Of these, five were outside the Kern County Discovery area. Two of these new areas are currently being tested. In the second half of the year we are planning to drill two conventional exploration wells in the Kern County Discovery area and one exploration outside this area.</p>
          <p>We also drilled seven unconventional exploration wells in the first half of the year of which two were successful and two are being tested. We plan to drill 15 additional unconventional exploration wells in the second half. In addition, we have drilled 10 conventional exploitation wells in the Kern County Discovery area in the first half of the year and plan to drill 23 more in the second half. We have also drilled 10 unconventional exploitation wells in California in the first half, with 25 more expected to be drilled in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The skid mounted gas processing plant came online at the end of the second quarter. The existing main processing plant and related infrastructure continue to have operating issues, which are constraining Elk Hills production. We are in the process of upgrading the infrastructure to alleviate these issues until the new gas plant comes online. We believe these upgrades will be in place by the end of the third quarter. Construction of the new gas plant has started and it is expected to come online in early 2012.</p>
          <p>Copies of the press release announcing our earnings and the supplemental schedules are available on our website at www.oxy.com or through the SEC's Edgar system.</p>
          <p>We're now ready to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Doug Leggate of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Steve. Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to try a couple, Steve. I don't want to hog the line here. But Phibro appears to have been really accounting for the bulk of at least amiss compared to what the Street was expecting. For a company which is generally quite conservative and having that kind of volatility in your earnings, can you speak to what is the danger of us overreacting to this versus what is your intentions in terms of perhaps trying to manage that risk a little tighter? And I have a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we've reduced the amount of their exposure and reduced the bar, if you will, in hopes of reducing the volatility. Some of it was &#x2013; he buys long-term contracts, and some of it's simply just mark-to-market. But some of it was realized to &#x2013; you can't say that his trading results in the quarter were anything but lousy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate that. The other one I have is it really relates to acquisitions. You know, you have talked about $1.5 billion. Just to be clear, I assume that means there's no current production with these assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I didn't say that. No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is the production associated with those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't said. We haven't said because we haven't signed &#x2013; completed the deals, but there's some current production. It's a fairly &#x2013; compared to the whole business, not a sizable amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But certainly in the Permian, a fair size amount.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I guess what I was driving at here was we were starting to hear about Occidental perhaps getting involved in structured acquisitions over time in places like the Marcellus and perhaps the Montney Shales. Could you maybe offer us some color as to what your thought process is there and likely scale and maybe timing of us seeing something &#x2013; you getting involved in those areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have a modest position in the Marcellus, which we've had for a while. And compared to the size of the enterprise, fairly small. You know, and it's out of the way some. And we're basically on the edges of the play, and we'll just see how it evolves over time. But compared to the size of the enterprise, fairly small, a fairly small total, I would expect. We'll see how the drilling progresses over the next year or so there to see what we want to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, forgive me, I'm going to risk one very last quick one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx was a bit light. I'm just curious as to how that plays into volumes as it relates to cost recovery, because I'm wondering if that's one of the reasons your guidance was a little &#x2013; a little light?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, some of the adjustments in the production sharing contracts were the result of not quite spending it quite as quickly and therefore not putting it into cost recovery as quick, and that's at least some of it. The bulk of it was that they really didn't get at &#x2013; we're not talking about foreign &#x2013; didn't get at the drilling in the second quarter at the pace that we had planned and so it's a little more back-end loaded. So because the wells come on pretty quickly. So some of it was related to production sharing contract, capital effects, and some of it was related to domestically not getting the drilling done as quickly as one might have hoped.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's nothing terminal in here that you're concerned about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm always concerned. You know, you shouldn't view that we're not concerned, but I think ultimately it will still work itself out. It's a matter of timing, and I think a little more focus on short-term results are needed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks, Steve. I'll leave it there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from David Heikkinen of Tudor Pickering Holt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve. As I think about your Analyst Day and providing the primary and secondary opportunity in the Permian versus these acquisitions, can you talk about how will you update the number of locations and kind of that inventory, or will you give us some idea of what you think about the inventory of what you're buying given that you haven't closed any of those deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll provide aggregate numbers in the next &#x2013; after the things are closed. We're not going to talk about each acquisition because these are private individuals and these aren't public companies selling or something like that. These are private individuals who just, you know, may not want their neighbors to know they're rich. So I think we'll provide aggregate numbers rather than what each one did. But the mix is, if you look at them in aggregate and compare to some of the announced deals, these are more reasonably priced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the comment of in the gassier parts of the Permian, does that also imply kind of more liquids rich, or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They look like the deals that have been announced recently in the mix of around half gas, around a quarter NGLs, which are related to the gas and around a quarter of oil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's useful. And then shifting over to California exploration and kind of the combination of conventional and unconventional tests, as you think about &#x2013; remember some horizontal drilling plans and some testing of horizontals in the conventional side, can you give us any update on that activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, do you want to do that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, we have two horizontals planned in and around the Kern County Discovery area. Have those planned to be drilled and down before the end of the year; testing some of the tighter parts of that particular structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So those are still towards the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as you think about the five drills outside the discovery area, you kind of broke down the types of prospects that you're drilling at your Analyst Day. Can you talk about that distribution or categorize those five within the buckets that you have described at your Analyst Day of what types of prospects those are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I broke them down between conventional and unconventional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was meaning more specifically kind of getting into the details of how you had the larger concepts down to the smaller concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the concepts always start large. It's just that sometimes they turn out small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Not going to get to high potential versus discovery type?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. These are &#x2013; we're shooting for the high potential ones, but sometimes when you drill them, they turn out to be a lot smaller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the plan is that they're high potential, but how they turn out, we'll see as the year progresses. If we find something sizable, we'll tell you about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just back to the envelope on your acquisitions, a 10% adder to your Permian Basin production in the acquisition sizes, is that a reasonable size plus or minus a couple percentage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you give us two or three years, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But buying production, up front production, is generally the most expensive way to acquire, because it's sort of easy to measure. So we try to buy some production, but we also try to buy drilling potential because the returns are a lot better. If you pay ten times current EBITDA for something, the way some people have, it's very hard to make the numbers work. The returns have to come from the development drilling or whatever you want. So the assets here are a mix of some current production, but a fairly sizable backlog of future drilling, which will add to the numbers.</p>

          <p>Any chance I could ask you for &#x2013; given the volatility in Phibro earnings this quarter, could I ask you for the net book value at quarter end and confirm that it's essentially a long only book?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's essentially a long only book. As far as &#x2013; he didn't short anything. But he had some initially in the beginning of the second quarter, he had some &#x2013; he used some &#x2013; a past basket of stocks and ETF or something like that to track oil prices, and for obvious reasons, the stocks didn't track the oil prices too well for the stocks that were in the ETF, some kind of accident somewhere. And so he sort of backed out of that. But the book is &#x2013; our net investment's somewhere under $200 million at this point.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>He &#x2013; the management there owns a tracking instrument in this, so relative to his net worth, even though his net worth is sizable, he's failing the pain disproportionately.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. Well, thanks for giving some order of magnitude on the net exposure then going forward. In California, at the risk of sort of splitting hairs quarter to quarter when you're in the midst of sorting out some kinks on Midstream and adding capacity, any guidance on the degree of uplift in California production in 3Q versus 2Q?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're expecting to go up from the third to the second. We expect -some of the kinks are already sort of worked out, and as we go into this month. But I'm loathe to predict an exact number because the old gas plant, it'll work real good for a couple hours and then it won't work so good. And we've had a lot of problem getting it to work the way we would like it to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So maybe excusing the unexpected hiccups in the old plant, the new skid mounted plant you expect to ramp up to full capacity fairly quickly or has it already?</p>

          <p>Hey, Steve. Just a follow-up on some of the language on the conventional California exploration. Of the I guess five wells drilled outside of the Kern County Discovery which two are testing, just to be clear, those are &#x2013; I realize they're out of the Kern County Discovery area, but are they completely sort of different objectives and targets?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, did you break out &#x2013; forgive me if I missed this, but you mentioned that 2Q production was lower than guidance. Did you split how much was California and how much was PSCs in the Middle East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually didn't because &#x2013; I probably &#x2013; I started &#x2013; when I estimated the guidance, I started with a different number than I gave you. I started with essentially a higher number. So I can't really tell you how much was this and how much was that. I think for the PSC effects, we lost 8,000 to 10,000 a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's the Middle East in PSCs, not the California ones obviously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The California ones are pretty small. These are really not caused by the price as much as just a contract recalculation of our cost pools.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Okay. And, again, I'm not sure if you mentioned in response to an earlier question, but have the infrastructure issues had a knock-on impact on the activity levels which obviously you are ramping up quite aggressively? But I was just wondering if there was effectively a knock-on slowdown that occurs because of the problems you're having with the curves because of the problems you're having with the infrastructure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're planning that the infrastructure is going to be fixed, and therefore, the drilling will move forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So you're just continuing to drill. Does that mean you're going to have essentially stranded production until the infrastructure is fixed? Or how will that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hope is and the belief is that that won't happen. That infrastructure will be fixed, but it's possible you could have shut-in production for short periods of time and that's where we are now effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then just a follow-up on Iraq, there was some word that you might be pursuing further opportunities there in the relatively short term. Is there anything more to say about that beyond what you have already signed? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, with price being relatively stable now in this band of 60 to $80, what's the biggest issue here as far as how you're going to ramp up production growth going forward? Is that the biggest hurdle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Product price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Production. With the price being stable, are you focusing more on production and looking for growth there? Is that going to come more still from organic? Or are you still focused on some areas of acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The company has always followed a balanced approach. You buy stuff when you can buy it at a reasonable price, and when you can't, you can't. So we have plenty of financial flexibility. But most of the growth will come from organically over the next few years. You might pick up something, but it's pretty hard to tell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the difficulty just like, is it valuation, that valuation is still relatively pretty high? I mean, we're seeing some sort of carve out of some assets of some other companies, and does that potentially present an opportunity? Are you really still focused on sort of the smaller private players?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're focused on generating value for the shareholders. If you do a dilutive to value deal, you're going to destroy value. So and somebody else may have different stock with different kinds of value in it. So if you pay 10 times EBITDA for production, you have a high hurdle to generate future growth in order to pay for that kind of acquisition.</p>
          <p>If you pay 50% more than the next guy is willing to pay for some asset, you probably haven't added value to the company unless you have some special insight. So we look for opportunities where there's some reason why we can have a competitive advantage. Some of it we have in the Permian because of costs and such. But the purpose of the exercise, of an acquisition is to make the company better, not worse. So we're not trying to dumb down the company. We're trying to strengthen the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. But with some of the private companies then are you seeing &#x2013; you're seeing better value as far as multiple and as far as what you're willing to pay? You're seeing those with the smaller?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Sometimes it works the other way where the large deals are more &#x2013; are better. And sometimes it works the other way. For example, in the ARCO Permian assets, we bought out of ARCO Permian over the last seven or eight years, two packages out of there, basically buying out virtually all of the true oil out of the packages. So what's left is sort of the residual after it's been picked over. There's nothing wrong with the properties, but the price paid was the full price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my last question really is more on looking at &#x2013; more of a macro question. Looking into 2011, potentially even 2012, again price being stable if it stays in this band, what are some of the biggest challenges for a company like Oxy here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Efficiently spending our capital. It's a matter of &#x2013; remember that while we're pretty oily, there's a fairly sizable gas component, and at whatever it is, $4 and change. We would hope that the price of gas would be less stable and more up.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'm back. With respect to your unconventional drilling, could you characterize what worked and what didn't work? Is this a primary sedimentary feature, is it digenetic, or can you just tell us what you found so far?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally we're looking for natural fractures that are there, and we're trying to define a technique to figure it out before we drill the well. And some of the times it works okay, and sometimes it doesn't. It's a fundamental truth that the natural fracing process is &#x2013; God is cheaper than Halliburton. So our natural fracing, we're looking for the flow from natural fractures, and we're trying to figure out with the amount of acreage we have, we should have plenty opportunities to find that rather than spending a boatload of money to do a high &#x2013; a large scale frac. We'll probably try some large scale fracs because there's a lot of pay here, but the goal in the unconventional is to find areas with natural fracturing so that it's more economical to produce. And you can always come back and try something more exotic later.</p>

          <p>Yes, John, we've got two rigs running, drilling mainly these high rate of return oil opportunities as opposed to the traditional shallow gas that you've generally seen in the past in Hugoton. But we've got a 2 rig program going there, and we expect to continue that throughout the rest of this year.</p>
