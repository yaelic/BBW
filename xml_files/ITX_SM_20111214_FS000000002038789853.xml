          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Inditex Conference Call for the Interim Nine Months 2011 Results. The presentation will be chaired by Mr. Pablo Isla, Inditex Chairman and CEO. This presentation will be followed by a Q&amp;A session, comprising two parts. The first part will be dedicated to the questions received on the telephone and the second part to the questions received through the webcast platform.</p>
          <p>Mr. Isla, please, you have the floor. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to all the participants in this webcast conference call regarding Inditex results for the interim nine months of 2011. I am Pablo Isla and here with me today are Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, our CFO, and Marcos L&#xF3;pez, Capital Markets Director.</p>
          <p>The results for the nine months of 2011 show that Inditex continues its ongoing global multi-concept, multi-channel growth. Sales in local currencies have increased 11%. Our operations have also shown high efficiency and tight operating control over the period.</p>
          <p>Let me also tell you that in terms of expansion, our store opening plan for the year is on track. We are now present in 81 markets, demonstrating the global reach of Inditex's business model. We have also launched online sales in selected new markets in the quarter. We continue to see significant growth opportunities for Inditex globally.</p>
          <p>Let me now hand over to Ignacio Fern&#xE1;ndez, who will provide you with some detail behind the headline numbers and I will join you later for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>In the interim nine months of 2011, <mark type="ph" /> all the lines (1:57) on the profit and loss account show significant growth as a result of our operating performance. Inditex has achieved net sales of &#x20AC;9.7 billion; EBITDA of &#x20AC;2.2 billion and net income of &#x20AC;1.3 billion. In terms of gross profits, this line has increased 9% to &#x20AC;5.8 billion, resulting in a 59.6% gross margin on sales.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses are tightly under control. We have grown 10% <mark type="ph" /> reflecting (2:41) growth in space and include all the start-ups cost for new openings. Operating working capital remains negative as a consequence of the business model. Thes working capital evolution is in line with the trend shown at fiscal year end 2010.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcos L&#xF3;pez, who will elaborate on the performance on the Inditex concepts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of space addition, we are on track, as we have opened 358 net stores in the interim nine months of 2011 to reach a total of 5,402. Continuing with our global expansion, we have opened stores in 45 markets over the period.</p>
          <p>Regarding the performance by format in the interim nine months of 2011, Zara and the general concepts grouped together have performed broadly in line with each other with some minor differences. Regarding the general concepts, the changes versus last year relate mainly to the comparable base.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pablo for the outlook section.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our expansion in 2011, let me highlight that our store opening plan is on track. Regarding the outlook for the second half of 2011, I would like to add that the store sales in local currencies from the 1st of November to the 11th of December have grown 11%. For the rest of 2011, we will continue to invest profitably, expanding our business in a number of markets with attractive long-term returns through our multi-concept and multi-channel strategy.</p>
          <p>Inditex is now present in five continents and in all the key markets, showing our global reach. The current base offers huge growth potential for the coming years.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I would like to cover a number of initiatives carried out by Inditex concepts and some store openings of recent months. Inditex expansion has reached a new milestone in China, as we have opened our 250th store in the market. We are now present in 42 cities. We will open around 130 stores in China over fiscal 2011 and expect to close the fiscal year with more than 270 stores.</p>
          <p>Zara has launched its first stores in Taiwan with a very strong reception. We have opened two flagship stores at Taipei's most relevant fashion locations, the emblematic 101 Mall and Zhong Xiao Road. Further Zara openings in Taiwan will take place in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Zara has also launched its operations in South Africa with a very warm reception. It has opened a flagship store at Johannesburg's Sandton City. Further Zara openings in Cape Town and Durban will follow over the coming months.</p>
          <p>Zara has launched a new image which is currently being rolled out in all new stores worldwide. This image can be seen in Stratford City, Taipei and South Africa. Zara launched online sales in Japan on the 20th of October 2011 with a very satisfactory reception. We plan to roll out Zara online sales in other selected markets until we establish a global presence.</p>
          <p>Bershka has been launched in two very relevant markets, Germany and South Korea. These flagships will be followed by very prominent stores in the coming months. Massimo Dutti continues expanding its presence in the Dutch market, with the opening of a flagship store in Amsterdam's Pieter Cornelisz Hoofstraart. Pull&amp;Bear has recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, opening a flagship ecoefficient store at Rotterdam's Linjbaan. The store is one of Pull&amp;Bear's largest in the world, with more than 1,000 square meters. Energy consumption is 30% below normal stores.</p>
          <p>Stradivarius has launched a Christmas collection in all its stores worldwide. Oysho has launched a new jean collection present in selected stores worldwide. Zara Home has been launched in China. Flagship stores in Beijing's The Place and Solana are the first steps in the market and will be followed by additional openings in the coming months. Uterq&#xFC;e has opened a very relevant store at St. Petersburg Galereya, the fifth in the Russia market.</p>
          <p>Moving on into recent openings, Zara has opened a flagship store at the Stratford City in London. We continue to expand our presence in China with highly prominent stores. Zara has opened a flagship store of 3,000 square meters at Chengdu's Zongfu Road, the key retail destination in the city. A Zara store at Bangalore's Phoenix Market City has opened recently. We continue to expand our presence in the main Indian cities. A Zara store has opened at Adelaide's Burnside Village. Additional Zara stores in other key Australian cities will follow.</p>
          <p>Finally, regarding our corporate calendar, the full year results for 2011 will be released on the 21st of March 2012 and this is all from us. We will be very pleased to answer any questions you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the telephone Q&amp;A session starts now. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from Anne Critchlow from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is about like-for-like sales in Q3. Were like-for-like sales positive in Q3? And if so, was the space contribution no more than 6%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Anne.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, adding some color on the interim nine months results, what I would like to say is, first, that we have achieved satisfactory sales in the quarter with positive like-for-like sales. The effect of currency translation on sales in the interim nine months results has been minus 1%. The isolated third quarter 2011 probably had the highest currency translation and is now behind us. At current exchange rates, our best estimate is for around a minus 1% currency translation for the full fiscal year 2011.</p>
          <p>As all of you have documented in your reports, the unseasonal weather has been a feature of the third quarter 2011. But as weather patterns have returned to normal, so have sales. Our trading update from the 1st of November to the 11th of December shows local currency sales growth of 11%, in line with the first nine months. And the store openings for 2011 are also on track.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just a follow-up on a small detail there. You mentioned the currency translation in Q3 was the highest you've seen all year. What was the currency translation effect in Q3, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we prefer not to enter into a breakdown of just a quarter, because <mark type="ph" /> decision (11:39) the most important thing. We have provided guidance for the year. But as I have mentioned, the third quarter has seen the highest currency translation for each of the quarters that we have seen. And for the year, we expect something around minus 1%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and are you saying that in Q3, like-for-like sales were positive? I saw that on the wires.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. This is what I mentioned at the beginning, that like-for-like was positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Richard Edwards from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. It's really a question relating to the gross margin. Looks like in the third quarter, the gross margin was up something like 100 basis points. I wondered if you were sticking with your guidance of down 100 basis points for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, you know that in the month of March, when we gave our guidance for the gross margin, we were saying that we thought that we were going to be able to lock in and to lock a minimum of 50% of the gross margin gain of the year 2012.</p>
          <p>Regarding the gross margin &#x2013; the gross margin, what I would say, as we always say this, that is the results of a combination of many, many different factors. In our case, something which is very, very relevant is the flexibility of our supply chain and the fact that we buy product very close to the season. So what I can tell you is that now at this stage, our best estimate for the gross margin in the second half is to achieve a stable gross margin compared with the second half of the year 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. That's good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Warwick Okines from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning. A couple of questions about the space plans, which you say are on track for the year. Just wondering if you could say how many stores you plan to open in Q4. The guidance at the beginning of the year you gave implied somewhere between 100 stores and 140 stores in Q4 now, but I was wondering if you could just tighten that range. In particular, do you think you'll hit the guidance you gave for Zara store openings at the beginning of the year, which was 125 stores to 130 stores?</p>
          <p>And finally, you haven't opened any Uterq&#xFC;e &#x2013; any net Uterq&#xFC;e stores in Q2 or Q3. I was just wondering if you're still playing around with the format or whether you think you've got the right format to roll out? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what I would say, first of all, that our store opening plan for the year is very much in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year. You were mentioning the fact that our openings, you know that there is a way there could be a calendar impact from that point of view. But by <mark type="audio gap" /> (14:27) so far in the fourth quarter, we have already opened around 30 Zara stores that <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:35). Globally, our store opening plan is we have on track with what we said at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Uterq&#xFC;e, your question, well, Uterq&#xFC;e as we always have said, Uterq&#xFC;e is a brand in which because of the profile of the brand, the number of openings will always be below the number of openings of other brands, because with Uterq&#xFC;e, we only go to very specific locations, high street locations. We think that it's a brand that is not &#x2013; we should not be present with Uterq&#xFC;e in most of the shopping malls. So, the number of openings for Uterq&#xFC;e will always be below the number of openings for any other brand inside our different concepts. Having said that Uterq&#xFC;e, we think we feel very, very confident about the future prospects of the format.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Pablo. And could I just follow up and ask then, whether you think you'll be at the top or the bottom end of your full-year store opening range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it will be very much in line with the guidance, because the problem that you can see is that sometimes &#x2013; if there is a shopping mall delay or two shopping mall delay, what we always say, 20 stores are above or below, is something that always could happen. There are some openings that could be scheduled for, let us say, December, then could take place at the beginning of February or the opposite. So that is why we would prefer to say inside the range, but without being more precise, because this is the type of things.</p>
          <p>Imagine that there are two shopping malls in which we go with all the different brands, one in China, one in Russia. Then, we would be talking about 15, 16 stores moving from the beginning of &#x2013; from the end of one year to the beginning of the other year. So I would prefer to stay very much in line with the guidance we gave at the beginning of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>The next question comes from Andrew Hughes from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Andrew Hughes from UBS. I had a question on e-commerce. We've had more than 12 months experience, or we've had more than 12 months experience in e-commerce in Europe and we had a few months now from the U.S. and Japan. Can you make any general comments on just what level of incremental sales you might generate from e-commerce, whether e-commerce is margin dilutive or not at this stage? And how it varies across different markets in terms of your experience so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're talking about the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (17:31) What we could say is that we are very satisfied with our e-commerce experience from two different perspectives. One, of course, is online sales, I could say online sales. And the other one is that when we begin our online activity in any given market, which is that the number of visits to our Web page in that particular market increases in a very, very significant way. So a lot of people are seeing our product on the Web. Some of them are buying online. Some of them are going to our stores after seeing the product on the Web. And the number of visits is increasing in a very, very significant way, the number of fans in Facebook, all these type of things.</p>
          <p>So, we are also very happy with customer services, with the deliveries. The comments that we are receiving from our customers are quite positive. As I have said previously, online margins are not <mark type="audio gap" /> (18:32) in our case.</p>
          <p>And regarding sales, I would say, it is too early to talk about sales. This is a year of execution, of implementation. We are quite focused on that. We have launched the brand different from Zara and Zara Home. We have launched Zara in the U.S. We have launched Zara in Japan. So we think it is too early to talk about sales. What we can say is that we are satisfied.</p>
          <p>About different countries, it's very much in line with our expectations in the sense that there are countries in which online sales have more relevance and countries in which online sales are less relevant. But this is what we were expecting when we decided to have &#x2013; what we were expecting from the very beginning. You have countries that this brand, Germany, the U.K., of course the U.S. in which online sales are more relevant than in other countries. No, this is something, but this is what we were expecting from the beginning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of the markets you're in, the U.S. is the only one where you have partners. Do you think that you might end up with partners in more markets, such as the structure you have in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but to say partner is probably is too much. We have our logistic operator. That's the only point. Instead of building our own logistic capacity, we thought it was better to have externalized logistics. But it's not our partner. As I could say, it's just a logistic operator with which we are working, because we thought it was better. You know that there is a lot of logistic capacity in the U.S. Online is extremely well developed in the country.</p>
          <p>And then when we had to decide, do we build our own logistic capacity or do we go through a third party, we thought it was better to have a third-party logistics supplier. That's the only point there. It's an analysis of cost, in any given market, what is more efficient from a cost perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. My question is regarding the gross margin. And I was wondering whether you could provide some light about the main drivers behind the extraordinary evolution of the gross margin in the third quarter, with 99 basis points of expansion, despite a much weaker like-for-like performance than what you reported at the first half of your speech? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, what I would like to say is that what I have said just now, that at this stage of the year, our best estimate for the gross margin in the second half is to have a stable gross margin compared to the second half of the year 2010.</p>
          <p>And then, you know that we prefer not to elaborate very much on the gross margin of one particular quarter. We think it's better to see the whole season. But as we always say, the gross margin is a combination of many different things. It has to do with mark-ups, it has to do &#x2013; well, with many, product mix, fashion trends. But in our case, something which is very, very relevant is the flexibility of our supply chain and as I was saying before, the fact that we buy product very close to the season.</p>
          <p>But that &#x2013; we prefer not to elaborate very much on the gross margin of any particular quarter. We always say that we prefer to analyze the gross margin on a full-year basis and in any case, on a full-seasons basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. One main question today and that's on the inventory position at the nine months. You've obviously given some gross margin guidance, so I take it from that you have a view as to how markdown might evolve across the season as a whole this year. Are you &#x2013; could you comment on the inventory and could you also comment on the commitment position of the company at this point in time? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we always say, the inventory position is just <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:04) reflects the commitment of the company at any given point in time. The roll rate as of the 31st of October 2011, is influenced by the comparable base. On a two-years basis, the inventory growth is limiting.</p>
          <p>Additionally, let me remind you that the store sales in local currency has increased by 11% from the 1st of November to the 11th of December. And now, we have also provided our best estimate for a stable gross margin in the second half of 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and regarding your comment about markdowns in the future, we are expecting very similar trends to the Autumn-Winter season to 2010. So, we are not expecting any significant change from that point of view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you're comfortable with your commitment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are quite comfortable with our level of commitment. We don't see any problem from that point of view within that. We feel very comfortable that this is something that &#x2013; we always say as you know that we &#x2013; that, that is the most relevant thing for us, the evolution of our commitment, much more than the inventory position at any particular point during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the flat second half gross margin markdown has no influence on that number in your view, at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, markdowns will be quite normal. And also, you must have in mind that when we say a stable gross margin, we always say &#x2013; we always include into that <mark type="ph" /> a statement (24:49) 50 basis points above or below, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we feel very comfortable with our level of commitment at this stage of the year and it's about normal, nothing special regarding markdowns during this season.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. One question from me on the gross margin, again, with the risk of not being given any more color, though. But if I can specify, could you talk about the FX impact on the gross margin, which is something you could maybe comment. And also, am I right to think that the cost inflation coming from Asia and I recognize that Asia is not the biggest part of your sourcing, cost inflation coming from Asia was increased year-on-year and if we could isolate this effect, how much that would be on your gross margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Chris, regarding first the currency impact on the gross margin, there is no currency impact that is significant in this gross margin we have just released. And second, regarding the different elements of the gross margin, we prefer not to elaborate, but the most important thing and we have insisted on that is our business model, the fact that we have a lot of flexibility and that we buy very close to the season. And I think those are the two more relevant features when looking at the guidance that we have provided for a stable second half gross margin versus the second half gross margin of 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. Can I ask then one other question about the Indian expansion? It seems the Indian government now has suggested that direct investment is allowed there, does this change your plans of expansion? Can that accelerate your expansion there or your plans are broadly unchanged despite this, the government's announcements?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Our plans are unchanged. As you were saying, you know that in India, we have the Tata group as our partner there and our expansion plans remains unchanged. We think it's a market with medium- and long-term significant potential for us. We have been very well received. Currently, we're present only with Tata. We are beginning to considering the possibility of introducing other brands, probably Massimo Dutti would be the first one with which we could enter the Indian market, and we are not changing at all our expansion plans there.</p>

          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see buying conditions particularly in your proximity markets for next year, in terms of supply and demand and various other issues that go into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know that we prefer to talk about the gross margin for the year in the previous year's results presentation in the month of March. So we prefer to elaborate a little bit more about the gross margin for the year in 2012 in the month of March, when we will present our full year results. What I would tell you is that globally, that there's nothing very relevant in terms of our sourcing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should think about gross margin stability going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer to update in the full year results presentation. But I would repeat to you that there's nothing very relevant from that point of view.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And could I just follow up on the new Zara format. How quickly would you expect that to be rolled out across the existing estate? Will you accelerate it or will you simply implement it on refurbs?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, what we would say is that regarding the new openings, it will be introduced in all the new openings. We are very, very happy with this new image. I was mentioning during the presentation that we have &#x2013; well, even the Australian shops are very much with this new image. And then, of course, we have introduced this new image in the most recent launches, in Taiwan, in the case of South Africa. Well, in the case of London, where you have it in Stratford City. The opening we were mentioning, this big flagship in Chengdu in China, it's also with this new image. And of course, from now on, in all the new openings, we will introduce the new image.</p>
          <p>And then regarding the existing stores, we will continue with our normal refurbishing plans. And of course, in the refurbishment, we will introduce their new image. But we will not change our policy. We will continue with the normal activity that we develop every year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Just if I could go back to the currency situation, still have a question on currency. I mean, it does look like the stronger euro in the quarter had a bigger impact than the market was expecting on both sales and margin. I just wondered if you could talk through why the currency impact was highest in the third quarter? I presume it's Mexico and Latin America? I just wondered if you can confirm that. And also, tell me what the currency impact was on operating expenses, please, either for the nine-month or for the third quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I mentioned during the presentation, the currency impact in the third quarter, in our opinion, was the highest and the accumulated is 1%. We expect 1% for the full year. The impact on the third quarter is the exchange rate versus the euro of many currencies. And according also to the comparable of the previous year, remember that in the third quarter, we have the highest positive impact.</p>
          <p>In terms of the gross margin, as I mentioned, there is not a significant currency impact, because this is linked to our buying process and this is different, not just to the &#x2013; it's not just translation. And then regarding operating expenses, you know it tends to be approximately half of the impact on sales. However, I would like to highlight the tight management of operating expenses over the nine months and also over the third quarter. I think the way that the company has managed operating expenses over the period is remarkable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Marcos. So obviously, the comparable base was a factor and then by geography, presumably Latin America, South America currencies were the big-?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, not Latin America. It is the currencies in which we sell. We're talking about the pound, the yen, the renminbi, the ruble, the Mexican peso. So it's not related to Latin America. It's the countries, the non-euro countries...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I meant &#x2013; sorry. I was talking about Mexico, really. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, okay. All right. And just another one on Spain, if I may, as well. Just, Pablo, if you could talk about the outlook for Zara in Spain post the general election and what you're expecting in terms of further austerity, how that might impact Zara going forward, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we prefer, as you know, not to talk very much about macro or about this. What we can talk is about our own performance in the Spanish market. And what we can say, very similar to what we said in the month of March that for this year 2011, we are expecting a stable performance in the Spanish market. You know that Spain is a market that we know quite well. We are present with all our different brands and we are expecting a stable performance for the year in the Spanish market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So obviously, it was quite a bit better than that was in the first half. So are you expecting now the sort of slowdown we've seen in the second half to continue into next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding our expansion plans in India for the next three years, well, I would say we will continue opening stores in the different Indian cities. The number of openings in India will be &#x2013; in the next three years, we will have openings every year, but it will not be a huge number of openings. There &#x2013; our expansion in India has to do with the shopping mall development, because our openings take place in shopping malls in the case of India. So it has a lot to do with the number of good shopping mall development.</p>
          <p>And we are expecting a reasonable number of openings for the coming years, but it will have nothing to do, for example, with the case of China, but it will begin to be &#x2013; it's difficult to be very precise now, but it's about to open &#x2013; how many openings could we have in the next three years, a relevant figure every year, but we could think about 8, 10 stores per year, something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. Sorry to come back to the gross margin guidance as well. When you're talking about a flat gross margin in the second half, that presumably implies a minus 100 basis point decline in Q4. And you're also saying that you're not expecting a significant change in the level of markdown in the end of season. I was just wondering, what other factors should we be thinking about therefore that could negatively impact the gross margin in Q4 to the extent of minus 100 bps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not talking about the fourth quarter. We're talking about the second half. And with all that we have seen, the trading update, the way we have been managing the gross margin inventory, the flexibility of the supply chain, our expectation is now for a broadly stable gross margin over the second half, 50 basis points higher or lower for the whole season. I know that you're referring to the markdown activity, but we've made very clear that we're not expecting anything significantly different to the previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And that's down to the flexibility of your models. So if we look at your inventory position, you were saying that in terms of the level of aged stock you've managed to switch or flex more in terms of the proximity and the rotational to minimize any aging of that stock going into markdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we mentioned is that we have a flexible supply chain. We buy very close to the season and based on that, what we see is that we expect to be able to achieve a stable gross margin over the second half 2011 versus 2010. And all things considered, we have also provided you with a trading update in terms of sales, that sales from the 1st of November to the 11th of December are growing at 11%, very much in line with the first nine months.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. We will now cover the questions that have come in from the webcast platform. Some questions on sales, currency and gross margins have already been covered. We have had a number of questions on China, which basically can be summarized with what are your expectations for growth and store growth in China over the coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know, China is a very relevant market for us. As we were saying during the presentation, we will close the year with around 130 openings in China. So we will have around 270 stores in China at the end of the year. Now we are present will all the brands in the Chinese market and we see very, very good prospect for us in the coming years in China and we'll continue opening stores in a very significant way.</p>
          <p>Now, we are present in 42 different cities in the Chinese market and we will continue increasing our presence in the cities in which we are already present and also, opening stores in new cities. So in the next five years, of course, China will be a very relevant part of our expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have another question on expansion. Can you talk us through your expansion plans in Brazil and Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, these are also two relevant markets for us. In Russia, as you know, we are present with all the brands. We have been opening stores in a significant way in the previous years and we will continue like that in the coming years. It's also a very relevant market for us in terms of expansion. All our brands are very well received.</p>
          <p>In the case of Brazil, today, we are only present with Zara, because of being in the South Hemisphere. But next year, we will also be present with Zara Home in Brazil. And we will continue opening stores with Zara and then also with Zara Home, a significant way during the coming years. You know that our South Hemisphere collection is becoming stronger and stronger. Now we are present in all the relevant South Hemisphere market, with the openings in Australia and South Africa during this year. And we will continue increasing our presence in Brazil in the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. We have one final question. It's regarding our recent launches. How have your recent launches in South Africa, Australia and Taiwan been received? What are your growth plans for those markets in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say we have been &#x2013; well, about Australia, we have already talked in previous conference calls. The reception was really, very, very good. And now with the openings in South Africa and Taiwan, it has also been quite remarkable, quite good, very good. The reception that we have had, in the case of Taiwan, a lot of people were queuing, waiting to enter the stores during every day.</p>
          <p>Two very good stores, two flagships, very, very crowded. I was there three weeks ago, just after the opening of the second store, visiting the stores. It was really very, very crowded, a lot of people visiting the stores. We have big impact in Taipei because of the Zara opening.</p>
          <p>And then in the case of South Africa, we are also quite happy and we are willing to open new stores in Johannesburg and also in different cities, as we were saying during the presentation.</p>
