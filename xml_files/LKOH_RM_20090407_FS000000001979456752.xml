          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. If those of you who are standing would take your seats we'll get started. My name is Richard Matzke. I'm a Member of the Board of Directors of LUKOIL and it's my esteemed honor and privilege to provide a few opening comments on LUKOIL's capital market day in New York.</p>
          <p>I've had this opportunity in the past. I've met many of you in prior years and I look forward to what is going to be said today by the members of LUKOIL's management team, LUKOIL being the premier Russian energy company.</p>
          <p>The program for today is probably outlined for you. Initially Mr. Fedun, Vice President of Strategic Development and Investment Analysis will make a presentation of year end results '08. This will be followed by a presentation from Mr. Alexander Matytsyn, who will discuss the financial condition of LUKOIL.</p>
          <p>Following that, Mr. Andrey Gaidamaka, Deputy Vice President of Strategy and Investment Analysis will lead a Q&amp;A session with all the members of management, including Mr. Kozyrev, Mr. Krasovsky, Steve Allen and Sergei Epifanov.</p>
          <p>I appreciate the fact that all of you took the time to come and listen to LUKOIL's management team today. I think you'll find it a very interesting presentation because, as you know, our industry has been in a bit of uncertainty, turmoil and the exotic behavior the past year.</p>
          <p>Is Mr. Gluzman here?  There's Mr. Gluzman. I think you should know Mr. Gluzman is President of LUKOIL Americas with office here in New York. Enough for me, I'll now introduce Mr. Fedun, who will carry on for the next half hour. Thank you so much.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce our 2008 financial results. Well, first some forward-looking statements about the statistics.</p>
          <p>Well this year has been very unusual, like for everybody else. While it all started very fine and sweetly and we were all happy and we were all drinking those toasts to keep celebrating, but quite unexpectedly it turned out that everything was not so well. Some bank in Australia with write-offs, some unclear debts in America and that's how it all started.</p>
          <p>But we all had this feeling that the holiday, the celebration would be over sooner or later, but no one knew it would be so deep and painful and a comprehensive crisis covering all countries worldwide. So no one expected that and neither did we at LUKOIL.</p>
          <p>Well I should say that we are in a unique position, as all other oil and hydrocarbons producers. You know what makes our position unique is that we have a number of products that has very elastic demand and despite this serious financial crisis, despite this serious turmoil and pessimism we had at the outset of the crisis. So we calm down that nothing bad actually happened to the oil companies.</p>
          <p>So we still have a pretty good position, a pretty good footprint, although I must admit that Q4 was the worst quarter in our history. At the same time we got record high free cash flow. We had very comfortable debt levels and our chief treasurer Mr. Matytsyn will comment on this later and right before the crisis we put on stream a huge field that that is helping us a lot now against the backdrop of declining production worldwide. But our production indicator is still growing thanks to this field.</p>
          <p>So here are the main financial highlights. Our sales reached $107 billion, it's record high sales amongst Russian companies. Our EBITDA is about 15 billion. Net income turned out a little bit lower than last year and our earnings per share and per barrel also remained at the level of last year.</p>
          <p>At the same time we repaid $38 billion of taxes, $38 billion of taxes. Not a single American company is paying that much tax, I'm sure and LUKOIL is tax payer number one today, although our production is six times lower than Gazprom's.</p>
          <p>So we still have significant cash flow, like I said and the dividend policy we adopted 10 years ago, so when we said that we're going to spend less than 15% of our net income on dividends and so we are going to support this policy this year. So it's my official statement for you, so we are not going to stop paying out dividends this year.</p>
          <p>Well some macroeconomic highlights. So what you can see here is favorable and unfavorable factors, but of course the oil prices were higher at the beginning of the year and the average was also higher, but it was compensated by this extremely high tax burden that you can see at the bottom of this line.</p>
          <p>Well if you look at the situation in the hydrocarbon market in Q4 last year it was a perfect storm because all the unfavorable factors that you could think of actually coincided. It was a dramatic decline in the oil price, a dramatic decline in demand, a dramatic worsening of financial opportunities for refinancing, it was refining margins going down both in Russia and in Europe.</p>
          <p>And yet we believe that &#x2013; well from my experience in the oil industry, I've never seen such a total and negative coincidence of all those factors. It's the first time we've seen this in the oil industry, but this time is over and today I can say that we are doing well and we are fine and we didn't actually use any risk plans. It was not necessary for LUKOIL.</p>
          <p>So if you look at this graphic what you see here is that in the past three months of last year we lost some free cash flow and it was not surprising because we saw some reserves, re-evaluations going on and oil prices were going down. And the export duties and the mineral production tax was still high because they calculate it based on two months averages and in December and in November each exported barrel produced from one to a $6 of net loss.</p>
          <p>But in January, February and March the situation has stabilized and we have come back to normal. So as you can see here, January, February and even during March we are seeing pretty positive results, pretty positive indicators. So we are working with a high level of profitability.</p>
          <p>So you probably remember this meeting a decade ago when we were talking about the ruble devaluation and what opportunities it opened for the development of oil industry. And actually it's history repeating itself. And 90, I should say 90% of all our sales are dollar denominated or euro denominated and a substantial portion of our capital expenditures are ruble denominated.</p>
          <p>And the difference you get here gives us a substantial benefit, substantial benefit for many oil companies, particularly LUKOIL. So this is our benefit from ruble devaluation, that's what you can see in this fall-out.</p>
          <p>Well in OpEx in operating expenditures, so more than 70% of this cost is incurred in Russian duration and in rubles, that's why we have a pretty, pretty good privilege from the weakening of the ruble.</p>
          <p>And this weakening basically took place in two quarters, in Q4 and in Q1, but there's a flip side as well. So what we saw was that the so-called paper losses because of this ruble devaluation because a substantial part of our returns receivable are ruble denominated, it's basically the debt of the budget of a company because the government always pays back the VAT a little bit later and all those obligations, all those receivables were evaluated and basically for each of these substantial paper loss and in Q4 it was more than $900 million.</p>
          <p>But I want to emphasize that this loss was 100% related for this reported system because costs incurred in rubles and the results are reported in dollars. And unfortunately we're going to see this paper loss again in Q1 this year because of this ruble to dollar exchange rate.</p>
          <p>Well of course the weakening of the ruble resulted in all our operating expenditures and leasing costs going down and we actually, we managed to drag down our leasing cost while our competitors such as Rosneft, TNK-BP and Gazprom Neft, so they basically, their leasing costs and operating expenditures went up despite the weakening of the ruble. The drilling costs went down dramatically, as you can see because that's what we're doing in West Siberia because this crisis opens up new opportunities for working with contractors.</p>
          <p>And of course we've seen some changes in the fiscal system as well. I should say that in the most difficult time in November, December the Russian government took unprecedented measures to help oil companies. So they quickly changed the taxation system, the so-called Kudrin scissors, when the prices were fixed for a certain period of time and the tax rate is thanks to this price and of course when the price goes down vertically and dramatically the higher tax rate becomes very painful for the new oil companies.</p>
          <p>And the government what they did was they reduced this tax rate two times, so what they reduced was royalty and extra duty and as a result we got a substantial saving. It was about $2 billion in Q4 alone and extra measures we're taking at the beginning of this year to support the Company, but the most effective measure being the ruble devaluation.</p>
          <p>Well our main operational indicators, so we increased our production almost to 2.2 million tons per day and at the same time we reduced crude oil exports while increasing the sales of our products, exports in oil products. And we also sold our products through our own retail network because when you export product you get about 30% higher margin than when you're exporting crude oil.</p>
          <p>And it's these indicators that we're comfortable in terms of our relations with OPEC because what OPEC wants us to do is to give them support, they want support from independent producers. And we support their view of cooperating with OPEC and we want all the measures we take to be in line with the relations between Russia and OPEC.</p>
          <p>So LUKOIL is still one of the crude oil reserve leaders, so we see some reduction in reserves because we have very conservative auditors. And so they took the price of $39 per barrel as the basis for calculation the reserve base for last year and as a result about one billion barrels of hydrocarbonates changed their category from proven to potential reserves because with such low prices it's considered that production would not be profitable. But now the prices, the prices are much higher than $32 per barrel, which means that these reserves will come back to normal in our next few quarters.</p>
          <p>Again, if you compare production for two years, so we put on stream two fields called Khylchuya, together with ConocoPhillips, our gas field in Uzbekistan which gave us a positive trend this year, which is a unique situation for the Russian federation where all oil companies are seeing decline in production. So we also are doing fine in international hydrocarbon production, it's going up quite well.</p>
          <p>So the key question is whether or not we're going to be able to keep this growth potential amidst this crisis. So I can say with confidence yes because we have already made the major investments into those fields that would give us a strong foundation for growth going forward.</p>
          <p>So by 2011 we're going to put on stream Kandym and S-W Gissar in Uzbekistan to give us about 12 billion cubic meters of production and by 2013 we're going to put on stream this major Filanovsky field in the Caspian to give us another three million of production. And all these fields are under development now and we are not going to slow down on the preparations and development of those fields.</p>
          <p>Some brief facts on those fields. An example of this Korchagin field that we put on stream just before the crisis, which has now reached its design capacity, so we managed to do everything quite quickly before the crisis.</p>
          <p>Well so this year, next year we're going to see some growth because of the launch of this Korchagin North field in the Caspian. You know that we have a unique position in the Caspian, 10 wells were successful out of 11 exploration wells. It's a unique situation worldwide, never happens.</p>
          <p>In May we are launching the foundation of drilling rig for exploration purposes, so this rig is ready to be launched, so production should start before the end of the year. And this is basically a roadmap for hydrocarbons production in this sector. What we did however, we slowed down a little bit on our gas project because Gazprom saw a very dramatic decline of gas demand.</p>
          <p>Well I think this gas demand decline is a little bit unsubstantial because the gas price formula encourages consumers not to buy this gas because for Europe before April 1st this year Gazprom is selling it to Europe at about $500 for a 1,000 cubic meters and after that, after April 1st it will be $150, so of course people were not buying.</p>
          <p>As a result, Gazprom have revised their system and their production plan, so that's why they slowed down a little bit the development of our field. So that's why we are now focused on gas projects outside of Russia only and inside Russia we decided to be more focused on our oil fields or on those gas fields where we have our own demand system in the North Caspian where we can sell gas to our own utility stations.</p>
          <p>So our refinery indicators, certainly you can see pretty good figures here. There's a lot of details in this file, but despite this margin decline we saw in Russia they still are very profitable. And to do it today, LUKOIL refineries, their utilization is 100% which is again a unique situation in the oil industry and we keep expanding the capacities.</p>
          <p>Well unlike in the U.S. in the retail, so the retail industry is still a very profitable segment for us. Well because of high taxes we do not have such strong price fluctuations as in the U.S. market. And this total price decline since the beginning of the crisis has just been about 14 to 15%, I mean the retail prices. So we're interested in expanding our retail sales and today we have a pretty strong footprint in the retail industry and we're going to keep expanding our potential in those markets that can give us extra margin.</p>
          <p>So our overall financial results, well they've been published on the Internet and you will have them, so not too much to comment on. Well maybe just this one thing that in 2008 we crossed the 100 billion sales threshold, which is a unique situation for any Russian oil company.</p>
          <p>Well our sales structure has not changed much over the past year, so the main contribution to our sales is our product sales abroad. So overall product sales gives us about 50% of all sales and we're going to keep growing this proportion by reducing the proportion of crude oil that we sell.</p>
          <p>So unlike the competition we managed to keep our operating expenditures under control. So the lifting costs went up a little bit because of production growth and for all the other indicators we're seeing a reduction and that's what you can see in this next slide.</p>
          <p>In Q4 2008 our lifting cost went down almost 17%. While our competitors saw a high lifting cost in spite of the ruble devaluation, well it's because of a couple of factors. Number one, we launched a new field that gives us a lifting cost reduction and then it's just the result of our continuous efforts to keep the operating costs under control, which is very important in a crisis.</p>
          <p>Well our transportation costs have been growing together with the inflation, but such monopolies as Transneft and Russian railroads, they've managed to negotiate some rate hikes. But those hikes were not as substantial as they could be, so we think that transportation costs are pretty affordable and I would even say optimum for Russian oil companies.</p>
          <p>Well net income, so as you can see the main issue was those huge write-offs. So this currency translation loss goes by the ruble devaluation and also losses related to the re-evaluation of our reserves. But this is also a paper loss I should say because we've never been in this situation before when the reserves are re-evaluated.</p>
          <p>And there's a lot of reserves that we could have classified as technological because a refinery or a gas station cannot work without some buffer reserves and we should have worked more with the auditors during this classification. But we learned some lessons we're going to use in the future in evaluating our reserves and our returns receivable in order to avoid this kind of paper losses going forward.</p>
          <p>So like I said, despite the crisis we managed to maintain a substantial quantity of cash flow, which means the Company has been operationally successful over the past year. Well the main CapEx items, so the main one is exploration and production, very huge contribution to the CapEx and item number two is refining and marketing because we're developing and re-equipping our refineries.</p>
          <p>One very important fact you need to understand, so in 2009 we expect our CapEx to go down by 40%. But you need to realize that in real terms if you translate it into the volume of seismic research, the number of wells worked over, rigs, we're not going to see that much reduction.</p>
          <p>So it's just a re-evaluation of the cost of services provided by Russian contractors, Russian rubles because in the past they would present or provide you services worth 30 million rubles and it was reflected in the reporting based on this ruble to dollar exchange rate of 20 to 25 rubles per dollar. Now that it's about 33 rubles per dollar, formally the CapEx reduction is about 40%, but physically the volumes are not going down. It's very important to understand.</p>
          <p>And the fields we cannot put on stream with this much cheaper in currency terms, capital expenditures. The production will be sold for dollars and that would give us a substantial benefit.</p>
          <p>Well here again you can see our CapEx compared to that of other companies, with some peers in Russia and abroad. So as you can see we've been seeing growth over the past few years, while oil majors have seen CapEx increase, but the production didn't go up or didn't go up that much.</p>
          <p>Well to conclude I would like to say that LUKOIL, as well as other companies, have been through a very hard and nervous three months, so when the crisis began and when you didn't know where the bottom would be and how it would all play out. But thanks to the commitment of our management team and our engineers and our workers on the one hand and because of support we got from the Russian government on the other hand.</p>
          <p>So thanks to the efforts by all world leaders, including your new president, into stabilizing the market, its OPEC efforts to stabilize the market. So as a result, today we feel quite confident and we can tell you with confidence that we will keep working successfully. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to emphasize on the financial situation of the company LUKOIL. I think just to say after the presentation of Leonid Fedun and first of all <mark type="inaudible" /> our commercial banking. I should say that it's not really affected our <mark type="inaudible" /> too much, that is why we can continue to perform our operations and all these dramatic things we can survive with the situation.</p>
          <p>I would like to pay you attention first of all on the current capital structure of the group. As you can see and we already explained it a few times that LUKOIL has very, very conservative debt management policy. And in this chart you can see that the debt-to-equity ratio of the Company now currently a little bit over 15%.</p>
          <p>At the same time the Company establishes the limit of this maximum of debt-to-equity ratio at a level of 30%. And you can see that this chart that LUKOIL has the best debt-to-capital ratio concerning with the Russian companies, Russian peers in spite of the fact that this year the Company increases the debt portfolio up to $2.8 billion as a result of the positioned assets in Italy and in Turkey.</p>
          <p>At the same time based on this debt-to-equity ratio we have got roughly $12 billion of headroom, which could allow us to borrow additional funds if the situation would be better. Second thing I would like to show that the consolidated debt profile of the Company. At the end of year 2008 the total debt of LUKOIL was close to $10 billion.</p>
          <p>But you should take into consideration that 22% or roughly $2.2 billion is so-called debt to ConocoPhillips, which is not really I should say a 100% banking debt because it's our way of finance the joint venture with ConocoPhillips. That means we will not, we should not repay it as a banking loan and it would be just recouped in the future investment, not investment, in the project we have got with joint venture with ConocoPhillips.</p>
          <p>That means practically speaking the real debt of the Company is close to $8 billion. And centralized financial policy of LUKOIL enables first of all to significantly reduce the level of secured debt. You can see that it has been reduced by 10 times in less than five years.</p>
          <p>We achieved the optimal debt currency mix. Debt service in the U.S. is covered by export revenues in dollars here. To achieve the optimal level of fixed rates, debt and to minimize the debt service fluctuation and we are now currently fully in compliance with the financial covenant we achieved for ourselves and which has been also advised to us by rating agencies.</p>
          <p>Mr. Fedun already explained the factors which affect LUKOIL's financial stability and liquidity. I will not put a lot of time just in explanation of these, but I would like to emphasize one thing, that the Russian government, as the other governments in the world, try to stabilize the financial situation, try to provide additional funding and liquidity to the Russian banks.</p>
          <p>That's why LUKOIL enjoys these unique situation in Russia, because we are one of the &#x2013; I think, we are really the best Russian Company and from that point of view, we have got huge access to additional flow which comes from the Russian banks. And as a result, we already took $2.3 billion from the Russian banks, 1.3 from Russian Gazprombank for three years with the repayment option and a one-year loan with Russian Verbank, which is 50 in U.S. dollars, 50% in rubles, which gives us a very, very efficient rate of the borrowing. I believe that, I couldn't tell you, but I think it will be extremely low based in our evaluation of the ruble debt evaluation.</p>
          <p>Also, we now are currently at the final stage of the negotiations with Russian Vneshtorgbank. This bank has now currently limit established for LUKOIL close to 75 billion rubles, which could be provided unsecured. That means that we have additional access to the additional funding, which currently is not available for us in the international market. We got it from Russia.</p>
          <p>Tax reduction has been already explained by Mr. Fedun, but I would like to emphasize just two things. One, we have good positive effect for the cash flow, because some taxes has been not reduced, but resistant of the payment of these taxes and calculation of these taxes has been changed, which gives us some advantages in cash flow and working capital facilities. Reduction of some taxes, like profit tax, has been reduced from 24 off to 20%, depreciation rate has been increased up to 30%. It gives us positive effect on the gross profitability. That means in 2009, we will enjoy these tax implications and consequences.</p>
          <p>A ruble devaluation also been touched already, but I would like to say that only in the first quarter of 2009, ruble has been devaluated up to 15% and currently we have got the reduction in production costs, which &#x2013; mostly in rubles and our CapEx expenses has been reduced from 8.3, which in the initial budget, up to $6.5 billion. And as Mr. Fedun said, all the significant projects and I should say, all the projects are still in place and they will be fulfilled based on the program.</p>
          <p>That, just maybe typical chart but it explains how the company would refinance its obligation in year 2009, 2010. We have got &#x2013; we should refinance roughly $4.7 billion and currently based on these explained loans from saving Russian's Verbank and Gazprombank, we already refinanced 2.31 billion, is we shouldn't refinance this because it's revolving credit lines and that's still in place. The international banks confirmed that the lines would be available for us in 2009. And that's why we should refinance only some roughly $1 billion and we achieved, already finalized negotiations with Russian Vneshtorgbank and we have also started the tender for mid-term secured refinancing with international banks, and we are also, I think, advanced in this way and based on the rate we can achieve, we can &#x2013; we have good choice.</p>
          <p>That's why the year 2009, which for a lot of Russian companies is really a horrible year, when Russia has to &#x2013; Russian companies have to refinance $220 billion and the cash flow is only is less than this amount, that gives LUKOIL a lot of chances for the, first of all, domestic growth to find out the additional opportunities in this market, having this stable cash flow situation.</p>
          <p>If you look at long-term debt amortization, you will see that average life of loan is now 4.1 years. Our target is &#x2013; it shouldn't be less than five years, but the current situation, the current environment doesn't give us. But we have moved into this target and we still consider different funding sources.</p>
          <p>First of all, we started negotiations with the other Russian Banks. We discussed the loans we've tendered for three or more years. We're already in the process with secured loans from international banks with a tender of three years. We think, if the market is open, we can still penetrate Euro bond issues and we are with different banks and especially with expert-grade agencies, we're in the process of discussions how we will project finance some of our projects, especially ecological projects, especially development of energy projects in Russia, and in some other countries like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, where the expert-grade agencies are very active.</p>
          <p>That's just explain the &#x2013; in detail, our funding sources, which I already discussed at the last chart, but that's how we are prepared to finance our current loan portfolio. I should say a few words about liquidity. LUKOIL established the centralized liquidity management system already two years ago and at this turmoil time, it gives us a lot of positive results.</p>
          <p>First of all, we reduced our working capital needs. We can now use our cash flow from operations around the globe 24 hours per day. That's the only Russian company who achieved this and we use our cash flow for all operations starting from Singapore and finishing in the United States, it's around the globe. It gives us effective liquidity management and it reduced our external funding cost for this.</p>
          <p>Currently, the company also has the confirmed credit lines of the working &#x2013; for the working capital facility for &#x2013; from the banks up to $2 billion, which with our own cash flow, gives us &#x2013; or cover our needs in working capital facilities.</p>
          <p>LUKOIL never stops thinking about the additional growth and especially in M&amp;A activity. Currently, the significant reduction of oil and gas prices creates the additional opportunities for LUKOIL and company considers different various investment projects and different partnership forms with international oil companies.</p>
          <p>But I need to assure you that every time the company looks attentively by financial aspects of the deal, each investment decision should be backed by a comprehensive financial package and we included bridge financing and take out facilities. That's why it will not &#x2013; any acquisition will not affect dramatically at the financial situation of LUKOIL.</p>
          <p>And at the end, I would like to show again the credit ratings of LUKOIL, which is pretty unique because LUKOIL is the only Russian company for which S&amp;P, Moody's and Fitch have affirmed LUKOIL's rating at before crisis level, investment grade level. You can see that the other companies have been downgraded, but &#x2013; and LUKOIL still have the same ratings.</p>
          <p>Rating agencies outline the following LUKOIL's trends. First of all, geographical business diversification, low debt level and low secured debt level, company's flexibility in respect of investment program and the strategy really for Russia. That's why this current financial situation gives the company a lot of chances to continue its further growth and development. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Yes, there is a question in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter McNally with Galleon Management. My question is with the lower investment in 2009, what do you expect to happen to depletion rates across the company and for how long can you sustain lower investment levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think that we are not going to see any real reduction of OpEx, because in rubles the exploration and drilling costs, the pipes and work over, in real terms, it will be at the same level as last year. So why we've seen this &#x2013; we are going to see this reduction because the ruble has fall &#x2013; has fallen 40%. All the major projects, with the launch of Yuzhno Khylchuyu field, the drilling on offshore Ghana we are starting in about two weeks, it's a major project for us. So all those projects will be financed 100%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. My name is <mark type="inaudible" /> with Orange Capital. I have a question about financing, two things, one is can you give us a sense of the latest financing you did, I guess a bilateral loan, what are you paying for that? Is it in ruble and if yes, what are you paying for that, what is the rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dollars and 16% in rubles, but if you mixed it in one package and if you can, for example, buy a forward, which is now a ruble at the level of 42, you could get the rate close to 4% effective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In dollars with...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other part of my question is, have you looked at, I call it bilateral deals such as Roseneft did with China or Transneft, these types of deals where people lend you money for oil or something along these lines. Have you looked at these things, and if yes, what type of terms &#x2013; I mean, is that an alternative or can you talk about that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you see that as I tried to explain, that LUKOIL is in a different &#x2013; a little bit different position to discuss these deals. First of all, I should not &#x2013; yes, I just can comment on our financial strategy. But if you see that these deals first of all are very expensive and at that time, if you can get something, you should give something in return. Yes, we don't consider it this way.</p>
          <p>We think that we can continue our traditional operations. The last thing we would like to have is a secured loan. But you know the current situation in the market with the banks and we believe that initially, we try to take as much unsecured debt as possible, but not with the Russian state ownership and because in this case, we could be potentially limited by the special requirement which the government could impose if they provide the direct fund.</p>
          <p>We tried to do everything on the commercial basis and what's most important, we would like to have the option to prepay all these loans if the situation is better. We still consider that once the market is open, we can start again the Eurobond issue. We can increase the maturity of our debt, if we use, for example, five or ten-year standard Eurobond issue. That's why we tried not to discuss these issues which would limit our activity and which limit our flexibility in the &#x2013; first of all, of selling our growth, because the company still thinks that it could sell as much growth at the optimal level price and not to be squeezed by the agreement for 15 years, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's take a question on the left side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>David Guzmanich from Renaissance Capital. Just, could you please revisit the discussion you had earlier on your dividend policy?  Over the last few months, has your dividend policy changed?  If so, can you comment on how?  If not, can you just refresh the terms of your current policy, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, I tried to comment on this, and I made a statement that nothing is going to change in our dividend policy. And so, we have decision of the board, and Mr. Matzke can confirm that. So the 15%, at least 15% of net income will be paid out as dividend. So I can reconfirm that once again, while the specific amount will be calculated in mid-April at the board meeting we are going to have in Prague.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was a question on the right in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard Rubin from Platz. Yes, I would like to know what is your anticipated 2009 production level is. For your CapEx, you are showing in 2009 <mark type="inaudible" /> are you going to spend any money on exploration and production in Russia in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually, we have exploration projects in Russia. They are just, they are not included in this overall cost in Russian production. We actually we have major exploration projects worldwide. There is again, a project of &#x2013; again, it's a very expensive project, but we are likely to have discoveries there because this West Africa is very promising. So I can just reconfirm all those figures I gave in my presentation. No changes. And Mr. Gaidamaka will comment on this more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you put Slide 29?  Most of that is related to that slide because there is a confusion about and there are questions, there are quite a few questions about it. Can we have Slide 29, please?  Okay. As you can see here, there are some questions and this is what the gentleman from Platz is asking as well. We do have a reduction of CapEx as you can see here in dollar terms. But it does not mean at all that we will not have any capital expenditures in Russian upstream. It's just the color scheme has been changed a little bit.</p>
          <p>The red &#x2013; the light red portion in the bottom does include international and Russian upstream together. It is just that we changed a little bit the color scheme from solid red to light red to picture forecast from the actual. So, there is a bit of a confusion, and there were questions about it coming from online. So I am saying again, Russian upstream CapEx is included in the bottom part of total upstream CapEx in 2009 forecast. In terms of &#x2013; yes, does that answer your question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in -- out of this amount, I would say about close to 70% is going to be in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And about the production please, 2009 production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By about 1.5%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>James Dobb from Lazard. Refining margins have come down recently. Can you give us your thoughts on what you see for refining margins over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, we are not seeing any factors to help us think that refining margins are going to grow in the near future, because any crisis &#x2013; as a result of any crisis, consumers try to consume less no matter when this crisis ends, and the capacity builds. So with this capacity, even if consumption goes down by 2 or 3%, refiners will not be able to increase their margins.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the margins are not going to go down either, because in January, February, March, you always see the least consumption of motor fuels. And it's a time when we have the least tracking margin in the year. And so as a result, you are going to see some flat margins at the same level as now, which means that independent companies that only did the refining will have serious difficulties and many players will offer their refining assets for sale.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Alina Chapovskaya from Merrill Lynch from the telephone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>

          <p>You have a question from the line of Alina Chapovskaya from Bank of America. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Alina Chapovskaya from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. I have two questions if I may. One question is about your Q4 results, and well, apparently LUKOIL has a hedging strategy to help the company to fight foreign crude oil prices. Did you see any contributions from your hedging strategy in Q4? And my other question would be, if possible, could you please provide the sales &#x2013; the revenue number for Q4, well, since it has changed due to accounting policy?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure we got the second portion of your question. I understand the first one, but I didn't get the second one. Can you repeat that, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if possible, could you please provide the sales number for fourth quarter, because apparently you have moved the income from the equity affiliates from the revenue line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In regards to our insurance, our hedging policy, it was most effective in Q3. Well, in the Q4, you are right, we saw very substantial losses because of reserves revaluation. But these losses could have been even higher if we hadn't hedged this, because we could have lost another $900 million. So this hedging system reduced our Q4 losses by 900 million. So the policy was right, and is right. It just didn't expect such a global decline with oil prices going down three times in such a short time, so no one could have predicted that, but this hedging policy reduced our revaluation losses. So, once again it reduced just two times our losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alina, I am actually surprised you are asking about any changes to our accounting policy, because we did not have any changes in accounting policy and the number for sales in Q4, 2008 we have in the presentation, it's Slide 21, if someone can put it up, it's $18.4 billion, so no changes in accounting policy. So I am bit surprised about that question.</p>
          <p>If there is something you would like to clarify, we have Deputy Chief Accountant, Mr. Kozyrev here. I think this is something that we will be glad to discuss in more detail during a personal meeting, which I am sure we will have, or in a conference call. But once again no changes in accounting policy and the number for revenue in Q4 is stated on the slide. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Is it possible to ask another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you please, if possible, give the guidance for the gas production for 2009?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the problem is, like I said, now gas price now is in a situation when the European consumers reduced their consumption, because you know that in two months' time, you can buy the gas cheaper than now. So as a result, Gazprom is trying to slow down this gas production by all independent producers. They are just &#x2013; they are not taking our gas in the situation they're in now. So we are reducing our gas production now. And it was the right decision when we decided to buy TGK-8 and invest into our own gas consumption structure, gas distribution structure. And a few years down the road, we will be able to avoid this negative influence from Gazprom.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Maria Radina from UBS. You may proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you for the presentation. A very simple question regarding write-down of crude and oil product inventories. So how did you treat these specific items?  As far as we can see, you include that in proven products purchased, have we got that correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you repeat the question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Kozyrev, who is Deputy Chief Accountant for the company, is going to answer that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, this 850 million consists of several parts. Number one is the write-off of inventory as of the end of the year, because we must bring the value of the reserves to the market value, it is standard. And number two, so we are writing all the reserves of enterprises as of the beginning of Q4 and at the price of Q3, so they are written off at the acquisition price and this gap, this series, if you will, give you this 850.</p>
          <p>And also &#x2013; it's also the so-called impairments. We wrote off goodwill on some of our companies, which was about 200 million and that's what this 850 consists of. So this is classified as impairment, so we have this year was on disposal and impairment of assets.</p>
          <p>Also, the second part is cost of purchase of crude oil and production and some of it is attributed to taxes which were included in the cost of reserves. And so, if you need more information, we can discuss it offline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This kind of detailed questions, I think is better to discuss in sort of a closed group meeting, not over the phone and not in a large audience like that. But with this, can we go to the next question?</p>
          <p>Yes, please?  We have a question from the room.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm Connery Erin with Argus. Can you talk a little bit about your expectation for Russian domestic demand and refining margins?  Do you expect to export more crude end-products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you for the question. Hopefully, we will be able to keep our sales in the Russian Federation as before, because like I said, even in the most difficult time in January, February, we didn't see a decline in demand for high octane gasolines in our retail chain, because Russians and people from Eastern Europe, they still drive their cars as before, while we are seeing a substantial decrease in diesel consumption. But it's diesel used by trucks, heavy trucks engaged in transportation and the construction industry, et cetera. But it's just several percentage points from the total volume.</p>
          <p>And when summer begins, we expect to see a traditional increase of high octane gasoline demand. And the measures the government has taken to revitalize the industry will result in high demand for diesel as well. So nothing, I think, substantial is to be expected and we're not seeing any substantial changes in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you can have couple more questions and we will be wrapping up our Q&amp;A session, because we're going to have more opportunity for you to ask questions at a group meeting following this presentation.</p>
          <p>Yes, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Anne Raft, Dow Jones. This 90.8 million tons as you forecast for Russia, I do have the figure for LUKOIL overall and can you comment on how this forecast could change with regard to future OPEC measures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I cannot comment on OPEC measures, although you know that we welcome all OPEC measures. Every merchant, we try to comply. But all OPEC proposals, they are about regulating exports and Russian exports have been on decline for two reasons, because all companies except for LUKOIL are decreasing their production, is number one. And number two is, companies are focused on product sales, not crude oil sales. And the figure that you quoted, was it 98.2 or something? So, 98 million tons &#x2013; 98.2 million tons is our production forecast for the whole company. 98.2 and that's with 1.5% growth.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Tom Purdalt <mark type="inaudible" />. On M&amp;A, have you had any thought or consideration into making an acquisition in MOL?  As you know, the RMB stake was sold to  Surgutneftegaz. Were you at all considering making an acquisition in Hungary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are things you always want to buy, but which are impossible to buy. And with all due respect, MOL is this kind of company. It's been hardened in this five or six-year independent struggle and 50% of European diplomats and lobbyists are involved. They have created such fortresses that are impossible to break. So we wish luck to Surgutneftegaz but we remain skeptical.</p>
          <p>So we prefer those acquisitions where we can be successful. Yes, we are interested in buying refining assets in Europe, but the position is still the same. We are only going to buy assets we need and at a fair price and we are not going to take &#x2013; to get away from this strategy.</p>
