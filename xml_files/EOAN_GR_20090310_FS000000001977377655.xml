          <p>Good afternoon, buenas tardes, bonjouno, and dobre den. Welcome to our Analyst and Investments Conference on our Results 2008. We would also like to welcome all analysts, investors, and our colleagues on Internet and Intranet. We would also like to welcome our <mark type="inaudible" /> we call them knowledge people on the right hand side -- they know all the answers -- and operation managers in this room.</p>
          <p>Certainly, I should not forget to greet the best friends of E.ON that is my family members in India watching this conference. My special thanks to all of you who have come today to attend my last Analyst Conference, including our biggest investors from Norway.</p>
          <p>Yes, it is now 17 years I have spent with this wonderful group and I'm leaving E.ON at the end of June this year. I can assure you that I had the best time and I have seen and learned everything what a group like E.ON goes through. I am leaving for my family reasons. Sascha Bibert, who's sitting in the front, who has joined us from Munich Re at the beginning of this year, will then take over at my role as a Head of Investor Relations starting July 1.</p>
          <p>I would like to take the opportunity to personally thank all analysts, shareholders, and bankers for their trust, for their confidence, and, most importantly for me, the open and warm relationship we have developed over the years. I've certainly learned a lot from all of you.</p>
          <p>I've always tried my best to protect the interest of E.ON, but at the same time integrate your concerns and credits into the management feedback. And I hope in this respect I have not disappointed you. Certainly, I'd have loved to see this best stock price performance in nominal and real terms before I leave, but that's life.</p>
          <p>My biggest thanks go to the entire Board of Management who has supported my team and me all these years. Yes, I'm proud to say that I'm associated with the management who is absolutely dedicated to the shareholder value concept and takes seriously the concerns of the capital market. In this respect, I would like to thank especially, Ulrich Hartmann, who hired me 17 years ago and Wulf Bernotat, who was giving me the great support in my role.</p>
          <p>I would also like to thank all my colleagues throughout the Group and in this room for their support, and last but not least, my competent IR team who has always stayed by my side during all these years. If you ask me what am I going to miss the most, honestly the most I'm going to miss is drinking those extra dirty martinis with Wulf Bernotat on the road show in the evening.</p>
          <p>Thanks again for everything, and now back to work, but before I hand over to Wulf and Marcus for the presentations, I would request you to turn off your Blackberries and mobile phones and please since I know all of you almost but please insert your card you got in, so I know who is sitting where.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I hand it over to Wulf for his presentation. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. After a little very personal farewell speech back to the business and so I would like to welcome you to the Analyst and Investor Conference for '08 full year results. On February 10 this year we already communicated to you some preliminary figures for the '08 annual results and let me therefore briefly pass through the main financials for '08.</p>
          <p>We can look back at a strong operational performance last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 8% year-on -year to &#x20AC;13.4 billion, adjusted EBIT increased by 7% to &#x20AC;9.9 billion, and adjusted net income reached &#x20AC;5.6 billion, up 9%. However, as a consequence of the impairments that we have already announced as well as other non-operating items, net income attributable to shareholders declined from 7.2 to &#x20AC;1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>The Supervisory Board proposes to pay out a dividend of &#x20AC;1.50 per share. At 51%, the proposed dividend payout is in line with our objective of distributing 50 to 60% of adjusted net income. With an increase of 9% compared to last year, our shareholders will be able to share with the Company's success.</p>
          <p>Finally, the acquisition of Viesgo and selected Endesa assets propelled E.ON economic investments to an all-time high of &#x20AC;26 billion. Economic net debt thus increased from 23 to &#x20AC;45 billion, close to our targeted financial structure.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now discuss our strategy for the coming years. During '07 and '08, E.ON has successfully positioned itself on the European scale like no other competitor. In parallel, the Group has accelerated organic investments to renew and grow its power generation portfolio, acquire a global scale in renewables, and strengthen its gas business. However, over the last six months, we have witnessed deep upheaval in the international financial and capital markets.</p>
          <p>At an unprecedented pace, the entire economy has fallen into a recession, which appears to be spreading wider, going deeper, and lasting longer than most had anticipated. Although E.ON remains probably more shielded than many other companies, the economic crisis will not leave us unaffected.</p>
          <p>Four developments in particular are affecting our business prospects. First, the collapse of oil prices and of all other energy prices; second, the devaluation of currencies in a number of countries where we operate; third, the unusual contraction of power and gas demand; and finally, the widening of credit spreads following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we now expect 2009 adjusted EBIT to match the level of 2008 and we have to acknowledge that it will not be feasible to achieve the 2010 adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;12.4 billion before portfolio measures that we had committed to in May 2007. We now expect to achieve a 2010 adjusted EBIT of &#x20AC;11 billion before portfolio measures.</p>
          <p>And Marcus Schenck provides you with a more detailed explanation in a moment. Clearly, most of the changes to our 2009 outlook and 2010 target are due to external factors of which we have no control. But we are not standing still. We are going to tackle the crisis head-on by focusing our strategy on the following three axes.</p>
          <p>First, we want to improve the operational performance by our own efforts. Second, we want to further focus our business model and streamline our portfolio. And finally, we want to concentrate on organic investments and prioritize them more stringently.</p>
          <p>Let me start with our first strategic priority, improving operational performance. We have already informed you on the key elements when we presented you the Perform-to-Win initiative one month ago. Perform-to-Win will address the entire value chain and all functions within the Group. The steering team has already identified more than 100 potential performance improvement measures. Although many specific projects are still in the validation phase, we expect that Perform-to-Win will help to improve adjusted EBIT by up to &#x20AC;1.5 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>The improvement of performance will be somewhat back-end loaded. Cost savings would contribute about &#x20AC;1.1 billion out of the 1.5 total while the other 400 million would be generated by a better utilization of our assets. In addition to improving adjusted EBIT, Perform-to-Win also aims to enhance and accelerate decision-making by streamlining decision structures, clarifying responsibilities, and simplifying lines of reporting.</p>
          <p>Over the last years, E.ON has gained in size and we firmly believe that this will support value creation in the future, but our vision of making E.ON the leading power and gas company is not only about size, it is also about quality. With Perform-to-Win, we want E.ON to move to the top of the rankings in operational excellence.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, let me now move to our second priority, portfolio streamlining. In less than 12 months, we have doubled the number of market units from five to 10. Most market units count several business units, which in some cases comprises a number of activities.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt that E.ON has become a complex group. To some extent, we can try to simplify what is existing, but we have come to the conclusion that we need to focus on fewer activities and that we must run harder those we decide to stay in, and that is what the portfolio review is all about.</p>
          <p>In practice, we are testing each business and each asset for its strategic fit on the one hand and for its financial performance and prospects on the other hand. The portfolio review has already yielded substantial results.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2008, we completed the asset swap with Statkraft, which provides us with full control over E.ON Sweden. We've signed agreements with Electrabel and EnBW to swap 1.7 gigawatt and seek 0.5 gigawatt of generation capacity in Germany.</p>
          <p>We are currently negotiating the swap of 2.9% of our Gazprom stake for 20% minus one share in the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field in Siberia. We are preparing the disposal of the power transmission network in Germany and we are looking at the possibility of a disposal Th&#xFC;ga.</p>
          <p>For several of these steps, we succeeded to combine portfolio streamlining with other strategic objectives. The asset swap with Electrabel, for example, helps us to fulfill the compromise with the EU Commission while allowing us to extend our presence in generation outside Germany. Another example is the Gazprom-Yuzhno Russkoye asset swap, which would bring us close to our target of producing 10 bcm of equity gas per year.</p>
          <p>Our short-term priority regarding the portfolio review is to execute on the already announced transactions as most of them are still pending. I'm thus not going to announce any specific new steps today. Nevertheless, rest assured that the portfolio review is gathering strength. All in all, our goal is to achieve more than &#x20AC;10 billion of cash-effective divestments by the end of 2010, capital market conditions permitting. This includes those disposals that we have already announced plus a number of options that we are currently evaluating but which are not yet ready to communicate on.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to E.ON's third strategic axis, prioritize our investments. Last year, we invested &#x20AC;26 billion. Thereof, &#x20AC;11.5 billion was spent on the acquisition of the Viesgo and selected Endesa assets and &#x20AC;4.4 billion on the cash neutral Statkraft asset swap. The other &#x20AC;10 billion were mainly invested in our priority areas for organic growth, conventional power generation, renewables, and the gas business.</p>
          <p>We planned initially to invest &#x20AC;36 billion over the period 2009 to 2011 in line with the run rate of the previous investment plan for this period. However, we have decided to limit investment for the period '09 through 2011 to &#x20AC;30 billion or approximately &#x20AC;10 billion per year. Obviously, due to the economic downturn, it makes sense to postpone or cancel some investments. Furthermore, even at &#x20AC;30 billion the overall level of investments remains high and we want to keep our financing in balance.</p>
          <p>We have rechecked the value creation potential of a sample of our investment projects. In power generation, for example, most projects that are currently under construction were ordered when component prices were at attractive levels. This stress-testing exercise indicated that even in a more stressful environment, these investments fulfill all our financial criteria. We are thus confident that the investments that are fully committed to, and especially the 18 power plants under construction, will create value for shareholders.</p>
          <p>The six billion reduction of our investments for the period '09 to 2011 will thus mostly apply to projects for which we have easy options to postpone or cancel. Before taking firm decisions, we will carry out a thorough re-assessment of each project and establish a stringent privatization among all the potential investments. This should ensure that the projects with the highest value creation potential come on top of the list.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, before handing over to Marcus Schenck, I would like to say a few words about our dividend policy. Our dividend policy remains unchanged: we want to payout between 50 and 60% of adjusted net income as dividends. However, as we do not expect to achieve &#x20AC;12.4 billion of adjusted EBIT in 2010, we cannot confirm our previous expectation of growing the dividend by 10% or 10 to 20% even per year on average between '06 and 2010.</p>
          <p>It is also likely that we will postpone the completion of our share buyback program for much longer that we initially anticipated. Nevertheless, we believe that in these difficult times, our dividends will remain attractive compared to many companies and sectors and will allow our shareholders to share in our success.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Marcus Schenck, who will discuss our 2008 results in more detail and present our outlook for 2009 and 2010. So, Marcus, over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, good afternoon also from my side. I will first walk you through the 2008 results and then subsequently comment on '09 and 2010. Highlights for 2008, earnings figures are essentially up as planned, adjusted EBIT and adjusted net income. Operating cash flow is down, as I will explain to you later, primarily caused by working capital changes. And then three, with 26 billion of economic investments, we've seen the peak investment year, which was also then the main driver behind the increase in leverage.</p>
          <p>As announced earlier, in February of this year, adjusted EBIT is up 7% in line with our guidance last March. The year-on-year comparison -- and this is the last time I'm going to say that -- is as you know not exactly meaningful given that the parameter of the market units in 2007 was slightly different to that of 2008. From Q1 of this year onwards that situation will be different, i.e., then you can compare the units.</p>
          <p>Before I dive into each and every market unit, just one overall comment. We've seen in 2008, a -- quite a hit resulting from the changes in currencies, British pounds, Swedish krona -- I'm pretty sure many of you that at least those who've made their way from the U.K., know what I'm talking about -- that has cost us some 220 million in 2008 compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>I will come back to that theme when I talk about 2009 and 2010, because people should not forget when we talk about 2008, at least as far as the P&amp;L is concerned, we are looking at primarily average rates over the year. And some of the currencies I've been talking about, Swedish krona, British pounds, they've seen the biggest hits at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Let's now go into the different market units. Central Europe first. As we indicated in the context of our Q3 results, Central Europe had, on a quarter-on-quarter comparison, some negative effects. In particular, we had a temporary outage of the power plant -- nuclear power plant Unteveza and in particular, in Q4 of 2007, we had a significant release in nuclear pension provisions, which was obviously not repeated in Q4 of 2008. But you should just bear that in mind when you compare this unit on a quarter-on-quarter basis.</p>
          <p>Looking at the full year, what are the main effects? Central Europe West, the non-regulated part, we have 1.2 billion power price effect that is roughly equivalent to an increase by &#x20AC;10 per megawatt hour. Against that 700 million charge in fuel costs -- increased fuel costs. We have about 160 million negative development compared to 2007 as a consequence of volume losses, in particular related to Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel, and as I mentioned also with regard to Unteveza.</p>
          <p>That was partially offset by slightly higher volumes, about 1.1 terawatt hours in Benelux. We had, when you look at the full year, seen net &#x2013; a higher release in provision on the nuclear sites, about 350 million, which then when you compare this year-on-year 2008 means was that 50 million lower than 2007 because of that effect. And then we have about -- just to give you an indication, 160 million, that is essentially transferred to other market units, primarily E.ON Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>Central Europe West, the regulated piece, we have seen a roughly 240 million cut in tariffs compared to the year before, and that is essentially being offset by the fact that in 2007 we had one-time &#x2013; one-off provisions for investments or &#x2013; for investments essentially into our grid business, with an overall volume of 300 million. Hence, West regulated was slightly up.</p>
          <p>And then as far as our Eastern European business is concerned, here the main effect is a price increase and more favorable regulatory conditions in the year 2008 in Hungary. In addition to that, we have an effect of roughly plus 100 million of the first-time consolidation of the French SNET business.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Pan-European Gas, here I would dare to say that we may likely see kind of a peak EBIT year in 2008, certainly when we sort of look at the next two years ahead. What are the main drivers? One key driver is the upstream business, which in total made 340 million of EBIT in 2008. That is roughly 250 million more than the year before; 100 million of that is price effect and 150 million is a volume effect.</p>
          <p>Our Midstream business, here we have seen higher income in the transportation business, around &#x20AC;140 million, and a higher result from our storage valuations, approximately &#x20AC;190 million. Negative effects in that business are essentially margin related, which is a drop in margin by about &#x20AC;130 million and a slightly lower volume of &#x20AC;90 million.</p>
          <p>In the downstream business, that is down compared to the year before. Here, the two main effects are, one is in our Hungarian business, F&#xF6;ldg&#xE1;z, where essentially the allowed price increases that are &#x2013; or the price increases allowed by the regulator have not been -- have essentially not been sufficient, and we have in particular suffered from the very weak forints in the Hungarian business, total effect about &#x20AC;150 million.</p>
          <p>And a last point, we had in 2007 extraordinary gains in the Th&#xFC;ga business as a consequence of a number of disposals in that business, and we had a one-time effect from tax reforms. Again, that positive effect in 2007 was not repeated in 2008; that's also in total 150 million.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the U.K., here actually the primary driver for the delta in EBIT contribution is currency. That has cost us 90 million in the non-regulated business and 70 million in the regulated business. In addition, in the non-regulated business, the retail business was weaker, where essentially we have been suffering from higher procurement costs compared to the year before. That was -- we started to reverse that a bit in Q4 of 2008, but when you do a full year-on-year comparison, we are still down.</p>
          <p>To be fair to the U.K. and the operating performance in pounds, in local currency, and corrected for those activities that have been pushed to E.ON Energy Trading, Climate &amp; Renewables, and some part of the storage business to Ruhrgas, they are actually roughly at last year's level, again in local currency.</p>
          <p>Nordic, the regulated business is flat, and in the non-regulated business we see an increase, 170 million, it's essentially driven by higher transfer prices to Energy Trading, roughly the equivalent of &#x20AC;6. And we have a drop in volume; they were down about two terawatt hours that cost us 70 million and then higher taxes on the hydro and nuclear sites of 50 million are the negative effects in that business.</p>
          <p>U.S. Midwest, essentially on the same level as the year before. The dollar has cost us in euro terms roughly 30 million. Also industrial volumes were down. Here we have actually already seen the first impact from the economic crisis in what we call our retail business in the U.S., but it's mainly industrial customers; that's 20 million. Those negative 50 million are being offset by higher recovery from -- on our fuel and gas cost and the return on the investments into &#x2013; let's call it the environmental CapEx that we have spent in the U.S. that's roughly &#x20AC;25 million.</p>
          <p>Energy Trading, here our asset optimization part shows a result of &#x20AC;466 million and the prop trading is at almost &#x20AC;180 million. In the asset optimization, obviously we have -- one of the key factors that &#x2013; in particular in the Nordic business, we have in the end realized better prices than before. And in the proprietary trading business, I think we clearly, like probably many others, benefited from the high volatility in the markets. We've achieved this strong result without ever coming close to the limits that we set for that business, the risk limits.</p>
          <p>Let me now come to the new markets. The contribution is in total at a level of &#x20AC;90 million on the EBIT level. It looks little bit more pretty when you look at EBITDA. Let me go through the four market's units separately. 60 million we're roughly up in Climate &amp; Renewables, essentially due to the fact that the asset base that is produced in earnings is bigger.</p>
          <p>In Italy, we have a situation where our &#x2013; we have for the first time consolidated for half a year the Endesa Italia business but we have one big negative effect, which we've been commenting on also in the context of the Q3 results. We have in total a charge of &#x20AC;155 million resulting from the fact that we had to step up the freely allocated CO2 certificates in the context of our acquisition and had to take that as a charge through the P&amp;L. This is an effect which will not be repeated in 2009. Same holds true for Spain, where that effect is negative &#x20AC;70 million.</p>
          <p>In Russia we are showing an EBIT of &#x20AC;40 million. Here just to give you sort of some sense, a big negative item is the charge of roughly &#x20AC;100 million from purchase price allocation.</p>
          <p>Let me move on from the adjusted EBIT to the other P&amp;L numbers. Adjusted net interest expense is essentially up by about &#x20AC;900 million due to the higher indebtedness of the Group, which is a consequence of our investment activities.</p>
          <p>Net book gains are almost at the same level as they were in the year before albeit for different reasons. The primary driver this year is that the transaction with Statkraft has created a roughly 1.1 billion book gain in our results. Last year, the two main effects that we were showing were on the one hand book gains from the sale of securities and then secondly, book gain on the disposal of our telecom business <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Restructuring cost, here we see an increase of roughly &#x20AC;450 million. Main effects here are a charge of roughly &#x20AC;250 million in the context of the restructuring of our regional utility businesses in Germany as well as roughly 100 million charge in the context of bundling of our trading activities. This is essentially all project cost.</p>
          <p>The goodwill, I will not at this stage go into more details. I hope we explained that sufficiently a few weeks ago. Here the total charge of &#x20AC;3.3 billion, just to recap, 1.5 billion for our US Midwest business and &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the context of the goodwill &#x2013; the preliminary goodwill for the assets we have acquired from Endesa, Enel, and Acciona.</p>
          <p>The other non-operating results is &#x2013; here we see a significant change in our numbers. It's essentially two effects that are driving this. On the one hand, we have an impairment on securities we are holding on our balance sheets to back nuclear provisions and partially also pension obligations. That's a total charge of roughly &#x20AC;700 million.</p>
          <p>And then we have a very large effect from the mark-to-market valuation of derivatives where we see a delta of roughly &#x20AC;2.7 billion compared to prior year. The main drivers there is the development of coal and the other one is development in gas prices.</p>
          <p>Those effects together leads to a significant drop in reported net income. Again, the two main effects that explain the delta to prior year is on the one hand, impairments, and secondly, the mark-to-markets or the developments in the mark-to-market valuation of derivatives.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the more relevant figure, adjusted net income. I think you're familiar with the logic in terms of the items that we correct for. Adjusted net income is up 9% compared to prior year. This is mainly driven by the fact that obviously EBIT is up, net result is down, and then in addition, the effective tax rates that is embedded in our adjusted net income is down compared to prior year. That's why all-in-all, we're up 9%.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to cash flow. Group cash flow is down roughly &#x20AC;2 billion to now 6.7 billion. I must admit, I don't find it terribly instructive to walk you through this on a market unit basis given there are a number of things that essentially result from the fact that there is a lot of interaction between the market units in particular E.ON Energy Trading and hence I will do this from a Group perspective on the next chart. Maintenance CapEx, just to highlight that, is now at a level what was in 2008, at a level of roughly &#x20AC;1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>This one here tries to reconcile the developments in operating cash flow looking at a from a Group perspective and we are -- essentially there is obviously 100 smaller effects that one could also mention, but I would like you to focus on sort of the key components.</p>
          <p>On the positive sides, when we start with 2007 number, we're obviously up given the price effects in our generation business in particular as it relates to the outright power positions in Central Europe and Nordic. We have, on the other hand, seen lower volumes in the acquisition given the outages of some of the nuclear power plants in particular Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel. We've seen, I mentioned that before, lower network fees in particular in Germany.</p>
          <p>And now, the next three items are, I would say the key drivers and they're all working capital related. Pan-European Gas, here we have a situation where 2007 we started with a high volume of gas stored and we've taken that down until the end of 2007 quite substantially. In 2008, we consequently started with a storage volume that was lower than it was at the beginning of 2007 and it has been roughly stable until the end of 2008. Meaning by end of 2008, we have almost the same storage volume or same volume stored as we had at the end of 2007. However, the difference being that in 2007, we had clearly benefited from the fact that we had started with a higher volume, i.e., 2007 saw a -- compared to 2008, higher cash flow from divesting working capital and we have not repeated that in 2008. That's the first effect.</p>
          <p>Second, in the U.K., we are seeing an increase in receivables in the retail business. This is almost exclusively price driven or -- this is exclusively price driven. Price levels were up hence the overall receivable volume is also up. The payment terms have not deteriorated. On the contrary we managed to slightly improve them.</p>
          <p>And then the third item is another 800 million negative cash outflow, which is a function of us having throughout the year 2008 acquired a number of CO2 certificates, which will be used in the coming years. What we've done there is, we have -- instead of essentially buying derivatives to hedge our position, we bought the certificates, more liquid market. We thought that all in all it was the smarter way to do it.</p>
          <p>What it means is, however, it means that 2008 suffers from cash outflow for that but that will be reversed in the coming years because then we will not have to pay those CO2 certificates, which essentially we simply acquired to hedge our position in selling power. So that effect, those 800 million will reverse in the years, in particular '09 and '10. And then there is a number of smaller other effects.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on investments. Cash-effective investments are at a level of &#x20AC;18.4 billion. Main effect is obviously the acquisition of Endesa Europe and Viesgo but also very prominently our organic investments. We've acquired some debts in the context of the Endesa, Viesgo transaction and we also include as a part of our definition of economic investments the asset swap with Statkraft, which is the second to last line here in the table.</p>
          <p>How has that impacted our economic net debt? We start with a level of &#x20AC;23.4 billion at the beginning of the year and then -- I mean, you can do the math in a way yourself the three things that take it down is economic investments leaving out the asset swap because that was not cash-effective, -- the dividend payments, and the share buyback and then -- that is partially being offset in particular by cash provided from the operating activities.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, the debt factor is up from a level of 1.9 to now 3.2. Just to highlight that 3.2 is -- assumes that we have -- and I think that's the correct way of doing it -- we have pro forma adjusted for full year ownership of the Endesa, Viesgo assets. It's not a very big impact but technically something you should be aware of.</p>
          <p>So that much to the 2008 results. Just quickly and given that Wulf has essentially commented on this &#x2013; this one just shows you the proposed dividend and the development looking at prior years. I will not repeat what Wulf has been saying.</p>
          <p>So let me come to the outlook for 2009 and then subsequently 2010. And I know this is obviously today probably the hottest debated topic. We will try to be as transparent as we can. We avoided applying an approach where we say, "Well, you know, if the world gets better, then things will look more pretty." I think that's clear that that would then happen. We are looking at the world as it presents itself right now. There are certain forward prices you can see and we are also seeing developments in the operational business, which I will comment on. And that's what we are trying to reflect in our comments on 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>We clearly have to recognize that there are more uncertainties than what we have seen the years before. I dare to say that no one here in this room or on the phone will come up with a firm view on when the economic crisis ends, and that uncertainty simply will -- you will see -- will be reflected in our numbers.</p>
          <p>At Group level, we expect adjusted EBIT to be at the 2008 level. Adjusted net income, expect to be around 10% below 2008. And I know, it has been asked for how can that be, why is that happening? With EBIT being more or less flat, our net interest result will deteriorate and just to give you some of the ingredients for that, when you look at the end of last year, you have roughly gross debt of say &#x20AC;40 billion. I think we have highlighted through the markets that we tend to pay some 5.2 to 5.4% on our debt position.</p>
          <p>We have, on the other hand, roughly 10 billion of cash or similar assets and there we earn in these environments probably more something like 2.5, 3,3.5%, and then you should also factor into this 50 billion of nuclear provisions and that portion in our pension service -- in pension obligations that is not funded where the charge is roughly 6%. If you factored all those numbers together, you -- I think that should give you some indication. Tax rate, we see roughly at the level of 25 to 27% going forward.</p>
          <p>Let me now go into the different market units and you will remember we didn't do that last year. This year given you will be able to compare it on a like-for-like basis, we'd like to give some indications and also highlight what we see to be the main effect.</p>
          <p>Central Europe, we expect to be up compared to 2008. Main effects we see here higher achieved wholesale prices in the order of magnitude of roughly of 4 to &#x20AC;5 per megawatt hour. We, at this stage, assume that Kr&#xFC;mmel the nuclear plant will be available for the second half of 2008. We'll have to see whether that in the end materializes or not. As you know we are not the operator of that plant, but we'll have to make some assumptions.</p>
          <p>We clearly see in our Central European business potential first impacts from the economic crisis, and here that can be in particular lower volumes and they're specifically not in the -- with household customers but with industrial customers, smaller medium term -- small and medium enterprises, which -- some of them may go out of business, some of them may have a contract where a certain volume is fixed but maybe not 100% and hence we think we run the risk of losing some volumes in that business.</p>
          <p>And then finally we also see in Central Europe a risk that the cost increases that we see in our German grids, in particular for network losses and having to buy balancing power that those will not be allowed to immediately pass on with tariffs in this year but potentially only with a time delay. This is still under discussion with the regulator, but that clearly is a risk that we see.</p>
          <p>Pan-European Gas, we expect to be down compared to 2008, I highlighted that we think 2008 was a peak year. In particular, the gas upstream business, where we're not hedged, is essentially following &#x2013; or is breathing with the oil price. We see it roughly break-even at today's oil prices.</p>
          <p>We also expect to see a hit compared to 2008 and we've been saying that almost exactly a year ago in this very same room in our gas transportation business from moving to cost plus regulation. We don't yet have sort of the final results from the discussion with the regulator but those will be effective then for this year. That will likely partially be offset with consolidation of EBIT from Yuzhno Russkoye in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>U.K., we expect to be down, I highlighted that earlier, it's in particular the pound that's driving that change.</p>
          <p>Nordic, here is also a currency effect that will cause, in our prognosis, that business to come down. We also clearly have less EBIT consolidated in our numbers because of having given roughly a third of the hydro capacity to Statkraft, so that's no longer -- that earnings contribution is no longer consolidated within our Group. And that will partially be offset by higher achieved power prices.</p>
          <p>U.S. Midwest, stable despite economic downturn. And new markets we expect to be up. In Spain and Italy, clearly we will no longer see this roughly 220 million negative effect from CO2 cost, which we saw in 2008 and we will now consolidate those businesses for the full-year.</p>
          <p>We expect also see a higher contribution from our Climate &amp; Renewables business given that the asset base essentially continues to grow almost on a monthly basis. Russia, we think it's going to move primarily sideways in particular given the slowdown in the Russian economy, weaker industrial demand, and in particular also here we see effects from currency movement, i.e., the weak Rubel valuation.</p>
          <p>This is in a way looks at almost the same effects, but with a different cut, so I will try to be a little bit quicker here. From a Group perspective, just the highlights. The two main effects that will drive results up is outright power. You see here, gives you some indication what the key data are and is the impact from new markets. And the things that will be driving it down is regulation; gas transport; risk also in the German power grids with a delay in the cost pass-through; currency effects, which is going to be a three digit million number; first effects from the economic crisis, which is primarily our expectation that volumes with industrial customers may come down but maybe also over time things like bad debt that you run into may go up. And then lastly here on that page the gas upstream business where in 2008 we had a very nice result.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the favorite topic of 2010 where we went through a period of many months where we've been bullied to raise that guidance that we put out and we've always been saying, we don't know where commodity prices will be and hence we are not going to adjust that target. We clearly now see that commodity prices are at a very different level, but sort of in the other direction compared to what we have seen for many months in the past two-and-a-half years.</p>
          <p>I will try to sort of come to the 2010 guidance from two angles. On the one hand, explain the main deltas compared to the original 12.4 target, and on the other hand, try to kind of build it starting from our prognosis for 2009. The second one, I'll do on the next page.</p>
          <p>We always acknowledged that there is upsides in the 12.4 billion target as a result of where commodity prices have been going during the past two years and given our hedging activities, we managed to capture quite some of that upside. To give you an indication, compared to the 2010 forwards that we were seeing back in May 2007, we achieved roughly eight to &#x20AC;10 more per megawatt hour than the forwards were back then.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, as far as our gas upstream position is concerned, the oil forward spec then were roughly in the level of $80. As you know, today we are more at around $60. All in all, we think there is an upside of roughly 600 million from that commodity position and these are round numbers.</p>
          <p>We clearly see a downside from what we put under the heading economic crisis. It is essentially a drop in demand from industrial customers and it's also downside from the increase in bad debt. We think it may take some time until we will really see first insolvencies amongst our customer base, nothing we want to see, but I think we can't ignore that that may happen. Now, obviously if we see a sudden return &#x2013; quick return in the economies at the end of 2009 that situation may look different. But right now, I think we don't have visibility of 2010 really being a year that will be significantly better in the overall economy compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Third effect, stricter regulation, we've been commenting on that in the context of many occasions. Here it's mainly gas transport and then some of the effects that I have been highlighting before as far as the German grid businesses are concerned. This can be at around 0.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Currency effects, this looks like a very big number and I must say, I'm always surprised when I see it, but indeed these translation effects do matter and make quite a difference. It's roughly 0.5 billion. Now, I can't project where currencies will be next year, but when you sort of take the levels that you see today for 2010, that's roughly the delta you have compared to where they were back in May 2007.</p>
          <p>And then clearly also the new markets are below the expectations that we had put forward back then. This is in total a delta of roughly 600 million down; 300 million is a function of us not having acquired the nuclear drawing contracts in Spain, and also a consequence of the fact that we will, in 2010, will have to seen us a real separation of the Italian business, so that some assets really go to A2A and will not to be consolidated in our EBIT numbers.</p>
          <p>So those, I would say, are essentially a function of the fact that the parameter is different, but there is also probably roughly 300 million, which is a &#x2013; which is essentially a deterioration in the business conditions. It's a claw back in Spain and in Italy it's things like the must run regulation. So, in total, this takes us down to roughly 11 billion and just to highlight, you can read it at the bottom of the page, before any portfolio measures, I think that's the only comparison that does makes sense.</p>
          <p>Now, how do you get to that number when you start with the projection for 2009? Here, again the single largest effect is upside that we see from higher power prices, it's roughly 800 million. It's, to be precise, it's higher power prices and a better availability, in particular, of the nuclear plants, i.e., we assumed that the two power stations in Germany will be fully operational in 2010. The total effect you see here on the page, some data that hopefully allows you to reconcile this, of around 800 million.</p>
          <p>In the new markets compared to 2009, we see an upside of roughly 200 million. This is earnings coming through in the Climate &amp; Renewables business. And also in Russia, given the liberalization so far, is following perfectly the path that the Russian regulation or government has been foreseeing. We also expect to see better results also because in 2010 some of the increased capacity will kick in.</p>
          <p>And then, we on the other hand, see some potential negative effects from continued economic downturn in particular that's what we have experienced, we think there's going to be a time delay until you really see some of the industrial customers to go out of business and that effect may be higher in 2010 as compared to 2009. So much for the two years, '09 and '10. Wulf will then subsequently talk a bit about 2011.</p>
          <p>Let me come to my last point and that is commenting on the financial position of the Group. The funding needs for 2007 until 2010, we announced that earlier and that's -- basically the number you should work of, was around 30 billion. Since we started our funding program back in September 2007, we have collected almost &#x20AC;25 billion in the bond markets. That leaves an open position of roughly 5 billion and here be it commercial paper, be it additional bond transactions, or just looking at the cash position of the Company, we feel comfortable that we can cope with that remaining position.</p>
          <p>For 2009, for our net financing needs, we're basically covered with the roughly 5.4 billion of bonds that we issued year-to-date. As a consequence of that, I'm sure you will have seen that we had also made an offer to earlier redeem the May 2009 bonds, where 36% of the bondholders had accepted that offer.</p>
          <p>The strategy we are pursuing on the financing side is clearly targeting a position where we go into the different currencies, markets, and where we, in particular, also make sure that from a maturity profile we look at a situation where going forward we will in no year really face a major refinancing challenge.</p>
          <p>And you can see that on the next chart where you see that the refinancing of existing obligations in the coming years is always going to be at around 1 to &#x20AC;3 billion, a level we feel very comfortable with. I think the last 18 months gave the market -- gave us evidence that our Company is very well received in the debt markets. We were nominated or elected Corporate Issuer of the Year in 2008 and some of the transactions that we did I think were really also breaking partially the ice in certain time periods during the last year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, our debt factor, we are in target zone with now a level of 3.2 by year-end. We continue to be committed to an Aa2 rating, and we will follow our finance strategy that we had announced back in May 2007, namely, whenever we are significantly below that three times leverage, we will either invest or if we don't see meaningful alternatives for that, redistribute cash to the shareholders. Conversely, if we are significantly above that level, we will reduce investment activity, divest to bring it down into the target zone.</p>
          <p>So, those are my comments on 2008 and the outlook. And I would now again hand over to Wulf.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Marcus has indeed talked about '09 and '10, but of course the E.ON story continues and therefore let me provide you with some insights on the perspectives for 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>And we believe that the current economic crisis will not fundamentally change the dynamics of our industry. We therefore remain optimistic about E.ON's medium and long-term prospects.</p>
          <p>In power generation, replacement requirements play a much larger role than demand growth in the balance between supply and demand. The current economic crisis does not change anything to the fact that most of the existing U.K. nuclear fleet will shut down by 2020, for example.</p>
          <p>The Large Combustion Plant Directive will also remove coal-fired units in many countries, and the growth of renewables will have to be backed by flexible capacity. The current weakness of demand will therefore have only a limited and temporary effect on the equilibrium of the markets.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are likely to see the postponement or the cancellation of many new-build projects. We therefore expect power prices and margins to recover during the next decade. We currently have 18 conventional plants under construction. Many will come into service in 2010 and '11 and contribute to earnings growth afterwards.</p>
          <p>The recent dispute between Russia and Ukraine has also underlined the strength of our strategy of diversified supplies backed by a solid infrastructure. In the gas business, the development of gas upstream and storage business will provide most of the earnings growth after 2010 and of course the renewable also remains a growth story. The sector might benefit from additional public support as part of so called 'green deals.'</p>
          <p>E.ON is rolling out its strategy of driving renewables to industrial levels. We have multiplied our renewable capacity by five in less than 18 months. We are adding about 1 gigawatt of renewable capacity per year and have thus joined the very selected 'Gigawatt Club.' As a result, we expect to reach our own 4 gigawatts of renewable capacity in 2010 and about 10 gigawatt in 2015.</p>
          <p>The earnings contribution of our market unit Climate &amp; Renewables will grow rapidly in line with its asset base. Our new markets, especially Russia, should also see strong earnings growth after 2010. The liberalization of the Russian market is scheduled to complete in 2011.</p>
          <p>Power prices and spreads should progressively converge to market levels. In addition, the four power plants that will be commissioned there between 2010 and 2012 will add substantial earnings. The extensive commissioning of new power plants, the development for our gas business, the growth of renewables, and the new markets form a substantial number of growth drivers for 2011 adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we will also see the completion of our Perform-to-Win initiative. The question remains what will be the impact of commodity prices as the current 2011 power forwards are trading at lower levels than 2010 hedged power prices.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen let me conclude. The last few months have an extremely rapid turnaround of economic fortunes. In all likelihood, 2009 and 2010 will be dominated by the economic crisis. To some extent we had to adjust our strategy and expectations.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, E.ON broad geographic presence, diversified asset base, and solid finances provide as trump cards to overcome the crisis successfully. Furthermore, by improving our operational performance, streamlining our portfolio, and prioritizing our investments, we are laying solid foundations for E.ON's future growth.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentations and I'm sure that you're now very interested and eager to ask questions and we all here at the Board will answer your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Wulf; thank you, Marcus. And those who would like to ask questions please press the button so I can see that. And second, as usual, we would like you to request two question per participant and you can always come back. Thanks. First question?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, it's Martin Young from Nomura, I have two questions. The first is, over the past fortnight, we've seen three of the major companies in the European utility space offer us their view on the world, clearly yours is the most conservative of that. To what extend do you feel that the guidance you've issued today is incredibly prudent and what sensitivities do you see around that.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it's great that you've reconciled the previous 2010 target to the new 2010 target, but you don't seem to have given too much granularity at a divisional level. Perhaps you could talk a little bit more about your 2010 expectations at a divisional level particularly with reference to the new market units, which do appear to be causing part of the shortfall relative to where you stood previously. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me first try to answer your second question by in a way not answering it. We're not in a position to do this on a divisional level. I mean quite frankly there are so many little effects going on, I think we've highlighted where we see the big effects with pointing out that the upside is in the outright power position that is essentially Nordic and Central Europe. I think we spelled out where we see the difference in new markets, it's specifically mentioned on that page what the effect is and we were also commenting on where we see the effects in the regulated businesses and there it's primarily Pan-European Gas with gas transportation and the German grid businesses, that's Central Europe. The volume effects -what we put under the heading economic crisis assume, you see that in basically all our market units, it's probably a little bit more prominent say in &#x2013; right now in some of the Eastern European markets where we may face the situation that our hope that certain things can be pushed through with support from the regulator quickly may, given health of the economy and some of the markets, may actually not happen so quickly. And, for example, thinking F&#xF6;ldg&#xE1;z where we are sort of accruing a receivable, which in the end may not be paid to us so quickly depending on the overall economic situation.</p>
          <p>As far as your first part is concerned, us being more conservative than others, I don't think we should comment on others. What we've been trying here is trying to look at the world in particular for the next two years, i.e. 2009 and 2009, the way it right now looks to us &#x2013; yes, of course, if 2010 sees a more quick recovery, then maybe some of the effects we are seeing in terms of losses to &#x2013; on the volume side with industrial customers, maybe some of the currencies will then recover. But it's a lot of maybe. I think we can just take the numbers as the markets currently see it in terms of forward rates and take that as a proxy. Of course, if we say, look, if the power price is at a certain level then &#x2013; which is higher than today, then, yes, and we have an open position and, yes, the world will look better. But whether that will and when that will happen, we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add one thing. I think the visibility is not there, quite frankly, as far as the &#x2013; let's say development going forward is concerned in our main markets. And I attended a meeting at the German Industry Association yesterday and we went through all those sectors. We had two economists there giving us their view and the short answer is nobody knows, really, seriously. But, yes, I think it's more prudent to apply some caution rather than to be too optimistic and there are a number of scenarios, which were also presented yesterday. And as I said, the sectors, which were presented were totally different from -- almost unaffected to very, very deep declines, especially in the steel industry, also in the automotive sector. So we don't know yet what the impact will be on the demand side and therefore I think we've applied some caution in our figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe to add an idea that when I read through some of the speculations of other companies, not knowing exactly what positions they have, is that if demand shrinks in a liberalized market, one has to understand, and I don't know how much of our competitors reflect that, but it's not just direct effect that you may lose some revenues and some EBIT on that, in a liberalized market, usually the retail operations are covered already for substantial part of such demand. And to cover that in earlier times, at different prices. If they have to resell it to the market then you have an indirect effect. And then as Marcus said, there can be an effect of bad debt. I think we were not deeply depressed or anything, but we felt like we should be realistic, we shouldn't speculate about when the oil price recovers to 90 on our business upstream, we just try to be very realistic and said let's assume for the next two years this year and next year the world is as it looks like. If it changes to the better, it changes, but what does it help anybody to speculate about an early end of the recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon. I have a question regarding the figure you have put out to the market in terms of disposal program of 10 billion. What is the motivation to do so, especially in light of the maybe a question, which has to be covered is that what could be the assets up for sale, what prices could you get there? So you are entering into a discussion, but you probably cannot answer at this point in time. So, what's the motivation here? Second question regarding the net debt to EBITDA level of 3.0 and you lowered your investment plans, which is helpful in terms of getting your net debt under control, which means it's positive to reach a 3.0 figure. Is that enough to stay in the realm of that figure of &#x2013; or do you desperately need disposals within the next two years to keep your debt under control? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me tackle the second one first. We will continue to invest quite substantially as you can tell from the numbers that Wulf has presented, up to 30 billion over a three-year period. We do indeed assume for the next two to three years a number of disposals, which will also then be needed to get the leverage to levels that we feel more comfortable with. I mean, right now I would say 3.2 is not exactly where we would like to be. It's within the range that is acceptable, but in times like this you prefer it to be maybe slightly south of three times. So, it is not, so we are trying to bring it back to that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to come back to your first question. I think it is -- it was intended to underscore our determination to continue with our portfolio review, which we have announced back in 2007. That is underway, we have identified a number of potential candidates. So, we are looking at others, which we cannot indeed disclose today, otherwise we would have done it. But it should really show our commitment to tackle such a program worth 10 billion and of course, we will not do any fire sales in that process, and we understand that the market conditions are not the best at the moment. So, we have to look at the timing of such transactions as well and the doability, but this was really meant to underscore our commitment.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Two questions. The first is, where you to pull the outlook out to 2011, what other drivers would you be seeing affecting '11 versus 2010? And the second question, where have you actually seen the demand weakness -- in all the regions that you're operating in, where have you seen to your business the greatest impact so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second one, you can see a demand decline in all markets I know. You see and these numbers are also probably accessible over time depending from country to country, from the national grid companies where you can see on year-on-year basis a decline of consumption. If you take that as a proxy and then translate it to the individual position then it depends on how big is your industrial position, how big is your retail position, and commercial, and probably, household. I would say for private households and small businesses, it's in the low single-digits in Italy, in Germany, and U.K., in Nordic. If you go to the industrialists I think as Wulf said, you have to go from segment to segment there, not from country to country. If you see automobile companies, steel companies you'll see declines of 20% or more. Others are more in the 10% range or lower. That's in the power side and in the gas side. I think the demand decline is somewhat covered this year by the cold winter. You have to look at numbers temperature corrected and then you would see probably a decline against that between households and others, but very small businesses and big businesses, but more on the 10% in the upper side and the lower single-digit in the lower side. But that covers again -- I wouldn't know any market that is shielded from that, including the new markets, Italy and Spain. You see same patterns and the difference is that we can see -- we follow early warning indications we call them and we follow hands on very closely what's going on. If you see differences, I wouldn't over-interpret them because they can also reflect differences in the portfolio and not really on the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll comment on 2011. Obviously, we are reluctant to put out a guidance for that year. I mean, comparing to other industries I would say that would almost feel absurd right now. But maybe one thing that one can say is when you look at 2010, and Wulf was highlighting here some of the effects, there are a number of things in 2011 where we would dare to say they should clearly be better than in 2010, things like from the new markets, we clearly expect a materially higher contribution in '11 compared to 2010. Climate &amp; renewables will continue to grow is asset base &#x2013; that it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to that conclusion. And in Russia, as long as you believe that the liberalization will happen, this plus the fact that in '11 we will also have more capacity that is well positioned in the merit order be available, that should also be quite significantly up compared to 2010. And Spain and Italy, I would say should be at least at the level where they are in 2010. So new markets should be clearly up in 11 compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>When you look at some of the other investments we are undertaking, I mean some generation capacity will be available, but also look at Ruhrgas just two points. And just looking at the situation as we have today, if I look at the -- it's a thin market, but if you look at so the forwards for '11 for oil, gas compared to the 2010, that looks a little bit more pretty. Now that can change, I will come to that. But that as such would already present an upside plus we will have Skarv-Idun starting to be producing in 2011. So that should also point north. We expect full impact of Perform-to-Win only in 2011 and as we have highlighted, this is kind of more back-end loaded. So this is, I would say, a high three digit million number coming from that end.</p>
          <p>The thing that is more difficult to quantify is what is going &#x2013; what's the value of our outright power position in that year. Now that's -- when you look at today's market prices, clearly is sort of -- is a downside compared to the prices we have locked in for 2010. Having said that, looking at the forward prices as they are today, the effect that I mentioned before would clearly outweigh that negative effect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. To continue on that topic, where do you see the decrease &#x2013; is it in more in gas or more electricity and everybody is talking about new electricity generation asset coming online. Where is the reserve margin currently? I have one very specific question on the bad debt. You are the second company to talk about bad debts increase, any way we should look at that, any historic, is there any specific market where we should look at it? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean on the point of bad debt I would say right now it's still early stages, it's sot of only early indicators, we've installed sort of an early warning system that -- with which we try to identify where things like bad debt are popping up. You have it partially in or you have it primarily obviously in all our retail businesses in the U.K., also in Germany with some of the SME customers. It's not yet really material levels, so right now I don't think we are sitting here and saying, "Hey, we have proved that this is significant," but I think this is something you need to in a way reserve for because the economic crisis is very likely going to bring this about. But right now I can't point to a history where we have sort of evidence, strong evidence for this.</p>
          <p>As far as reserve margins is concerned, I think here I would say people should not confuse that for the years '9, '10, and maybe also to some extent '1. Our industries will see some rougher times given that the overall economies aren't so great. The fundamentals is exactly that charge are totally unchanged, yes, and in that sense I think we're all really sitting here and saying, look the underlying business model, the underlying rationale, that it doesn't make sense to invest into power generation capacity. That indeed as the ones that were &#x2013; maybe less conservative in terms of their projections or maybe less specific on what exact years they were talking about. The underlying logic that over time we expect reserve margins to reach levels where either prices will go severely up or that will partially be mitigated by people having made investments that will come, that from our perspective is a given and that's a primary driver for why we still see the long-term value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would like to add one thing, and I said it also in my presentation, at the end in the conclusion, first the fundamentals have not change but they might get worse actually because we will some postponements or cancellations of power plant projects given the fact the carbon prices are low, as they are at the moment. So I think the situation will not get any better and the reserve margin is below 10%, so you see a problem popping up in a number of European markets certainly in the U.K., and in Germany and therefore as Marcus said, the fundamentals are in tact, they're bit sort of clouded by the economic downturn at the moment or maybe it gives us a bit more breathing space for this year, next year in terms of capacity and matching demand but in the longer term these fundamentals, as shown in this chart, are still very much the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And again, the markets we are invested in predominantly with our generation are not fundamentally over-supplied markets and the retirement curve as Wolf has pointed was very clear, and that will come, large combustion and things will come. And then you really have to look behind the scene where will the plants sit on the merit order and our new plants are very well position on the new merit order. So I think it's more the influence of oil and coal in the world markets of primary energy demand to drive the next one, two years somewhat down not fundamentally the capacity margin that we see or the capacity need that we see. So that work doesn't worry us too much from you know the bad debt. I think one has to bear in mind that from the nature of our business, we're always delivering approximately four to six weeks before we get the bill paid, that's the nature of this business or pretty much in all systems we are invested in even regulators force us to upfront energy for a good months and then you have the bidding time. What we do now is doing best practices by being very much on the topic and making sure that we are not going out longer, but some weeks is very hard to change. If we see industrial customers who is in danger, then we ask for upfront payment, but there is a &#x2013; in a lot of customers, smaller businesses it's almost impossible from a regulatory perspective to not be upfront at four of six weeks and then to make the math how much could that be I think is beyond anything I could at least do.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now before you take in the room, I'd like to go to the Internet for a question from Benjamin [Benjamin Leyre] from Exane BNP Paribas. Do you expect economy net of EBITDA below 3.3 times at the end of 2009? It appears like with your 10 billion in CapEx it could go above that level. Question, Marcus?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, partially also depend on the disposal efforts. In particular, when we look at the five gigawatt of German generation capacity that we will get out of during the year 2009, we'll have to see how much of that will in the end be sold for cash and how much will be swapped. Our plan of course is to not bring it at a level that is at 3.3 times.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question from him is what do you hear from S&amp;P and Moody's regarding their methodology to assist your rating? Are you aware of any willingness to change their methodology?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We or they? We -- no, we &#x2013; I mean, as you can imagine we are in close contacts with them, we have our regular review with them. We have no indications that they would change methodology. We've had a number of discussions with them so far since January.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then last question from him is what is the blocking agreement with Gazprom on the swap? Any possibility to change the swap terms or is that fixed for good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer is nothing. We are on track with that agreement. We reached the fundamental agreement back in October last year, which we signed on the 2nd October and since then we are negotiating the details and working out the contract details and &#x2013; that is on track and we are planning to have the agreement in place in this sort of by mid this year, early second half of this year.</p>

          <p>Now we go back to the room. Bobby Chada [Morgan Stanley].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had two questions. First of all, are you able to give average realized prices in your key business units as you have done before? And secondly, on the Perform-to-Win program, should we expect the full 2011 contribution to be sort of delivered on an annualized basis in 2011 or is there a run rate and that kind of slips into 2012? And you talked about slimming down the business, taking out layers of responsibility, improving decision-making, quickening things up, can you give any practical examples of what you're trying to do there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll do the last one first, so Marcus has a little time to look some numbers up. The slimming, for example, is in or the practical example could be generation. Right now, we have the generation organized in our regional market units. All of them or a lot of them have been coal fired and more than one has nuclear, almost all of them have some gas. And each of them does their own decision orders on how to do maintenance and how to run and optimize it. And there we have &#x2013; we're just validating all the idea that we more functionalize the whole steering. There will be one fleet center for all gas fired across the E.ON world, one fleet center for our nuclear across the E.ON world, one fleet center for hydro across the E.ON world. And these will have full competence down to running and budgeting and organizing their expertise plants and we think they will definitely instead of trying obviously to get 10 people together on the top level and then trying to reach the plant mangers and then trying to have the right priorities that should be much more efficient, much faster, much cheaper.</p>
          <p>Another one I would point out to is the organization of German sales. Right now, one segment of sales being organized in E.ON Ruhrgas and other segments are being organized from Munich from E.ON Energie and sometimes we found out even from customers that two E.ON organizations approached them, sometimes we found out that there are conflicting messages, sometimes we found out or we are aware that IT systems are doubled and so and so forth and those we will -- we intend to fully put together -- organize under one brand, one root, one steering, one IT system wherever possible. So, these are two examples where organizational changes will empower better market access, clearer penetration of markers, hopefully better margins, what ever they are in a market and significant lower cost and lower steering assets. There are a lots of those, but I think these two point in clear direction and as a significant changes of organization without turning the board upside down and without taking too much concentration away because the whole Group is restructuring. It's a very distinct efforts and they should be fast implemented and very clearly done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to add one thing. It's not just sort of looking at our structures and our steering models and of course it's also about performance improvement and one significant lever we see is availability of power plants, especially nuclear power plants in the Nordic where we see, let's say, a less impressive performance so far than compared or if compared with the performance of our German nuclear plants, which are in the top league in the world, actually, and just increasing availability there will give us substantial performance improvement stand.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Realized prices, Central Europe, and here I'm talking about the generation volume that Central Europe produces and at what price that is being sold at the, sort of at the E.ON &#x2013; from E.ON to the outside world. So, I'm not talking about internal transfer prices, okay. For the entire volume, Central Europe it is around &#x20AC;65 in 2008 that includes peak and pays and auxiliary services. Just to give you some indication for outright power, it is more than &#x20AC;10 below that, the base loads. Nordic &#x20AC;48 and the U.K. quite frankly, here the power price is not terribly meaningful because we're selling spreads minutes, sort of mid-70s, but it doesn't really tell you that much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Next question in line, I see Alberto Ponti from Citi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I personally welcome the new guidance you are giving because it's very realistic and pragmatic. So, if we agree that 2009 is going to be a tough year for &#x2013; in terms of earnings, my question is, are you prepared to boost the payout ratio towards the upper end of the range you have proposed so you keep the dividend in 2009 at least in line with that of this year's so &#x20AC;1.5 per share?</p>
          <p>My second question is, if you could give us an idea of how much is the impact of bad debt provisions you have included in the -- in your 2010 guidance.</p>
          <p>And the third question would be if you could remind me of how you intend, if you haven't made up your mind already, how you intend to disperse off transmission, is it going to be like an IPO or a trade sale or merger with other entities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the first one. I mean we confirmed our dividend policy and we confirmed the range and I think it's far too early really to make any statements and comments about next year because as we try to make clear in our presentation the visibility of this year and the developments into next year are so uncertain that it is not wise necessarily to make such comments now, let alone the fact that of course there is a process we have to observe which is, the Management Board is proposing a dividend to the Supervisory Board and Supervisory Board is proposing then the dividend or confirming to the AGM that is the process- so we can't speak on behalf or our Supervisory Board, but we can confirm our dividend policy. So, sorry that we can't be more specific on that one.</p>
          <p>And maybe I will pick up the last one, the TSO disposal. We have two years, as you know, for the disposal starting on the 1st of December last year. So we are in no pressure. The main aspect, which we have to look at is the position of the regulator in this respect and the clear framework from the regulator going forward for the TSO. That is actually a similar situation of <mark type="inaudible" /> at the moment with their divestment process. They also need clarity from the regulator because no investor is prepared to invest unless there is some form of clarity for the handling, and the, let's say, position the regulator is taking. We are getting closer to that decision, as we know from talks with the regulators. We need that clarity, and we hope that we get a basis on which then a formal process can start for a divestment, and that is a structured approach, and I don't -- at the moment really see an IPO as the, let's say, preferred route, but it is certainly possible, but probably not very likely. Marcus?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on your second question, in terms of assumed cost incurred from bad debts, I trust you are then referring to this delta of 0.5 billion debt we were highlighting compared to the 12.4 billion previous guidance that we put out. I must admit, it's actually very difficult to come up with a specific number because, depending on what scenarios do we -- that number can really materially change. But, to give you some indication, I would say that almost half of that 500 million, we think, can be bad debt cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, a couple of follow-up questions. I think the first one, you haven't answered Bobby's question about when the full impact of Perform-to-Win was going to come in, whether that was a run rate for the end of '11 or whether it was '12, or whatever.</p>
          <p>In terms of my questions, in terms of what you are assuming for Italy, Spain, and Trading, are you assuming a continuation of the fourth quarter '08 run rate, going forward? Obviously Trading is a volatile business; I'd be interested particularly on that. But for Italy and Spain, obviously fourth quarter '08 reported what was necessarily a reflection of abnormal times, so I'll be interested on that. And then in terms of the reduction in the CapEx, when can we expect to get more details of that CapEx plan, will that be done at the first quarter results, or some time after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, the impact assumed from Perform-to-Win with, at this stage targeting full impact in 2011. I think you may have heard that when we spoke about Perform-to-Win a few weeks ago; we were highlighting that right now we are in a phase where a number of the measures are &#x2013; need to be validated and, I would say, we're only in summer in a position to really come up with more firm statements. But right now, we're targeting for full impact in 2011.</p>
          <p>As far as trading is concerned, I think you will find it very difficult &#x2013; I admit that &#x2013; to really correctly project the results of the adjusted EBIT contribution from the Energy Trading as we move forward, as a consequence of the fact that you probably cannot really reconcile what the internal transfer price is. You will hence see more volatility in that unit because we have essentially pushed all our commodity risk into E.ON Energy Trading. Some is left with Ruhrgas, but mainly all short-term commodity risk sits in E.ON Energy Trading. Hence, you will also see fluctuations there. Doesn't really &#x2013; it's not a terribly satisfying answer &#x2013; I admit that &#x2013; but you will have a hard time to, in an isolated way, project E.ON Energy Trading. So maybe one day we actually have to show &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; an overall generation result or so to make it a little bit more easy, but right now we don't have that.</p>
          <p>As far as Italy and Spain is concerned, we highlighted that we had a 220 million charge in the second half of the year that should not have been there. Hence, the result should have been corrected for that, probably around 200 million for kind of a half year. It's not exactly correct because there was some business in Italy that was there before and the old Italian business from Th&#xFC;ga. But if you double that, it gives you maybe some indications for that business.</p>
          <p>Well, a breakdown of the CapEx plan, right now, I would say, we're at this stage not planning to give a breakdown into the different years. I think we can probably give a &#x2013; I think we have given a breakdown for 2010. You see that in the annual report &#x2013; sorry, for 2009. You see that in the annual report. There still is, I would say, not perfect visibility on what exactly we're going to do in '10 and '11. We'll have to see. If situation stabilizes, I think we are in a position to put forward more precise numbers. Right now, we'd shy a bit away from that.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One addition on your question with regard to the 2011 Perform-to-Win run rate. You may find the language in the handouts, on the slides that you saw a bit misleading, given that in one slide we speak from large part of 1.5 billion and the next chart probably says 1.5 billion of performance improvement. I think what we &#x2013; what we are trying to express here is that we anticipate that we will see something like one-off effects or, say, enabling expenses for some of these efforts to be implemented, and that may have an impact on 2011 annual results. We see the full run rate of the initiatives materialize in 2011; that may help you to understand why we are using different languages.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Before I go into the room again, a question from Vincent de Blic from Cazenove. Why didn't you say that the dividend will not be cut in 2009? Is it because you see downside risk to your adjusted net income guidance? What will you take into account when setting the payout ratio? The second thing, excluding disposals, where do you see the debt factor at the end of 2009?</p>
          <p>In my view, I think dividend, I think, Wulf, you have answered a lot, but do you want to add something? I think Wulf has answered in detail. I guess we don't have to repeat again. The last one maybe we can answer, debt factor, Marcus, end of 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>The last question from him is regarding, you don't mention Perform-to-Win as an EBIT growth driver in 2009 versus 2008 and point to &#x20AC;400 million in 2010 versus 2009. Does this mean that you expect only 400 million by 2010? How does it compare with the 600 million announced in May 2007? Does that mean that you expect 1.1 million in 2011 versus 2010? A long question that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is roughly 200 million &#x2013; 100 to 200 million that we are targeting for 2009 as part of Perform-to-Win. And hence, it's an additional 400 in 2010 and hence, it's another, I would say, 8 to 900. At this stage, we can't be terribly specific in 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Yes, two questions. First of all, I think probably generally accept what you're saying about tighter reserve margins next decade and understand your philosophy about investment. Most of your investment seems to be going to power generation and quite a lot into upstream gas, plus you are reasonably highly burn to yield. Is it just a statement of fact that we just have to accept that the earnings going forward are going to be much more volatile than they've been in the past, which seems to be a lot of the focus of questioning towards 2011?</p>
          <p>Second thing, just on the reduction on CapEx of 6 billion, you didn't talk about specific projects, but what sort of projects are you cutting back on? You did say that most of your projects have passed the stress test, but what projects are failing stress test? Is there a particular type, or is it particular geographies? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll comment on the earnings volatility. Quite frankly, I don't think the situation is very different to what it was before. The only point is it was never visible. From 2002 until 2007, commodity prices, to the best of my knowledge, were essentially all going one direction. Hence, it felt like this is all very stable and it's &#x2013; it can't be volatile. And now we have, within a 12-month period, seen a major change in volatility, which is probably unprecedented, and this doesn't leave us unaffected. We've always had some of the volatility.</p>
          <p>I could argue that in a way, given our investment program being only to a small extent, giving us additional direct exposure to the oil price, namely that part that is gas upstream and then the expansion of the capacity in Oskarshamn, the nuclear plant in Sweden. The rest is either regulated, such as renewables, infrastructure investments, or is investment into spec business, gas and coal-fired power plants, which is &#x2013; which are not necessarily correlated to the oil price. So I'm not sure I would concur with the statement that we're running into a higher volatility situation than we had before. We're only right now seeing more volatility in the earnings because &#x2013; not because our business is now more volatile, but because commodity prices have been volatile.</p>
          <p>The 6 billion cut, yes, you can see it here on that chart. I would say, it's sort of roughly the breakdown that you see of the 36 billion, maybe with a slightly higher share for generation, would also represent a breakdown of the 6 billion cut. So it's kind of across the board we have been doing this. Clearly, right now, we're also in a situation where, for a number of projects that can, by the way, also include renewable projects, we are also in renegotiations with some of the suppliers for equipment costs. In fact, we think the situation in those markets is likely going to change as we move forward; it may make it a bit easier for us to also drive for lower equipment costs.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One additional comment that we are not just talking about customers re-scheduling and postponement, so pushing them out of the current vending period. But those projects will not all disappear; they might be implemented later, if they are passing the stress test.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. One, you depreciated the U.S. asset; do you intend to sell them? And the second question: can you comment what would be the impact of the depreciation of the main currencies in some part of Eastern Europe, compared to the 31st of December, since we saw some severe decline over the last couple of weeks? Any thoughts would be welcome. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I have indirectly commented on U.S. already by saying we have got a total package of divestments ahead of us, where some are specific, some are sort of communicated, some are not. As far as the U.S. is concerned, we have no news to communicate. Therefore, we have to- you have to bear with us going forward what will ultimately happen there and we will look at it obviously in the frame of our portfolio review. Marcus, the other part?</p>

          <p>It's a tough one. I can only do some eyeballing right now, and maybe we'll &#x2013; we can work that out in more detail. Are you referring to 2009 or -? Right now. Just Eastern Europe, I would say, is sort of high two-digit million, up to 100 million, that that can cost with the currency. Just look at the situation in Hungary, where we've seen in the last quarter of 2008 a major drop in the forint. And there we have also the situation, which is going to disappear, but we had a situation and we will continue to have it until mid this year, where essentially we are buying gas in dollar and selling it in forint.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. One is, I'm trying to match together your 10 billion of disposals with your 11 billion target. By how much would you adjust your guidance 2010, if you managed to dispose all of the assets? And the second question would be, if you can say that investments from last three years, how much of contribution into this 11 billion target you assume? So the last two years you spent roughly 40 billion on economic investments; how much of this we will see in 2010 figures? And what is actually the period when you're going to achieve your initially assumed return on capital employed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on the 10 billion, I'll make it easy for myself. And also, given we can't really spell out what the precise projects are that we're working on, say, for the ones that are non-year, but if you assume we are selling assets that are in a way earning their cost of capital, and that would be roughly where we would also be then selling it. Just as a proxy, then take a 9% return, and that gives you a rule of thumb how you can come up with some math to estimate if we were to sell all the entire 10 billion.</p>
          <p>The second one is much more complicated, and I must admit, before I throw out a number here that we then have to work against, and explain, I would say, we will come back to you on this and try to work out what is the exact impact by when. I think the only thing I can highlight is that we clearly &#x2013; we were showing previously, I think, an impact until 2010 of roughly 1.6 &#x2013; sorry, 1.7 billion. That's what we communicated, I think, in May, as a consequence of growth investments. As I was highlighting earlier, in particular, with regard to the new markets there, we see a lower result now. You cannot compare the number that you've quoted in terms of CapEx with the contribution in 2010 because there are still a lot of organic investments that will not yet be producing: Skarv-Idun will start producing in 2011. Most of the power plants will come on stream in '11, '12, '13 and onwards, but it's included in what has already been invested. But we will see whether we can work out some numbers and then circulate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before we go to Andreas Thielen in the room, we have a question from Ingo Becker from Kepler. On the delays in cost pass-throughs in the grids, are you referring to wholesale costs, in bracket, wholesale power and gas prices, or specific costs in the grids, and is this affecting both power and gas grids?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just for the avoidance of doubt, this has nothing to do with our retail business. This is our regulated business, the grid businesses in Germany where network losses play a role, and where we also have a cost for having to buy balancing power. And so far, we have a situation where the regulator has granted, I think, a price of &#x20AC;44 compensation, which is far below the price that all grid operators had to pay, and now there is a debate around when that delta can be passed through to higher tariffs. We, and I would assume all other grid operators, are obviously advocating this has to happen immediately, but there could be a time delay and we only get it later, in which case that can be quite a significant charge in 2009, or actually in every year if they don't change the logic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Further example, in the TSO business, we have more and more renewables in the German system. You need more and more regulatory power to balance the grid, and there we discuss &#x2013; one theory is that TSO is allowed to pass that through to the DSOs, the distribution system operators, but these distribution system operators may only be allowed to put it on a regulatory account. They have five-year periods. An in the second period, they get it back with interest. But even then, you have the fiscal effect and we have an added effect on the way that has to be recorded in the books.</p>
          <p>So there's various effects that not necessarily mean that there's a total loss of anything, but the system in Germany is young. Don't forget in the U.K. we're in the fifth period. The regulatory system is, I would say, adult. Things have been tried out, things have been worked out. Here in Germany, where we have the biggest TSO and DSO business, a lot of things are just maturing and there is debate going onward and forward, so we have to believe that some deferrals happen.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Firstly on the outlook for the gas business, you were saying that the break &#x2013; the upstream contributed 344 million last year and break-even this year. The outlook for &#x2013; okay, sorry. The outlook for 2010, does that include any positive contribution from the gas upstream business? You were saying it is based on the forwards there. If I look on the forwards, there should be something positive. Given that we have limited information on that so far, are you willing to give us some kind of sensitivity for that business? And the second thing is you were talking about the changes versus the original '10 guidance, 500 million from regulation lower; would it be correct to assume that the gas transport business will account for something slightly below 50% there, so what is yet to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second point, at this stage, it's a little bit speculation because we are &#x2013; we don't have an agreement on tariffs. And I think against that background, at this stage, we would like to shy away from giving a precise answer, which I trust you do understand. We're right now &#x2013; we're talking potentially weeks in discussions about that. As far as the upstream position is concerned, indeed 2010 should see an upside in gas upstream compared to our 2009 projection. That is driven by two points. The first, we expect Yuzhno Russkoye to then be available for the full year, and then there is a slightly higher oil price, at least, if we sort of just look at the forwards. It's not terribly material, but there is some upside. At a level of $50, the combined business, Yuzhno Russkoye and our existing E&amp;P business, should be better than break-even. But it's, I would say, probably taking us to a number that can &#x2013; if everything goes well, it can be a three digit million.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Stefan Wolf [WestLB]. Stefan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically one question is left regarding how you came up with the 11 billion in 2010. Given the improvement commodity prices, this is a big issue adding some 800 million. Well, looking to your open positions here, there are some relevant positions left, especially in United Kingdom and of course also in Central Europe, perhaps you can share your assumptions regarding the pricing of that open position filled up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, the &#x2013; you are probably referring to page 30, the 800 million upside, don't forget this also includes the assumption that Kr&#xFC;mmel and Brunsb&#xFC;ttel will available in that year and that's &#x2013; that is one effect.</p>
          <p>As far as 2011 is concerned, I think the main question is what our open position in outright power is. We don't want to give out a specific number. You can see here what the overall hedge ratios are. Obviously Nordic, that is primarily just outright power; Central Europe, this also includes a capacity &#x2013; a generation capacity from coal and gas. Yes, again, I don't want to give out what our open position in outright power is, not in terms of terawatt hours to be sold. I think at this stage all I can say is this 800 million, there's a volume impact that's &#x2013; it's around 250, 300 million from the return of those two nuclear stations. And the rest of the upside, the lion's share of that upside is outright power.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to explore two areas where you have now a more, let's say, pessimistic or realistic outlook for 2009 and '10. Can I just clarify, first off, on the cost pass-through that may be delayed? This is now neither in your 2009 EBIT and it's neither in your 2010 because it shows up on both pages. So effectively, you are assuming that it won't be passed through before 2011? And that would be my first question. And second, can you update us on the timing of your discussions with the Bundesnetzagentur on the gas TSO regulation? Do you expect that to become a retroactive decision like we've experienced it back in 2006, i.e. would that be available for &#x2013; well, for us to see in the 2009 results already? What is your current outlook there? And if I may, just one last question for a number, if you say in your economic crisis point there is lower volumes in there, what is your current assumption for lower demand? We've talked about industry versus household, but what is your number that you've put into these scenarios that you publish? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, the time delay is in with an assumed comprise. Obviously, again, it goes back to the same point when you're in discussions about the compromise, you don't really talk about it in public. Second, we do assume that it will apply retroactively i.e., from beginning of this year. And three, volumes, same as we were saying with regard to bad debt, this is really kind of a proxy where we look at a number of things. And if I give you sort of a terawatt hour number, it doesn't really tell you much because what you really need to look into is with what customers, how have we hedged our position there because the typical loss then is going to be that we will be sitting on volume that we have acquired to hedge the sale, and we then have to sell that into the spot market. So it's a fairly comprehensive calculation you have to make. And hence, forgive me for in essence not being able to give you the precise method behind that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the time, the way it's going, I guess, we're going to take two last quick questions. One is from Michael Schaefer from Equinet and then followed by Chris Rogers [JP Morgan].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first is a follow-up on Andreas' question on gas upstream. Given your change on product mix or contribution mix going forward, you talked about start of production in Skarv-Idun in 2011, where is your breakeven point going to move starting from slightly below &#x20AC;50 for in the years to come in gas upstream, would be my first question? Second one, you mentioned a lot of times basically bad debt as a key risk going forward. Looking at your outlook for the U.K. business for 2009, there is only the weak pound occurring as a key risk factor, so to say. Does this mean that that is not a key issue in your U.K. business in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't mention &#x2013; look, first on the second part, we didn't mention bad debt as a key point in the U.K. because there really the most prominent factor is the weakness of the pound. Clearly, I think I said that earlier, in all of our retail businesses, bad debt and drops in volume are the big risks. And given we have a large retail business in the U.K., it will also pop up there, but sort of the most prominent effect for this market unit is the pound. That's the only reason why we haven't mentioned it.  As far as the break-even is concerned, with Skarv-Idun and then the other fields, I think directionally the break-even will come down slightly. It will be slightly shy of $40. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So hopefully two simple enough questions. First one, on your new scope of consolidation, can you just let us know what your carbon balance looks like? If that's in the other documentation, then I'm sure I can look it up there, in terms of how much free CO2 you get and what your emissions run rate is going to be going forward? And secondly, I presume that all of the guidance you've given us today is, if you like, on a mark-to-market for where we are today kind of level. I've got that impression from what you've been saying on power prices and forex and so on. Obviously, your last update on mid-term guidance was May 2007, and the one before that, March 2003. How live do you plan to keep this guidance? Will you be updating on the quarter, the six month, the full year 2010, just so we can kind of keep track of how this business is doing in these difficult times?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sometimes I get the impression that you believe that we've got the crystal ball unlike anybody else and we have all the information and data available and all the visibility you can think of I would like to have. Quite honestly, running a business is something different and, of course, we would like to provide you with as much clarity and detail as we can. But as we tried to make clear in the whole presentation, the visibility now in terms of the economic development is much more clouded than in previous years. So therefore you seem to expect sort of business as usual performance and behavior and transparency and all this, which quite honestly, we don't have and nobody has got under the circumstances. So I'm a bit puzzled by what you expect.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, that wasn't what my question was. My question is, is this a mark-to-market set of guidance and how often will you be updating it? That was specifically the question. I know it's a difficult economy and who knows, but presumably you know when you are going to update us next and whether this was based on mark-to-market or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, we will give you guidance as we go and as much as we can obviously. But it is difficult to make sort of a commitment now and say, we will get it on a quarterly basis, on a half yearly basis or whatever. I think we will try indeed our best to remain as transparent as we can. I'm not here to hold back information, but it's a bit difficult to come up with the sort of clear commitment, as you would like, to hear that from us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the first words, you're right. This is based not on a vision of higher prices and better conditions, but it's also not based on a depressive view of the world goes down under. This is mark-to-market with present prices; present visibility, best estimates on things. So I've heard some people saying, if the world goes really nice, then this is our income, and other people don't say anything. We try to reflect the insight of our business where we know more than other businesses, but we can't have the crystal ball. This is mark-to-market. This is realism.</p>
