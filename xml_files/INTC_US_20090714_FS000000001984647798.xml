          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q2 2009 Intel Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Christina and I will be your coordinator for today. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn this presentation over to our host for today's call, Mr. Kevin Sellers, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christina, and welcome everyone to Intel's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. I'm joined as usual by Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini and Chief Financial Officer Stacy Smith.</p>
          <p>As we begin our call, let me remind everyone that today's discussion contains forward-looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially.</p>
          <p>Following brief prepared remarks from both Paul and Stacy, we will then take questions.</p>
          <p>We posted our earnings release and updated financial statements to our investor website, intc.com. Anyone still needing access to that information can find it there. We will also post on the investor website the appropriate GAAP financial reconciliations for any non-GAAP financial measures mentioned during the call.</p>
          <p>So with that, now let me hand it over to Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kevin. Our second quarter results were clearly better than we expected, with demand strengthening throughout the quarter. While the global economic environment is still recovering, our customers signaled increased confidence for a seasonal second half with their ordering patterns. I believe that this reflects how critical personal and enterprise computing have become to the world.</p>
          <p>From a consumption perspective, consumer purchases led the way, with a strong rebound in mobile processor shipments. Enterprise PC volumes remain weak, but server processor volumes were better than expected, driven by a strong ramp of our Nehalem based products.</p>
          <p>We are seeing significant interest in our new products, from Nehalem based Xeon processors to Atom to Core i7 on the desktop. These are the fruits of our Tick-Tock strategy at work.</p>
          <p>Globally, we saw strength in Asia-Pacific, particularly China where their stimulus programs continue to generate meaningful growth in their PC market. The US also had a strong quarter while Europe's recovery lags that of the US and China.</p>
          <p>Let me say a few words about some of new products. We launched our Nehalem-EP server processors at the end of Q1. And in just one quarter from launch, Nehalem already makes up over one-third of all of our dual-socket server shipments. We expect the ramp to continue, with Nehalem shipments crossing over the 50% mark in August. We remain on track to launch our Nehalem-EX processor line, which is the multi-processor version of Nehalem, in the second half of the year. Nehalem-EX is expected to redefine the performance standard in that segment.</p>
          <p>Atom revenue grew a very strong 65% this quarter, reflecting a bit of a snap back after the inventory correction we saw in late Q4 and in Q1. While netbooks are the main catalysts of the overall growth in Atom, we are pleased to see Atom now making its way into nettops and embedded applications. We continue to add new customers in the embedded market segment and are pleased with the great progress Atom is making in opening up new opportunities for Intel, all with healthy product margin profiles for the company.</p>
          <p>Next, our recently introduced consumer ultra low-voltage mobile processors are helping to create a new PC segment of ultra-thin full function notebooks. This product line takes advantage of two key technologies; first, our high-k metal gate transistors, which allow us to create the extremely low voltage variance of our processors. And secondly, we have created advanced packaging breakthroughs that significantly reduce the overall footprint and thickness of notebooks based upon these products. Ultra-thin notebooks are now shipping in the market and we believe they will further invigorate the notebook category and be a significant contributor to our profits in the future.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to comment on some of the strategic announcements made recently that are aimed at accelerating our growth initiatives. The first is the acquisition of Wind River, which is nearing completion. This transaction is an important step for us and we expect it will combine our world-class silicon capability with their world-class software and services to create a new class of differentiated products for the embedded and handheld market segments.</p>
          <p>Our Nokia announcement was also an important milestone as we move towards building products that will allow us to compete effectively in the handheld market segment. Our collaboration with Nokia is deep and multifaceted. The announcement specifically referred to our open-source software collaboration and the acquisition of a 3G license. Other work is underway and will be announced in the future.</p>
          <p>In closing, I want to thank the employees of the company for their outstanding execution and attention to detail in a very difficult economic environment. Our efficiency progress and cost structures continue to be important advantages for us and our financial performance clearly reflects that. We are now operating with more speed and agility than perhaps at any time in the company's history. As we continue to grow our core business and ramp our new initiatives, this agility will be increasingly important to us and to our success.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul. Second quarter sales were better than expected. In anticipation of the seasonally up second half, the supply chain began refilling inventory positions that had been depleted over the past two quarters. As a result, we experienced better than expected demand from microprocessors and chipsets, which contributed to $8 billion in revenue, a 12% sequential increase, the largest first quarter to second quarter growth in over 20 years.</p>
          <p>The company's execution was strong and contributed to our improving financial results. The factories executed particularly well, with inventories down an additional $240 million this quarter, improvements in throughput time and yields, and unit costs better than expected across all lines of business.</p>
          <p>Additionally, spending was in tight control and the number of employees was down an additional 2%. The strong execution can most clearly be seen in the 5.5 point improvement in gross margin quarter to quarter.</p>
          <p>Despite the strengthening market and the company's strong execution, the impact of the European Commission's $1.45 billion fine resulted in an operating loss of $12 million and a quarterly net loss of $398 million. Excluding the impact of the fine, operating profit was $1.4 billion, up 122% from the first quarter; and net income was $1 billion, up 67% from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>On a year-over-year basis, revenue for the second quarter was down 15%, an improvement from the 26% year-over-year decline in the first quarter. Revenue of microprocessors including Atom was better than seasonal patterns on higher volume and lower average selling prices. Second quarter revenue for Atom based microprocessors and associated chipsets was $362 million, up 65% from the first quarter. Excluding Atom based microprocessors, overall microprocessor average selling prices were slightly lower than the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Gross margin dollars were $4.1 billion, $800 million higher than the first quarter. Gross margin percentage at 51% was 5.5 points higher than the first quarter and the outlook that we provided in April. The largest drivers of the sequential change included a 3.5 point increase from higher CPU sales volumes, a 3.5 point increase from lower period costs, which consisted of several points from lower excess capacity charges, offset some by higher startup costs. The increases were also partially offset a couple of points by lower CPU average selling prices.</p>
          <p>Spending for R&amp;D and MG&amp;A was approximately $2.6 billion, slightly higher than the first quarter, due to higher marketing spending. In addition, we had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $91million and the EC fine of $1.45 billion.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, the number of employees is down by 2,000 from the first quarter to 80,500, primarily due to previously announced factory actions.</p>
          <p>Gains and losses on equity investments and interest and other income was a net loss of $38 million, smaller than our outlook of a net loss of $150 million, based on lower impairments and positive fair value adjustments on mark-to-market trading assets, as the market for certain debt instruments strengthened during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Excluding the impact of the EC fine that was not tax deductible, the provision for taxes in the second quarter was at a 25% tax rate, slightly higher than the 24% previously forecasted.</p>
          <p>The company's strong execution can be seen in the strength of our balance sheet. Total inventories were down an additional $240 million after the $700 million reduction in the first quarter. Total cash investments comprised of cash, short-term investments, and debt security trading assets ended the quarter at $11.3 billion, $1 billion higher than the first quarter. Cash flow from operations was more than $3 billion. Capital spending was $981 million. We did not repurchase stock in the quarter and paid nearly $800 million in dividends.</p>
          <p>As we turn now to the outlook for the third quarter, please keep in mind that Intel's business outlook includes the Wind River transaction, which is expected to have revenue of less than $40 million and reduce EPS by about a penny in the third quarter. The outlook does not include the potential impact of any other mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or business combinations that may be completed after July 13. I will use the midpoint of the forecast ranges when making comparisons to specific periods.</p>
          <p>We are planning for revenue to be about $8.5 billion plus or minus $400 million. The midpoint of this range would be an increase of 6% from the second quarter, which is in the bottom half of the historical seasonal range based on the expectation of continued weakness in the enterprise market segment.</p>
          <p>Our expectation for gross margin percentage in the third quarter is that it will be 53% plus or minus a couple of points. Anticipated improvements in the CPU business are expected to contribute three points sequentially to gross margin through higher sales volume and lower unit cost. An additional three point increase is expected from reductions in excess capacity charges and startup costs. These increases are partially offset three points by inventory write-offs, primarily for the lead 32-nanometer products built prior to qualification for sale and one point for lower CPU average selling prices.</p>
          <p>Spending for R&amp;D and MG&amp;A in the third quarter should be approximately $2.8 billion, $200 million higher than the second quarter. The majority of the increase is in the classification of spending as process engineers move from cost of sales to R&amp;D. Additionally, in the separate category for restructuring and asset impairment charges, we expect expenses of approximately $40 million. Amortization of acquisition related intangibles primarily associated with the Wind River acquisition is also expected to be approximately $40 million. Depreciation is forecasted to be approximately $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net loss of approximately $80 million. The loss is higher than the second quarter because we had mark-to-market good news in our trading assets in the second quarter that we do not expect in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our forecast for full-year spending on R&amp;D and MG&amp;A is between 10.6 and $10.8 billion, $200 million higher than our prior forecast due to the addition of Wind River and higher revenue and profit dependent spending.</p>
          <p>Our expectation for annual capital spending for 2009 is that it will be $4.7 billion plus or minus $200 million, lower than the previous forecast, slightly down from $5.2 billion in 2008. The reduction in forecasted capital spending is primarily due to the increased roll forward of capital from 45 to 32-nanometer and improved factory efficiencies.</p>
          <p>The tax rate for the third and fourth quarters is now expected to be 23%, one point lower than the prior forecast.</p>
          <p>As we end the difficult first half of 2009, it is worthwhile to reflect on the financial progress we made in the past quarter. We achieved a $1 billion increase in revenue in a quarter that is typically down. Gross margin was 5.5 points better. Spending and the number of employees were in tight control and we continued to generate efficiencies across our operations. We generated over $2 billion in cash from operations in excess of what was required to pay our dividend. Capital efficiency allowed us to reduce our CapEx forecast $500 million from last year. Over the past two quarters, inventory has decreased by over $900 million. And we will continue to extend our technology leadership as we ramp our 32-nanometer factories.</p>
          <p>As we look into the second half, we remain committed to maintaining the strong execution levels that have benefited us over the past six months, confident that the combination of the strengthening market and strong execution set the foundation for continued improvement in our financial results.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it back to Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thanks, Stacy and Paul. We'll now be happy to take questions. In order to facilitate as many questioners as possible, each participant will be limited to one question and a follow up. The operator will prompt your question, and then I'll ask if you have a follow-up.</p>
          <p>So with that Christina, please introduce our first questioner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess the first question would be of the color. Could you provide color on channel inventories? Do you think there was restocking that went on in the channel? And how do you feel about the inventories in channel? Are they over-inventoried, under-inventoried still, or about right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the first part. By channel, I think you probably mean the broad channel, but let me comment on the three levels of inventory that we see. First of all, our inventory which as Stacy said for the first half is down $900 million, so our own inventory is in very good shape. The distributor inventory that we take our reserves for is also in very good shape. It was about flat quarter on quarter and that's in a growing quarter. So if anything, that could use a little bit more heft as we go into the second half. Thirdly, there's the inventory of our products that have to sit at the OEMs and their reseller channels. Everything we've seen suggests that's in pretty good shape. Our major OEMs are all in a hub pull system from us, so there's really no likelihood of large inventory amounts in their work in process. And everything we've seen with our reseller channel checks suggests that's also in very good shape.</p>
          <p>I think you have to &#x2013; when you look at inventory this quarter and the overall growth in the quarter, I think there are three things going on here. First of all is that overall consumption is recovering and we've seen some growth in overall consumption, particularly in notebooks, consumer notebooks as we spoke about. Second is that the inventory channel which has dramatically depleted itself in the fourth quarter and into the first part of the first quarter is starting to refill part of its &#x2013; to where its normal levels have been. And the third is the general view of our customers to build some inventory up in anticipation of a stronger seasonal second half. The combination of those three really is what made the quarter happen the way it did and it also gives us confidence on the second half and fairly good confidence on the levels of inventory that are out there. And the second part of your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that actually covered both parts of that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mark, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a follow-up, Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please. As you look into Q3, could you give us a sense of how you're thinking about how you're guidance is impacted by back-to-school spending or any kind of a corporate refresh? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's certainly some view &#x2013; given that consumer notebooks and consumer sales have been the strongest element of this recessionary period, we're expecting some of that to continue and some back-to-school. But we're not out there thinking that there's a recovery to prior levels in the aggregate.</p>
          <p>In terms of enterprise, I actually &#x2013; we are not planning for a big refresh this year. I think that there is likely to be a refresh coming when you look at the aging of products that are out there. Desktops in the corporation &#x2013; corporate environment are about four years old, notebooks 3.5 years old, servers about three years old. At some point, those need to be refreshed. I think there is an opportunity for that to happen around Wind Seven and our new technologies, which worked pretty well together in terms of new stability and security features. But we're not counting on that happening in large measures in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Sumit Dhanda with Banc of America-Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi; Stacy, first question for you. You talked about the write-offs as it relates to your 32-nanometer ramp costing you three points in gross margins in Q3. How should we think about Q4 just specifically as it relates to that element of your gross margin guidance? Should we just think about "adding that back," and then of course flowing it as we would normally based on our assumptions of volumes or unit costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good question. Let me back up and explain what that is. It's a pretty normal phenomenon that we see. Actually it's a very normal phenomenon that we see as we ramp a new process technology. Up until the point that we qualify a product for sale, if we end the quarter we'll write off the inventory that we built on that product. That's the lion's share of the three points of reserve impact that you see in the third quarter forecast. And yes, you'll see two to three points of that coming back in the fourth quarter because we won't repeat that write-off. So that gives us a little bit of tailwind as we go into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then the second question again relates to inventories, down 240 million after the $700 million decline in Q1. And one could almost argue that there's a little too low days of inventory, down in the 60s now, which is the lowest level we've seen in some time. Are you comfortable? I mean let's assume that there is some upside to demand in the second half of the year. Do you feel like both your throughput times as well as your current inventory profile will be adequate to serve the demand outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are actually I think two elements to your question. The first is yes, the inventory levels are actually a little lower than I'd like. As Paul said, that's true when we look at our channel customers. It's true when I look internally. What happened was we saw Q2 that strengthened through June. That caught us a little bit by surprise, and so where I thought I was going to build more inventory in Q2, we actually depleted inventory.</p>
          <p>That said, I still have unutilized capacity in the third quarter, even with my uptick in margin. I expect to have unutilized capacity in the fourth quarter. So we're confident that we can respond to supply. And in fact, I think I'll keep a little more 45-nanometer capacity in place just as a precaution if this market ends up being a little stronger than we thought.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sumit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung with Citigroup.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, when I look back at the history of your gross margins, from the bottom gross margins typically in the mid-40s. It's usually four to six quarters when you can get back to a quarter gross margin at 58% or higher, and I obviously recognize who the hell knows what's going to happen in four to six quarters from now. But do you think that a 58-plus percent gross margin quarter is something that's achievable for the company on at least a one quarter basis looking out sometime in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Glen, let me take that and then Paul can add color commentary if he wants. There are two things to keep in mind. One is the supply chain in general in this recession responded more quickly than it has in the past, and that's true for the worldwide supply chain. You saw the amount of inventory that came out quickly over Q4 and Q1, as well as our inventory levels came down pretty dramatically in Q4 and again in Q2. I think that has kept the duration where we're down below what I call the normal range of 50 to 60%, a little lower than we've seen in prior downturns, which I think is a positive sign that responsiveness of the supply chain I think is healthy.</p>
          <p>In terms of can we be back in the upper end of that range, what I said at the investor meeting is yes, I expect our gross margin profile over the next several years to not be different than what we've seen over the past several years. And the majority of our gross margin readings over the last ten years have been between 50 and 60%. I think that we can be at the upper end of that and I think there will be times where we have excess capacity charges and other things where we'll be at the lower end of that. It really just depends on the business conditions inside that quarter, but there's no fundamental reason that we can't be at the high end of that gross margin range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Glen, did you have a follow-up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the follow-up is actually thinking about ASPs also. I looked at a chart of ASPs over time, and what you tend to see cyclically is when we go into a down cycle, ASPs come down. I assume that's because mix starts to move lower. But by the same token as you go into an up cycle, ASPs actually start to improve, ostensibly for the opposite reason. I wonder if you think that's something that can occur, and maybe give us your response in the context of mix with Atom and in the context of a mix without Atom, just so we can a sense as to how much Atom is impacting that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your analysis of prior cycles is right, but I'm not sure that it will play out that way this cycle. The industry is lot bigger and it really is segmenting much more discretely than it ever has before in terms of the differences between servers and mobile and desktop and now netbooks all interacting with each other.</p>
          <p>In general, the reason we've done well in up cycles isn't just demand driven, but the fact that Intel has invested traditionally in new products through those. And the new products are premium products, and they tend to pull us out of things. As recessions end and cycles end, we tend to be able to sell those more aggressively, and that has helped us. That part of the equation is not going to be any different. We are investing heavily in new products and they're gaining traction, as I talked about before. What I think is different this time is the nature of the cycle and just the sheer size of the PC industry. Netbooks as they come will have a dilutive impact on ASPs just by definition. We're hoping to be able to manage margins such that the margins are accretive, as we talked to you guys before.</p>
          <p>And then the other secular trend is the notebook displacing the desktop. As that happens, notebooks are getting cheaper and cheaper. They will always be a little bit more than desktops, but they tend to approach it. So you've got those all playing together. I think that I'm not going give you an ASP forecast out of all this, but I think you need to think about how these dynamics come together.</p>
          <p>The third thing would be servers. I do think that we are on the edge of a fairly strong build-out of server capacity, both in enterprise and cloud over the next few years, and Intel is particularly well positioned to benefit from that. That will have an uplifting impact on ASP.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much, congratulations on your execution. Paul, just in terms of &#x2013; maybe first Stacy, actually you just mentioned that some of the revenue had come from the refill. So just to be clear, you feel now that your OEM and channel is now at a point where you'll be having more seasonal lift rather than refill lift. Would that be correct? And it also looked like the chipsets outpaced the microprocessors. Does that enhance your visibility to some extent for the calendar third quarter? How should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the short answer to both of those questions is yes. What we saw was a little more predictability and a little bit of <mark type="inaudible" /> in terms of the sales out that we saw in Q2. We also saw the supply chain doing a partial replenishment from the inventory that burned off. And as Paul said, when we look at the inventory in the supply chain, it looks pretty appropriate for a supply chain that's geared up for a seasonally stronger second half, so we don't see anything that we would think of excess there. That gives us some confidence from our customer standpoint that they're gearing up for a seasonally up second half.</p>
          <p>And then as you pointed out, the chipset volume that we saw in Q2 would be appropriate in Q2 for a Q3 where they're expecting some unit growth. So all of those point to what we said a quarter ago, which is the expectation that the second half of this year is seasonally up from the first half.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon guys, congratulations on a good quarter. Paul, my first question, on the last conference call and then again at the Analyst Day, you guys were pretty emphatic about Atom being much more new market expansive than cannibalistic. Granted, it was off of a low base. When you look at the sequential growth in the quarter, do you still feel that way? And I guess when we think about longer term Atom as a percent of the client mix, what do you think that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our view hasn't changed, John. It's still a lot of the 65% jump that you saw in Atom revenues this quarter really was the fact that netbooks had been built ahead of the very rapid fourth quarter drop, and they were living off of inventory the second half of the fourth quarter and mostly through the first quarter. All those netbooks sold through from our customers and now they're starting to reorder and you're starting to see that pretty dramatic quarter-on-quarter swing reflected in our numbers. That's why I used the word snap back. I don't think there was much &#x2013; I think the end user sales probably were much more constant over that period in terms of linear growth than the big jump we saw this quarter in CPU shipments.</p>
          <p>In terms of cannibalization, everything we've seen so far both from a study standpoint and a purchase pattern standpoint and a buyer interview standpoint suggests that if there is any cannibalization, it's at the low end of the notebook, the Celeron based notebooks that these are coming out of. And as we've pointed out in the past, that's a positive gross margin tradeoff for Intel to make. And even at that, we're talking about a total cannibalization that's probably no more than 20%.</p>
          <p>I think the usage models are really differentiating between notebooks and netbooks, and that will be even more clear when the new ultra-thins are out there because now if you want a thin and light notebook, you don't have to just pick a netbook. You can pick an affordable notebook that has more functionality. So I think in the next six months, we'll see greater end-user differentiation between the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Paul, as my follow-up, maybe a follow-up to Tim's question just around Windows 7. You said you don't have a strong opinion around the consumer, but I guess given how important the consumer is for Q3 growth, given that corporate client is still relatively weak, are you at all concerned that we could see a pause ahead of Windows 7 in the consumer market or what are you seeing around linearity in the September quarter versus normal trends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>July and August are rather small anyway and the operating system is the last thing that's loaded. So it's very possible that this is all lining up for back-to-school, Labor Day kind of thing. I'm not privy to the exact launch date of Win 7, so I can't opine on that. Traditionally though, what has happened is that machines launched near the &#x2013; sold near the launch or prior to the launch have had some kind of coupon or upgrade capability, and I suspect that that will happen in this cycle too, to be able to minimize the impact of any stall that might be out there.</p>

          <p>Okay, great. And then my follow-up would be, if I could, the timeframe that you guys think is reasonable for us on Wall Street to expect a meaningful contribution to the P&amp;L from embedded and/or handheld?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Embedded is already meaningfully contributing. I think we've described that as a large ongoing business, well in excess of $1 billion. And that's just &#x2013; it's on a nice growth rate and I don't think I want give any more granularity than that.</p>
          <p>On the handheld, I think a lot of the products &#x2013; you're seeing us make some progress in MID [Mobile Internet Devices] devices this year. The product that really is aimed at the sweet spot of the handhelds is the Moorestown product, which is a 2010 high volume product.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, if I can just add on the embedded segment, as Paul said, it's a business that's well in excess of $1 billion. It's growing fast, and I shared some information at the Investor meeting a couple months back. The gross margin &#x2013; the product margin within that business is actually beyond what we get in our core client business, so it is a very profitable business. It's on a nice growth clip. And you look at something like the Wind River acquisition, that's really meant to accelerate our efforts there and it will also have a spillover effect into where we want to go in the handheld market as well.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Can you give us some feel for the puts and takes on Atom's ASP? You talked about embedded but also Atom for desktops. And separately, you guys haven't said this, but we've seen items in the news about giving fewer &#x2013; giving less of a discount to companies who use Atom in netbooks above 10 inches. So can you help us understand which things suppress ASP, which things push up ASP, and on balance whether it rises through the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think Atom ASP is going to be materially different over the course of the year at either the processor or kit level. There really are no changes. We've got some variants of the product coming in. We bring on a dual-core version for the desktop later this year and things like that. But for the most &#x2013; and then we're moving to more highly integrated versions in SoC following that. All that is aimed at meeting the existing price points with very cost efficient and performance efficient products.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks, and another quick one for Stacy. Stacy, restructuring costs, do they continue for quite a long time? I mean we've seen restructuring costs in every quarter. Do they keep going on going forward or do they begin to tail off at some point fairly soon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I guess it's all relative. They are tailing off, David. When we were just embarking on our efficiency program and going through significant reductions in the employee base of the company, we were seeing restructuring charges that were running in the hundreds of millions of dollars. What you see this quarter is restructuring charges. It's all employee related. It's the actions that we announced to you back in the first quarter, which were some closures of some older generation factories and some smaller assembly test factories. The carryover that you're seeing in Q2 is going to be the continuation of some of those actions. You can see that Q2 is &#x2013; I'm sorry, Q3 is half what Q2 was. And I'd expect it to stay at some level of restructuring cost but at a pretty low level when we get into the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys; Stacy, a question on the gross margin side of things. Other than other the 32-nanometer charges going away in the fourth quarter, are there any other one-time dynamics we should include in our models?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, let me just pontificate a bit on what I see as some of the headwinds and tailwinds on gross margin as we go into the fourth quarter. I'll give you some insight into what I see, and I'll preface it by saying I'm not going to give a point estimate but I'll give you some ideas of some of the relevant trends that I see.</p>
          <p>So we talked about the reserve impact. I think that that should give us two to three points of gross margin tailwind from Q3 to Q4. When I think about startup costs and excess capacity charges, I actually don't think that they're going to be materially different in the fourth quarter than they are in the third, so I don't think they're going to be either a headwind or a tailwind. If you remember what we said on startup costs at the investor meeting, we said that they'd peak in the second quarter, come down in the third, and flatten out the fourth. That's still what I expect. And similarly with excess capacity charges: big number in Q1, cut dramatically in Q2, down a bit more in Q3, and then flattens out. Again, that's still what I expect.</p>
          <p>So when I take those elements into account, I think of my Q4 gross margin as being in the upper half of the normal range that I've articulated in the past. I've said between 50 and 60%. I think that with the reserve good news, I'm likely to be in the top half of that when I get into the fourth quarter. Obviously, it'll be somewhat dependent on pricing and business levels, and I'm not ready to put a forecast around those. But independent of those, I think I'm in that top half of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then I guess while we're talking about ranges, it nice that you guys are actually giving a range, but it's a little bit bigger on the revenue line than we've had in years past at about 800 million. What would be the dynamics other than just simply better or worse demand that would take you to the high or low end of the $800 million range in revenue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that I'll talk to the forecast range and then maybe Paul wants to add on here. We didn't provide a specific point estimate for revenue in Q1 and Q2. I think that was an indication of the volatility that we were seeing in end demand levels as well as the volatility we were seeing in the inventory levels in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>As we start Q3, we've seen order patterns stabilizing, in fact improving a little bit in the consumer segment. And we're seeing there's partial refilling of the worldwide supply chain. The combination of that gives us more predictability, but you can't lose sight of the fact that there is still a lot of economy volatility out there. We still see a weak enterprise market, so we think that the right answer is to provide the point estimate but with a wider range because I think there is wider range of potential outcomes in this Q3 than what we'd normally see.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my question, a question for you on ASPs this quarter. You said that ASPs even excluding Atom were still down. But you had much higher growth of mobile than even the desktops, and you even spoke about strength in the server segment from Nehalem where the ASP should be much higher. So I was wondering if you could help me understand why ASPs overall excluding those things would still be down from where they in Q3. And particularly if you could maybe focus on the mainstream notebook side, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, it's a pretty simple answer. It's relative weakness in the enterprise segment of the market relative to the consumer. Enterprise tends to buy a higher, more full featured mix. That's particularly true of notebooks. We predicted that for Q2 and that's what we saw. And as we look into Q3, the expectation is Q3 tends to be a more consumer led quarter. So we're likely to see a little bit more of that mix towards the consumer, which gives us a little bit more of a downward pressure to ASP in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I tried to answer that before, which is I think that in general, you're going to see a secular decrease in average selling prices in notebooks &#x2013; notebooks, not notebook chips as notebooks just get cheaper. As Intel integrates more and more onto a single chip at typically the low end, that allows us to maintain good margins even as the price points comes down. And you're just seeing that evolution happen bit by bit now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But focusing on the potential for CULV to maybe bring pricing in the stack down as you have &#x2013; and also I'm looking at the opportunity even potentially for upselling with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, actually I see it as more of the latter than the former. We have ultra-low voltage versions of all of our mainstream brands of Celeron, of Pentium, and of Core. And those ULV versions sell at a premium to the non-ULV versions in each of the brand segments. So what we're trying to do here is get an upsell inside of every brand segment for ultra-low voltage for the technology that I talked about and the form factors that are enabled. And you've seen our customers have a variety of patterns of introduction around that. Some customers are focusing on the Core brand ULV products. Some are focusing on Pentium or Celeron to be able to enable very different price points. In all cases though, those CPUs sell at a premium to their non-low voltage brothers that we're shipping into the marketplace at the same time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a CPU for CPU into the same segment if you will, performance segment, it's higher because it uses a higher yield effectiveness of our technology to build them. The package is a little more expensive. It uses the higher performing parts of the process to able to deliver the performance at low voltage.</p>

          <p>Yes, Uche, let me try. First of all, the normal seasonal pattern for Europe in the second quarter would be down 15%. Europe was down a little over 9%, right, so it was not immune to the kind of surge we saw in other geographies, but it was relative to other geographies the only negative one. That's why we didn't point it out. And my view is that it's twofold. One, Europe is a big continent in the sense that it includes not just the Western European countries, but also places like Russia and the Middle East, where you've got a mixture of economies that are recovering fast or slowly depending on their sensitivity to say energy prices for example. So the patterns we saw in Western Europe were slightly different than the patterns we saw in the former Soviet Union or the Middle East and Africa, point one.</p>
          <p>Point two, in general Europe went into this cycle from our perspective, from a technology sales perspective, a little later than the US, and I think they're coming out a little later than the US. And to a first approximation, it looks like about a quarter, three or four months difference right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could maybe add one thing, you also keep in mind that a lot of the demand in Europe is satisfied from production that happens in Asia-Pacific. And so what you saw in the prior quarter was Asia-Pacific was down much more than the rest of the geographies. That's a function of this worldwide supply chain re-optimizing inventory levels. What you see in this quarter is Asia-Pacific is stronger than the rest of the world. Again, that's partially a function of that refilling of the inventory pipeline, and then partially a function of some real strength we're seeing in China. I think you have to keep in mind that length of supply chain to make Europe makes sense as you look at the quarter-by-quarter changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, that's really helpful, just a different question. NAND Flash, there wasn't really much said about it this quarter. Any insight as to what contribution that may have had on the margins and also into the outlook, any insight as to how your product roadmap on NAND products are developing, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. You have to first keep in mind that NAND is a relatively small portion of our overall business. I shared some of that at the investor meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so we did see pricing better in Q2 than we have seen in the prior quarter. And then as we've said over the last six, nine months, our costs are coming down at a nice clip. The combination of those two things gave us something less than a point of good news to the gross margin line in terms of NAND in Q2. It wasn't at the same kind of level as what we saw with the CPU business, but it certainly was positive. As we go into the second half, I have fairly good insight into the fact that my costs keep coming down. I watch the pricing very carefully and I'd expect it to come down a bit, and the question is just going to be how much as we get into the second half. But I think I can keep it gross margin neutral over the second half just based on cost control.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The second part of your question is we also talked about moving into solid-state drives and things like that, and we've made good progress on that. We're getting good customer acceptance, some great industry recognition in terms of the quality of our solutions, and we're in the ramp phase as we going into the second half of this year and into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But should we expecting more meaningful contribution in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it remains a fairly small portion of the overall business, but we're certainly committed keep driving the kinds of levers or pushing the kinds of levers that we have been pushing to improve the financial performance of the business; so we're committed to keep doing that.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Stacy, could you give us a little more color on what the utilization rate should be tracking in second half of the year and how much inventory or additional inventory you guys will be producing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably not at the level of granularity that you want, it's going to be from a shape standpoint very consistent with what I showed in May at the investor meeting. We took utilizations down to a record low in the first quarter &#x2013; in the second quarter, sorry. They get meaningfully better in the second quarter. They'll get somewhat better again in the third quarter and then flatten out. That's pretty consistent with what we showed you. I did indicate earlier on the call that we're going to keep a bit of 45-nanometer capacity in place. We want to wait to see some of the demand signals. It's devastating for our business to get caught short. When we get into 2010, we'll either fill that capacity or we'll redirect that to offset 32-nanometer investment. Again, we talked about that. That's the roll-forward effect of what we can do with one generation behind capacity in capital.</p>
          <p>What was the second part of your question? The inventory levels, I am a little lower than I'd like right now. I'd like to put some inventory in place in Q2 &#x2013; Q3. But with the phenomenon that I talked about of the Westmere products that are being built prior to qualification that will end up being written off in the third quarter, my guess is that I'll show net inventory actually down a little bit in Q3 and maybe I'll get a bit more in place in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and then the second question, and it might be better for your FP&amp;A guys, but you guys look at the Intel versus the PC tracking. And so if we plug in normal seasonality for Intel in Q4, your revenue will be back up to up 10% year over year, which is great. However, if we look at where the PC market is tracking, that revenue will be down about 10% or more year over year in Q4. So I guess I hear you and that's what I hear, that inventory is very low out there. But I guess how do you guys explain the discrepancy between processor sales and PC sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the people who track the market tend to play off of our results to a large portion. And you'll see &#x2013; I think you'll see you have seen the year-over-year numbers in terms of decline, projected declines of the industry shrink. I mean people were talking about 15 &#x2013; 18% down in January for the year. Now they're talking about 10%, 5%, and some are even projecting much lower numbers than that, closer numbers than that. So my sense is that the forecasting world is catching up to the reality of what's being shipped today more than projecting where the world will really be.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks for taking my question guys, one for you, Stacy. If you could talk and give us a little bit of an update on the China startup costs, I know it's looking out a little bit ways, but any updates there on what we should expect early next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Doug, nothing beyond what I showed you six weeks or so ago at the investor meeting. We are starting up a new site. That's an unusual phenomenon for us that will drive a little bit of increase to startup costs. And I did say for Q4 I would expect startup costs to be relatively flat. A portion of that's going to be the early startup costs associated with the China factory. But for 2010, I'm not currently thinking it's different than what I showed you six weeks ago. We'll watch that as we get into next year's investor meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, and one for you, Paul, if you could talk a little bit about whether you feel like you have all the pieces needed now to go after more revenues in non-PC markets. If I add them up, recently we've had deals with LG, with Cisco, with IBM, with Nokia with, the Wind River deal. Do you now have everything that you need or should we consider your efforts here just starting? If you could tell us how we should think about that, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we have critical mass yet. We have large ambitions in the non-PC space, and a lot of the design wins that we either have or would like to have, have not been announced. And in many of these areas, this is a long-term trend. So I think you see very good progress here both on the customer side and also on the infrastructure side. What the companies are buying in the graphics area for example to be able to get ready for a robust software environment around Larrabee and now the acquisition of Wind River for handsets and embedded, all these are fleshing out the ability to allow us to move even faster into these markets.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Doug. Christina, we're going to take two more questions if that's okay.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of John Barton with Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the topic of embedded, Paul, in the previous response you had talked about embedded being a billion-dollar company. Obviously, that's things other than Atom. In your prepared statements when you were talking about Atom revenue, you said primarily driven by netbooks but also nettops and embedded. Could you give us a feel for how Atom is doing embedded, and maybe weave within there how the relationship with TSMC is working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I did that at the Analyst meeting. I'm trying to remember from then in terms of what I talked about. I think I talked about 1,200 new designs in Atom in the embedded space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hundreds of new customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And out of that, there were 120 -150 customers that were new to Intel as a result of that. So what we see is converting of our existing embedded customers to Atom based designs and another newer generation of products. Then we also see new customers coming in where we're taking architectural share in embedded from power and to some extent from MIPS, the higher end products that sell in those segments. I think that continues as we share our system-on-chip roadmaps with embedded customers. That allows them to be able to do all these solutions with high performance on one single product, one single-chip product. And to me, this is just a &#x2013; you know, we've been in embedded for 25 years. And these are long design cycles, but then the design cycles play out for a long time in terms of production and that's why the business tends to give you a very nice gross margin profile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then as my follow-up if I could, you made reference to the fact that the usage models are really starting to find themselves as it pertains to netbooks. Can you give us some insight as to what you're seeing in sales trends for netbooks, particularly as it pertains to developed economies, developing economies, et cetera ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are still principally developed economies or Tier 1 cities in emerging markets in places like Shanghai or Beijing. I think that you'll start seeing that spread into more emerging markets as the global economy recovers and system price points continue to come down. The primary usage models that we've studied in places where there is the highest buyer satisfaction is where they align around a principally Internet based model. When people try to do 3D games on these things or try to run their Office applications on them, they tend to think it's a bit slow. And that isn't just the processor, it's the entire architecture. So I think you're seeing a model emerge that is a third usage category and that's likely to be &#x2013; to have a higher contrast between those products and notebooks as the ultra-thin products come to market.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First question is on the Atom. How much has the advent of the carrier and selling those through that channel helped the Atom sales in the second quarter and how do you see that playing out going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It hasn't had a &#x2013; I can't use the word material here. It's not the driver at this point in terms of sales to date. We see a tremendous amount of interest from the carriers in conjunction with both OEM and ODMs to participate in this business. I think in 2010, that's likely to be a large part of the business. You've seen some very interesting existence points of this. There was a Best Buy Sprint netbook ad last week at $0.99 if you signed up for two years I think it was. And you'll start seeing more of that. But I don't think that's the prime driver. I know it's not the prime driver to date. You'll start seeing more of that into the holiday season this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my follow-on question is given the fact that inventory up and down the food chain is pretty lean, you guided to sub-seasonal growth in Q3. I was just wondering what's the hesitation to your more normal seasonal growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two comments to that, Gus; first of all, keep in mind Q3 you typically see an inventory build into seasonal patterns. And then secondly, it's really just an indication of a continued expectation that the enterprise market will stay weak in Q3, and frankly we expect that throughout the second half of this year. We're not anticipating client sales in the enterprise to pick up this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So effectively, the build happened a little bit earlier in terms of seasonal builds in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The expectation is there will be a bit more build in Q3 in anticipation of an even higher Q4. That's how seasonal patterns work, but that's in the seasonal comparisons.</p>
