          <p>Good morning or good afternoon, I am Moira the conference call operator for this conference. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services results reporting for the nine months to the September 30, 2010 Analyst Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only mode, as the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Debra Broek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello everyone, and come to Zurich's nine months results call. This is the Q&amp;A session for analysts and investors. And I hope you all had the opportunity to view the video online that we put online at 7 a.m. And now, without further ado, I would like to turn it over to our CFO, Dieter Wemmer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon and good morning for the ones who are dialing in from the states. I hope you had time to look at our analyst presentation and the technology it work to your expectation. I would just start with a very few short messages, and then we go straight into the Q&amp;A section.</p>
          <p>We feel it is still a strong core business return, actually when I look at the ROE number for the core business, it only was 14.3%, above our target ROE, it is still a very good number. Our Global Life segment is adding further to the new business value, a very good increase still based on new business growth but more important with very healthy business margin.</p>
          <p>Motor and auto, an unchanged story and generating strong operating margins and good overall results, also certainly benefiting a bit from the low catastrophe quarter we have seen in the U.S. In General Insurance, our strategy I think is working. The renewal rate increases are continuing, and they could improve our underlying loss ratio, which is the focus of our General Insurance strategy for 2010.</p>
          <p>Having said that we have also to recognize that based on our accounting procedures, we impaired our goodwill for Russia by 100 million, which is then reducing the business operating profit of General Insurance.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet remains strong, and I'm absolutely convinced that our economic solvency position is even stronger actually as maybe the number is showing. And then I would make one last remark about our dividends for next year.</p>
          <p>Based on changes in the Swiss tax law and current situation of local accounting policies, we will be able to pay the dividend for 2010 out of the additional paid-in capital. That is a quite sizable fund we have there. So that will allow us the dividend free of withholding tax, and then depending on the tax situation and the tax environment in particular of our investors and shareholders, it might be even tax free or at a reduced income tax depending on the situation.</p>
          <p>So with this introductory remark, I would immediately go into the question and answer. And I'm looking forward to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Mr. Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, thank you very much. Two questions please. On the first one in terms of the economic capital ratio, I guess there is two parts, and one is I think you implied stronger than the number would suggest. I wondered if you could just sort of expand on what you meant by that? And the second part of that one is I think I saw a headline earlier saying that you thought the Swiss Solvency Test position was still above 200%. And I'm just trying to reconcile in my mind what the gap between that and your own economic capital model is. Obviously the confidence interval is different, which I guess explains a lot of it, but could you maybe talk us through some of the other reconciling items? And then the second thing is, in terms of the pricing trends on slide 9 I think it is, how do the increases in renewal rates you're putting through compare to your expectations of future claims costs. In other words, how of much of a net impact would you expect these rate increases to have on the combined ratio, once they are fully pass through? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you much Spencer for that. That are two very good questions, and I would have been disappointed when you would not be the first in line. So starting with the economic solvency, and my remark is actually referring to the fact throughout all of this competing solvency regimes, which we are now seeing in Europe such as Solvency II, which we have now filled in as prescribed exercise; the Swiss Solvency Test, SST, which we are filing now regularly and we have just filed our half-year number a week ago. So therefore I think we are now getting a much broader overview of the various calculation modules. And we are recognizing what we do in our internal model for the, in particular, for the asset liability mismatch risk.</p>
          <p>We are very conservative in our own model. And we are including a stress buffer in our model, which allows us to stand for a very long period even if interest rates go down to zero, which is a obviously a very expensive calculation for the Life balance sheets after the maturity of the existing bond portfolio.</p>
          <p>So and that is what I mean when saying that our solvency actually looks better than the number, we are not &#x2013; we have just completed our calculation as we did in all of the last quarters. So therefore, I think I should highlight that this is creating more volatility and the Swiss Solvency Test, which is still at a very healthy level. I must say that gives a bit the difference and therefore I don't see any change for us in changing our risk appetite for organic or potential strategic expansion.</p>
          <p>So your second question, the pricing trends in General I think of course we would like to see a bit better pricing in the U.S. but everybody would like to see this. At least we managed in the third quarter that the number is zero for the U.S. and not falling any more. But that is certainly the market who probably needs to go into positive territory going forward. And I think as some of the competitors are now also in their Q3 announcement recognizing that the interest environment is staying at the disappointing low levels. I hope that they all get now more to their senses.</p>
          <p>In Europe, I think we show improving results so therefore the rate increases are doing what they are supposed to do and if you look at our underlying loss ratio in the overall mixture, our underlying loss ratio improved by 100 basis points, which is a very good number in this environment and is for us absolutely no reason to be depressed about the future outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And I wonder if you could be just a little bit more specific on what the, how one would get from 114% economic capital on your own model to the 200% SST. Is it a question of the confidence interval and you're suggesting that your own model is more conservative than the SST on asset liability mismatch risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the SST is a different set up as model as such. It is a different confidence interval, naturally it is a BBB versus an AA calibration, but there are also some specific rules in it which we have not adopted for our internal model. That would be probably a 60 minute detailed presentation to do all the spreadsheets and that is really something for the technical experts. I don't want to do this now on the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi there. Sorry to go back to the economic capital ratio again. Are you able to give us any color as to &#x2013; I'm assuming this has recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter, given interest rates have gone up. And also, just trying to understand, in effect are you double counting interest rate risk in the Life business because obviously your available financial resources would have fallen because of negative variance on the VIS but you're also increasing the capital requirement associated with ALM risk. I just understand why that isn't effectively double counting the interest &#x2013; impact of interest rates but maybe you could clarify. The only other very short question was: You've obviously taken out some, reduced the component of senior debt because it is nearing maturity. What is your general approach to thinking about leverage and whether you'd be looking to refinance that. And the final issue is at least in Germany, there was quite a big deterioration Q3 on Q2 and Q1 in profitability of the non-life business. Can you give us any color behind what is going on in Germany? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That is a lot of questions. So let me start with the double counting. It is not really a double counting on the interest rates because the risk is reflective of today's spot rates or to be precise, September 30 spot rates, where the risk capital covers you for further movements in the interest rate. And certainly when interest rates are 4% and then you build the scenario what capital you need when interest rates fall 200 basis points &#x2013; that is from 4 to 2, much cheaper than from 2% to 0%. That is for people who know how discounting &#x2013; discounted cash flows work have experienced this already quite often.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a main driver. And our internal model, we are sometimes getting criticized that we have a model which includes senior debt, but we only include long-term senior debt. And if maturities are less than 12 months, we take it automatically out, although the senior debt of course is only maturing in nine or ten months from now. So therefore whether we refinance we will then decide at this point in time when we look at our numbers next spring. So I cannot make any statement about it. But I think that that should not be actually too concerning for everybody as we are still, I think, on one hand in a very healthy number, very conservative model and a very good balance sheet position in general.</p>
          <p>The German question, it is true that Germany is performing this year not as good as it did the last six years, but I must say it is less the accident year result. We did book additional reserves in Q2 for professional liability business and also in Q3 for another segment of the professional liability business we booked additional reserves. And therefore we don't see this as a overall major shift. The personal lines business is still doing quite fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Marc Thiele from UBS, again. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have three questions all related to growth. My first question is on Global Life. Can you provide some detail on the maturing Life book? If I look at the presentation slides, there seems to be 21 billion of net inflows and 17 billion of outflows, which by coincidence is the same number as for the half-year, which I find odd, but then if I take the 3.7 billion in &#x2013; earlier in the slides, it suggests that there have been only 0.8 billion of net inflows. APE has also been down 4%. Maybe you can give us some numbers related to the maturity coming through in the Life book.</p>
          <p>Then secondly on Farmers, the surplus ratio came in at 45.8, which is significantly ahead of the target corridor, but what percentage would you anticipate is scaling back of the reinsurance contract? And then thirdly, General Insurance, another quarter with a 6% year-on-year decline in premiums. You reflect in your earlier comments the U.S. pricing environment. At what stage would you anticipate some volume growth to come through or should we just anticipate it will be pretty flat going forward for the time being?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mark. That's &#x2013; let me start with inflow, outflow question. I must say I did not see that the numbers are exactly the same as the half-year, but I think the foreign currency moved quite a bit from half year to nine months, as the numbers here are not the average rates that are probably spot rates so therefore that is not surprising. The in and outflows, that is not only maturities, that is, I think, also cancellations from single premium product so there is a wide diversity of input factors to these two numbers and to drill it down into the various categories that I certainly we could see what we could send to you, but I'm not able now to drill this down by markets. But I think overall the total net number is still a very positive one. And we continue to mature more in the old guaranteed businesses and have the shift to our new product range, which is in the end what we want to achieve.</p>
          <p>So the surplus ratio for Farmers has developed very strongly, I think driven by two effects, the multi-line rates we did drive through to improve the multi-line combined ratio or loss ratio in particular, and the third quarter was very light in weather-related events and the U.S. also compared to previous years. Therefore, the Farmer surplus is growing nicely. And we will then most likely reduce the quota share at the beginning of the next year. And the final number of this reduction we will then determine based on the experience with, over the next quarter, how's the surplus ratio developing and then of course the appetite of the exchanges, what retention do they want to run themselves.</p>
          <p>Your volume question, I think that in the third quarter particularly we saw more volume reductions in Europe. The U.S. actually had a small positive because we had hundred million portfolio transfer as an additional premium income in the U.S., which certainly helped the income line. I think we are clearly focusing on our profitability and underwriting results comes always first and top line second.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Brian Shea from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please. First of all, I really struggled to model correctly your, the solvency ratio coming out of your own internal model, and I typically get caught off-guard by interest rate moments. If you have published the sensitivity of your economic model to interest movements in the past, I really missed that and I wonder if you could just explain what the sensitivity is. I think you were suggesting that the net effect on available financial resources if interest rates go down is that they go up? But it sounds like the RBC goes up by more than that. But Dieter if you could just elaborate on that I'd be grateful.</p>
          <p>And then my second question is on investment yield. In the non-life segment, for example, it looks like you're running yield is running at about 3.4%, and I was wondering if you could just say how that compares to the rate at which you are putting new money to work. Obviously, I've got to figure out how your yield is going to progress going forward and to give some help on that, what is new money going into and at what rate would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Brian, actually if you would be able to model the economic solvency and its sensitivity you would immediately get a job with us. Our experts are letting the computer run for two weeks in a row to determine the final number. If you would find a way to shorten this, I would be really appreciative. So the stochastic models with all the variance, which is being calculated between the various risk classes are very complex tool, and I don't think that there is a back-of-the-envelope calculation to understand it completely.</p>
          <p>The interest sensitivities, of course, we try to model, but there is certainly in the current yield environment the last 10 basis points has the biggest impact, but it's when an option is certainly deeper in the money then the effects are getting much stronger or more out of the money, that is in both cases in the extreme and it's going like this.</p>
          <p>And we are testing very conservative scenarios here. On the investment yield, I think our investment policy is in the end very transparent and for GI on average of 5 to &#x2013; you pick the number from the yield curve 5 to 6 years and you go for AA corporate in average and then it depends on whether we match the Euro, Swiss franc or dollar liabilities and that is the yield what we are achieving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. If I could just follow up on the first point then, am I right in saying that interest rates go down, available financial resources on balance go up a little bit, but the RBC goes up more, is that in a very broad sense the way the mechanics work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is in a broad sense the mechanics work because despite our duration matching on the &#x2013; actually on the General Insurance side, there is nothing moving. That is very much independent of the yield environment, but on the Life side, as I said, when you have interest guarantees still out, even if you have much smaller portfolios than many others, the complexity of an interest guarantee will actually when the interest rates continue to fall, even when you were in a matching position before, you are moving to an unmatched position, and that will create that effect is what you are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, all right. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from <mark type="inaudible" /> from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, gentleman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just two questions actually. Firstly, I mean you correctly point out that you've had a massive drop in volumes in your European businesses, particularly in the last two quarters, and I'm just wondering &#x2013; I mean with the 3% price increase and then a 7% drop in volume year-to-date, I mean that is a massive drop in potential policy counts, is that correct? And I'm just wondering what impact you expect that to have on your expense ratio going forward and how you are dealing with that. That's question number one.</p>
          <p>And question two is in your Life business. You're getting exceptionally strong growth on an APE basis, double-digit in some markets together with very strong improvements in profitability. Now is that because, so firstly how are you able to achieve that level of growth in markets such as the UK and Germany? And secondly, is the profitability just an interest rate effect on your link business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. No, you are right. We are facing in Europe in the personal lines business is clearly also drops in policies in-force. But there is also still a reduction going on that people are reducing coverage because of the economic environment. I think in countries like Spain that is certainly a move you can see where comprehensive cover is being replaced by third-party liability only in Motor. And in the UK and Italy, we have also deliberately reduced policies in-force because the focus is clearly to get this business back to profitability. Actually, Italy it's working already nicely after a few quarters of negative results. The third quarter 2010 stand alone was a positive <mark type="inaudible" /> number produced by Italy and that is a sign that the strategy is in this respect working. In UK we have still to continue to achieve the same in the Motor business.</p>
          <p>In the Life business, well on one hand, I think there is a bigger market in Life, and we are starting from a smaller market share. Secondly, you actually see an increase in savings quota in many countries, also the countries where the economy is, in general, in a dire condition. So that offers also more opportunities for the Life business. And I think we have a number of very good niches develop where we can grow and new niches to come. I think the Corporate Life and Pension business is probably at the moment our most successful distribution channel and still far behind our market position we have in Corporate Business and General Insurance. So if you consider this gap, there is still a long way to go, which we see as an opportunity still.</p>
          <p>And then our &#x2013; setting up our new operation in the U.S., preparing the start of a few low-risk product lines, but where we feel where we can attract attractive business, it's starting soon. The regulatory approval processes for the product are close to completion. And we bought this license in Indonesia, so we didn't buy the small company because we saw this as an M&amp;A deal. We saw it much more as a buying a license in the Indonesian Life market. And we are committed to do a good organic investment in this country and see a lot of growth opportunities, which will then add when other growth opportunities are maturing and delivering lower growth numbers. And that is actually the strategy we run at the moment, which should allow us to keep this fine balance between very healthy profit margin and a good growth number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just come back on those points, if &#x2013; just on the first points about policy count. Are you confident that your expense ratio will basically remain flat because of your cost efficiency programs or do you not see a pressure on unit costs with the volume reductions? I just wanted to be just be clear on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think that is a &#x2013; you are right. There is a natural pressure on unit cost. But I think that is a challenge for the organization. And I think certainly on December 2, on the Investor Day, we will also explore this area a bit more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just secondly, more of a comment than a question, you sound quite bullish on your Life business, compared to your non-life business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that depends. If you look at top line, then it is much easier to be bullish on the Life business because that is a business, which is certainly not damaged by the economic environment. On the General Insurance side, our commercial customers are buying insurance in reflection of the economic environment and as long as their own business activities are not growing they will also not buy more insurance. However, I believe that we are in a great position because we start to focus on underwriting results much earlier because we were strong believers that the falling interest rate is a consequence of the economic environment and therefore not happening by surprise.</p>
          <p>Our whole company was prepared for it right from the beginning. And I think if you go back, we started to talk about it actually already end of 2008, that we said yield, it's not something to rely on, we need underwriting results. And we will continue to work on in this direction and will probably even increase the speed of how we are doing this.</p>
          <p>And therefore I think it's a very good reason to be optimistic because with a strong balance sheet in our background I think we can be very relaxed what is happening in our industry and then let's see.</p>

          <p>Hi, thank you very much. Dieter, sorry, I did want to come back to the capital question and just follow-up on your answer to Brian because I'm not quite clear. With regard to slide 28, which shows the calculation of your available financial resources. I'm confused about the why the value of in-force adjustments has stayed unchanged at 17 billion, which is the same as what it was at the end of June. Because it seems to me quite simply, your shareholders' equity has been supported by a meaningful amount from the fall in yields, so there's been a positive development there. Meanwhile, we know from your embedded value disclosure that there's a negative relationship to falling yields economically speaking. And we also know from what you said earlier that there basically shouldn't be any impact, let's say, from the non-life side. So I don't understand why the surplus value of that 17 billion hasn't fallen in the third quarter. And I appreciate that it is complicated, but I would have hoped there is a sort of rule of thumb that we could think about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very quick answer because the small reduction from interest rates got compensated by the new business value. So we have a growing book in force so to speak. And the sensitivity of the MCV against the interest rate is much smaller than the stress testing what we do at the end of the interest rate curve.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I may also ask, with your CFO Forum hat on as well as your Zurich hat on, during the presentation in the webcast you talked about introducing a liquidity premium following your CFO Forum decision, could you clarify for us what that decision has been? And dare I ask also if you could share with us the outcome of the Quiz 5 run that you've done so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the process on the Quiz 5 is that it is being first filed with the regulator, and I think as an industry we agreed that we would not talk about preliminary results before. The liquidity premium that is in MCV, exactly the same process and formula as in the Quiz 5 procedure. So that is &#x2013; let me remember the formula, I think the discount rate is roughly: swap minus 11 basis points plus liquidity premium. And the liquidity premium is tested against the corporate bond portfolio, minus the CDS spreads observed in the market. And then you get a proxy for liquidity premium, which then goes into some additional refined calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dare I ask on the Quiz 5 subject given that you're chair of the CFO Forum, C-Ops is going to take quite a long time to go public on their full accumulation of what the outcome of Quiz 5 is well into next year? If it's possible to discuss with your regulators whether the CFO Forum can give some comfort to the market about the outcome ahead of that, maybe by end of this year, I for one will be very interested.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is certainly discussions we will have, but I think at the moment people are just finalizing the numbers and filing it. So it will probably still take some weeks before we go into it. But you have always to remember here we are a Swiss-based group. And for us the group solvency is calculated based on the Swiss solvency test, and we have a few large subsidiaries in the EU, where all our GI business is on the Irish carrier so that it's really one legal entity, which has a really good risk profile under the Solvency II considerations. And then the few Life balance sheets we have in the EU. So therefore, our concern has to be always to look good and very good under the Swiss solvency test and that is what we are doing.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr Stefan Schuermann from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Mr. Wemmer, just have a question on the dividend payment and fungibility. I think there is obviously a headwind from local regulators in terms of capital requirements and I just wanted to maybe ask you to give an update on that issue, knowing that you are basically merging your units in Ireland and Europe. But I mean &#x2013; it's just a general view I mean to get a feel what's going on here and what's your take on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry Stefan, do you mean from the subsidiaries to the holding company or from the holding company to the shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both. I think with &#x2013; we have a very strong centralized solvency capital management and cash flow management established for the whole group for the last years. So therefore I think we are in a very good position as a company with our internal cash flows. And the dividends to the outside world I think we have &#x2013; the holding company has plenty of room in retained earnings, and as I said in the beginning we can now according to the Swiss tax law, also pay out paid-in capital and that means our theoretical funds for paying dividends are quite big.</p>
          <p>So that should not stop us and when we go to the regulatory approvals &#x2013; well with a solvency run ratio of 245%, which is still the formal decision area for whether you can pay a dividend, yes or no, I think we are in safe territory.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Paul Goodhind from Redburn Partners. Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Hi Dieter? I had a few questions if I can. Just on the reserve movements, you mentioned workers compensation in the U.S. is an area of increase. And I know that there are lots of moving parts here, but could you quantify the size of that increase and maybe just discuss the context, whether you see that as that part of a trend. When these long tail lines tend to sort of deteriorate. They can often be kind of the start of something bigger, is that a concern? And maybe you can say whether it's case reserves or IBNR that you've increased.</p>
          <p>And then related point to that you're still releasing a decent amount of reserves from prior years, what's going in at the front end? And I'm just trying to get a feel for whether the overall level of conservatism, say at September, was the same or similar to the level at the end of last year to get a feel for how the overall reserve aggregate has changed over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>And then lastly on Farmers, I think you said that the volumes in Q3 were down 4% in terms of premiums of which half was due to 21st Century and half was the underlying development. What's the volume price breakdown of that negative 2%? And looking forward to next year is kind of flat overall growth the best expectation or do you think you can actually grow the top line again in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks so much, Paul. The reserve movements as usually is a big combination of positives and negatives. I have already mentioned that we did strengthen in Germany some reserves. And in the U.S. to be very precise here the workers comp reserve got strengthened by $159 million. And that is I think also in anticipation of what is happening here. I think we are still doing fine in this line, but I think that is certainly something where I don't see any room to release reserves from this line of business. And we try to be careful here with our reserve actions and that is what we are doing. On Farmers, yes, you understood me correctly. The Q3 stand-alone was minus 4.3%. Roughly half and half between the exchanges and 21st Century.</p>
          <p>21st Century as the direct business is actually developing absolutely in line with our expectations, but we bought also with this acquisition an agent business where we did say right from the beginning of the acquisition there is a lot of poor quality business in it. And therefore we are losing volume on this, and nobody is unhappy about this lost volume. The Farmers exchanges itself, the shrinking is actually doing a bit better than in the earlier quarters this year. I think actually in August we stabilized the policy in-force count in particular in Motor because that is where we see the reduction, and also the October numbers continue to go in the right direction. So therefore we assume that we achieved somewhere mid 2011 the turning point between shrinking and growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And just to come back on the overall reserve adequacy, can you just give a qualitative feel as to whether the front end conservatism that you're building in for this year is balanced by the prior year releases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, according to the presentation our Chief Actuary did yesterday to the</p>
          <p>Audit Committee of the Group, it is unchanged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had a couple of questions. One on Russia, I remember Q2 you said there was going to be an improvement in Russia now you've taken a goodwill write-down. I just wondered what happened between August and now? Second, I really probably, going back to that economic solvency calculation, I see the negative 2% for the dividend. I don't see a positive for the earnings. I don't understand and the earnings presumably are a bit higher than the dividend in the quarter but maybe that's me kind of a thing. And then there was I read somewhere that there was extremely bad weather in the U.S. in October. And I just wondered if you can give us a feel for that because you would have picked it up from both reinsuring Farmers and on your Commercial business? Thank you. Oh, and the final one. You know you just put in more money in New China Life, I just wondered what the impact on solvency of that would be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That is a tour through the whole book. Then going backwards. New China Life is in our books and available for sale equity holding that means that capital required for it is like any other $400 million investment in a stock index. The weather events in October in the U.S., I haven't seen any specific numbers. We had actually in September a number of large losses in Canada and also U.S. I think there was some flooding in the St. Louis area, which contributed to the increase in the Life loss number in this third quarter. Russia, yes, there were, I think, operationally we make some progress, but we review our intangibles always in the third quarter that goes through a defined procedure. There is an impairment testing for the goodwill as being prescribed by IFRS.</p>
          <p>And then you roll the things forward and then you have to book whatever comes out of this calculation. And I think that &#x2013; your question on the economic solvency, yes, the Neot is included in the AFR as base equity, where the dividend accrual of course is not an equity position or a balance sheet position. Therefore, we are showing it separately. We have not done this in prior years. So, therefore, I think it is important to see that we are deducting it already and not assuming it has to stay in the books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just on the earnings &#x2013; maybe I am completely out of it, but would there not be a positive somewhere then? In the roll forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is concluded in this AFR which has more movement and then there is a special disclosure available in the whole AFR where the net earnings are clearly included because it starts with the reported shareholders' equity, which includes the earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I understand. And just a general comment, I've seen a number of investors recently and we have now had &#x2013; this is the third quarter where I'm thinking could do better. And I could do a lot better, and Zurich is actually doing very well. But it's relative to the high-standards we expect at Zurich. There seem to be little misses here and there like the German, which must have been a huge number because Germany to go from 92% at six months and 99 at nine months &#x2013; must have been a big number. Anyway, I just wondered, is there something we're missing in terms of, is someone going around behind our backs saying, do it like this and we're going to flip this and flip that. It does seems weird. We're seeing a lot of noise, something I hadn't been used to with Zurich in the past or maybe I hadn't paid attention. I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we feel that the underlying profitability is still strong. We are position the business for the future. I'm absolutely aware that we are disappointing you with our announcement today. Therefore, we have called it ourselves a mixed performance. And yes I think the management team is absolutely committed to do better and not speaking to a mixed performance because that is not good enough and I agree with you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Andrew Broadfield from Barclays.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Dieter. Just a few questions but simple ones. I'm just trying to understand a little better how we should think about your economic model and surplus or potential surplus capital. It seems to me the way you're phrasing or encouraging us to look at your economic model is that it really is at the top end of sort of conservatism in terms of the stress buffers that you have put in, which was all fine. But should we continue to think that you want to hold 120% under any scenario as a minimum or as a sort of top end of your range? Or is there actually some more flexibility in there now that we should be thinking about in terms of what you feel like you need to hold. So that's one question. And just on the back of that you talked about your interest rate stress buffer in particular and as you move, as interest rates move lower &#x2013; the deeper into the money that you go on those guarantees, for example, the more sensitive your sensitivity becomes. But presumably when interest rates get close to 2%, that sensitivity is sort of floored if you like. Where would that floor take you in terms of your solvency coverage and would it take you below 100 for example? So that's one slightly long question.</p>
          <p>Another one, just can you give us a quick update on the U.S. tax situation from your perspective if possible, if indeed there is any development? And then finally, on the reserving, just to follow-up on I think it was Paul's question, just if you can give us a sense of what you have or what you continue to put into future assumptions around things like inflation. Is it the sort of the same sort of assumptions that you've had for the last four or five years or is it taking more into account what's happened or are you putting more conservatism in for potential shock inflation spikes or hits. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Starting with this economic solvency, this 140 number is already after deducting the buffer for this stressed interest rate. So that is the reason why the number did go down so substantially, if you want to say so, since the beginning of the year. And what we are thinking is we have now to look at how the other models like Solvency II and Swiss solvency test are dealing with this question. And that is what we need to discuss then internally and see whether we have to come up with some revision to our own model, otherwise we might create a misleading KPI for your review. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Dieter if I can just very quickly on that before we move on. So there is the potential, I'm not saying this is what you will do, but there is the potential that you revise the model to be more consistent perhaps with the regulatory approach or approaches that may cause an uplift in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That review is certain, it's at the moment going on in our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second point is on the U.S. taxes. I assume you are referring to the Neal Bill proposal. That is still undecided and certainly I think that Congress is now re-established in its membership. And therefore we cannot make any statements in which direction this will go under the new membership of Congress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Within &#x2013; sorry, sorry, Dieter just to cut in more on this sensitivity. Have you &#x2013; are there contingency plans? Or have you identified any opportunities or ways to manage this should it go away from you, I'm not suggesting that it will. But or is it straightforward that there's relatively, there is a sort of binary situation with this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's much more complex than binary because even when Neal Bill would be established at one of the latest drafts was, it did not create too much worry for us. So therefore, I think we should, we don't have this as a top priority item on our list.</p>
          <p>The reserving and inflation assumptions. In general, we have capped it unchanged. Although of course, when I mentioned the number for Workers' Comp that includes also an uplift of inflation assumption within this line of business, which is mainly medical inflation driven and has nothing to do with the general inflation in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks ever so much Dieter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we can take one last question because we have consumed the time now almost completely. Okay, that -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do we have the final question on the line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Mr. Fabrizio Croce from Kepler. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And thank you very much for giving this great opportunity. And the answer, the question is very simple in October every CFO in Switzerland get a letter with the approval or the denial or the partial approval of the SST model. Now the question is you highlighted 200%. I heard before Spencer saying that he is still expecting this is to be true. Now the question is, is it &#x2013; so do you reconfirm that the model is above 200% and is your model actually approved by SST? That's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second one is, about the dividend and still I'm sorry for that. But when you say that you could pay out a dividend from the paid-in capital &#x2013; do you point to some sort of payment in the form of so called <mark type="inaudible" /> or will it still be in cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh no, it's &#x2013; we pay our dividends always in cash and paid-in capital is &#x2013; was in classical terms was called agile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. So it's not that you will change the form. The form will be in cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. It will be a cash dividend, and we will pay it at 100% and there will be no withholding tax.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Wonderful. And the third one is about the lawsuit, which you are expecting. I mean what caught me a little bit in surprise is not the fact that you have a lawsuit. It happens, every company, large cap has it. So you win lawsuit and you lose lawsuit, but the last one was pretty expensive. And so the question is, looking forward within the past two, three years, how many of these surprises do you expect actually per year? Or is it now really a one-off, which we will not see recur for the next past &#x2013; next five years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Fabrizio, I would really like to stress the point. It was not a lawsuit. It was a settlement, and I think it was a very rational decision. You might call it in an irrational environment. But I think that was a settlement, which I think is protecting us and getting a potential problem out of our way, and we can focus on our business which is much more important. I don't think that we have any frequency of similar cases planned or budgeted for the next years. And this type of things can happen. You can never 100% exclude it, but I think we feel pretty good about our processes and governance in general.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But, sorry, what did ignite actually the settlement? Was it really something spontaneous or I mean there must be something, which &#x2013; what was the starting point actually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, a rationale decision.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is a settlement, is always a deliberate and freewill decision between two parties. And probably in Europe we would have gone the other route.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
