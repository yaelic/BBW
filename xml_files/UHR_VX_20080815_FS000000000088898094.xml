          <p>Good afternoon, this is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Swatch Group Ltd. Half Year Results 2008 Conference Call for Financial Analysts. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Hayek, Jr., CEO of the Swatch Group. Please go ahead sir.</p>

          <p>Hello ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference. This time we have a reduced team around the table. It's Mr. Geiser who is with me, Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Darwish, responsible for the Electronic Systems. Marc Hayek and Arlette Emch are on business trips to make a fantastic further business and Mr. D&#xFC;rr is on holiday. And I just came back from Beijing especially to be here only to respond to your questions and then I head again back to Beijing to the Olympic Games.</p>
          <p>So let's not lose too much time. You have seen our communication, our results and as always I am sure you have some interesting questions and we hope to be able to respond to all of your questions. Please go ahead. Hello?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Mr. Jon Cox from Landesbanki Kepler. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the call. I have a couple of questions I probably have quite a few more, but I am sure some of my colleagues have a lot of questions as well.</p>
          <p>My first question is on the tax rate in the first half of the year. It looks much lower and I am wondering if you think it's sustainable for the year as a whole? And obviously that links into the net financial loss we saw. I wonder if you can just give us some details on that, that's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is on; you're talking about maybe some of the orders won't be filled until next year. I wonder if you could just give us a bit more color on that? Is it really just very high-end watches or is it across the board where you think that you won't be able to fill those orders until next year?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is just on a potential buyback, you're obviously, your current buyback program is running down relatively quickly and what do you have planned for any further buyback after the current program runs down? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jon for these questions. Let me start with the orders first. It's true that our order books are full and we have still capacity problems, we have invested a lot of money in increasing the capacity, but we are still not there where we would like to be. And when we say perhaps, some of the orders we can only fulfill in the next year, this is mainly for the very high-end, of course. If you take the lower-end, the mid range and the upper range, with some exceptions on the very successful new calibers of Omega, I think most of the orders can be fulfilled towards the second half of this year. Of course, if the orders continue to come in as much as we see now, okay, then we have of course again another problem, but it's a good problem to have. But if we talk about delivery of some product next year only, this is mainly the very high end. So that's for this question.</p>
          <p>Then the buyback, Mr. Geiser can respond to this and then I will respond to the tax issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in fact you are right. The buyback program current running of total of 420 million as approved by our Board of Directors is close to being completed, most probably by the end of August. Whether or not and in what extent a new buyback program is going to be made is fully at the discretion of our Board of Directors, who will talk about this subject in their next meetings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But let me add, since I'm convinced, if I look now at the stock market and I see that so good companies like ours are so -- let's say, it's very low in the market capitalization at the moment, if I look at the stock market. But I'm confident that now the people see that we are and continue to be in a good trend that the stock price is going up. So it will be more difficult for us to think about a buyback program perhaps. So let's see what the stock market is doing in the future. We are hoping it goes in the right direction, up.</p>
          <p>Let me come to the tax issue. Some of you have been there four years ago, I remember Athens Olympics, now we have Beijing. And I remember my first day in this company, at the Olympics I was before here -- but I was at the Olympics and we have these nice reports in Financial Times and in Wall Street Journal, where they were talking about tax issues all over the newspapers. And of course, in the consequences of this, we had all kind of tax reviews, tax surprises. You cannot imagine how many people of Mr. Geiser's department had to work extra time. If we could bill this today it would be fantastic.</p>
          <p>So over the years, of course, and you have seen this perhaps in the papers, we have had some small amounts of reserves concerning taxes. And now in the first half of this year, we got some of these transfer price issues solved totally, as we have always said, there is no issue, there is no problematic. So we have decided there is no reason anymore to have this relatively small amount, dissolved. So you will have a tax rate probably at the end of the year as we have now foreseen in this half-year. Does this respond to your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does. I wonder if I can just go a little bit more then on to the financial loss we saw in H1.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know it was weighting down. Can you just give us a bit more color on...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that the stock markets everywhere in the world are down. So if somebody has in his portfolio, the Swatch Group, for example, they will face about 30% less value on this stock. So it's a momentary situation. And if we look at our portfolio, we manage a part of our cash in investing into the stock market in a reasonable way.</p>
          <p>So we have prime quality shares. Nestle for example, but we have also shares in Xin Yu. Xin Yu is our partner in China. It's the biggest retail chain developing very well. They will -- I think on 28th of August communicate the half-year results. I'm not allowed to talk about it, but since we are in the Board of Directors I can tell you that their results are exceptionally good because the economy is very good over there. We have the normal trends. These shares went down like the whole Hong Kong market by about 30%. And since we decided once that we put these shares into our marked-to-market, Mr. Geiser is helping me. He is the finance boss. We put it in marked-to-market. If we have gains we show gains. Okay. Fantastic. If we have a situation where the market shows market value at the stock market less, we have to show this.</p>
          <p>So that's the only reason, but this will not change our policy towards Xin Yu, biggest retailer. We will maintain our 8% participation. The outlook is fantastic and already now if we look in August, the situation of our portfolio of shares, we have already gone upwards. So at the end of the year, you will see also on the net profit of the Swatch Group again, an increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Erwan Rambourg, HSBC. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Erwan Rambourg from HSBC in London. Three questions, if I can.</p>
          <p>Firstly, regarding the Olympics, going back to Beijing, we've seen a good EBIT expansion in your watch division, despite the Olympic push. Should we consider that part of the costs are still to be taken in H2 or is this just an allocation; you've spent more on Olympics and less elsewhere?</p>
          <p>Second question is on M&amp;A; we've seen stakes being taken in brands like Hublot, Roger Dubuis, Girard-Perregaux, recently. You've expanded more into distribution with Deaxenue and Rivoli. Do you consider that your brand portfolio is now full or did you consider that the brands I mentioned were not complementary to your portfolio or too expensive or whatever else reason not to look at them? And in M&amp;A, are you still looking at expanding into jewelry?</p>
          <p>Finally, third question is on the EBIT margin for production, you were mentioning order books are full, so capacity problems. Should we consider that the production EBIT margin is sustainable, if not expandable in the months or years to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for your questions. Now the first one, you said despite the Olympics. I think the Olympics is a good positive point. So the development of the margin increased to 21% despite the favorable exchange rate and increased gold prices and diamond prices. It's first of all not due that we have spent less marketing. No, no, no, no, we have not spent less marketing, our marketing spend has increased. It is because of our good performance in all brands, of our cost control and because of the mix change. Some brands are selling a better mix, a mix that is giving us more profit, and then of course, we have done some price increases but not very much. During the year we had some slight price adaptations, which will have a full impact during the whole year.</p>
          <p>And when you talk about the second half of the year, of course we will have marketing expenses of Olympics, since Olympics are happening in August, now at the moment. And Omega has a fantastic visibility, has done a great job. You have perhaps all seen that the opening ceremony was exactly the advertising campaign of Omega. They worked with the same elements and that shows that Omega has on the point understood what China wants, and what the psychology of China is.</p>
          <p>Of course we will have the marketing expenses, the major part of Olympics in the second half, but we will have also a huge benefit from additional sales during the second part, don't think that end -- on the 24th of August Olympics are over and sales will stop of Olympic products. This will continue very strongly especially in China until the end of the year because for these people in China, this is the biggest happening that's ever happened in this country and they are very proud. So we are confident that we will perform better than last year at the end of the year, you will see a further better situation in our profit, in our operating margin. I am very confident.</p>
          <p>The only question is exchange rate. If the exchange rates go where they are today, nearly $0.01 for the dollar, then I can &#x2013; I don't like the word but I can nearly guarantee you that we will have a fantastic operating margin in the second half despite marketing expenses that are higher because of the Olympic games. But we will have also have huge opportunities to sell more.</p>
          <p>And let's not forget with Omega, we have not just Olympics, James Bond is also there in November. And that's another big asset for Omega to make a step forward as they have already done in the first half of the year. Does this respond to your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the second one, mergers and acquisitions, you see, you have forgotten about Tiffany. Tiffany we gave a very good example. We spent not one single Swiss franc or dollar to make an acquisition of that brand name for watches. And what we can do is we have a 30 years contract. We have full autonomy to develop the range of products that we want, especially also products that are in the range of the jewelry, female products of some competitors. I always name them as Cartier and Bulgari, without spending one single penny in an acquisition. That's not necessary. So we spent the money in investing in the collection, in the distribution, and in the marketing.</p>
          <p>So we have no need. And if I look at our portfolio, I think we have no need to invest the money in buying another brand. But what we are doing is pushing Tiffany forward, pushing the other brands, pushing the industrial base, which unfortunately another company like LVMH is not doing. They acquired a brand name, but they didn't acquire any production facility. And that's where we are very strong.</p>
          <p>And then it's distribution. Why Swatch Group shows these results despite a more difficult environment? Because we have a distribution network that goes into the countries, to the shops, to the consumers and our move with Xin Yu in China very early on and our move with Rivoli is showing that you can have nice brands, but if you don't have the distribution, if you have don't have a control over the distribution, how your product is presented to the final consumer, it's not very helpful. And that's why our strategy continues. We push our brands. We add one or the other one in a clever and intelligent way, as we have done with Tiffany. And on the other hand we continue to invest into production capabilities. We invest in the distribution capabilities of this company, and we invest, of course, in the marketing of the company. So no big merger and acquisition in view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the jewelry front? I remember, in the past you used to mention you would like to expand into that product category?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, jewelry -- we are using jewelry in Breguet, we are using jewelry in Swatch and Calvin Klein very successfully, and Omega has also jewelry. But this a small percentage. If I take Omega and Breguet, that's a very small percentage compared with what they sell in watches. And by the way, the profitability in watches is higher than in jewelry, everybody knows that. Now with Tiffany, we have also an agreement that we can open, so called, Tiffany Watch Stores, with about 30 to 40% jewelry inside, that will be delivered by Tiffany. And this, you will see also finally on our turnover in the Swatch Group. So this is an additional possibility to enter the jewelry market with a very, very strong and professional partner. You still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I am there, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was thinking about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally on the sustainability of the production margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This I let Mr. Geiser, otherwise he looks at me and says now he is responding to everything, he wants to monopolize. I give the word to Mr. Geiser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have no problem at all please believe me. With regard to the EBIT margin, the operating profit margin of the production segment as you have seen in the release, the reason why we have made again an additional increase are, is threefold.</p>
          <p>One, we have very high capacity utilization and there is no reason to believe that this should not -- should decrease, on the contrary. We have full order book. So the production is running at full speed. And even we have backlog to catch up. The mix of product doesn't indicate any change. We have still a strong demand for mechanical movement. So that's another reason why there was and still is a very healthy operating margin. And in one or the other, but very limited elements we were even able to increase also some of the prices, which is an indication that this is not a question of sustainability that we will fight for that and as long as those elements are in place, we have no problem with this margins going into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you see there is one point I would like to add, is that you see the production number, especially for our group, the increased numbers over third parties. And this is mainly due because of the catch-up of Swatch. Swatch has catch-up very strongly and ETA is producing Swatch. Perhaps some -- many of you don't know that, or many knows it, but it's good to remind that. So, Swatch that has an increase in volume very strongly is of course, in good part for this increase for the stronger increase, but also Omega, the new caliber had a huge success. And Omega let these products be produced on a separate production line at ETA. And of course this is a huge increase, but this is also a huge additional value, because these movements are quite expensive. Its quartz movement and they have really been very successful in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just want to make sure I caught your answer to Jon correctly on the tax rate. Did I understand correctly that the H1 rate could be the one we would see over the full year, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will be diluted in as much in the sense that the second half will have a higher tax rate, that the first half has taken advantage of this relaxation of the situation and -- on which a prudent house <mark type="inaudible" /> would provide certain things. And now this is no longer at this rate necessary. However, in the second half, we obviously never know what ever happens. Tax authorities around the world are after amounts that they could cash in. But for the time being, one should count with an average Group tax rate for the second half as opposed to this rather lower tax rate in the first half so it will be a mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So a rate in H2 similar to last year's rate would make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a fight between Mr. Geiser and me. You know we say tax authorities always want more. They always fight to get more and we are here to say no, come on and that's the constant fight that we have here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very useful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. A few questions. My first question coming back to the tax charge and accounting, I believe that there's a release of provision which appears in your cash flow. I see a line called "Changes in provisions, taxes and interest" for minus 150 million. How does that square with the balance sheet? I couldn't find that the corresponding variation in the balance sheet. That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question could you explain what hedging instruments you have in place, if you have any for the remainder of the year for the main currencies?</p>
          <p>And my third question with regards to Mr. Hayek's current trading comments this morning, the July-August trends double-digit was it for the whole Watch division or the Group? And was it broadly inline with H1 and consistent across region? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will start with the -- your third question. I don't know, which statement: the CNBC or the Bloomberg? On Bloomberg I was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The CNBC statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is better, because the Bloomberg, I was angry. He started his comments in saying "Swatch Group has failed by far the expectations of the analysts," and then I got angry and there was no comment at all.</p>
          <p>Okay, yes, I can confirm the July numbers. They are very good. We had double-digit growth in local currencies; again United States was a plus 14 points -- nearly 15% in local currencies for all the brands together in the Unites States of the Swatch Group. And in August, we see even better numbers. I have the numbers of our retail networks and August looks very good. And if I take the exchange rate that in July was miserable, compared to what we see now. If we end the month with something like around one-tenth or one-ninth a dollar, keep the fingers crossed. August will do a fantastic result for the Group. And I maintain certainly double-digit growth in local currencies. This is I can reassure you July and August. And I don't see a reason why it should not continue throughout the end of the year. However, how much this will translate into Swiss franc is depending strongly by the exchange rate of the Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>But the trading statement is right, the numbers are very good. July was good but August looks much better than July that was already good.</p>
          <p>Okay, let's come to the first point, Mr. Geiser.</p>

          <p>Once more the question was regarding the taxes and this time focused on the balance sheet and I would like to refer you to the fluctuation you will see in the other non-current liabilities in one part and also other current liabilities show a decrease.</p>
          <p>In the hedging policy that was your second question; obviously, we have various types of activities going there and some areas we do not actively address. Let's me start with this one, if we have a bond portfolio in Europe, we definitely did not do any hedging on this portfolio. We could as well have invested into Swiss Franc bonds and I think everyone will understand that. But the euro rate has come down at the end of June, which also was part of this impact in the financing cost.</p>
          <p>When it comes to trading outstanding between the Swiss companies, the brand companies and the individual foreign distribution companies, here we have a regular program of doing hedges but not very far in advance. And when it comes for the financing of our foreign subsidiaries it is true that some of those we also have taken advantage in countries in which it is rather difficult such as China such as Korea or India where you can not easily provide local banking facilities unless you pay a very high amount of interest, we also provide some loans in Swiss francs, which had an impact on the foreign currency line in the profit and loss paid. We are addressing those issues and revisiting these areas with potential additional capital increases. So, yes. We're doing a very active job on that. But we cannot present that we have a crystal ball here knowing what the rates are going to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Patrik Schwendimann, ZKB. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Patrik Schwendimann, Z&#xFC;rcher Kantonalbank. Good afternoon gentlemen. I have several questions if I may.</p>
          <p>Firstly, could you touch a little bit more the situation in Europe in the main countries, what you're expectations are there for the -- I would say second half?</p>
          <p>And secondly, again, on the net financial results, I mean, which is well known, the Xin Yu loss in the first half of roughly 47 million. Could you give us split of what was the loss of the other of the balance of this 120 million?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, could you give us the net cash -- the cash position at the end of June and also the asset allocation on this?</p>
          <p>And further on again, I am sorry, again, on the tax rate, did I get that right, that probably there was some provision releases of roughly 50 million in the first half? And regarding tax rate, you gave us a long-term guidance in spring of 20 to 22%. What would be your guidance from now on, I would say, for next year -- for 2009?</p>
          <p>And lastly, regarding -- a question for Mr. Darwish, the electronic systems division I know which is always difficult to give an outlook, but what are your expectations there for the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mr. Schwendimann. Five questions I think. You make us work. Mr. Darwish we let you start.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As written in the press release, you have to look at this case per case from the three component companies, EM, Micro Crystal and Renata. EM which is the largest, has been performing very lovely during this first half of the year, exceeding largely the best growth rate in this sector. This was not the case for Micro Crystal because of the mobile phone market and the change in distribution of this market. While, for Renata they were exposed to some exchange rate problems which are beyond the numbers you see, because very often for those companies the exchange rate, even if you sell in Swiss francs, the price is still linked to the dollar.</p>
          <p>So taking all this into account EM should continue the very nice progression. Micro Crystal should get in better situation by adapting to the new product mix and in Renata we're taking measures to reduce the cost. So the combination of all this and those are the three most important companies in this group should provide, let's say an improvement if there is no major change in the market situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you say improvement you mean improvement against the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, provided that we do not see further degradation of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there no signs for further degradation of the market at the moment. No, I must really add to this. The signs in the market are rather positive. If I look at the exchange rate, if I look at our numbers and if I look at the products &#x2013; at the consumer products that people are buying, where <mark type="inaudible" /> is also involved, the only outlook that I -- that we feel a little bit tough is the car industry. Here we must say and you have seen that we have exited, we got rid of some of the car businesses that we have, here the outlook is more difficult. Okay, that's for this.</p>
          <p>But it is true that in all other segments and what is the most important is that the demand for the product is always there and alive. It is always a big attractivity of the product of those companies in the market. And there is one element Schwendimann, that you have perhaps seen and the Swatch Group was always in line with this strategy. The Swatch Group has never given in, in whatever area, to build up big production facilities in <mark type="inaudible" />. There was once an exception when there was a strategy or low price movement. But we have always invested here in our production base, Mara or Micro Crystal.</p>
          <p>And now what do you see? You see many, many of companies that have invested in Far East they come back. They see that there is an issue, there is a problem and we see with our clients that they are coming back, some of them that wanted lower priced products that went to Asia. They come back because they say, okay these companies are based in Switzerland, we know the strategy, they are stable and we don't have to expect from one day to the other -- some changes, dramatic changes that could happen. That we have seen. That the cost base is increasing by 10, 20, 30%. And that's one of the advantages we have and that we feel now that we have some of the clients that have been in Far East attracted, come now back to us and these are huge opportunities for us. And that thanks to the strategy of this company continue to invest in Swiss. And Mr. Darwish looks at me and says, yes, you are right.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

          <p>Part with the taxes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the net financial results, and give you an additional breakdown. As you have mentioned already a number for <mark type="inaudible" /> to this is to be added in our regular share portfolio, roughly another CHF 30 million, plus on the bonds another 11 and some, which gives the total of the financial impact of just the quotation on the stock market.</p>
          <p>Then we have the exchange differences, which are split into various parts. Part of which is even added to the portfolios and by the way those portfolios have stayed more or less with the same asset allocation as was mentioned in March and frequently repeated when individual discussions were taking place. We have not changed the asset allocation. We keep those shares. We believe we have a sound portfolio also in the bonds and believe that their time will come when we will see quite different numbers on those investments.</p>
          <p>There are two other elements to be added to it. I was giving a hint to those. We have certain positions in our Swiss francs balance sheet, with <mark type="inaudible" /> in dollars, or Micro Crystal also in dollars. We have some dollar receivables, which need to be quoted at exchange rate, prevailing at the end of the month. We have certain positions in the balance sheet in subsidiaries, outside of Switzerland, which have been financed in Swiss francs and this is also added to it and all the exchange differences combine together including those on the portfolios are roughly CHF 29 million, that's the spilt.</p>
          <p>When we come to the net cash, net cash position as regularly indicated by Mr. D&#xFC;rr in those conferences, end of June net of the financial debts are somewhere in the CHF 870 million, 866 exactly.</p>
          <p>Now your question goes again to the tax rate, you made an estimate of how much might have been positively impacting the first half of this year and your guess is not wrong. And regarding the guidance for the year to come I would love to be able to know exactly what sort of taxes we are going to see in the future. You obviously first of all, let me enumerate a few elements which might impact the rates as such. You know that they are -- we have more than 160 companies in more than 30 countries, there is already through this a certain mix of tax rates who will be addressed and reviewed.</p>
          <p>China has added or increased the tax rates, other countries have slightly decreased tax rates. We were able to negotiate on new investments here in Switzerland zone for instance, Dress Your Body and others, additional tax holidays and tax treaties. We have dependant on the mix of the business going forward we will see what profits are to be shown in what tax jurisdiction. But my indication previously apart from any surprise in as much as we would have any difficulties in one or the other jurisdiction will still be valid, we would be fighting for 20, but cannot exclude 22.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Schwendimann, I would like to add, this last year when this whole thing came in the newspapers four years ago as I said, in the Financial Times where there were some allegations which were absolutely not true. It was in one side very good because we had these tax audits and transfer price studies and finally now we could make up the point with many, many of these countries and we got agreement, we got agreement on all of this. That's why we dissolved very confidently some of the reserves that we had, because we said, hey, this is a very good case for us in the future. So we showed everybody that our transfer price policy is complicated, but it's very sound and accepted by many, many tax authorities and that's why I am going more in the direction of 20% than 22 from Mr. Geiser.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This we have to take. Okay, then your question was Europe, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I have the numbers, the half-year numbers. Switzerland, it's a fantastic double-digit growth. Italy is a half-digit, it's double-digit even in the over 20%. And if I say retail it's our own stores. You have Germany double-digit growth. UK high double-digit growth. Italy high single-digit growth. France very high, double-digit growth in the first half. It's always in local currencies. Be careful, Mr. Schwendimann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Local currencies that I give you, not Swiss francs, except for Switzerland of course. Spain below, here we have a decrease. Spain has a crisis. Without any doubt that's the country in Europe that makes us the headache. And it's again the bloody immobiliare, real estate, sector that has bitten and here we feel really some problems. So here we are on a minus. Austria double-digit, Holland double-digit, Poland high double-digit, Greece, high double-digit and then what else, I have forgotten in Europe, nothing else that's more or less, the most important countries.</p>
          <p>And if I look at July and August then I must say that the development continues in double-digit growth in local currencies in most of these countries. Germany makes us very good impression also in August until now. United Kingdom, we thought that perhaps United Kingdom will have a weakness but we don't feel it at the moment. August has been picking up very strongly. France is doing well. Italy is doing relatively well, despite the holidays. I think all the Russians have gone to Italy this time. We sell very expressive pieces there. And also in Lugano, by the way, they come over the frontier.</p>
          <p>So Europe looks good and solid of course the Chinese are missing in Europe at the moment. Because you know perhaps the government employees in China don't get so much travel releases, visas as in the past. One, because of Sichuan because of the earthquake they had and the Olympics China wanted to keep the people on board. So in the second half of year this will change and the Chinese will again come more often into Europe and into Switzerland.</p>
          <p>So Europe outlook second half of the year, very good also in Germany despite the fact that I hear that Germany has a negative growth, I heard somewhere when I flew back with Lufthansa from Beijing, but unfortunately Swiss is not traveling, is not growing and I heard that Germany has led but we have very good news, very good sell-out and sell-through in our own network and the retailers are confident.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I have three questions, three follow-up questions. The first is, if you can please expand a little more on your retail strategy, give us an update on where you stand and how you think about your direct distribution, generally speaking? But also maybe if you can specify on how do you see that developing in China, and by that I mean over the medium-term, how much mono-brand distribution do you see that to account for the Chinese market? This is first question.</p>
          <p>The second again on China and Omega, I was curious to understand how the Olympics are becoming an opportunity for you to improve the mix and the pricing. How the support is driving the brand there?</p>
          <p>Thirdly, on the operating margins, it's the last question, just to -- if we look at the increase that we've seen both in the watch division and in the movements, on the watch side, I'll be curious to understand, if you could quantify what brands are driving that increase more than others i.e. is Omega operating margin reaching a level where improvements are more moderate? Is it the other brands that are driving the increase in margin?</p>
          <p>That's the first thing, and secondly, going back to a comment you made before, on the movement side, how sensitive on the downside would the profitability be from a decrease in the lower end offering that you have? You maybe -- if you can give us an idea on that as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's try to respond to all your questions. First of all, the distribution strategy of this company, it's a mix. Let me start with the wholesale distribution because that's important to understand that you own your wholesale distribution at the first place in a country. The Swatch Group has established very early on, wholesale distribution worldwide in the most important countries, also the emerging countries, like India and like China. That's a part of our big success there. And wholesale distribution means from our company we distribute then to the retail stores, might be our own retail stores or some of the partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, perhaps, as an indication for you, what I forget before, if you take the margin &#x2013; the improved margin in account, we have started with Russia to take our distribution in our own hands. In the last year and of course in the first half of the year, this year you have also an impact of Russia improved because the wholesale margin is now part of the Group and not any more with an agent. So this is also oddly &#x2013; also partly a strategy of this company and a successful one. Of course, we have the cost of the distribution, but we have also the margin. So we continue to open up in countries that have a potential that's big enough our own wholesale distribution, that's the first point. And we are very consistent with this.</p>
          <p>The second point is owned stores. It's true; we have a mix of possibilities. We have for Breguet and Blancpain, Glash&#xFC;tte for Omega and for Swatch mono-brand stores because they are profitable. And we need to be at the best places, at the most prestigious places. And this strategy is successful. And this strategy will continue for these brands in a moderate way as we have always done. There will be opening of stores in Zurich for Blancpain soon, for Omega on Fifth Avenue, in St. Petersburg in Russia, wherever we see that there is an opportunity and there are important strategic, important positions, we will make the necessary investments. But we'll always check with the business plan that these investments are profitable already on a retail level.</p>
          <p>Now we have also and we will not -- and we have not the objective to run only mono-brand stores, our own mono-brand stores. We have of course the strategy of franchise stores. So there are, for Omega, for example or Swatch, many franchise partners that are opening stores. So we don't have the investments. We have the control over the operation and they run the operation. So this is something that's good for the brand. It's good for the partner, but it's good for us also because we don't have the cost. That's another area. And here is Swatch and Omega, they have, Omega has about 60 to 70 franchise partners that open stores and have stores and Swatch has a little bit more franchise partners that have stores out here.</p>
          <p>Then we have multi-brand strategy. These are the Tourbillon stores. And we have about 14 or 15 of them where we go into hotel lobbies, like in Beijing, for example, we have the Grand Hyatt or the Park Life. We go to touristic resorts like Marbella. So -- and we go to places where our other brands are not distributed in a correct way. But this is on a small level. Here you see we have about 14 to 15 Tourbillon stores and perhaps we will end up once with 18, 19 or 20.</p>
          <p>Then we have the airport operations, Tech-Airport, where we control the Paris, Orly and Charles de Gaulle airport and Nice. Newly Nantes is coming into the network, and we have also -- we have been winning the tender for the Vienna airport that will open a new terminal in end of 2009. So this is a strategy that we follow up, and it's very successful and profitable, the airport operation.</p>
          <p>But let's not forget that we have partners, that's the retailers and we have sent two very clear signals to the market. We have the biggest retailer in China, Xin Yu where we have 8% participation. And he is opening many mono-brand and multi-brand stores on his own cost. That is very profitable for him, but for us, it's a good way of not having all the costs of this operation on our shoulders. So it's a professional partner that is doing this.</p>
          <p>The same in the Middle East and in India; with Rivoli, we have decided to take a participation in the biggest and most important retailer and his know-how and his people and his locations will permit us to roll out our brands, without always running the operations at 100% ourselves. So it's a mixed strategy.</p>
          <p>We are capable in every country in the world to react according to the needs. With own stores, own investments, own know how, with franchise partner models, with multi-brand models, with airport operations or with participation in big retail chains that gives them the possibility to expand the distribution, because they know that they can do it with the strongest portfolio mix that you can imagine.</p>
          <p>And here comes in place a big advantage. The Swatch Group is present in all segments. If you want to run a store, you cannot run it only &#x2013; I'm not talking about the mono-brand store, I'm talking about the multi-brand store, you need brands in the lower and middle market segment and not just the luxury segment, you need the whole mix to be able to move and here we have an advantage. Nobody else can offer this than the Swatch Group. And this is the distribution strategy of the Group.</p>
          <p>Do you need more explanations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's very clear. On the market where you're taking partnership, I was curious to understand do you see the distribution there generally for the market to move disproportionally more towards direct retail or mono-brand retail, whether you run it or whether it's a franchise or there is a partner compared to wholesale distribution at the market level?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but in China, you see the tendency goes in brands like Breguet, Blancpain or Omega and Swatch they will, of course, have the tendency to be much more in mono-brand operations. But here again, it's franchise operations with our partner Xin Yu, he is running them. But we also have, of course, the strategic most important places we run ourselves to be sure that we keep always the balance. We never give the power 100% to a partner. We always want to have counterbalance in case, you never know. And that's what we are doing.</p>
          <p>Of course, the Middle East the same, there is a huge potential. If you walk around in the Middle East or in Saudi Arabia or in India, There are huge possibilities for beautiful mono-brand stores for our brands, but also for highly qualitative multi-brand shops. And it's a mix, you have really to see, if a partner brings a good location, I cannot take it away from him. I have to do it with him. If I find a location myself then I can decide I run it myself or I give it to a partner. And we are working really very pragmatic on an operational level on day-to-day basis.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then China was the second question, I think about Omega.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You see the Olympic games is the biggest and the most excellent event in the world. It's perceived by the people in the world as the top, if you participate in Olympics, you must be high quality. And, of course, if as a brand you perform the timekeeping and you have the visibility and you get associated with the performance and the emotion of the athletes, you gain in positioning, in quality, in perception, it's clear. You get additional emotional value but you get also recognition for your high quality of the product. And this means, it's easier to sell products that are more expensive because your credibility as a brand has strongly increased.</p>
          <p>This is a mid and long-term strategy that we have. And with Omega since 1932, we use the Olympic games to communicate this excellence of the brand. And, of course, Beijing, which is certainly the most important event in 2008 has a lot of polemic around it, but nobody is not looking at the Olympics. This will give Omega the additional edge that Omega deserves, not only in China also in the rest of the world. It's a high recognition and it's practically impermeable. I think even if you have billions of money of dollars that you would put into marketing, you cannot replace it by the real credibility of what we are doing now in Beijing.</p>
          <p>And of course, there is another point; you get access to better point of sales to better positioning at the places. I will give you example in Beijing at the moment. In Wangfujing Street, that's the pedestrian street, they have covered all the logos of all other watch brands during the games. There is only one watch brand where the logo is visible and the shop can display all the products with the brand name. Guess who it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Omega. And of course this is giving the people a strong impression of the brand. Because, honestly, I would never accept as another brand that somebody would cover my logo and Omega is the only one present there and is communicating strongly. And this is fantastic for the brand. It will not translate automatically in 20 or 30% more sales the next day, but it will reinforce our leader positioning not only in China, but worldwide, but especially in China. And if you know that Omega has already more than 20% market share in this country, you can imagine with this Olympic games it will be tough to get Omega away from this 20% in a growing market. I would rather say you will see an increase in market share in a strongly growing market, and that's very good news for all of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on this point, are you also taking this as an advantage -- this advantage to -- as a way to increase prices or you're talking about...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, look, we never increase prices in an unfair way. We have launched new products, new movements. You have seen the Five Counter, this is a new chronograph from Omega. Of course, the moment you launch a new product, because of Olympic Games, you fix the price a little bit higher. Because you have a new product, you have a new movement and you have the excellence of the time keeping, of course that you have more margin to position that product then at the higher price. Yes, but we are not going to increase just all the products that we have to a price that would not be reasonable. We increase the price or we position the new product at that place where it deserves to be, thinking also about the Olympics of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You had other questions. I have forgotten the other ones or have we responded to all of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It was on the operating margin, on the watch side, if we can -- if you can elaborate on what is driving that expansion between Omega and the other brands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You see it's a bit all the brands that have shown strong improvement. On the one side, we are very cost conscious. We have taken certain measures to cut the costs when we saw the exchange rates developing in the wrong direction. And everybody is taking advantage. If we make better job in distribution, transportation costs, this concerns every brand. And especially, a volume brand like Swatch takes big advantage, if you improve your transportation costs, you renegotiate your contracts, you rethink the way you deliver the product. So you see here, for example, Swatch takes a bigger advantage than the high-end brands that are delivering much less volume.</p>
          <p>Then you have, of course, the stores that come in play. More expensive pieces you sell more likely in your own stores. Because the consumer is confident because he buys a very expensive piece at the place to be sure it's a not a fake one where he knows it's the owner of the brand, who is doing that. And also because very expensive pieces very often, a normal retailer has a problem to take them in stock. Because he says, ""My God, that's a risk!" So we can take them in our own distribution in our stock, in our shop, we expose them and we very often sell them. We see this in Geneva or in Zurich, where we sell very expensive pieces. In Omega, for example, when a normal retailer has a little bit more problem, because he has not all the money to put so much stock in these very expensive pieces. So the stores are certainly in there to improve the mix and to give us a better margin.</p>
          <p>What else we have? I said before Russia, wholesale distribution that we took over and this is improving, and Russia gets more and more important. So these are the most important factors for the improvement of the margin, and now that the exchange rate is going towards higher levels again, if we can maintain the one-ten or one-nine or even grow up with the dollar, then we will have a spectacular second half of the year. But if the exchange rate goes down, okay, we have to manage with it and we'll come anyway with a very good result.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the movement side, sorry, that was the second part of the question and the profitability there, my question was how sensitive would it be to the assumption that at least the lower end of the -- the lower price point demand may ultimately soften. How much of that...?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>This we don't see. You know that the world record -- Swatch holds the world record, in the United States. We have 52 shops and I can tell you we sell Swatch watches like -- we don't know how to deliver.</p>

          <p>Two things. First tourism, there are more people going to the US because the dollar is not expensive and they are buying, and the Swatch is a fantastic souvenir, and you buy spontaneously. We have fantastic locations. And the second is also the America consumer wants to continue to buy a gift and to make himself pleasure. And where should he invest his money? Should he go and buy shares or houses or things like that? No, he prefers to invest in watches and...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, really this is &#x2013; we see it. So where should you invest your money, also in expensive watches, a watch, a Breguet, or a Blancpain or Omega maintains the value. If you buy it, it's not that in one year the value has gone down. Mr. Geiser looks at me and says, "Oh, Mr. Hayek, we should have put some expensive watches into our portfolio instead of Credit Suisse shares or UBS shares,"</p>
          <p>[Laughter].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because that's a part of the shares we have there that we have. He doesn't want to say it, but in small amounts, but nevertheless. And I think the people are reacting like this, that's why we are more resistant in this industry. And I think that's also true for Swatch. Swatch is a value and people continue to make themselves pleasure. So the sell out is exploding for Swatch in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now in the production, a Swatch that's creating huge volume increases is giving good profit. Let's not always think at the high end and we only earn money with the high end. This company, the basis of the success was a Swatch that was sold in very, very high volumes, and the more volume you sell, the more money you earn. So I would not be preoccupied for the profitability of the production sector.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, could you please explain the reasoning why you have a financial portfolio in the first place? Now I don't mean Xin Yu but other equity, for example, as this is not your core competence?</p>
          <p>The second question is would you be interested in considering to increase the dividend payout ratio instead so that we as shareholders could decide what to do with the cash?</p>
          <p>The final question is what methodology do you use when you value your share price? And this is related to if the Board does not decide to start a new buyback program, should I interpret that as that you think that your own share price is fully valued? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's try to respond to some questions. It's a small part of our portfolio -- you're right, our business is watches -- that's our core business. And sometimes when we hear these discussions from the investor community, from funds, from analysts, we get the impression they don't care very much about our core business, they are more talking about financials. So I am happy that you say that our core business is watches and that's what it is.</p>
          <p>It's true, but there is a small part that is managed inside the company, where they put some investments in shares, et cetera. It has been very successful in the last years. So this year the stock market went down, but here we have certainly taken measures that we go in a different direction in the future, but not with participation like Xin Yu. Xin Yu is a strategic...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...participation now. But on the rest, I have the tendency to say, yes, to you that we say, okay. We should be more careful, but you have also to accept one thing, as investor and shareholder, that if we look at how we manage our cash, how much return we have, because we have very often heard, hey you have to manage your cash, we need at least 5, 6, 7, 8, 10% 15% interest rate. Okay. We should be more conservative and we say no, come on, let's have very low-key kind of a portfolio where we have no risk, but we have a return that is much lower. And that's what we're going to do. That's the lesson that we have learned from that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the buyback, I think, it's always a question of looking over a certain amount of time. But if you see how much money we have already put into buyback programs, I don't feel ashamed in talking about this at all. If I may refer to page nine of our financial statement and the cash flow statement and looking at the number I mentioned before CHF 0.5 billion returned to the shareholders through dividend and through the share buyback program. And if I look a few years back that we are close to CHF 2 billion having being paid in terms of dividend and share buyback, I don't think that the Group and Board of Directors have been too hesitant.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Mario Montagnani, Cheuvreux. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Couple of questions, if I may.</p>
          <p>The first one is on margin expansion 110 and 115 in production watches was impressive. But I think it was even higher switching out a FX and input cost. Can you quantify the incremental input cost you had in the first half of this year? I think it was 25 million in 2007.</p>
          <p>Then I have a question on the phasing of margin expansion. You had 140 basis points in the first half of this year. If you feel obviously, you mentioned if you saw we remained at 110, but if you feel comfortable with the current 30 basis point projected by consensus or even of the current rates, if everything else will remain equal for the remainder of the year. If you -- if can easily beat this 30 basis point margin expansion. And if you see amazing pressure in terms of input cost in the second half although, have a lag in terms of input cost carried on by the second half this year.</p>
          <p>Then I have a question on your backlog. You mentioned the backlog is very strong in the high end for your finished watches and jewelry division, but as well in the production unit. Can you just give us just a sense or feeling, what is the visibility you have in terms of backlog for watches and jewelry? Is that six months. I think, you mentioned in the press release part of the watches you are producing right now will be delivered only in 2009 and the same for production.</p>
          <p>And the very last question is that on the current negative development, we have in another watch retailer in Asia, I think it is Peace Mark. I think, this company is one of the largest watch retailers in this region and also distributes Swatch Group watches. How important, how big is it in your total sales?</p>
          <p>And finally, probably, come back to the question of my colleague previously in terms of sensitivity of your margins, obviously you're very optimistic on the outlook. But everyone, I think, out there is starting to plug in the worst-case scenario for 2008; sorry, 2009 and 2010. What could be a worst-case scenario for Swatch in terms of top line growth according to your experience? Top line growth and margin expansion? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, we are not paid to make worst-case scenarios, because there is no need for it. We are paid to give you a realistic outlook. And I think if you look our track record over the last years, we have constantly kept our promises and what we said, because we tell you things that we experience every day. That's our business. We are not people that make theories and projections and think in worst cases.</p>
          <p>You see, there is no reason when I look at the strategic setup of this company. In all segments, the distribution strength, the strength of the Swiss watch industry and the Swiss made, I see no reason why we should not over the next five years, and I said this in an interview in Finanz und Wirtschaft, there is no reason that we should not grow between 6 and 10% every year in turnover in Swiss francs, between 6 and 10% over the next five to six years. I see no reason -- I see many reasons that it could even become better, but 5 to -- 6 to 10% is not a bad number.</p>
          <p>And I don't see a reason why our margins should suffer. I think everything we are doing is pointing to more volume, because more people are buying. We have fortunately more countries like India, like China, like Russia that are consuming and even if the growth in these countries would not continue by double-digit growth rates, but only by 2% or 3% or 4%. If China is growing by 2% it's still a hell of lot. And here why should I plan for a worst-case scenario. No, it's not necessary the outlook is very positive, because the world is positive.</p>
          <p>Of course, it's terrible to see what's happening in Georgia and in the United States et cetera, but there will be changes. I think the new President in the US will soon come and then things will become better. So the outlook I gave you is a realistic one for this company it's 6 to 10% every year at least in Swiss francs that's what is something this management should be capable to do. Now in certain circumstance, if there is a World War coming okay then, forget about it, all forecast are not happening, but nobody would forecast or make a worst case scenario for a World War. You agree with me?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is &#x2013; these are facts. We see it and everything we are doing, you see, our investment in Rivoli is because we have done a plan for the next three, four years. And also for the local population not just for the Russians that are traveling down there. We take everything in account that's happening there. So that's why I am very confident to say the 6 to 10% should be there every year with a margin that is improving but at one point of time, the margin will come to a situation where we can not make jumps of 1 to 3% every year in the margin side.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>But this is how this company strategically put and more I cannot say for the forecast. And we are convinced about that and we are working for that to achieve it.</p>
          <p>Now you were talking about Peace Mark. That's important and I thank you for this question. Peace Mark is a very, very small part of our business. We have started very early on with Xin Yu. We have chosen our partnership, we have 8% and we stick to this partnership because that's a successful business. It's a focused business. Our partners are doing retailing. That's their business. Peace Mark however, we analyzed Peace Mark since many, many, many years and Peace Mark is a so called [German word] , they do production, they have own brands, they buy a lot of chains everywhere in the world, they go to Singapore, they come to Switzerland. They lost total focus and we have seen this since a long time. They even do with Tourneau in the United States joint ventures and this company spends a lot of money and we have a very small business with Peace Mark. It's a very, very low amount.</p>
          <p>So I can tell you that if I look at our China business or Singapore business that we have, they bought some of our partners. They bought Sincere. With Sincere we had some business. They bought some Swatch watch retailing -- retailers. But directly with Peace Mark, we have not big business and we don't plan to have big business and we have taken our measures when we heard what was happening. But to be honest, it was foreseeable what is happening with Peace Mark. Because the strategy of this company is -- yeah, it's a bit crazy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest. And Xin Yu is totally different. Xin Yu is focused, well managed and they have a portfolio of very good brands. And they are a very good partner. Okay.</p>
          <p>Now comes &#x2013; let's come to the backlog. The situation of the backlog is you see Omega has on certain models, a huge backlog because the demand is so big. You have to make a difference between a backlog of a new model. For example, the Breguet has launched the Double Tourbillon and it's a fantastic product. But they only want to deliver it if everything is perfect and it's a very difficult product. So they are making sure, that such a difficult product is coming to the end consumer when everything is fine. And here of course, it can be that this will be delivered and products like this that are new, that are extraordinary will have a delay will be 12 months, 24 months, but people are waiting for that, that's not the problem.</p>
          <p>However, if you have the launch of a new product; let's take the Five Counter from Omega for the Olympics. It's a new product. We have launched with some thousand pieces and now the demand has exploded and people want it and here, of course, it will be difficult to deliver these orders that are coming in within the next six months, it will probably be 12 months. But the major part of our brand, if you don't talk about Breguet and Blancpain, will be able to deliver a big part for the Christmas business and to fulfill it.</p>
          <p>And one thing to calm you down, no retailer has cancelled any orders because this could also be the case that if you wait too long the people are canceling. There are no cancellation of orders at all, in no brand. So this should make you confident and makes us confident. But one thing is sure we would like to have the product as early as possible, as quick as possible and Mr. Geiser would like also because we have in semi-finished product, some stock there and we want to get rid of them and get them out, because the orders are here, it's a pity that we cannot deliver.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Things will get better in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of visibility, you said something between six months, twelve months you have in watches and sometimes higher...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depends on the products. Tissot -- Tissot has a big, big, big demand on T-Touch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And here we have the touch screen that we have to deliver. The capacity in the touch screen that we have, it's a unique product. It's difficult to bring them very quickly to Tissot. We hope that it will be there within the next three to four months. However, if you talk about a new movement that has been set up and launched in the market and we need to push this product out and we have the cases, we have the dials, then of course it can take six months.</p>
          <p>It depends on the brands. It depends on the product itself. When there are standard products and this is also existing, we have some standard products that we cannot deliver because we don't have dials. And here of course this will get down within the next six months, no problem. So I would say that 70% of what we see between 60 and 70% will get out already this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know its complex. It's depending on every single brand has different demands and different reasons for the delays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously production is even higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; [Laughter]. You know, we have every day a backlog &#x2013; an additional backlog, because, of course, we cannot tell the people you don't order any more until we have delivered the old ones. We have to continue to take orders and we have to continue to produce the products that where we have the components. So we switch the production of course and we'll deliver them products and we have to put the other ones in stock as semi-finished products. It's not that the production is stopping.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to come back on the question, previous question of margins. They would have been even higher than 140 basis points, if you sweep out FX? You produce obviously your total production costs are in Swiss francs. So you can quantify the input cost you had occur in the first half of this year and if you see the same phasing of this 140 in the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this I cannot say. But one thing is clear, if I can only say about, if we would have a production that was capable in putting everything fine out as it is without having to store semi-finished products, if we would have an exchange rate that's more favorable, of course, we would be here with an operating margin. You would look at us and you would say hey, you have been cheating these late years. You have such a good operation margins. But I cannot quantify, but it's substantially higher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we're sure we'll see some of that in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the very last point on &#x2013; in term of brands, if you can just elaborate on the brands &#x2013; the performance of the brands in the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's boring, it's quickly said. I'm so sorry it's boring. All the brands are performing very well. Swatch is doing very well as I said before. Tissot is doing very well. And the mid range brands are &#x2013; people are questioning me, they say today this morning on CNBC, they say. "Oh, the high end luxury is working very well and the lower market segments." But everybody says the mid range is not doing well. It's not true, the mid range is performing extremely well.</p>
          <p>If I look at Longines, it's beating every record with the strategy that we implemented with the sports watches that they brought in. Rado is picking up after they had a lot delays in products and now they got the product so they are rolling out and they are giving nice double-digit growth. Omega is doing well. Omega is suffering the most on the exchange rate because dollar and renminbi and the dirham -- and they are developing very well. So I don't have one single brand, unfortunately, to say that's the weak spot. It's working on all segments. We are happy that we have all segments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Two questions, if I may, and that is on central costs, were there any one-offs since central cost were so low? I think you told us there was a negative goodwill on one of your acquisitions and I am just wondering if there is any other one-offs in the central cost that drove them below trend.</p>

          <p>Last year you had &#x2013; in the both half years you had corporate costs after the divisions of 11 million in each quarter &#x2013; in each half year, excuse me, and this year in the first half you had only minus 6 million. And I am just wondering were there any assets sales -- I think we know about the 1 million in negative goodwill, I am just wondering is there anything else that drove this line below trend?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, wonderful, thank you. And my second question was just a little bit more color still on that first question about the provisions, were there any reserve -- releases of reserves in the half year, besides the tax -- the deferred taxes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. With regards to taxes, we answered the question already...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> suggested that it could have been about 50 million and I did confirm that the order of magnitude is in the ballpark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, because that still suggests that if we go year-on-year, you had in the first half of last year, you had that line on the cash flow statement had minus 13 million, this year that line had minus 150 million. So the swing from last year to this year is 137 million. So, 50 million comes from taxes, where do the other 87 million swing come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But these are not the changes in the provisions, it's also the payments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Your payments -- historically, you've always paid -- historically, the past couple of years in your cash flow the cash tax and the reported tax, the GAAP tax are the same. There's not been a difference between when you pay taxes and when you don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are sometimes differences, and this year we definitely had a difference between provisions and actual taxes paid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but I'm just trying to get at again, the swing from first half last year to first half this year is CHF 137 million. You have said roughly 50 of that is from taxes. Okay, good. Then we have 87 million still swing from last year to this year, and it's again, in that line Changes in provisions, tax and interest. Can you give us any color of where those 87 million come from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I repeat myself; we have 50 on the ballpark number...</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...with regard to provisions, okay? And the details &#x2013; I'll have to check on it but basically these are the payments, actual payments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, these are actually -- it's the opposite. It's the cash because these are cash subtracted from your net profit, so actually these are non-cash items. In your cash flow statement, as you report from -- to get from your net income to your cash flow from operating activities, these numbers are subtracted. So they're non-cash, there is no payment there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Matthias Eifert, MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. There are just two questions left from my side. First of all, can you give us a bit more color on the market share gains you mentioned? Can you please say in which markets you have that market share gains you talked about and give us an idea of the magnitude?</p>
          <p>And I would actually like to know how much sales you now generate in your own stores, and roughly how the performance is year-to-date in terms of like-for-like sales in your own stores and get an idea how much came from space growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mr. Eifert, we do about &#x2013; if I take the overall turnover, it's about 10% that we do in our own retail network, of our total turnover on the watch side. It's about more or less 10%. Of course, depending on the brands, Swatch had more. The Swatch turnover of the brand Swatch comes about 30%, 35% from the own network, and Omega is much less than 10%, for example. So the overall, it's more or less 10%.</p>
          <p>The performance of these stores is better than most of the trades, because if I look at the sell-out, I give you some numbers just as an indication. In Switzerland, let's say, I say they are in a double-digit. So our own retail stores are about 7 to 8% higher in turnover than what the market itself is in Switzerland. If I take the UK, it's about the same. We have always to think about roughly 10% better than what in the markets -- what the market is happening. I told you why because our stocks are better, the assortment is better, the pieces are partially different. So that's what we see everywhere that in our own retail stores you have at least a 10% -- at least the 10% better performance than the market in itself. And these are sell-out numbers. That's why it's important. It is interesting.</p>
          <p>Now when you say market share gains, I will certainly not give you all the details that you'll report it to all our competitors, but it's just sufficient to look at the exportation horlog&#xE8;re, you see if you take the Swiss exports, they have been at 14.9% over the last six months January to June. And this is in Swiss francs. And if you take our watches and jewelry, we are 17% in -- when you take net of exchange rates so we've taken a good 3%, you see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the watches, in which geographical areas...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This I will not tell you. I will not tell you, because this is something a competitor is just waiting for me to say, oh, where they have gained some market share, but we can look into it, and you could certainly see when you look around. One thing is sure....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>They will see it anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but let them work a little bit. Let them not help. You see in the strategic important area, I think, in the emerging markets, the so-called emerging markets, if you take China, Hong Kong, Russia, Middle East, India we are certainly -- we've reinforced our leader position without any doubt. And in the United States, we've certainly taken market share because one thing I can bet, there are some brands that are very well known that are suffering in the United States, that have a strong position and we have taken advantage. And here we have taken a lot of market share, especially with Omega we have taken market share. I will not tell from whom, but that's the fact. In Europe, okay, I will not go through all the countries, but fact is if you look at the Federation Horlogere numbers, and you compare with our numbers, we see very often quickly what our situation and this of the competitors. But I will not go into the details. I am sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will try. And last question on Tiffany, now you probably have seen some models and you're, after now half a year working with them bit more, how it could look like the next year? When can we expect the first real impact from Tiffany? Could it be in the first half next year already, and how much could we have in total with the -- for 2009 from Tiffany deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, 2009 you are right 2009 will be the first year that there will be a substantial turnover. It's also foreseen in the business plan. We will present product in Basel. So, we'll make nice show there. And of course I have seen the product. My sister is the boss of the Tiffany operation, and she did a wonderful work. And the collection comes nicely together. And we'll see something in Basel. And the first impact will be seen in 2009. But how much I will not tell you, Tiffany will kill me, because we have a business plan that's confidential. Tiffany in the US would kill me because they would say Jesus Christ, if you do already in the first year and not even in the full year this turnover, people will say, My God! So much more turnover than what we have done in all these years, we will be ashamed, so we prefer not to say it. We are fair partners.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Urs Diethelm, Bank Sal Oppenheim. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Urs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions, it's more on the clarification side. The market securities, you reported at December 2006 -- at 2007 with 656 -- if my calculation is right that this market -- marketable securities portfolio is now worth of 486 million at the end of June.</p>
          <p>And then the second issue is July, August performance, you mentioned double-digit performance, does that relate to the overall Group or does that relate to the watch division and is this, let's say, double-digit growth similar to what we have seen in the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Of course, I am talking about the watch division, because I said it's in local currency double-digit growth. So this is, of course, concerning the watch division. But if the exchange rate, I repeat it, if the exchange rate goes back to the levels that we know like 1.10, 1.11, 1.12, this can translate very quickly in a double-digit growth in Swiss francs for the whole Group. That's the situation. So double-digit growth, I was talking about all the watch division, in local currencies and if the exchange rate develops the way we see it now, it will translate also in a double-digit growth in Swiss francs. That's absolutely possible.</p>
          <p>But careful, exchange rates, we don't know where they go and second the base of 2007, let's remind us it was a record year for the Swatch Group, 2008 will be a record year. But the basis of 2008 second half is very high. So we rather really want to have this exchange rate favor and -- okay, I don't exclude double-digit growth for the Group if the exchange <mark type="audio gap" /> -- like that --.</p>
          <p>Second question &#x2013; Mr. Geiser.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The marketable securities, I can confirm at this stage once more that we have not added anything to the marketable security portfolio nor sold things at a loss. So you can take whatever number you had in spot and subtract the valuation difference that was recorded in June. We have not made any changes and we are not going to sell these securities at a loss.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>So then my calculation is right; you had 486 million in marketable...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will check on those numbers, and if you have taken the annual report and what we have reported in June your number must be correct.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We can hear you loud and clear.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. I've got three hopefully very quick questions. The first question is, do you monitor sell-through rates and inventory levels at your wholesale customers, especially in the developed markets and how do you do that?</p>
          <p>The second question is, are you willing to provide a breakdown of inventories by semi-finished, finished and raw materials?</p>
          <p>And the third question is just to clarify, are you saying that income from marketable securities should be positive by year-end or just in second half? If you could clarify, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First the third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The marketable securities, what has been said is that we expect an improvement in this situation; neither you nor your teams, nor your analysts nor any bank can really predict what it is, but we believe it's going to be better. And what we want to get rid of is of those losses. Now, we will see how far we get, but we are confident and we are not speculating as it was clearly said in marketable securities. This is not our core business, but we will not sell those at a loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, if we take August already, the situation is much better. So if you take the actual situation at the stock markets and how the valuation is of most of the shares, it's already much better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But nobody at this table is pretending that the 120 minus is going to 120 plus that is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes! I am predicting this! Because if the community of the financial analysts are helping us, all the stock markets go up. No, please disregard this remark.</p>
          <p>Are you still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other two questions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the wholesale, the sell-through information?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because after all 10% of the business is retail. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In our own retail stores, I get the sell-through &#x2013; sell-out information day-by-day, either on a piece of paper, either on information system. It depends on the brand because as you know, Omega is organized differently than Breguet or Blancpain or Swatch and they have different systems. For the multi-brand stores, I get, for example, a daily paper that's filled out by hand because it's only about 14 shops where I get every single sell-out every day with a potential discount with the payment. And I get also how many people have been in the store and who was buying the product, what nationality. So this information is on a daily basis for our whole network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your wholesale customers, do you have...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the wholesale customers, we have a very interesting system. I don't get this from everybody, because some of them are jealous to give us the database. But we have so called sales reductions. If you give us the sell-through information and you accept to make an automatic replenishment means that we deliver automatically a product the moment it has been sold out so that you have a good assortment, you get 1 or 2% better conditions from us. And we have a range of countries and retailers that immediately bought into this program. I can tell you, Xin Yu in China, he gives us all the sell-out information, and by the way since we are shareholders, I get also the sell-out information from all our competitors. It's legitimate. We are a shareholder and we have a seat in the Board of Directors. And we get from some countries in Europe, United Kingdom, for example, from the major retailers, I get sell-out information, not of all because some of them are refusing to give us the information. They have not understood that it's good for them that we know what's happening so we could help them to have the right assortment.</p>
          <p>And that's one of the tendencies and of the push that we're doing to convince the retailer, give us the information, we accomplish a work for the assortments and you will do better businesses and we will do better businesses. So we encourage this with a certain form of 1 or 2% additional margin if he is doing this with us. And for the moment, I think about 20 to 30% of the wholesale retailers are doing this with us. The others are still reluctant; they are old fashioned. They say you have not to look into my books.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So is that mostly US and the rest of Western Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The US are not the most open retailers. But we have one big partner in the US who is giving us a look into the sell-out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tourneau, I guess. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I absolutely will say nothing about that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And breakdown of inventories, could you give us sense of the spilt, is -- it is still roughly 25 --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The Geiser will exceptionally because we had not many ladies today so he will give you the spilt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If you compare the two numbers in the balance sheet consolidated. I'll give you the increase by category as opposed to what we showed in our details in the annual report. Raw material, works-in-process and semi finished products this is what is in course of production has increased by CHF 142 million, finished goods by 101, mainly due to filling up or directing stock into the retail stores for the high selling period in summer and the openings of new retail stores. And also the customer service inventories have been increased under the light of new products being launched, being ready to service all those products by another 15 million. So these are the CHF 258 million that has been added to those individual categories.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Thomas Chauvet, Citigroup. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sorry, two quick follow-up questions. One with regards to production; your internal sales in H1 were up 16% versus only 4% for external sales, I mean, I understand the bottlenecks, I understand your strategy to give priority to your own brands. But can you tell us, if there has been any change in the way you allocate the available movements between your own brands and your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Chauvet, I would be happy, if we would be able to do this. But we would be in a hell of situation. No, I try to explain it. Swatch and Omega stands for the increase. You know Swatch is produced by ETA, nobody else gets product from Swatch. We are not obliged to deliver to anybody else. And Omega has own movements that they developed on themselves and they have a contract. ETA has to produce them. And these two brands are accounting for the major part of the increase in the production at ETA, if you compare third parties with us. This is the reason for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not to give advantage. You know, if we could we would give 100% only to our brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my second question with regard to the importance of tourism to your business, you've given the example of Russian tourists in Italy, earlier. Can you maybe give us your best estimates of the overall contribution of tourists to European sales and to US sales, if you've got an estimate, rough estimate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have one, but you see the tourists at the same time are also consumers of the product in their own country because they love the brand and they go outside of the country and they buy it outside; for whatever reason, either they don't have the product, they don't have a point of sales nearby or the prices are different. They want to take advantage of exchange rate fluctuation. So this is a number that is very difficult to get. In Switzerland we know that certainly a big part of the sales are done because of tourists in this country. But I cannot tell you how much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be pure speculation and I don't want to.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Louise Singlehurst, Morgan Stanley.  Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I wondered if you could just give us a bit of color on the general mood of your wholesalers and clients by region and how that has changed over the last few months if at all? And how your relationship has changed with them over recent years, i.e. how you control the level of discounting that happens within those wholesale outlets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's an interesting question Louise. So first of all, the mood is good, we have some of the retailers in Beijing invited and they follow the Olympic games. So I must say most of the retailers and the ones that are not watching too much business TV, CNBC or Bloomberg, are not reading too much analysis from the financial community. They are good -- have a good mood.</p>
          <p>The mood is generally fine, but there are some areas in the world and I agree if I take the United States and the United Kingdom where retailers are owned by groups, by financial funds. The moment you have funds or you have a company that's in the stock market quarter, the tendency is that if they hear bad news from whatever area, they start to say, we have to decrease the stock, decrease the stock and this is especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries the case. And what we always have to do then with the retailer, we go through this exercise and we say look, you -- if you decrease your stock, you have good stock and bad stock. We can prove you if you have the right assortment, you sell more. And we have more and more retailers that understand this, but we have more and more funds and financial investors that are coming and they are looking just at the numbers and say your stock must go down, the moment there are some signs of whatever crisis. And here it's typically Anglo-Saxon countries. The rest of the world, the mood of the retailers is "Where the hell is my product? Please deliver, I want more". This is the mood that we see at the moment. In the rest of the world, Anglo-Saxon countries, a little bit more difficult.</p>
          <p>The second question was, Louise, remind me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was just relationship that you've got with them and how that's changed are you -- can you control level of discounting that they're giving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, discounting is a headache, I agree. We went now in China and Hong Kong more and more into a zero discount level with Omega. And of course, the strength of your brand together with your own distribution network permits you to control the discounting. And one way of controlling the discounting is reducing the margins to the retailer. Because why should I give to the retailer 40% margin, if he gives 15% away to the consumer? So I cut him his discount, I cut him his margin.</p>
          <p>And that's what I forgot the reduction in margin for the retailer in some parts of Asia has also helped to increase our operating margin in the first half. That's what I forgot to say before. That has certainly a small impact.</p>
          <p>And that's what we continue to do. We will supervise what is done with the brands, because it's extremely damaging to the brands. We will reduce margins and we will put our own stores nearby, if necessary to control the discounting policy. But you know the European Union is difficult. You cannot tell the retailer what pricing -- you can suggest him a price, but you cannot tell him he must sell to this price. But the tendency is reduction of this bloody discounting. But that's an effort the whole industry is trying to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just two very quick questions. Spain, obviously is tough for everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is that the only market in negative territory? I mean how...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is another one, Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Australia. And Japan, how is that performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Japan, we have a number -- we are plus, we are growing. It's 2% or 3%. It's a small number. Of course, it's for everybody the same. I have even seen other companies that are having minus two, minus three, minus five. We are growing in small steps. But it's true. Japan is -- we don't see any signs of improvement. It's just going on like this. Perhaps we can only hope that there are many Russian and Chinese tourists coming to Japan to back my &#x2013; the consumption over there. But it's not a preoccupation. We use this situation to clean the market, to position our brands better, to make everything what you have to do, to have a good start the moment the economy picks strongly up. At one point of time perhaps I don't know, in 30 years, Japan will be back on track. But if we grow, our two, 3% and the rest of the world is growing the way it's growing now, it's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then very last question. Can you tell us when you'll start the rollout of the new Tiffany branded stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first we have to roll out the product before we roll out the stores. So 2009 will be the rollout of the collection and you will certainly, also in 2009, see in one city, one of these stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So during the year 2009. We'll not tell you where the store could be, but it will be in Europe somewhere.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you Louise, so we will continue for another 10 minutes and at 4 o'clock we will cut. Next question.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Julie Saussier, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Looking at the press release on page nine, the cash flow statement, can you explain why the cash flow from operating activities is down 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Geiser.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can explain. This is what the other gentlemen wanted to know with regards to the charges and taxes and all these payments and I have to reinforce once again what I said before. These are not add backs to the cash flow, these are payments to the large extent and this is one of the reasons when you used up also some cash in the increase in net working capital, I just explained also the increase in the inventory. And for good reasons, which is about 11%, 11.4 exactly. So this is all something in which we invested into the business or had to pay whatever is necessary to be paid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand the change in the working capital, but the 480 million to start with the net income, already included some mark-to-market losses in your marketable securities that you presumably have -- should add back. So the fact that the total is 270 million is a pretty low number. Because your 480 million already includes your tax payments and your interest payments. Then you add back your mark-to-market losses on marketable securities, so in fact you should add back a big number there. And then -- okay, and then you deduct from 50 million tax relief, but then this 270 million down 35% on last year, is a surprising number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have to take into the detail of this condensed consolidated cash flow statement. What we normally look at is the extensive one, but I'll have to go back and check on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so you will come back to me on that or I should call back in the next two days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you hear nothing from Mr. Geiser, you'll have to call him back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Jonathan Herbert, Zadig. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I just wanted to ask you what the status regarding the Comco [Swiss Competition Commission] agreement is? My understanding is it expires in '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, no, it expires in end of 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's about the kits, the so-called the kits that we will not deliver any more, but we will replace it by finished movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what would be the margin implication moving to finished movements rather than the kits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there could be an improvement in margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the Assortiments side, do you still have obligation to deliver or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. that's what we just said the kits are the Assortiments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Assortiments, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you talk about Nivarox that's something else. Here we don't have any agreement of course. We continue to deliver our Assortiments from Nivarox. The kits from ETA is something else, but the Assortiments are &#x2013; there is no contract and whatsoever so this is something that continues to continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is not a change in the policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Thank you very much for the clarification.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Aavi Fructus, Atticus. Please, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions. First one is you compared your market share to Swiss Watch export growth which were 15% in first half in Swiss francs and you did 11% in Swiss francs. So I was wondering how -- what's the correct way to look at that?</p>
          <p>And the second one may have just been asked on the 120 million financial charge where it is added back in the cash flow statement please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Geiser?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As I said before, we are going to look into the detailed cash flow statements. I have noted down your name as well. We'll come back to you on this one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You know when you look at the federation, this is export numbers. And if I look at my export numbers, how much I have exported with the company in Swiss francs to the other companies, I come to a substantial higher number than your 14 or 15% of the federation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see you must be careful this is exported product, not sold product, because most of the companies are sending products from Switzerland to their affiliates. So, let's say, Cartier is sending from Switzerland product to the United States, it's in the export numbers but it's not sold products because it goes first to the affiliates of Cartier in the US, the same with us if we deliver something. So if I look at my numbers that I performed in Swiss franc, the turnover that I do in the countries then I see that I have a higher numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you are saying is that the market overall at retail level grew less than 15% in Swiss francs, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Swiss francs, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have no question any more or do we have one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have two follow-up questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then we take one of them. If it is a short one, we can take the second one, but then it's over. Mr. Cox is the next?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the next question is from Mr. Jon Cox...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is the third time that Mr. Cox is asking a question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I have an opportunity, I might as well take it. It's always a pleasure to talk you guys. First question is on electronics; you've obviously talked about a tough environment. I am just wondering if you ever thought about disposing of that overall business as a unit? You've obviously -- you are selling of a little bit of it. I wonder if you've thought of actually getting rid of the whole thing?</p>
          <p>Second question is just on &#x2013; I wonder if you CAN give us some figures on the duty-free, and you've been very kind in the past just to say how the sell out is in the duty-free channels. I know you work with a couple of big the duty-free people. Could one of you just give us some recent data on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I have my all my people traveling around. So I have not the details with me on the paper for duty-free. But again, if I take the comparable basis, the biggest duty-free operator, I compare our brands with the one of the competitors there; we are selling about one-third to double better than the other. That's the situation -- sell out situation in the duty-free operations. But I don't have the exact numbers with me, I am really sorry.</p>
          <p>Then about automotive industry, no, we have not a plan to sell everything off. That was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why bother having the whole division? Why not just get rid of the whole electronics division, it's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why? What's with you? Jesus Christ!</p>
          <p>First of all, we use a lot of these products for our core business. Don't forget about Quartz watches they need a microchip. Don't forget about the touch screen of Tissot that we developed. We have many, many things that we developed in there that are important for the watch business and that gives add-on business. So Mara is, of course, selling the chips of the very low power and -- to other people. Logitech, for example, or other, but the main usage for it is still watches. So we would be really stupid to sell this division. The technology is geared by watches to help innovation in this field. This is the mission and the reason to have this company.</p>
          <p>In a way you are right, we need to -- we are focusing and we are making efforts in this direction. As you have seen we have divested a part of a company for the automotive mechanical activities. So the trend is to focus on the components, which are useful for the watches and useful for the innovation in watches. Okay.</p>
          <p>And then you have synergies, of course, in other areas in the world where you can be the leader. As in Logistics, for example, tagging, radio frequency identification, it's a huge field where we can use the watches, but we can also use the know-how of Mara for other products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The technology of the watches, which is very well suited for portable equipment can be deployed in other fields very successfully as just cited by Mr. Hayek, RFID for example or SIM cards or Access cards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That what we got rid of was really the mechanical part, automotive industry, that was not interesting for us and gave no potential for developments for the watch industry in the contrary. So that's why we decided we'd rather separate from this area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wonder if you could just add me to the list as well of those people interested in what's going on in the cash flow statement? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Mr. Geiser will have to make a phone call for all 123 people, now 124 that are participating and then I will line up too so that he gives me also the explanation.</p>
          <p>Okay. The last question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question is from Robert Bonte-Friedheim, Select Equity. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a very short one, thank you. And I just -- you mentioned that you have nationality statistics on the sell-through. I'm just wondered if you would give us a sense of how big -- how important Russians are both perhaps globally and in Europe as your customers roughly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on what brand. Russians are very strong lovers and buyers of Breguet because Breguet is the national hero in Russia, Pushkin already mentioned Breguet, so Breguet is for Russians the nom presulta and then they like very much Blancpain and Omega and recently Swatch watches and let's not forget Longines who is since a long time over there. So I would say the favorite watches of the Russian is definitely Breguet that's the number one and that's in the hit list number one, but more and more you have as well Blancpain, as Glash&#xFC;tte, I have not to forget our German brand, Glash&#xFC;tte and Omega and Swatch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I said overall Russians account for what, 10% of sales maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No!</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>High?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's too high. That's too high. No, no, no, no. Look, there are still not as many -- you have a lot of millionaires and billionaires in Russia. I agree you could perhaps say this for Breguet. If I take the Breguet watch, I could say, yes, but if you take the Group I must definitely say, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay. Thank you everybody. It was nice talking with you. I will head back to Beijing and Mr. Geiser will clarify the points that you wanted to be clarified. I want to repeat, we are looking solidly forward, a very good second half. And we are sure that we will come in with a very good other record year as well as in turnover, as well as in operating profit, but also as well as in net profit. And I don't see a reason why we should not achieve this, this year and also the years to come. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.</p>
