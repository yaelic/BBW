        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining us on our conference call on the January 3rd, 2011 reinsurance renewals and the preliminary key figures for 2010. Today's speakers are J&#xF6;rg Schneider and Torsten Jeworrek. After the presentation, we will have the usual Q&amp;A session. And as always, I'd like to ask you to limit your question to a maximum of two per person.</p>
          <p>That's it from me. And J&#xF6;rg, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is my pleasure to present another pleasing result also for 2010. All figures on the slides provided today are reliable already. But as you can imagine, we have more granular data at hand, but I would not like to dig too deep into specific topics. And I have to ask for your understanding and patience for the time being as we still need a couple of days for the quality assurance and also our auditor needs to sign off.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the overview on page three &#x2013; slide three. The good result of &#x20AC;2.43 billion allows us to propose a dividend of &#x20AC;6.25 per share. This is an increase of 8.7% compared to the &#x20AC;5.75 of last year.</p>
          <p>Our shareholders' equity was further strengthened to &#x20AC;23 billion and our current share buyback will be very soon completed by the AGM on the 20th of April, 2011. We have already bought shares since the last AGM with a volume of 750 million, so another 250 million to go. Buybacks will remain an important cornerstone of our active capital management.</p>
          <p>Our actions will continue to be governed by the need for a sensible balance between, first, an appropriate capital buffer to preserve our capital strength and to allow us to take business opportunities as they often arise after major insurance or capital market losses. So in other words, we want to be strong when others are weak. And we expect, specifically, opportunities from the development around Solvency II. There is no big M&amp;A on the horizon.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we have no interest in excessive capital buffers. We want sustainable high payout to our shareholders. If we take into account the dividend and the buyback, the total cash use amounted to 10%; and now with reduced buyback of &#x20AC;500 million stilled to 8%. So our shareholders really participate in the success of the company in a, I think, rather convincing way.</p>
          <p>Our payouts are financed out of the revenue reserves under German GAAP. It is naturally a challenge to build them up in the current low interest rate environment. Accounting limitations especially stem from the duty to fill up the claims equalization reserve.</p>
          <p>So the constraints do not primarily route into earnings power of Munich Re, but in rather temporary differences between earnings and accounting revenues generation. We cannot fully close the gap, but we aim at decreasing it. In any event, we will continue to generate sustainable value for our shareholders going forward based on sound and low volatility earnings.</p>
          <p>Back on slide three, our investment result was 4.5% of the market value of our assets based on high disposal gains and a favorable duration management which proved beneficial.</p>
          <p>Couple of remarks on the segments. Reinsurance had a strong result in spite of high claims burden. In Primary Insurance, ERGO more than doubled its annual result and achieved &#x20AC;355 million. Munich Health, after a difficult start into the year 2010, is meanwhile well on track.</p>
          <p>On slide four, you see the key numbers on the left hand side; for the full year on the right hand side for the first &#x2013; fourth quarter. Here only a few comments on the fourth quarter numbers.</p>
          <p>Gross premiums written in the fourth quarter increased by &#x20AC;730 million, particularly from organic growth in property-casualty and favorable foreign exchange development in both Reinsurance segment and in Munich Health.</p>
          <p>The investment result in the fourth quarter compared to the preceding quarter was &#x2013; to fourth quarter 2009 was down some &#x20AC;700 million to &#x20AC;1.4 billion due to substantial write-downs on fixed interest related derivatives after a significant increase of interest rates in the fourth quarter. And also due to a decrease of net realized capital gains by &#x20AC;300 million. So our write-up/write-downs roughly down &#x20AC;400 million and net realized gains down &#x20AC;300 million.</p>
          <p>However, the return on investment was more or less in line with our expectations from beginning of November and, therefore, the return on investment for the full year of 4.5% is also in line with our projections which we gave in the November Analyst Conference.</p>
          <p>The consolidated results for the full group, fourth quarter 2010 compared to fourth quarter 2009 was down some &#x20AC;400 million, and this was due to the lower investment result as described and the decreased technical result, particularly in reinsurance life and primary insurance property-casualty.</p>
          <p>Some extra information on the next slide, number five. Munich Re shows tax income in the fourth quarter despite profits before taxes of &#x20AC;300 million. This is caused by many isolated effects, mainly the following &#x2013; most of our reinsurance, our US &#x2013; American reinsurance group profits are realized without a current or deferred tax burden. We have a loss carry-forward for which up to now no deferred tax asset has been recognized.</p>
          <p>Second, the corporate tax credit increased due to a beneficial ruling of the German Constitutional Court in connection with the law change in 2001.</p>
          <p>And third, we could release some tax reserve because there were lower risks in several areas than anticipated before. So this overall led to the negative tax of &#x20AC;167 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As you can also see on that slide, under Munich Re Group, we expect an increase of the economic risk capital at year-end, mainly as a consequence of low interest rates, higher implied interest rate volatilities, and higher reinsurance risk exposure. We also expect an increase in the available financial resources, but most probably not to the same extent as the increase in economic risk capital.</p>
          <p>In Reinsurance, major losses were high, especially those from natural catastrophes, was 11% compared to our normal budget of 6.5%. That means 4.5% more. On the other hand, we had in the fourth quarter moderate reserve releases in the order of &#x20AC;400 million, including the run-off from natural catastrophes. But at the same time, we strengthened the confidence level of our overall reserving.</p>
          <p>As you saw, we had significant major losses in the fourth quarter, especially from the flood in Australia, and I'm talking here only about the first flood in Queensland, and the second is an event of 2011, the floods around Brisbane. It should &#x2013; it could come up with a loss in the same order as the 2010 Australian flood. This is something around &#x20AC;260 million, &#x20AC;270 million, but it's far too early to make a good judgment now.</p>
          <p>After normalization of all impacts here &#x2013; all extraordinary impacts, we can be rather satisfied with our business development in property-casualty reinsurance. The same applies for life reinsurance; we had a very negative impact here, the reserve strengthening for our US long-term care business.</p>
          <p>The analysis of this business in run-off, which stems from the underwriting years '98 to 2002, showed that the result of this block of businesses were worse than previously assumed, owing to higher claims frequency and longer claims duration.</p>
          <p>After a general provision of &#x20AC;77 million has been put up in the third quarter on a preliminary basis, the further actuarial analysis in the fourth quarter led to additional expenses of roughly &#x20AC;240 million for the entire block of the US long-term care business.</p>
          <p>I dare to say that fortunately the long-term care business is for us in the US a niche product. It only accounts for approximately 10% of the premiums and reserves and of our US life book, and the new business volume is totally insignificant at the moment.</p>
          <p>Apart from that, the developments in life reinsurance was positive and this should also be demonstrated by the market-consistent embedded value, which we are going to disclose on the 10th of March with our annual report.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Primary Insurance, here also we had extraordinary high losses, albeit on a much lower level than in Reinsurance as some natural catastrophes in &#x2013; of mid-sized natural catastrophes in Germany, very strong winter especially in Germany and Poland and also very challenging markets in some markets abroad. And therefore, we ended up in our international business with a combined ratio of 107.8%, Germany still strong with 89.8%.</p>
          <p>The new business in life was a premium income of &#x20AC;2.9 billion. This is an increase of 16.7% compared to last year, driven by single premium business similar to the whole market, especially in Germany.</p>
          <p>This is a relatively good outcome of the year where we moved the traditionally well established brands of Hamburg-Mannheimer and Victoria to the new ERGO brand. And many people expected us to have a sharp decline of our new business, and this was absolutely not true. To the contrary, there's a good momentum in our sales forces at the moment.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the market-consistent embedded value should decline due to the decline of the risk free interest rate in life more than in health. So far with these additional informations on the IFRS and some economic numbers.</p>
          <p>On slide six, you can see the development of the volume turnover, gross premiums written grew by 10% to &#x20AC;45.5 billion. One half of this growth is due to positive foreign exchange developments, and therefore, only refers to Reinsurance. The other half was organic, composed of the impact of the large volume deals, which we had already explained a couple of time and also good organic growth of ERGO in all segments. ERGO now achieves a premium income for the full year of &#x20AC;20.1 billion, including the savings product where the premium income is not booked under IFRS.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, on the left hand side, you see our asset allocation. First, we have a decline of the market value of our investments by some &#x20AC;4 billion compared to end of September. This is due to the sharp increase in interest rates.</p>
          <p>There are only minor movements in the asset allocation. You see an increase in our equity exposure and higher miscellaneous &#x2013; that means deposits and also our investments in renewable energy.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, the investment results which was &#x20AC;700 million better than in 2009, and this can be fully explained by the better results from write-ups/write-downs. So we had deterioration in the fourth quarter with the rising yields, especially from fixed interest derivatives. But overall, for the year, we had an improvement of exactly these &#x20AC;700 million. The regular income was 4% compared to 4.2% in the preceding year.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, there is a focus on our fixed income portfolio. No major movements here since the end of September. Again here a decline, which is driven by the increase in risk-free rates. And also no major movements in the composition of our government portfolio, which you can see on the right-hand side, a good balance between the various exposures here with a very strong emphasis on highly rated securities.</p>
          <p>So far with the numbers of 2010 and now let's look forward to what Torsten will tell us about the renewal.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much, J&#xF6;rg. And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'm on slide ten. And before I come to the Munich Re portfolio, I would like to discuss our observation of the market environment in the last renewal. I can summarize that we observed an ongoing, but sort of moderate competition in this renewal.</p>
          <p>According to our observation, it was a less severe competition at least than predicted by some of the brokers early October or November. For the Munich Re, I will try to show you that we achieved a very satisfactory outcome for our portfolio. We achieved in a difficult market environment, profitable growth.</p>
          <p>But coming back to the market now, in general, one can say that the capital base of our industry is more than sufficient. Two years ago, we showed the reduction as a consequence of the financial crisis; now, we see plenty of capacity in the market. And we think that the capital base is driven by two factors. One is, of course, the sound profit of the past year, which were to a large extent retained. And the other driver is a high valuation of the bond portfolio in the insurance and reinsurance companies as a consequence of the low interest environment.</p>
          <p>This is, of course, what we call, to some extent, sort of hot air. So that means in an environment of rising interest, this part of equity, they can disappear, of course.</p>
          <p>And for all regions and all lines of business, there was enough capacity, plenty capacity available, and this together the capital base and the sort of flat demand for insurance and reinsurance led to a continued softening of crisis both in reinsurance and in insurance.</p>
          <p>There were a few expectations on the Reinsurance side and that were those segments which were affected by larger catastrophe losses in 2010. The low interest environment itself was hardly an issue for price discussions in the renewal.</p>
          <p>On slide number 11, now to the Munich Re portfolio, we achieved two different results in the renewal. On one hand, we continued with our very consistent and tough cycle management as the response to the softening prices in the market. That cycle management affected, of course, the in-force business in our portfolio and we took very conscious decisions not to renew or to reduce shares where necessary.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, and that is a bit different compared to the years before, in this renewal, we could take advantage of some new business opportunities and wrote some large proportionate treaties, which came new into the market and were only to some extent or hardly available for the broad majority of other reinsurers. And this together, I think, is a very satisfactory result because it means we can profitably grow in a difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Maybe a few indications of market prices which we have observed, first, our general views for the existing business &#x2013; so not for the new business, for the existing business, that on an overall basis the market saw price reductions by single-digit percentage points. For loss free catastrophe excess of lost contracts, the price reductions were larger, in the order of 5% to 10%, particularly the US market, a bit less than the European market. And then, on the other hand, for the loss affected cat programs like New Zealand or Australia, there were price increase in the order of 50% -- 40%, 50% available.</p>
          <p>Offshore business, here the liability side was affected less, the property side as a consequence of Gulf of Mexico, 50%, 100%, in a few cases 150%.</p>
          <p>And then the other exceptional market was, of course, as known, the motor UK market where as a consequence of the very bad combined ratios on the marketplaces, sharp price increases were achieved in 2010 or starting in 2010 in the order of 30%, sometimes 35% and we think that this trend in the UK motor market will continue.</p>
          <p>A few words to the specialty lines, as far as credit business is concerned, this line of business has completely recovered. You will see the attachment that we will show for our portfolio here, the plus/minus zero rate development for our portfolio that reflects, to our best knowledge, the current price development we have seen.</p>
          <p>I should, however, mention that this type of price development or rate development is on a very high level and is on &#x2013; even on a better level than we expected one year ago at the 2010 renewal.</p>
          <p>In other words, credit developed during the course of the year much better than anticipated. And on that level, we achieved a sizable rate development.</p>
          <p>Aviation &#x2013; here, this slide, the airline business is again under pressure in the order of 5%, sometimes 10%.</p>
          <p>Next slide, slide number 12 shows you the figure for the Munich Re portfolio. Similar to the last year, almost two-thirds of our traditional reinsurance business that excludes our risks &#x2013; what we call, risk solution business, so our direct insurance activities which we entertain in the Reinsurance segment, were two-thirds &#x2013; close to two-thirds of this reinsurance business was up for renewal. January is still our biggest renewal date.</p>
          <p>And as you see here that this represents a premium amount of &#x20AC;7.8 billion &#x2013; close to &#x20AC;7.9 billion. And as a consequence of our cycle management, we had to cancel about 16% of this volume, which is approximately &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And it's very difficult to identify what we canceled here because that goes over all regions and into all lines of business and it's a broad response to prices.</p>
          <p>And further on the right in the chart, you see the two columns of the increase on the renewal business and the new business. And here we achieved despite the difficult market environment significant growth. And this was profitable growth and it's not business which we took away in the free competition from other clients &#x2013; from available business in other portfolios. That was new business, large quota share business which was available as a consequence of stronger growth, particularly in the Asian markets.</p>
          <p>So what's happened here? In the fourth quarter, there were a number of clients who approached us as they need a sort of risk release as an alternative tool to refinance themselves to support their solvency ratios which deteriorated as a consequence of their original strong growth, particularly in China.</p>
          <p>And as an alternative tool to manage their solvency ratios, they decided to buy on pretty short notice some additional, what we call, solvency proportional treaties with volumes in a three-digit million order for the Munich Re. So this business was new and this was only available for a very small number of reinsurers.</p>
          <p>We also achieved few proportional treaties in Europe, which can be considered as the sort of first development towards Solvency II. I would not like to exaggerate this development because I don't think that this is sustainable yet, but the few companies decided to buy some additional reinsurance already now.</p>
          <p>In the column, increase of renewal, you see a 4.6% growth. This is basically driven by a very few number of clients, particularly because of our participation on a proportionate basis in the UK motor market.</p>
          <p>So altogether, the outcome is then that we achieved volume increase by 4.1%, which represents a premium of &#x20AC;8.2 billion. And the price change, which is also though shown here in this chart, for the overall portfolio, it's almost flat, what we call a black zero and therefore I wanted to show it here, 0.1%. This is a pure rate change.</p>
          <p>Of course, this rate change is not achieved by application of better rate to all the existing portfolio, it's also the consequence of the cancellation of very deadly performing business on one side, which is shown under cancelled, and new business which will perform much better.</p>
          <p>So finally, one can say our general underwriting policy is absolutely unchanged wherever necessary. We will definitely stick to profitability and cancel business, but there were new opportunities this time.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide 13, you see the change by line of business and by region. What should be mentioned here is another line of business. The chart, you see a reduction in credit which might surprise you a bit where we go down from 6% -- from 7% to 6% in a good market environment, as I told you.</p>
          <p>What is the reason for this? It has nothing to do with cycle management or with better rates. It's only a consequence of one client which decided to limit the placed share with their reinsurer as from 2011 onwards. And because we had a higher participation in that client, we were brought down to their maximum new limit.</p>
          <p>Then you also see here, under casualty, a very sharp increase &#x2013; or a slight increase from 35% to 36%, which is volume-wise about 200 million. And this is our new business in motor UK, but although part of the solvency quota shares in Asia.</p>
          <p>On the regional side, on the right side here on the chart, you see exactly what I mentioned, sharp increase in Asia and then reduction in Europe.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, a few highlights to demonstrate what &#x2013; where we changed our portfolio. And as mentioned in the first part of the table, it's hard for me to mention very specific lines of business or regions where we gave up business. It's a large number of bread and butter business where we reduced our shares or gave it completely up.</p>
          <p>It should be mentioned, a very significant change in the Dutch market. Here we gave up alone in motor more than &#x20AC;40 million together with other cancellations. That is a reduction of our portfolio share in The Netherland by more than one-third. It should also be mentioned that we continue to reduce our proportionate participation in the German fire business due to competition.</p>
          <p>On the growth side, the lower part of the table, you see very specific reasons where we increased our share. First, strategic business expansion that is here, motor UK is included. Then the 70 million, with a very few clients, we could achieve or agree on new projects where we achieved either higher share or followed clients with their expansion abroad and then the very big share of 500 million where we wrote additional solvency-related business in China, but also in other territories of the world.</p>
          <p>So this last part is quota-share deals on a proportionate basis. They can be to some extent compared with the large deals which we could write in the last two years in life and health. And it has to do with our technical experience, but it's also with our close relationship, two clients, and they were placed mainly on a direct basis and mainly with Munich Re.</p>
          <p>So based on these results, I'm very satisfied with the renewal. It is, to be honest, a bit better or, to some extent &#x2013; not only a bit better, it is better than I expected originally. And on a sort of normalized basis, if we should see the sort of average cat activity in 2010, I'm sort of optimistic that we can significantly improve our combined ratio and would carefully say that we might end in the order around 97%, so optimistic view and I would give back to J&#xF6;rg Schneider.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Torsten. A few final remarks on slide 16. We showed resilient earnings in a challenging environment with especially high claims activity. Torsten demonstrated how even on a strict bottom-line orientation we can grow our property-casualty reinsurance business. Our solid capitalization and the good and stable earnings allow us to increase the dividend again and continue the share buyback, albeit in a somewhat moderated way.</p>
          <p>And just &#x2013; and finally, a few remarks as an outlook for 2011. We expect the net result to be about the same as in 2010. That sounds a little bit better than three months ago. Nothing dramatic has changed. We expect an improved technical result, as Torsten said, with good renewal outcome and on the basis of the budgeted major losses.</p>
          <p>We expect a slightly decreasing investment result and both should add up to something in the order of the 2.4, which we achieved this year. But this is, as you can imagine, highly uncertain because it's just beginning of February.</p>
          <p>Now, we look forward to your questions and to the discussion.</p>

          <p>Thank you, sir <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Andy Broadfield of Barclays. Your line is now open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Hi. I just have two questions, please. One, I just want to understand a little better about the Asian growth drivers. It sounded like it was more that the reinsurance option was a cheaper capital solution for companies to add some capital stress. I was wondering if that capital stress has to do with just trying to fund growth, and therefore, I think in one of your slides you mentioned Asia becoming &#x2013; moving from 11% to 15% of your revenues. So I was just interested to see whether that's a sort of trend that you think you're going to continue to see or whether that it is just perhaps a little bit of one-off based and that it would return back to sort of more normal levels later?</p>
          <p>Second question, just on the transitional arrangements in Solvency II, I think you said at some &#x2013; previously, you had some inquiries about Solvency II. The latest suggestion is that the transitional &#x2013; a proposal to have transitional arrangement, does that take away that potential opportunity for you, at least diminish it materially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Torsten here. I would start with the first question. The Asian solvency related quota share treaty, it's &#x2013; the clients approached us in the fourth quarter. And you would see already some of the premium volume in the last quarter 2004 by the way. What happened? They had towards the end of the year an issue to manage their solvency ratios. And the growth, which deteriorated their solvency ratios, was for their original business in the order of 25%, 30% or so and was mainly driven by the very sharply rising motor market in China.</p>
          <p>So they had then, at the end of the day, two options and they finally decided &#x2013; although because they needed the sort of quick solutions within the fourth quarter of the last year to decide for the reinsurance alternative. I cannot tell you any figure comparison here, how that compares with the cost of capital in the capital market. The quota shares are in a way structured, so that they protect both the downside and the upside for the reinsurer, but they leave us with very, let's say, decent margins for this type of business.</p>
          <p>How long do I expect to have this business? Now, we had it in the fourth quarter for the first time. We have it now for the full year 2011. I cannot exclude that some of the companies might consider for 2012 or for the years after to look for alternative capital management measures. But that is unknown to us and not foreseeable now, at least for the year and maybe for a few more years that business should or might stay with us. That is what I can comment without going too much into the client details.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question on the transitional rules on Solvency II, how much does this take away our business opportunities. A big bang from Solvency I to Solvency II in 2013 had never been realistic and therefore a pragmatic transition with a phasing in of the new rules is anyway right, pragmatic and is much better than the total postponement of Solvency II which was perhaps also meanwhile on the horizon.</p>
          <p>But Solvency II will become a reality as of 2013. And I have the impression that it will be earlier, that it has already started somewhat, as Torsten told you from the renewal.</p>
          <p>So the primary insurers will look to their Solvency II solvency ratios and perhaps the independent financial advisers, the brokers will do their job in exercising pressure that companies move early to this superior solvency regime because when I compare Solvency II with the economic principles to what we have at the moment in Europe, then this is a quantum leap. And therefore, we trust that the gradual &#x2013; that there will be a gradual shift to Solvency II driven thinking and that this will be beneficial for our business. Does this answer your question, Andy?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I guess it does. I guess the only quick follow-up is whether there's &#x2013; you have started to see anything beyond enquires. The sense I get is that there's quite lot of enquires, but not a lot of transaction, is that a fair statement at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way. Since 2010, we have seen indeed a lot of demand for sort of consultancy type service, so the client wanted to know from us what will the models means for us, what could it mean if I apply this sort and that sort of reinsurance, how big is the impact on me? Just started now. Within the 500 million, where I said Solvency related business, there were about close to 70 million solvency-related businesses from European companies. So this is in our opinion sustainable platform, a very small number of clients who began with the first transition towards Solvency II.</p>
          <p>And therefore, I think that is very sustainable unless Solvency II is completely in doubt, which I don't think and don't assume. And when will it start and will it continue to be a realistic? I don't expect a very fast, further development until the rules and the time of the introductions and the basis of the introductions is really clear at the end.</p>
          <p>Now, if I would be a company who would consider it, I would wait probably for the sort of definite outcome or so. Therefore, I think I would not increase the hopes too much here that we see a lot of quick additional business already in the year 2011.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two things please. The first one is, can you just try and help me maybe reconcile the fourth quarter combined ratio in the Reinsurance business. I know this is an exercise we do every quarter. But if I take the 96% stated number and adjust it for about five percentage points of excess large losses, but I guess there is about eight percentage points of reserve release in the number. I am not sure how much of the reserve release exactly relates to the fourth quarter versus the other quarters. But that would seem to suggest an underlying number of about 99%. Is that sort of about right?</p>
          <p>But on &#x2013; the second issue is, can you just give us a bit more detail on the combined ratio side of Germany on the Primary business. The 107.8 does seem to be sort of dramatically large movement quarter-on-quarter. I'm just wondering, is that entirely weather or unusual events or is there some reserve issues in there or maybe you could just give us a bit more color? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah, then let me start with the reinsurance, and the combined ratio for the fourth quarter on a standalone basis 96, that is true. Not cut higher, roughly 5%, that is also true. Reserve releases make up for some 11%, but this is including the special effect, which one has to see. And part of the reserve release comes along with increase in provisions in commissions. That means the increase in the run-off of the business is partially reversed by these commissions. And if we also adjust for that phenomenon, then we end up roughly in the same order as for the full year and that is some 98%.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Then combined ratio, ERGO abroad, is 112.7. This is partially due to high natural catastrophe losses or catastrophe is perhaps also exaggerated, very strong winter, Poland as I said before, but also difficult market environment especially in motor business in Turkey and in South Korea. This explains a lot of this non-sustainable, very high combined ratio. We are confident that we will bring it down in 2011.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Michael Huttner of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. The first question was on Australia and New Zealand, I guess. On Australia, yesterday we had a figure from Hannover of 16 million, 16. You have a figure of 267. Now, you're not &#x2013; as far as I can work out, you're not 15 times the size of Hannover, kind of four times the size of or three time the size of Hannover. And so I don't know how to put this question politely. But maybe you can give us how long would it take for you to get your money back just out of Australia assuming a normal run of event in Australia going forward. My guess is here the diversification played too much influence on the underwriting and the decisions were a little bit skewed. But maybe I'm wrong, I hope to be wrong.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the return on investment, you guys said &#x2013; currently said, the figure &#x2013; the underlying recurring figure was for 2009 4.2%, for 2010 4.0%, and I just wondered if you could give us a feel for the number you see in 2011, which I guess is included in the 2.4 billion for the year. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Torsten here. Let me start with the Australian flood question. I don't know the market share distribution between the various reinsurers, I only know ours. And we have indeed a high market share in Australia historically &#x2013; that is not new &#x2013; which is in the available reinsurance business &#x2013; in the freely available reinsurance business about 30%.</p>
          <p>So with this figure in mind, I cannot comment it, but I can imagine at least that we're much more than four times larger than Hannover Re or others in that market. According to the first estimate, which we have here available, our share in these loss events based on the figures we gave and we estimate that the insured market loss for both floods together is in the order of AUD5 billion, is below our market share in reinsurance.</p>
          <p>So on that basis, it must be expected. If we have such market share, historically, I can only argue, over the last five to ten years, both the cat book or the total book of business in non-life is extremely profitable for us in Australia.</p>
          <p>So, yes, in a year like 2007 &#x2013; '10, we are in the red, no doubt, but I am optimistic that our pricing is very adequate. Of course, after such an event, you reconsider your models, reconsider your pricing approach, we haven't found anything what should be changed, which does not mean that we will not increase prices, but the model as such are in order. So that's what I can tell now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From my side, you ask about the return on investment, Michael, 4.2 running yield, not return on investment; running yield for '09, 4.2; '10, 4.0; 2011, I would guess a little bit less, roughly 3.9, around 3.9. It's not so easy. This is based on the following assumption &#x2013; a turnover rate of 20% equivalent to a five-year duration, a reinvestment rate, which is calculated on the basis of an average yield during the last six months and then we would end up slightly below 4%. So it's a mild development, somewhat milder than we had expected a couple of months ago.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So higher technical result because we do not expect the same development in life re as we had and the same high level of claims when we do this budgeting here. And on the other hand, a slightly lower investment return because we do not plan for high realized gains and write-up or write-down.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, just a couple of questions. I wonder, J&#xF6;rg, if you could just give us a bit more color behind the reserve movement in the quarter, the positive run-off of &#x20AC;400 million. You mentioned &#x2013; I think you were trying to suggest that you'd strengthened as well as released reserves.</p>
          <p>In the past, you've obviously been strengthening the older years and releasing from the younger '04 kind of onwards years. What's the dynamic between the years currently? Just give us a little bit more color as to where the reserve release has come from and where you think you've strengthened.</p>
          <p>I guess the other question, on these large surplus release deals, is there any issue when you recognize profit in terms of timing of profit recognition. Does that &#x2013; is an issue on the life side or there's a somewhat deferred recognition of profit? Is that true of these kind of deals on the non-life side or should I just treat them as standard quota share deals? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Torsten here. Let me start with your second question referring to the solvency quota share deals to the new ones. No, the pattern of the cash flows and when we earn the money here is completely different, has nothing to do with the life behavior. The business composition by line of business is to a very large extent motor business and then some other lines of business like property are, of course, included. We get the cash flow at the beginning, like on the very traditional motor, any other quota share treaty. The only specific feature, so to speak, in these treaties is that you have a commission adjustment. But it means we have always the money and the profits in our books only at the end of the term. There is a sort of sliding scale commission, which is adjusted according to the underlying loss ratios. That's the only specific feature to protect our downside, but also to limit our upside to some extent. But we make some money immediately not only accounting-wise, but also in terms of real cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; I guess you also took part in a large multi-year deal in the January renewals, I think you were the least, is there any issue there in terms of profit recognition or again should I treat that as a multi-year deal, but you're kind of booking that on a one year, one year, one year kind of basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I understand you correctly, but if you mean the same, I could not comment because these are client-specific issues. That's my problem now. I can only say in general, whenever we entertain multi-year treaties, we do it on an extremely strong basis, which is double check twice or three times in our company as far as price and conditions are concerned. And the second point is, we never do it without a sort of adjustment and change clauses which take care of changes in portfolio exposure developments. That's what I can say in general. Because it applies to all of our multi-national treaties, it might also &#x2013; it definitely will apply to specific treaties which you might have in mind. Is that a fair comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And finally, I guess, you are effectively guiding for an improvement in underlying profitability because you said you thought you could achieve 97%. Obviously, <mark type="inaudible" /> underlying is you want to get 98%. Is that just as clear? That's the message you're trying to give that the underlying profitability is improving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is, to some extent, correct what you say. I have the following view. You normalize our current combined ratio by large losses and particularly by the cat impact in 2010. And then you end up around the 98% already, then we have very slight improvement already as a result of the renewal, January 1 now. And then I have some careful confidence that our overall reserve levels are, let's say, prudent. And if the very positive development should continue, and I have signed for that, but no definite answers, of course, then I can at least imagine that there is some positive contribution in 2011 too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I can jump in here, with the development of 2010 with the reserve, for our overall non-life reinsurance business, the run-off result was positive roughly by approximately &#x20AC;400 million. And within this &#x20AC;400 million, there are roughly &#x20AC;100 million clear run-off from natural catastrophes. So adjusted for it, it's only major losses overall. So adjusted for it, it's some &#x20AC;300 million. And developments in opposite directions, as you mentioned already, for non-traditional exposures such as asbestos and latent mass tort risks, the actual reported losses during the calendar year in the United States were higher than expectations, like the court ruling we got in the case of Western MacArthur. And this led to reserve strengthening in the year 2000 and prior &#x2013; in the 2000 and prior accident years.</p>
          <p>And the development in these older years for traditional business was positive for most segments or stable for US workers' comp. In the traditional years, for later years, for accident years 2009 and prior or 2001 and later, we had favorable indications consistently across our company's business segments and accident years. And although the rate level has been softening, we have no evidence of adverse developments in our initial reserve assessment for these more recent years.</p>
          <p>So what we do when we get these positive indications? We do establish balance sheet provisions on a more conservative basis in comparison to our pricing estimate. While these provisions are a best estimate, the provisions are prudent and we would hope that on a long-run basis, the reserve performance should be neutral or positive, as Torsten indicated. And we would expect to realize favorable one-off results more often than adverse indications, but we cannot promise that for a specific year.</p>
          <p>All-in-all, we feel well reserved here and our confidence has slightly improved in spite of the run-off results, which were in total positive for this year. Does this answer your question, Andrew?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I had a question on the equalization reserves. I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of how much is distributable in the holding company after reflecting the restrictions of HGB accounting? But also where whether you've looked at ways around this problem because I would assume if you were to reinsure the main operating company to somewhere, another country, where they don't have to hold equalization reserves, you'd really be able to free up a lot of that money, so I am just wondering how much flexibility do you have around that and what sort of time-table would you have to create more flexibility within your distributable reserves? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, this is a valid remark and especially what you describe here would be in theory possible. But this would lead to an unfavorable capital allocation in the group because we would have to capitalize another company beside the Munich Re AG. And one of the strength of our overall capital position in Munich Re is that we have very little tangibility constraints because some 75% of the reinsurance business is written out of Munich Re AG. And this is extremely capital efficient. And it's the other side, the flip side of the coin of what we described, has been constrained for our profit distribution.</p>
          <p>Perhaps, I can share with you some numbers on the revenue reserve and the equalization reserve. Currently, the equalization reserve stands at some &#x20AC;7.5 billion with a maximum of &#x20AC;10 billion. Maximum means that we have to fill it up, up to that amount and dependant on the development in the various lines of business.</p>
          <p>So there is some way to go, but according to our prognosis for the business, if we have good underwriting results, we have to fill up this equalization reserve for another couple of years. But then it would slowly come down because one basis is also derived from the volatility of the business in the last 15 years. And since our underwriting is so disciplined and the volatility has come down somewhat in comparison to the very difficult 90s of the last century, there is a declining curve here that helped.</p>
          <p>Our distributable funds at the end of 2009 were &#x20AC;3.3 billion. We paid dividends, we did share buyback of &#x20AC;1.3 billion or together of 2.5 payouts in the last 12 months. We had a positive change in German accounting rules of some &#x20AC;500 million and a profit for the year in the parent company of some &#x20AC;1.4 billion roughly, not audited yet. So that would lead us to a current status of distributable funds of &#x20AC;2.8 billion. So this is fine. This does not make us courageous when it comes to future payouts and therefore we have halved the share buyback piece. But you can rely on us being very sensitive here for us and I think we have a good track record, high payouts are always very high on the agenda. There is no need and no ambition to keep very high buffer in Munich Re.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Good afternoon. Two questions. First on the reserve strengthening and the DAC write-down in the long-term care business in the US, from my understanding you have taken a hit in the third quarter of &#x20AC;100 million and in the fourth quarter of &#x20AC;215 million roundabout. What has changed in the fourth quarter that you did not put up the whole &#x20AC;350 million already in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>And my second question is a little bit basic. I apologize for this. But the 0.1% pure price effect, I try to reconcile that and I wonder how expected claims inflation comes into play here if we assume that claims inflation normalized to the 2%. Does this mean that the true pricing, the quality of the book is deteriorating by 2% or how does the claims inflation come into play here?</p>

          <p>Michael, Torsten here. I'll start with the claims inflation question, although I apologize for my basic answer, but it's pretty simple. This calculation is made after considering claims inflation. Very simple, we have per region per lines of business per industry claims inflation figures for all the underwriting units available which we permanently adjust and update.</p>
          <p>And these, so to speak, preset figures are a mandatory part of our underwrite &#x2013; of our pricing methodology, so that means they're automatically applied against future losses and then the premium is measured against these already inflated losses and that means the 0.1% is then the additional like-for-like comparison.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, in the chart number two &#x2013; sorry, the chart number 12, the total book-to-cycle management chart, the claims inflation is then included in the &#x20AC;362 million &#x2013; the expected claims inflation is then included in the &#x20AC;362 million increase on renewables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The claim &#x2013; the claims inflation is an underlying loss figure, so to speak, and we charge premium against expected losses. So that has, first of all, nothing to do with &#x2013; and showing premium figure here. And you can have even the reduced premium and nevertheless you can have considered claims inflation because you have then different attachment points, et cetera. So that's a different issue. If you, let's say, have just a proportionate book of business and nothing else, no further adjustment features, then claims inflation is reflected in the best way under higher exposure. Yeah?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, from my side, long-term care reserve strengthening, the figure you mentioned for the third quarter, 100, was US dollars and that's translated into &#x20AC;77 million and now there is another 238 roughly also expressed in euros.</p>
          <p>Why &#x2013; wasn't it all booked in the third quarter? We had detected at that time one major contract with this problem. And we did not know how much the same phenomenon affected the whole portfolio. Afterward some more intensive reviews were done and we felt that it would be prudent and necessary to do the same bookings more or less for the whole portfolio of this kind of business. But it is limited, so it's not an unlimited problem. It should be fixed.</p>

          <p>Our next question today comes from Brian Shea from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Most of my &#x2013; I guess, the most important questions have been answered. There are just two small questions I could put please. First of all, German motor, is this market good or bad? Hannover Re yesterday was suggesting that it has begun to turn. They talked about price increases of 5% and suggested that it's getting better. You guys still seem pretty cautious. If you could just give a bit more color on that, I'd be grateful.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, J&#xF6;rg can you update us on your expectation for the tax rate going forward? I guess you expect to realize more earnings out of the US. And if you are not writing back the DTA, should we be &#x2013; actually, I can see a lower tax rate than we previously had been expecting. I guess the easier thing is if you tell us what you think the tax rate is going to be going forward. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, Torsten here. I'll start with your first question, German motor. Price increases we have seen in the market refer to the non-proportional reinsurance business in the German motor market. Here the single-digit price increase is possible. Despite of these price increases, we decided not to re-increase our share in the non-proportional motor business. Why? Because the index clauses under these non-proportional treaties, which respond or take care of the loss development once the treaty is in place, they are still not sufficient and still under discussion with the client and the German Insurance Association. So as long as these claim index clauses on the non-proportionate is not changed, we will not increase our market share here.</p>
          <p>As far as the insurance business is concerned, motor insurance, well, I can only comment on our position. We have not reconsidered our &#x2013; or changed our position and still keep away from that business. So we have not increased our motor premium volume in Germany after we have reduced it, as you know, significantly over the last years. The only, let's say, neutral, if you want, figure which is available to get an idea of the performance of the insurance motor market in Germany is the 105% combined ratio, which is publicly available by the German Insurance Association.</p>
          <p>So if I may add, according to our observation, no rate changes yet in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Same applies from a primary insurer perspective. We are very cautious here, the business is still not good enough, but at least it's not getting worse, and perhaps to the contrary. So at ERGO, we observed the market with lot of interest, but currently not in aggressive way.</p>
          <p>Your question on tax rates going forward, our general tax rate in Germany is 33%. In reality, it is mostly lower. This is due to a couple of effects, which we also described in the annex to our annual report. But mainly, it's a realization of tax free gains here and there. And secondly, more and more thanks to the good performance of our US entities. And they really get most of their profits tax free because we have not set up a deferred tax asset. It could well be that we will have to do that if the confidence in the recovery of the loss carried forward increases from year-on-year, then it could well also be that we have to set up a deferred tax asset, which would be a positive one-off impact, but we have not planned for it yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up on the tax point, I think in the past you suggested 33% would be the max and down to 30% could be the bottom. Would you stick with that? Are you feeling more optimistic that you could go below 30%? And then I guess the other one, what will be the timing on your kind of considering reactivating the US DTA and can you tell us what is the stock of DTA that's written off at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know that by heart, perhaps a colleague can help me out with the stock later on. But yeah, I am a bit reluctant to give too precise prognosis around the tax rate because it's jumping up and down from quarter-to-quarter. In principle, for us internally, we see roughly for reinsurance in the order of 25%. In primary insurance, we cannot expect it to be substantially lower than 33%. It depends on the commercial tax rate, which is the local tax. So it's a bit lower than 33% but not structurally lower and the stock of the deferred tax assets in the US is quite big due to our &#x2013; due to the bad start we had with our business there, with our acquisition. But it is not &#x2013; it is not too high figures we can expect here, if we have to write it up. I will give you a better indication in the course of our analyst conference on that.</p>

          <p>Our next question today is from Paul Goodhind from Redburn. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up from Michael Huttner's question on the Australian losses. Can you just scale these for us and say how many years of profits have you given up in 2010, put that in context?</p>
          <p>Secondly, can you give a feeling for whether your cat exposure will increase in 2011 versus 2010, perhaps by giving us the one in 250-year loss, whether that's going to be greater this year compared with last, given what you've done at renewals?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, obviously you've got on the investment income side the effective lower bond yield, but also I guess your mix of new business is probably different to your mix in terms of the back book from a duration perspective. Can you give any insight into that duration difference? I am thinking in particular your move into Asia. I'm guessing that perhaps is a shorter duration than the rest of your business. And are there any other differences between the new business and the back book on the duration front? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the Australian loss again. Few figures maybe in my &#x2013; our portfolio size in 2010 was in the non-life business &#x20AC;510 million approximately. Considering that the large part of that is non-proportionate business, which is of course exposed to exactly these events, then the loss amount is easily understandable in my opinion. Historically, after such events in Australia, we expect returns of such losses for the overall portfolio, not just of course from the impacted covers five, six years or so.</p>
          <p>As far as cat exposure is concerned, I don't have the exact figures at hand yet and that is a detailed information we would like to provide you in early March analyst conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the duration of the new business versus the current business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question was whether the duration of the liabilities were changed, Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so what you've written in 2011, is that duration shorter than the duration that you have written historically? I am trying to model the effect of a change in mix on the investment income in terms of mix and duration effects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Duration is expected to be slightly shorter, I would say. We both &#x2013; for the proportionate business, we wrote now and although the non-proportionate business are more short-ish tail business compared with the business we cancelled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you quantify that at all in terms of scale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I cannot quantify that yet.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Maciej from Morgan Stanley. I've got two questions. First of all, could you update us on what the latest position is under S&amp;P in terms of excess capital if possible? And secondly, and very broadly, I am just wondering whether or not you could describe what you see occurring in the life reinsurance business this year and what assumptions you're putting into your profits, whether you see a strong premium growth and how that will evolve in your numbers please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Life re is always an issue because either you get the big deals or you don't get it and we do not want to plan for it, because that would put us under inappropriate growth pressure. And we have very good growth opportunities, especially in Asia and lot of promising client relationships here which we were built up. Torsten, you want to add something on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other question was about excess capital with Standard &amp; Poor's?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Small single digit number, but it is somewhat volatile because they are a number of topics which you discuss with the rating agencies to get the appropriate classification here. So we are in safe territory, but not excessively redundant capitalization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say that &#x2013; perhaps another way of putting it is you've given us your distributable capital under the German GAAP position. Would you say that S&amp;P would be more or less restrictive than your position under German GAAP?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It cannot be said so precisely, because there are number of points which you can put in one or the other bucket and the agency, not only Standard &amp; Poor's, but also the other, they are increasingly looking at the economics of the risk positions and not apply and do not apply blindly the models. Therefore, it is very difficult to ask to do these model calculations. But it does not close any sleepless nights for me.</p>
          <p>So perhaps, I am a very happy CFO because things are well balanced. On one hand I have this bottleneck, let's call it, like this, of the HGB revenue reserve. On the other hand, this is more or less in line with the room for maneuver we have from other point of view. And also we think that it is perhaps prudent to keep some good capitalization in this phase of migration to Solvency II. So, I think things are well balanced and we have a very high payout and we provide our shareholders with the very good return overall and you can rely on us to do everything what is meaningful and that for us the payout is of utmost important.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Sorry, just one question I think if I can ask at this point, on the casualty slide in the backup most of the increase and the new business seems to be the UK Motor and the Asian quota share. Is that a fair understanding? And in that case does it imply that you're cutting quite aggressively in other areas like US casualty? That would be the one question I would like to ask. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed, it's exactly the right description. The two markets, you described caused a growth in the problematic areas like the UK. But also some other markets, we sharply reduced it; US markets we reduced it, exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just follow up, you've also just said that liability duration was going down. Can I assume then that these Asian motor quota shares are going to &#x2013; are not really long tail quota shares, and is that a fair understanding as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is also true, despite the major portion of these Asian quota shares, our motor business, not all motor business but the major portion is motor and the Chinese motor business as far as the tail is concerned it's pretty short tail in its character. Therefore your assumption is right.</p>
