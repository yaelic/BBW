          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to the AMX First Quarter 2010 Results. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions Mr. Mauricio Fernandes Senior Latin America Telecom Analyst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ben [20.3], good morning or good afternoon to everyone. My name is Mauricio Fernandes and I'm the Latin America Telecom and Media Analyst for Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. We are honored to host this quarter's conference call to discuss America Movil's first quarter 2010 results. I'm in Sao Paulo, Brazil and from America Movil in Mexico City, we have Daniel Hajj, CEO; Carlos Garcia Moreno, CFO; and Daniela Lecuona, Head of Investor Relations. Daniel, Carlos and Daniela thank you very much for opportunity. Daniel and Carlos, you may now go ahead with your initial remarks. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mauricio. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for being at the call. As always Carlos is going to present a summary of the results. Carlos, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Mauricio, thanks for hosting the call. The economic recovery and the appreciation of every Latin American currency versus the U.S. dollar, shall bring about a reacceleration of consumer spending and subscriber growth. All of these, together with the continued interest in data services, we saw very strong profit growth, and several countries' significant EBITDA margin expansion. Before going into the numbers, it is important to note that the financial figures for the first quarter of both 2010 and 2009 have been presented for the first time on the international financial reporting standards, IFRS.</p>
          <p>Mexican companies are obliged to move towards IFRS and we decided to have this move coincide with the beginning of our new fiscal year. We have handed over to the bolsa financial information for the full year 2009 in IFRS and you may all consult this information at the website of the bolsa.</p>
          <p>The main thing regarding the income statement has to do with revenues, which are now presented net of commissions paid to distributors and the cost of loyalty programs. Compared to Mexican GAAP, this means that these revenue figures come down, although EBITDA is very much unaffected. This leads to higher EBITDA margin from the IFRS than under Mexican GAAP.</p>
          <p>Our new additions totaled 5.5 million subscribers. They were 41% greater than a year before. Mexico, Brazil and Tracfone in the U.S. each contributed more than a million net adds, with Argentina, Colombia and Peru each bringing in approximately 400,000 subs.</p>
          <p>In relative terms Tracfone was a more than amicable subsidiary, having increased its subscriber base 31% from a year before. At the end of March, we had 270 million lines, of which 206 million are wireless.</p>
          <p>First quarter revenues, just shy of 100 billion pesos under IFRS, were up 9.8% year on year, with data revenues driving SAB's revenue growth. The share of SAB's revenues went up nearly 5 points from the year earlier quarter to 21.3%. Under Mexican GAAP revenues would have increased 9.1% and SAB's revenues 8.4%.</p>
          <p>It's important to note that at constant exchange rates, revenue growth would have been a full percentage point higher, both as regards total revenues and as regards to service revenues irrespectively under Mexican GAAP or under IFRS.</p>
          <p>EBITDA reached 42.3 billion pesos, which represents a 12.4% increase in annual gain under IFRS, which was virtually identical to the one obtained using Mexican GAAP, which was 12.5%. The EBITDA margin increased 1 percentage point to 42.8%. Under Mexican GAAP, it will have increased 1.2 percentage points to 41.7%. So again, in terms of the increase of the EBITDA margin, it was particularly identical under Mexican GAAP than under IFRS. If anything, it was even higher under Mexican GAAP.</p>
          <p>Our operating profits were up 11% on the prior year to 29 billion pesos, while our matching costs were down 38% on foreign exchange gains and a lower average level of net debt. Together that helps us come up with a net profit before taxes of 27 billion pesos in the quarter, which exceeded by 18% that of the year-earlier quarter.</p>
          <p>Our net income, 16.9 billion pesos was up 2% from a year before on greater tax provisions, including those associated with a higher corporate tax rate in Mexico, but also to do with the exception of tax losses and tax credits that took place last year have so far been increasing the profit before taxes mentioned above.</p>
          <p>Our net debt, 266 billion pesos at the end of March, 17 billion less than at the close of 2009, with a record 5.4 billion pesos to capital expenditures and a similar amount to share buybacks. In March, both Moody's and Standard and Poor's have raised America Movil's ratings, to A-2 and A- respectively. The grade was amongst the highest within the telecom sector globally. I believe there's only 26 that have higher, marginally higher grade ratings than America Movil today.</p>
          <p>In the same month and taking advantage of very strong conditions in the grade markets, America Movil issued $4 billion in five 10-year notes and 10-year bonds. It was only in the U.S. market. Previously we had issued bonds for an additional $1.4 billion equivalent, mostly in the Mexican market.</p>
          <p>Well with that, Mauricio, I would like to pass it back to you and maybe we can start the Q&amp;A session. Thank you all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Carlos. As participants line up for Q&amp;A I'll just kick off with asking 2 questions. First in Mexico, the ARPU was once again quite solid, as you said, and up 3% year-on-year, while this time subscriber and net additions have actually picked up. Could you or Daniel comment on the outlook for Mexico and what you expect for these metrics? And then the second question is on the U.S. market, revenue growth there was quite impressive at 60% year on year, and the ARPU went up 11%. Can you comment on the main drivers behind this performance and what you would expect for subscriber growth in ARPU there going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mauricio, on Mexico, I think the ARPU has been very strong, solid, and I think there are 3 main reasons. The first one is that you could see that we're focusing on high-end subscribers. Our post-paid subscribers are growing at a very good pace and we're focusing a lot of our strategy in the post-paid subscribers.</p>
          <p>The second point would be data. We are growing on post-paid, but we are growing also. In our own base of post-paid we're selling new things to our customers, mainly those things are data plans for all these customers. And the third thing is I think Mexico economy is recovering a little bit, and that helped us to have a better margin &#x2013; sorry, a better ARPU.</p>
          <p>On the second question talking a little bit about the U.S., we have different programs in the U.S. We have the Tracfone program. We have the Net10 Program and then we have this straight link program, and then the Straight Talk. The first three, the Tracfone, the Net10 and the straight link are programs that the ARPU could be around 10 to $15.00, maybe $8.00 all in different plans.</p>
          <p>And the Straight Talk plan is a plan that you have 30 or $40 ARPU. So that's mainly the reason why our revenues are growing so strong. We have a very good quarter in the Straight Talk Plan. And that's the reason why we have a 60% increase in revenue growth. Know that that's mainly what is happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. Now Ben, we may now open the call to Q&amp;A. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Miguel Garcia with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. My first question is regarding your guidance for net adds for the year. You had mentioned before, I think that it was 13 million. And just with this first quarter you have reached 42% of that guidance. I wanted to see if you wanted to give an updated guidance for net adds and also if this strong growth in subscribers could have an impact on CapEx. So I also wanted to see what would be your guidance for CapEx, or you're maintaining it. And lastly, if you could give us the percentage of revenues in Mexico that comes from data and also if that's actually the highest, the market that &#x2013; where data has been more successful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first, we haven't been changing &#x2013; we have a very strong quarter, this quarter, five, more than 5 million subscribers. But we haven't changed our guidance on the subscriber growth. We, we're going to review that, but at this moment, we are not having any change on the guidance on the subscriber.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx, we have been investing &#x2013; not this year, we have been investing for the last 5 years very strongly. So I don't think there's going to be any change on what we need to invest if we have 1 or 2 million more. We have been investing on capacity. We have very good coverage. We have 3G and we have been investing a lot on data.</p>
          <p>In the results, you could see that we have been rolling out our international transport network. We have 95% of that network already done. So we have been investing that for a lot, maybe the last years we have been investing very strongly on that. So I don't think we need any more CapEx if we grew 1 or 2 million more subscribers.</p>
          <p>And the third, the data in Mexico is, it's not the highest. We have been doing very good in Mexico, and in Mexico we have 24% of our revenues are data. I think those are the questions, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, the highest, I don't remember exactly, but the highest is Argentina.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Right now, I don't have it, the numbers here. If you want, you can ask Daniela, but Argentina is more than 30% and Mexico is 24.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Michael Morin from Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Good morning, everyone. Michael Morin from Barclays, I actually have 2 questions. First, regarding the international transport network, which you allude to in your press release, can you talk a little bit more about that, which countries you reach with that, what the real tangible benefits have been already in terms of costs? Because it seems like this is probably a very key driver of some of the cost reductions in a number of countries this quarter and I just wanted to make sure that's correct and if there might be more ahead in the upcoming quarters. And then the second question would be around Tracfone. Given how successful you've been with the MVNO business model &#x2013; there aren't too many success stories globally and I'm wondering do you have any ambition perhaps to take that business model to other countries globally? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the international transport network, it's a network that we have been doing fiber all around the country and then we connect all the countries. I think we have mainly connect our &#x2013; it's 18 countries. And what we're going to be able to do is to pass our voice and data traffic through all the countries and to the United States. That's mainly the reason, and that is going to be with much better quality than what we have today. And instead of buying and reselling these type of minutes, we're going to do it through our own network.</p>
          <p>It's, we are doing &#x2013; we have some cost savings in each country, because we don't have to buy and then sell the minutes. And the quality is going to be much better. We have the &#x2013; we're going to start to use that network. It's maybe 95% done. And I think at the end of the year, I think we should be using the network maybe completely in all the countries.</p>
          <p>So that's the reason of the network. It's more data and more voice minutes. And we're connecting all the countries where we're operating with that. The second is we have been very efficient doing the model on the MB announce in U.S. Tracfone. We don't have any plan at this moment to do it in other countries, but we have been very happy the way we &#x2013; the way Tracfone has been developing in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, thank you for that. If I can just follow up on your answer on the ITN, are you saying that in this particular quarter, in the first quarter that you have not really seen or realized any savings yet? And it's going to happen more towards the end of the year? Is there -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I, I think it's going to happen more at the end of the year, exactly. As we have impact in some traffic, but I think we're going to use the &#x2013; we're starting to use that network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and is there one country in particular, and specifically if I look at Brazil, where your margins expanded 500 basis points with only 4% service revenue growth, is it all lower subscriber acquisition costs? Or did the ITN really start to move the needle there for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's maybe acquisition costs and cost control that we have been doing there. So that's &#x2013; I think this network is going to be used more in the future because there's going to be lots more data traffic all around Latin America, and a lot more traffic, voice traffic. So I think this network is going to be used more and more through the years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you very much, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll take our next question from Andrew Campbell with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I was hoping that we could go back to that topic of the Brazil EBITDA margins and if you could just give us a little more color on why the margin was so strong there and if you believe that some of the changes there are sustainable, so that this could be a new margin level that we see going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the margin that we have on Brazil was 30%. I think it's sustainable. It's going to depend a lot on the growth that we &#x2013; still in Brazil we're looking more for growth than for EBIDTA, which I think growth is number one priority in Brazil if we want to have good customers, we're going to grow our revenues. But we're having a good cost control there, so that mainly what is happening.</p>
          <p>I think 30% through the year would be a very good target for us to have. But it's going to depend on two things, the growth that we have on subscribers, and the aggressiveness in the market that we're in. It depends also on how aggressive our competitors would be there. So it's something that I cannot tell you exactly what. Under these conditions I think we could get 30%, at least that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question will come from Vera Rossi with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is about Brazil as well. Brazil is one of the few countries that you didn't have the growth in post-paid higher than pre-paid. And you only have 7% of your net additions in post-paid. Do you have any churn issues or anything going on? Is it that the post-paid base in Brazil is growing slower than the other countries, or even less than the average in the market this quarter in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Vera. I think there are two things. First, we have some let's say, offers or promotions last year that we haven't been so successful because we have some disconnection. So still you are going to see for first quarter, we don't have a very good number of post-paid subscribers. But we're working on that.</p>
          <p>I think we're working a lot on the distribution network for post-paid and we're doing a lot of things. We are really interested in having better growth on Brazil on post-paid and we're working on that. It's true, we don't have a very good first quarter, but we know that. But we are fixing that and I think you're going to see better growth on the next months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a follow-up question. Do you think the quality of the services, or the customer service needs to improve in Brazil to get to a better position in post-paid?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean on the call centers? Or you mean on the quality of the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Both. The quality of the network and the call centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Brazil is very big. We need to do investments, the investments that we already have been planning to do. On the data, data is growing a lot, so the PCMC cards are growing so we have to do investments on data there. But I think we have good quality in Brazil. Of course we can improve the quality always. But I'm feeling comfortable and I think in the future with everything that we have on Telmex International would make a very big and good synergy with us in Brazil. So that's something that you are going to see through the next months, Vera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. Just two questions, first in Mexico, the incremental data growth, the new data that's coming in the quarter what's the mix between data cards and I guess data on a smartphone? And then the second is question your margins in Mexico I know were positively impacted by IFRS, but you're basically at like 70% margins or close to that. I would assume that the government can look at these type of financial results, and I guess the closest comparable is probably China Mobile that has 70, 80% market share also in subs and their margins are 50%. Are you concerned that having margins at that very high level could attract incremental regulation? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I don't understand exactly your question and the numbers that you give me. But I think we have a lot of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>EBITDA margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a lot of competition in Mexico so I hope regulators will look on the prices to the end customers, that we're really competitive on prices and they look also on the competition that we have a lot of competition. And I think in the future we're going to have more competition instead of looking if we are efficient and we do good our work or we don't do good our work. So I don't think regulators should look if have good margins or bad or low margins. I think regulators should look on if we have good prices to the end customer, that we have very good prices. We have around $0.05 of a dollar.</p>
          <p>You could see that the minutes of use that we have in Mexico are around 200 minutes of use. It's more than a lot of the companies in Europe let's say. We compared to the European companies. We have better most than the European companies and we've got a very good coverage. We have all new technology, all the 3G networks. So I hope regulators will look on these type of things instead of looking if we are an efficient company or we are not an efficient &#x2013; or we run the company in an efficient way or we don't run the company on an efficient way, no?</p>

          <p>I agree with &#x2013; Daniel, I agree with you 100% and I think you should get those returns, especially if you're giving your customers service. But I mean Calder&#xF3;n was, during the quarter, making press statements about new regulations and referencing jail time for companies that don't adhere to &#x2013; or are, I guess, convicted of monopolistic practices. It seems like the rhetoric is higher. And in the same quarter you're producing these very high margins. Obviously some of it is based on IFRS, but you don't think there's any incremental risk in 2010? I mean I know you don't think that you're doing badly, but do you think the risk is the same as it's always been for you guys?</p>

          <p>The data question is I don't have the mix between PCMC cards and the data in the phone. We have these 2 segments of data and we are really interested in both. So I don't have the mix. If you want, you can talk to Daniela.</p>
          <p>But the broadband, the PC cards, are new customers and you could see them as new customers. The data on top of our customers that we have, they are not as new customers. That you could see as new revenue, but they are not as new subscribers or new customers. So that's the way we account for the subscribers, no?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Yeah, I guess the point of the question, I guess, is just are you seeing a lot of those existing customers upgrade to those integrated phone, Blackberries or whatever? Or is a lot of the data growth that's occurring more about new PC cards than new customers?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Daniel and Carlos. I'm interested in going back to the &#x2013; you're going to be having these assets in Brazil which has a very good backbone. In the past you have been saying it's data &#x2013; the cost of data expansion has been a big for Claro in Brazil. Daniel, can you quantify how much could you gain in terms of integrating in Brazil with Claro just because of the backbone, backhaul and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's going to be very important. It's going to be very important for Embratel to have part of the network of Claro, and it's going to be very good for Claro to use the backbone and the backhaul from Embratel. Exactly on the amount of money that we're going to get, I don't have these numbers, but because this is going to be a very good investment for the future. It's going to give you a lot of capacity.</p>
          <p>When you mix everything, it's going to give you a lot of capacity on data and this is going to help you to grow on all the PC cards for data on the phone or anything that you do. I think, everybody knows that the data, let's say in Brazil, data is growing 45% year on year. So I think we could grow more. So we have to do the investments in the network to make the synergies with Embratel and that will allow us to increase our revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second is that in the income statement, we see that the income taxes were at a higher rate than were expected there, some 38%. Can we expect these rates to go back to usual levels, maybe close to 30% for the whole year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the statutory rate is around 29% is a good average, 29 to 30%. So that's the one that we should be trending towards. I think, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, there were some exceptional tax losses and tax credits that we were able to take advantage of at the beginning of last year. And that's why the comparison year on year is so different, to make a provisions for things that have been taken advantage of at a consolidated level, but where we needed to provision now at an individual level. And that's the kind of things that led to this big number, no? But you should, we should be moving towards something that is closer to that lower rate.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. I've got 2 questions, if I can. The first is trying to work out the margin expansion that you've seen this year or sort of year on year. How much of &#x2013; can you just tell us what is the rough margin that you make on mobile data when compared to sort of voice, just so that we can try and work out how that increase is helping? And my second question is a little bit technical. It's on Mexico. If I take your ARPU number and times it by the average number of subscribers, you get to an implied revenue number and then you have this sort of other revenue, which seems to have grown materially like 22% year on year. Can you talk to us about what's in that or what's not included within the ARPU number that could be driving that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; I don't really, I mean I read your piece, James and I didn't really understand it and I feel that I'm not being able to understand.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Or me.  But the fact of the matter is that the savings revenues are only comprised of what you have &#x2013; what you see in the ARPU. There's really no other revenues as you are mentioning here. So I don't know where the &#x2013; the location, but maybe as I suggested the last time we talked, maybe we want to, might want to talk it over with Daniela.</p>
          <p>Obviously you know that total revs are made up of service revenues plus equipment revenues.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And equipment revenues is a figure that we do not reveal on a per-country basis, but that we have on a consolidated basis.</p>

          <p>I don't have exactly the number again but I can tell you that data has less the margin than voice of course. I don't have exactly because at the end of the day, they're going to be in the same networks. Everything is going to be &#x2013; IT is going to be on the same networks, so it's going to be very difficult. Of course voice is much &#x2013; it's a higher margin than data, but I don't have exactly what's the difference on the margin, on the cost.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Have two questions if I may, first is maybe just an update on the auction situation in Mexico? You were talking about the competitive landscape and it is competitive, so the regulars I think would view that interestingly. And update just maybe on what the status of the auctions are, are they still looking like May, June timeframe to submit and finish? And then my second question is back to the United States, obviously very strong results with Tracfone, particularly Straight Talk. Our channel checks here in the United States, it looked like you were so successful they might have run out of phones somewhat during the quarter. Can you talk about the opportunity to continue to grow Straight Talk? Are there any supply problems? And any interest in taking ownership of a network or spectrum as you've become so successful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question about Mexico, I think my understanding is that it's going to be a May/June. They are going to auction 1.7, 2.1 at plus at spectrum, plus the 1.9 spectrum. And I think still they are &#x2013; the rules are not defined yet or maybe they are defined but they are not giving out the details. It looks like we're going to have more competition, but I think we are well prepared for the competition.</p>
          <p>On the U.S., we were very successful on Tracfone. We have a little bit of shortage of some equipment, but we are already in good shape. And we don't have any problem to still grow the Straight Talk, that it has been very successful in the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>No. No, I think the way we're doing business in U.S. has been very profitable for us. We have been growing. We have been doing very good on pre-paid. We are &#x2013; we could say that we are like experts on the pre-paid because we have 18 &#x2013; 17 countries in Latin America running pre-paid platforms and we're going to do, and still do, exactly what we are doing at this moment, no?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Two quick questions for you, first, just to follow up on the U.S., just was wondering if you could talk a little bit about margins. They were obviously down a little bit year over year. I would assume that most of that is certainly related to Straight Talk. At what point do you feel that you will have enough scale there to really begin to drive EBITDA margins forward a little bit? And then secondly just real quickly, was wondering if you were willing to provide any guidance related to potential synergies related to the Telmex and Telmex International transactions? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in the U.S., the program, Straight Talk program for us, it's a &#x2013; it's going to be profitable. This program is profitable. The, you're seeing that the details is being a little bit lower than last year because of the amount of subscribers that we are getting. Straight Talk is a higher ARPU then we have to have a better handset, then we have to have a little bit more on subsidies there. But this program as a stand-alone program, is going to be successful. We already have a big base of subscribers so we should be profitable this year, unless the growth of Straight Talk should be higher than what we expect. So that's really what we're looking and that's really where we're deciding what to do.</p>
          <p>Your other question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ah, the synergies with Telmex and Telmex International. I think we have been making our job. We have been looking for a lot of synergies. We don't have exactly the number of the savings, but mainly the synergies with Telmex and Telmex International are going to be on CapEx, on the way we're going to invest on the networks in the future. We are not going to take out people. I think on purchasing we could have a lot of synergies. We could have a lot of synergies in content. We have a lot of synergies. But the main, main, main synergy is going to be on the CapEx, on the investments on the networks in the next years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, two questions. First, can you please outline your priorities as you see them with your strong cash flow generation? And then second question is do you expect to be in the capital markets, specifically the debt capital markets, in 2010? And more specifically, do you have any plans for further dollar-denominated issuance for the remainder of 2010? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the priorities today, as has always been the case, is we have to look at the immediate potential commitments. Right now, I think the first potential commitment that we have to pay is the tender offer for the Telmex International stock. To the extent that a portion of that may be tendered for cash, I think that we need to have the cash at hand. I think on that, it's basically seeing to it that the company and probably the new integrated company once we complete the acquisitions have a smooth optimization profile. We like to have a comparable maturity profile of our debt. And so that's I think, an important thing. Other than that, whatever spare cash that we have is typically, it's paid out to all shareholders to the extent that it's not used for acquisitions. But that hasn't changed at all.</p>
          <p>I'd say that we don't really have any plans to go back to the U.S. market at this stage. But we are always opportunistic and if we see an opportunity sometimes we act on it. But at this stage, we do not really have any plans of going back to the U.S. market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for the question. I noticed that your equipment revenues jumped 15% year over year during the quarter, whereas your equipment costs jumped only 3%. And my question is is this related only to a result of better FX, or a result of the customer mix of your net adds or if it's more a deliberate decision to reduce your subsidies? And my second question is if you expect voice prices in Brazil and Colombia to keep declining at the pace we saw during the quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the first question is on the subsidies. I think we have been careful. The FX exchange rate helped us a little bit this quarter. But the mix is not helping. The mix is in the other side. It's opposite, because we're doing post-paid customers and post-paid customers requires more subsidy. And in your third option that you said, that it's on taking care about the subsidies, we're doing that. So the FX exchange rate helped us and we're taking care on the subsidies.</p>
          <p>And in Brazil and Colombia, well it's going to depend on the competition. I think we have very good prices all around Latin America and good models, good prices and let's see. Depends a lot on the competition, but we could be ready to be as aggressive as the market requires us, no?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>No. No, it's take us a little bit more of time to prepare everything. I'm sure, I think mostly of the documentation and everything is done. The approvals are mainly done. So I hope that in May we can launch the offer.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good morning. My question is regarding the post-paid growth in Mexico. And obviously it's very strong and I'm wondering whether these are customers who are your pre-paid client, pre-paid customers that you're converting to post-paid? Or are these your customers that you're coming and taking on board brand new or getting from other operators? And my second question was regarding the price elasticity in Brazil. It looks like it's not &#x2013; you're not really getting much of an elasticity as you knock down your towers. And I'm wondering whether you think that this is end-of-the-year price decreases? Or do you think there's a further decrease in tariffs to come in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Mexico, Rizwan, we are growing our market share in post-paid. Of course we have some of these post-paid customers &#x2013; pre-paid customers moving to the post-paid platform because it would be a better plan savings for them. But that would be only a part of what we're doing. We're doing others in PCMC cards in data and broadband and other ones they are new customers. So we have been successful on the number portability in post-paid, so we are growing also in number for stability in post-paid, so there is a mix of everything, and I think the strategy that we are doing in Mexico is working.</p>
          <p>In Brazil of the &#x2013; we haven't had a lot of elasticity maybe. We have a lot of promotions. Maybe it's because also the economy, was the slow down of the economy. I hope that this year as the economy gets better, we can have a recovery on all these promotions that we have been doing, no? I &#x2013; we don't want to reduce and to do more promotions from Brazil at this moment, but we need to do what the market needs to have, so that's where we are. Our main target in Brazil is growth. So we are being, going to be aggressive as the market needs to be there, no?</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question, Daniel, if I may. Regards to the synergies you talked about, yeah, I mean you're, in the end I don't care whether has been four months or three months, but do you think should we expect some number from you in future even if it's second half of the year? And lastly, will any of that synergy come from tax impacts of consolidation?</p>

But at this moment, we don't have a specific number to give to the investors now.</p>

          <p>We will take our next question from Henry Cobbe with Nevsky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks very much for the call. Just a question on the upcoming spectrum auctions, is there kind of reserve price that we could pencil in for that of how much it'll be going for? And secondly on your debt side, how much of your foreign currency debt is hedged back to pesos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the debt side, I think today substantially all of the debt, net debt is hedged. We never hedged it 100%, because as you recall we have some operations that are dollar-based. So we will always have a portion of our debt that is also dollar-based. But we retain the exposure. But other than that I think today, given the level of exchange rate we have considered to be better to have less than full exposure to pesos in most of our debt. And as regards the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the auction that we're going to have we don't have an amount of money that we think it's going to be. Remember that it's going to be like an auction for the frequencies. But then you have to pay like an annual fee for each of 10 megahertz. So that runs in 2 parts, okay? What you pay in what the auction that you have, but in the other side is what you pay every year. So that's mainly the way the auction is going to run.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And next, just on the depreciation, from the restatements that you put through in the first quarter in '09, it looks like depreciation policy may have &#x2013; may be slightly different under IFRS. Could you just give us what the annualized number might be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think most of the impact that we have on depreciation really has to do with a change in the acceleration in the depreciation of network equipment in Brazil that we began last year. I think this was shown in the last quarter's figures. There is, as you point out, some elements of changes where you have to set the new values for your plant and then keep on depreciating it from there. But what I can tell you that it is not all that meaningful, no? The impact of the move to IFRS is really not that meaningful in terms of its impact on the financial statement?</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, we have time for one more question. One more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will take our last question from James Ratzer with New Street Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, guys. I have two questions please. The first one was about the revenue growth in Brazil. You mentioned earlier in the call that focus on growth was a top priority and I was wondering if you could give us a target of what you thought growth might be able to reaccelerate to. And if you do achieve that, is that going to come at the expense of EBITDA margin, so EBITDA margin could potentially weaken in the second half of the year? And the second question I have was in Mexico. I think this was the first quarter in quite a long time when your price per minute has been falling less than 10% per annum. And I was wondering is this now a change in strategy for you in Mexico, where you're trying to step back from price decreases and we could see a more stable environment in Mexico on pricing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think on Mexico we don't have like a strategy on pricing. I think in Mexico, it depends a lot on the competition. I think Mexico's pricing is running at very efficient. We're doing almost $0.05 of a dollar in Mexico so I think &#x2013; I don't think we could sustain the decrease on prices that we have been having. But we have 9.5% decrease year on year on price, so it's a very good decrease on price. And even if you have that good price in the market that is around $0.05 of a dollar, so it's an excellent price.</p>
          <p>And what I can tell you in Brazil and in Mexico that we have enough capacity to do what the market condition would ask of us. If we need to decrease more the price, it's going to mean more minutes, and then we're going to do it. We have the capacity to do less price in Mexico and less price in Brazil. So everything is going to depend on how aggressive is going to be our competitor, and how aggressive we need to be to do what the strategy we want to have in each country, no? So that's mainly the way we operate, no? But what I'm trying to say is we're ready to decrease the price as much as the market asks us to do it. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It sounds like you're seeing slightly less maybe competitive pressure at the moment than you have done in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. The reason is that the prices has been &#x2013; the level of the prices right now are really competitive, no? So I don't think when you are in $0.10 you can decrease the price as when you are in $0.05 of a dollar. So that's a difference, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then with regard to the revenue growth in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Another thing important is also when the economy is going down, it's less &#x2013; it's a little bit more difficult to reduce prices, no? For us and for everybody, no? So depends a lot also on the economic conditions as the &#x2013; that you have in each country. Maybe as the economy recovers then we can have more competition and then we can have lower prices on everything there, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's clear on Mexico, thank you. And then just sort of a question on the Brazil growth and potential impact on margins please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if we do &#x2013; our target is to have $0.34 EBITDA margin and we're going to try to do that. Wall Street market conditions are different than what we expect, then maybe we can reduce a little bit more. But what we target is to have around $0.34 EBITDA margin in Brazil for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think revenue growth can inflect and go back above 4% or maybe even towards kind of mid, high single digits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so, but we don't know, no?</p>
