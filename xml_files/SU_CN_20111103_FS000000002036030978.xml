          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Suncor Third Quarter Conference Call and Webcast. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Douglas, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Douglas, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you, Thomas. And thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I have with me here in the room in Calgary our President and CEO Rick George, our Chief Operating Officer Steve Williams, our Chief Financial Officer Bart Demosky, our Controller Jolienne Guillemaud, our Assistant Controller Greg Freidin.</p>
          <p>Just before beginning I do need to give you a legal advisory. Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions described in our third quarter earnings release and MD&amp;A, as well as our current AIF, which is available on SEDAR and EDGAR and our Web site. Certain financial measures referred to in these comments are not proscribed by Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and for a description of these financial measures please see our second quarter MD&amp;A.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll hand over to Rick George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, thank you. Thank you very much.</p>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Delighted to be here with you this morning; and obviously very delighted with our third quarter results. Bart and Steve will get into the details a bit later, but you know the headlines are obviously very positive and a real indication of where our company is and a lot of indication, I think, about where it's going.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the quarter, we had record oil sands production of over 325,000 barrels a day, record operating earnings of almost $1.8 billion and a record cash flow of over $2.7 billion. So obviously, our base operations are performing very well. We came out of, if you'll remember that significant turnaround quarter &#x2013; second quarter, and have produced very reliably through the third quarter. We also managed to get to the bottom of our hydrotreating issues and have been experiencing &#x2013; that we experienced in the first quarter and a little bit in the second quarter, and started to maximize our higher value sweet production towards the end of the third.</p>
          <p>We recently set a record production for in situ and I'll let Steve give you the good news about that, which is terrific, continued also with outstanding performance in downstream with 97% utilization rates, and over $2 billion of cash flow from operations generated year-to-date. We also had great strong contributions from our exploration production group, which also passed the $2 billion year-to-date cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our growth projects are moving ahead in great, great shape. Firebag 3 is ramping up. Firebag 4 is on schedule for initial production in the first quarter of 2013. The Northsteep Bank Extension and the Millennium Naphtha Unit are nearing completion and will provide us with increased flexibility and can support continuous improvement on reliability. A lot of that will start showing up in the first quarter of 2012.</p>
          <p>We're still over a year away from sanctioning our new mines, that is Fort Hills and Joslyn and the Upgrader. But we're encouraged by the way the planning work is progressing and the synergies we're seeing in our joint venture &#x2013; joint venture with Total. We really feel like we've de-risked the growth plans, spread it out over a manageable timeframe, and clearly we're generating the cash flow to largely fund that program internally.</p>
          <p>And most importantly, and I think a lot of people don't think of us this way, we're focused on investing this capital efficiency to get the highest return for our shareholders. Obviously, if we cannot accomplish that because of changed in conditions, we won't spend the capital.</p>
          <p>Now, turning away from oil sands for a moment, I know investors are going to be asking questions or interested in developments in the Middle East and North Africa and how they may affect us. It's important to remember that this is actually a relatively small part of our portfolio, and we're continuing to take a cautious approach. The safety of our people, employees on the ground, it is, obviously, always our first consideration. Through this period we've maintained safe production and profitability in Syria while complying with all sanctions.</p>
          <p>In Libya, we've been encouraged by recent developments obviously. We're working hard with our joint venture partner Harouge as we work to establish reliable production again. We're not in the position, today, to give you any numbers or any assumed kind of levels of production in 2012. But just know that there's certainly more upside than downside from here and we're working hard with our partners to move those things forward.</p>
          <p>Stepping back &#x2013; I just want to take a second and go back to strategy. It's always something I love to talk about. And I know people have been very concerned about how volatile the crude oil prices are, what's going on in Europe, other conditions. But, you know, I think this quarter really highlights what we've been talking about for a year or two &#x2013; or really since the merger &#x2013; the strength of this integrated strategy right across all of the business cycles that we see coming down the road. Suncor's strategy again is an integrated oil sands growth strategy. It's a flexible operating model, allows us to optimize oil sands per barrel -- margin and to maximize cash.</p>
          <p>Low cost offshore production and integrated downstream generate significant free cash flow for investment in future growth. And that growth, in our opinion, is lower risk. We have the resource. We've obviously got the experience and the knowledge. We've got very strong partners on the projects we have partners on and obviously have the balance sheet to execute on that.</p>
          <p>So the 2011 year-to-date cash flow from operations is higher than any full year in the company history. So we made more money in the first nine months than we have in any prior 12-month period. I would also say &#x2013; and maybe this kind of comes out of our competitive spirit &#x2013; Suncor generated almost the same amount of cash that the next two largest companies in Canada generated. So virtually equal to the next two in terms of cash flow from operations.</p>
          <p>We've also, and this a very important thing to note, our return capital has risen to 13.4% as we come out of the merger and the re-rating of some of our assets and I'll guarantee you, we are going to continue to focus on achieving strong return on capital for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>To sum up, listen, we're on track for the best year ever at Suncor. But we also know we can't get ahead of ourselves. We remain very focused on the five key priorities I've been talking about: operational excellence across the entire business; the improving performance of our Firebag in situ projects, and you're going to see that; Steve will talk to that; reducing and managing our cash costs at oil sands and in situ; the effective project execution on our projects, particularly near term, that's Firebag 3 and 4; and, obviously, the implementation of our Total joint venture and growth plan. All-in-all, very exciting period for Suncor.</p>
          <p>Steve, I'm going to turn it over to you to take over.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rick.</p>
          <p>And I'm pleased to pick up on the back of Rick's report there and say the continued focus we've had on operational excellence is clearly starting to pay off now. And of course, I'll remind us the foundation of operational excellence is safety, and we continue to make progress on that journey to zero injuries. In 2011 year-to-date across all the Suncor operations, we have reduced the recordable injuries by 17% and our lost-time injuries by 45%, and the number of high-risk incidents by 74%.</p>
          <p>Of course, the second pillar is environmental due diligence, and it's another foundational element of operational excellence. And our results in that area have also been very positive. Year-to-date in 2011, we've managed to reduce both our incidents of regulatory non-compliance and loss of containment by over 30%. So it's those steadily improving safety and environmental results that have laid the groundwork for the strong operational performance across the business that we've seen.</p>
          <p>As Rick said, we came out with a very successful turnaround on Unit 2 to generate record production at oil sands in Q3, and that's continued into October. In August, we resolved our hydro treating issues at the oil sands base plant. So that's allowed us to improve our sweet/sour mix in September, and it's setting us up very nicely for improved production into the fourth quarter and then into 2012. We set oil sands production records while safely completing the in situ turnaround and some significant annual coker maintenance and upgrading.</p>
          <p>In in situ, with plant maintenance completed at MacKay River and Firebag, and initial production from the infill wells starting from Firebag, we've recently topped the 100,000 barrels a day in situ production for the first time. And for exiting of 2011, we're now targeting total in situ production of 110,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>In the downstream, our refining marketing group had another great quarter as the refineries were able to run at a 97% utilization rate. So they took full advantage of the record-breaking crack spreads we've been seeing. The E&amp;P operations produced reliably with the exception of Buzzard, where we believe our joint venture partner has now resolved the operational issues and expects to produce at full rates for the remainder of the year. Of note, we're in the midst of a four week turnaround to Terra Nova and so far that's progressing to plans.</p>
          <p>Cost management remains a top priority and we continue to target oil sands cash costs in the mid $30 a barrel range. Quarter 3 came in at $36.60 a barrel as we experienced upward pressure in a number of areas: increased Firebag operations costs, because we're in the midst of start for Firebag 3, so we have very limited production at this stage before plant is coming on; higher mining costs as we begin to work through a leaner ore grade in the Millennium Mine and we'll be managing that carefully through the next twelve months. And of course, the increased maintenance to successfully resolve the hydro treating challenges we've had earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>So effectively managing the costs of both our base business and our growth programs is a huge priority for us, and we're making progress. And I'll give you a few specific examples. The North Steepbank expansion is coming on line in Quarter 1 of 2012. It gives us access to $600 million barrels of reserves. We'll produce 125,000 barrels a day of bitumen and the project development costs of $500 million equates to about $4,000 per flowing barrel. So they're the sorts of costs you can have when you're debottlenecking existing facilities.</p>
          <p>I'm also excited about our learnings in in situ and the promise of new technologies to lower costs and increase production and, for example, the initial production from our infill wells at Firebag is proving very promising to us. So we are maintaining a relentless focus on cost management and keeping a downward pressure on inflation.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we're well positioned for a strong finish to the year and continued success in 2012. The ramp up of Firebag 3, bringing on that North Steepbank expansion and starting up the Millennium Naptha Unit which is getting close to completion. We'll continue the focus on safe reliable operations and that gets us to this relentless downward pressure we're putting on costs in our business. And we'll leverage our flexible portfolio in oil sands to make sure we optimize the margin rather than simply maximizing production.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand over to Bart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Rick already highlighted, just an outstanding financial quarter for the company with record operating earnings of $1.8 billion and cash from ops of $2.7 billion. I think something to emphasize is that this really, I think, does highlight the profitability and the power of Suncor's integrated model, which I think is the essence of this quarter's results.</p>
          <p>And let me give you a few examples of what I'm talking about from a margin perspective. If we look at the upgrading part of the business with bitumen prices having fallen into the mid-40s range late in the quarter, we're now seeing upgrading premiums approaching $50 per barrel for our oil sands upgrading business.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our inland refineries, which ran full out for the quarter, were able to capture crack margins that averaged over $30 per barrel in the quarter. Those are our inland refineries. And not to be outdone, our E&amp;P operations, which leveraged their low operating costs at a great oil price that was over $110 for the quarter, they were able to generate average cash margins. And these are after tax and after sustaining CapEx of over $40 per barrel. We also get the benefit of a very strong midstream and renewables business. And those assets and expertise help us to maximize the netbacks on our crude production. Earnings there have picked up in our corporate segment, and for the quarter they were $65 million and year-to-date $171 million. So that part of our business is a very strong contributor as well.</p>
          <p>So as we move forward from here, we believe our integrated portfolio approach to optimizing the oil sands' barrels are really going to continue to produce superior results for the company. And those results are producing a lot of cash. And our balance sheet is in terrific shape. Net debt today is at $7.7 billion. We've got a debt-to-cash flow number now that's down to 0.8 versus a target for us of 1 to 2 times. And we have cash on the balance sheet now of &#x2013; in excess of $3.3 billion. So I think the message I'd leave you with there is this company has lots of capacity and dry powder to execute on its strategy, accommodate any kind of market volatility, and for other strategic uses as well.</p>
          <p>Which obviously begs the question, then, what do we plan to do with that cash? And the first thing I'd say is it's a nice problem to have. But we do plan to stay the course and maintain our priorities. First of which is to fund the base business. And clearly we're doing that and we're focused on relentless management of our cash operating costs. Second is to fund our strategic growth plan. And at current oil prices, and in fact quite a bit below current oil prices, we are able to meet capital requirements from internally generated cash flow; continue to manage the balance sheet conservatively and we look to maintain our conservative debt ratios and ample cash on hand; and then subject to Board approval, return more cash to shareholders as well. Our plan to date has been to do that through dividend increases in line with production growth and those of regular increases, but also opportunistic share buybacks as well. And our current share buyback in the market is an example of how we plan to manage some of this excess cash and use it to drive shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>The strategy behind the current program is really to soak up dilution since the merger. It's a $500 million buyback and we feel it was well timed to take advantage of what we believe is a very undervalued share price for Suncor. We've purchased in excess of $180 million to date since the start of the program early in September, and we're now well over a third of the way through the program, only two months in. And we do plan to continue purchasing as we believe today the shares still remain very much undervalued.</p>
          <p>Our capital spending program is right on track and being fully funded from internal cash flows, $6.7 billion is the budget for the year and we're right on track with that. And for next year, in 2012, we see a range of around $7.5 billion. That's subject to Board approval, of course, which we will be meeting with the Board next week.</p>
          <p>Now, some of you may have expected a higher capital number, but one of the things that we're working very hard on is to both spend capital efficiently and to spend only within our means. And those are objectives that we believe are reflected in next year's budget number and will be reflected in the budget numbers in years beyond. So our focus is going to remain strongly on costs and quality. And we won't spend the capital, and as Rick said as well, unless we can achieve a strong return for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that, in summary, we are very well positioned to meet or exceed all of our targets for 2011. There's no material changes to the guidance issued today. We do plan to issue 2012 guidance next week following a review at our Board of Directors meeting. And again, our expectation is that capital will be in the $7.5 billion range, as I've already mentioned; we should expect to see production increasing somewhat as Firebag 3 ramps up; and we continue to see the benefits of operational excellence in our oil sands based business, and as well as cash costs coming down modestly as we do not have any oil sands turnaround activity in 2012, or major activity. But we will be carrying, of course, the full burden of Firebag 3 costs as those ramp up.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it back to Steve, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bart, and thank you, Rick and Steve also.</p>
          <p>Just before we go to Q&amp;A here, I should reference that the updated 2011 guidance that Bart mentioned is now available on the website. 2012 guidance will be available next week. And I want to provide you with a couple of numbers that are unusual items. The LIFO/FIFO impact was a negative impact of $82 million in the quarter. That's an after tax number; and year-to-date that puts it at $166 million positive. A couple of others; stock based compensation was after tax in the quarter, an increase of $186 million, which puts it at $41 million positive year-to-date. And finally, we had a negative after-tax impact of exchange rate on U.S. denominated debt of $533 million in the quarter for a year-to-date of $317 million.</p>
          <p>I should note that as we go to Q&amp;A here now I'd ask you to keep the questions that are detailed modeling type questions, if you'd hold those, and the IR group and the Controllers group will be available throughout the day for those types of questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll ask the operator to open up the line to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Joe Citarrella from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the 2012 budget comments, if you're able, any rough split, I guess first there, between maintenance and growth capital? And second, can you update us on the capital cost environment more broadly speaking? What, if anything, are you seeing today or building in next year in terms of inflation? And can you give us some color on your cost containment efforts for your growth projects specifically? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Joe. It's Bart here. I'll answer the first part, and then I'll turn it over to Steve. So the $7.5 billion that we mentioned, it's broadly balanced between &#x2013; sorry. I'll turn it over to Rick. Broadly balanced between growth and then sustaining CapEx for the organization. So I'll turn it over to Rick for the strategic part.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so on the second part of that question around inflation, generally, I mean, we really think about it in two buckets. One is on the operating side and &#x2013; and what I would say about that is our goal here is to eat our inflationary costs we're seeing on the operating side. And now you may not see that quarter-to-quarter, but that's generally the trend that we hope to accomplish here over the next several years.</p>
          <p>On the capital side, we have not really seen the kind of inflation I know the market is worried about. And what I can't do is promise you it's not going to come; I wouldn't do that. But I would just say here in 2011 we haven't seen that kind of massive increase. If I said it was out there, it's 3%, 4%, 5%, it's not double-digit numbers. We don't actually see a big push in 2012, certainly through the early part of the year. And beyond that, I can't actually give you a forecast other than to know that we, as well as a lot of the other operators, are working hard to make sure we don't go into that period, back into that high inflationary period we had in '05 to '08.</p>
          <p>And again, back to what all three of us here have been talking about is these projects we're going to do are going to be focused on quality and cost, not on schedule, and we're going to watch this thing extremely carefully. And I think Steve, Bart and myself have all said it in different ways, but it's all the same intent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on that, if you're not schedule-focused, is there anything in terms of &#x2013; I think you were speaking to previously $8 billion to $9.5 billion per annum roughly in CapEx, is there anything that is getting pushed back in 2012 or is the growth plan as it stands now broadly on schedule on the track and the CapEx is merely lower for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you know what, what I would say is I that's gotten misinterpreted over time here. If anything, we see these projects probably pushing out. I'm not thinking here of Fort Hills, Joslyn and the Upgrade. We have nothing to announce. Again, we're going through this very methodically, where we're again, we do not make schedule the primary issue. And so what I would say, if anything, you'll probably see these capital costs flatten out, not increase from where we are or the expectation.</p>
          <p>But we still have a lot of work to do, okay. And until we sanction these projects, which is still a year away, we won't be able to actually give you that number. Just know it's a big focus of ours. We do not want to peak on manpower, on sites and construction projects. We're very well aware that we can create our own firestorm here, and so these things are going to be very carefully managed as we go through the next two or three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And quickly following-up on the comments on uses of cash. Should we think about an upsized repurchase program as a potential use of cash beyond funding CapEx and the dividend in the event that oil prices remain high and you're generating free cash flow or do you see potential for any other uses? Just trying to think about prioritization beyond CapEx and dividend and the current repurchase program</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Joe, it's Bart here again. So a couple things; first to go back to your earlier question on the capital budget for next year. I think the 8% to 9.5% that you were referring to was a comment we might have made last quarter, a couple quarters ago. That was really for the 2013 and forward period. 2012, we had always intended to have a lower capital number because the projects are really starting to ramp up after next year. The big focus next year is Firebag 3, of course, and getting that project completed. So the 7.5% is consistent with what our plans have been.</p>
          <p>On the use of cash, I wouldn't see a big ramp up right now. I mean, we're focused on executing on the buy-back that we have in place, and then, of course, as I'd outlined in my priorities though for uses of cash, once we've accomplished those first few things, we'll look at dividend increases and buybacks. But they'll be strategically positioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate the clarifications. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Potter from CIBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just looking for a little bit more color on the infill wells at Firebag. I don't know if that you can talk to any rates just yet. And maybe a little bit more color in terms of plants, how many wells in 2012, and what is the &#x2013; how many wells or how many infill wells could you drill on the Firebag 1 and 2 sites?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you a little bit of color, Andrew. But I will limit the detail I go into for this call. So we have the opportunity to drill in excess of 15 wells. The first four or five are in their very early stages of going into operation. They're producing very well versus our expectations. I don't want to talk about specific numbers at this stage and, of course, numbers for Firebag going forward will be quite difficult to segregate because we integrate the parts of the plant now. Just to say, when we add all of those effects up, infill wells, Firebag Stage 3 coming on, it's exceeding our expectations as we go into this first stage of the start-up.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Then just one related question. Have you talked at all about any plans to look at solvents or test solvents on Firebag?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have a comprehensive technology program in place. We're working on approximately 10 projects and a number of those are solvent projects and we will talk to those in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from George Toriola from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and this question is for Rick. It pertains to the Keystone pipeline. So there's reports that to the extent that that pipeline has to be rerouted, scheduled impacts there. So just wondering how you're thinking about your growth projects and the possibility that Keystone is delayed and how you would be addressing this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, George. I actually knew that question was likely to come up. What I would say is, listen, Keystone XL is a TransCanada pipeline project, so you really should talk to them. Obviously, we're very supportive of the project that they're going through, and for the purposes of both North American energy security supply and jobs, so we're hopeful that the politicians make the right decision here.</p>
          <p>You know what, there's lots of kind of plan Bs, and I don't want to go through them in great detail, but its reverse of Line 9, ultimately Gateway. But there's also a reversal of lines between Cushing and the Gulf Coast that are available and a number of other options. So you know what, this industry is very inventive. If you see a differential large enough, we'll get the crude moved around one way or the other. So I don't want to go into great lengths about all that plan B, but there is and there will be a plan B in case this does not go forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. And then just a quick question on the &#x2013; I wonder if you can quantify the impact of the hydrotreater that you'll be putting in service here. What would be the impact of that to 2012 and beyond cash flows and production mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll talk to it just in operational terms, not specifically in cash terms because it's heavily dependent on what the margins are at the business, so what the differentials are between sweet and sour products. We've designed operational flexibility deliberately into the plant, and that's the reason that we're bringing the hydrogen plant on in the fourth quarter this year rather than next year with the hydrotreater itself.</p>
          <p>So we'll take the hydrogen. We'll put it into a common header, and then we can take that hydrogen and put it to Unit 1 hydrotreaters, Unit 2 hydrotreaters or into the MNU hydrotreaters. So it gives us a great deal of flexibility to start to take full advantage of the margins in the prevailing market conditions. But we don't plan to talk about specific numbers for that unit.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Greg Pardy from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Maybe just as a follow up to George's question, synthetic sour production has been a bigger proportion of the mix this year, but once that third hydrotreater is on, what would you expect as a run rate in terms of the synthetic sweet versus sour mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I would say, if you could hold on to that, Greg. Next week we're actually going to give specific guidance including the Millennium Naptha unit online, so we'll give you some clear indications following the board meeting next week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly the percentage of sweet is going up. I mean, that you can take &#x2013; we will definitely get to that next week.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No problem. So when is the budget coming out then? Can you -</p>

          <p>After close of business on November 8.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On November 8. Okay, thanks very much. Maybe just a couple of other questions; you talked about the CapEx. How should we be thinking about base oil sands and operating costs for next year, or is it just too early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me, I mean, we've said we're targeting broadly in the mid 30s as the long term run rate. And Rick mentioned that that includes attempting to eat inflation certainly for the next few years. Next year, there are going to be some impacts, and I did talk about one of them, and we'll clarify the size of those next week.</p>
          <p>And that is, we are going through it. We've got two things going on in Oil Sands next week which will put upward pressure on that 35. One is we're going through a lean part or a region in the Millennium Mine where the concentration of bitumen to the volume of Oil Sands we have to move slightly decreases so we'll be going through that lean patch for about 12 months.</p>
          <p>And, of course, we've got the Firebag start up where we get into the most important part of the Firebag 3 start up and Firebag 4 starts to come on. So those two things will put some upward pressure on the 35 and we'll give guidance next week. But broadly speaking, in the long run we are targeting $35.00 or there abouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just the last question for Rick perhaps is, is your interest in Syncrude still core? You knew I was going to ask that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Greg, you always ask that. It's a good question. So, yeah, listen first of all we're proud of those assets. We do see some synergy value in terms of exchange of ideas, of technologies and a whole bunch of things. We have real faith that Exxon is going to do a much better job of operating this down the road and so our current position is those assets are not for sale. Now that does not mean that that will hold forever, but it's 8% of our production or something like that. It's an important piece. Right now there are no plans to sell.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our next question is from Brian Dutton from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I just wanted to get a little more clarity on the downstream business. In particular, the Rack Forward business has been very strong, very consistent over the past 12 to 18 months. And I was wondering if we should be anticipating those kinds of earnings to be generated on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll pick that up, Brian. It's Steve Douglas here. We don't break those out to the Nth degree, if you like, but I think what we do talk about an awful lot is, obviously, with the inland refining network we're enjoying very, very strong profitability because of lower crude cost inputs and global finished product pricing.</p>
          <p>And part of that is certainly a transfer, if you like, of profitability from the upstream to the downstream. And so, if at some point in the future as we fully expect, WTI and Brent come back together we see some of that margin and profitability accruing back to the upstream. In terms of the Rack Forward, you're correct. It has been very steady and that's been a phenomenon, if you like, of the last couple of years here where we stopped seeing the cycling of pricing that was so prevalent in the earlier 2000's. And you're correct; there has been steady profitability. Never predict the future though, but certainly it has been a steady source of income the last couple of years here.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only comment I would add, Brian, is following the merger we did, as you know, restructure the retail network and that restructuring has proved to be very positive. So we've seen volumes hold up very well both on gasoline and on the other sales through the service stations.</p>
