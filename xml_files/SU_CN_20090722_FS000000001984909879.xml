          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Suncor Energy, Inc. Second Quarter Results conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with instructions provided. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like to remind everyone that this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, July 22, 2009 at 9:30 AM Eastern Time, and I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Rogers, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for listening in to our second quarter conference call. I guess this is our last conference call as a standalone company. We have with us today Rick George, our President and CEO; Ken Alley, our CFO; Maureen Cormier, our Vice President, Controller; and Tim Maw, he works in the Controllers department with Maureen.</p>
          <p>We're going to follow the usual format. Rick is going to give you a bit of an overview in his thinking around the quarter and the &#x2013; how the year is going. Ken will give us a bit of an update on the financial situation. I'll give you a bit of an update on outlook, and then we'll open it up for questions. So Rick, why don't you kick it off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>John, thank you very much and welcome, everyone. I'm delighted to be on the call this morning and the second quarter here was really, for us, a period of repositioning ourselves the best we can in terms of this merger with Petro-Canada and I have to say I couldn't be happier with where we are and still very confident about the merger itself and where this Company is going.</p>
          <p>So if you take a look from a Suncor viewpoint, here in the second quarter we did receive the Competition Bureau approval yesterday. You will have noticed that in the papers. We have a continued drive to operational excellence that's showing great results. Our financial capacity is stable after one of the worst downturns as we went through the fourth quarter and the first quarter of this year in terms of commodity prices. And I think we're well positioned in terms of the planning of the integration of the two companies.</p>
          <p>So each of those is kind of a major accomplishment for our company, but to kind of be working on all fronts is something we're quite proud of. Now obviously, we wish we would have made more money in the second quarter, but and Ken will talk to that, but what I would say is if you think about us positioning ourselves for the future, we feel very good about that.</p>
          <p>So just to take those four things kind of in order, first of all, we did receive the go ahead from the Competition Bureau. It means we will close on the first of August or one minute past midnight on the 31st of July. And under that agreement we are obligated to divest of some 104 retail sites in Southern Ontario; that's the combination of both Sunoco sites and Petro-Canada sites. We will sell approximately one billion liters annually of terminal storage and distribution capacity for a ten year period through a couple of the terminals located in the greater Toronto area. And that was the summation, a very brief summation.</p>
          <p>There's lots of details behind it of what the Competition Bureau decision came out to be. My view of that, it was a very fair result achieved in a timely manner. I've got to give credit to the Competition Bureau. They were very thorough on their process and very professional; worked very hard to get us to this point. And the thing about big mergers in our industry, we announced this in March, got shareholder approval in June and then closed in July. That's as quick as I promise you any of us could have expected it to happen. And I've got to give a lot of credit to the team at both Petro-Canada and Suncor who made that happen. It didn't just happen on its own. And so, very delighted with where we are in terms of that whole agreement.</p>
          <p>On the operational side, again, we're making great strides under the leadership of Steve Williams. We have been working on this operational excellence program of ours for some time. And we're seeing increased reliability, increased volumes, and are starting to see lower costs across our entire operation.</p>
          <p>Our Oil Sands business produced just around 290,000 barrels a day for the first six months. The costs are coming down, although maybe not as quickly as we would always hope. You always want to see them down as quick as you can. The price on a per barrel basis was $32.50 for the first six months. The second quarter was 31.30, and we actually even had one month, June, where we had our operating costs below $30, just below, a couple of cents below, but it does show you that we are making progress.</p>
          <p>On the costs side, what you are seeing is first of all, we are seeing productivity come up, particularly on some of our construction projects. Our material costs are going down. Obviously energy prices are down so our energy input prices are down. If there's one that's very sticky it is on the wage side of our business, and that's been a little bit more sticky, as we've talked about in prior calls.</p>
          <p>Firebag also making great progress. Again, it's a technology I've always had a lot of faith in, but it's one that is coming along very regularly. They produced just around 49,000 barrels a day in the second quarter but probably more importantly, currently kind of running in the mid 50s. So you're starting see that ramp up happen and a much steadier operation. Their costs were down to $17.30 for the first six months and so again, we're starting to see that. Now, lower natural gas prices helped that somewhat, as well.</p>
          <p>Our downstream business has actually had a great first six months of the year as well. They generated some $222 million in earnings and almost $450 million of cash flow in a very difficult environment. So very proud of what our Refining and Marketing division has done in the first six months. Our Natural Gas division also had solid performance in terms of production at just over 200 million cubic feet a day, also very tough environment on the Gas side.</p>
          <p>So with that as well, our Major Projects group we really have two major projects underway, our Firebag sulfur plant, which is over 90% complete and will done here in the third quarter. And our CPAC extraction plant, which is also way over 90% complete and will be done in the third quarter. So the two big projects we have are just winding down. What we will be doing, we'll be looking at Firebag Stage 3 to determine at what point here we'll give it the full green light.</p>
          <p>And I know one of the questions out there will there be: well, give us the order of the going projects. I would just say you do need to give us some time after close until we get the put backs and we can take a look at that in terms of putting all of these projects on a comparable basis and prioritize the projects on a go-forward basis on terms of highest return, what provides really near-term cash flow, and also, a part of the equation is risk around doing the lowest risk projects first as long as they have a high return.</p>
          <p>You know, what's really great about this Company is you have a Company who has growth projects stretched out for well over a decade, and we can actually go at this at a pace that meets both our financial capacity, but also the technical expertise that we have in a way that does not create its own inflationary rates. And so this is a good time to go at this on a very steady basis, on a go-forward basis.</p>
          <p>I'm going to let Ken talk a little bit more about the financial capacity in just a few minutes. But what I would say about the downturn in commodity prices, and I'm not making any forecasts here around oil prices, but I would say I feel like the worst is over, in terms for Suncor alone. We, I think, are positioned ourselves very well as we come out of 2009 and go into 2010.</p>
          <p>My personal goal is to do this merger as well as we can. The synergies we announced in terms of $300 million of annual cost savings and $1 billion in capital savings, I can just tell you that based upon the early planning that we've done, and we can't look at everything because of the Competition Bureau's restraints until after close. But I would just say those targets are definitely achievable. I have absolute confidence we'll get to that. Will we get to more? It's a good question. I think that's a question probably for the next quarterly call we have.</p>
          <p>One of the things that I want to make sure &#x2013; and I'll have for sure some Petro-Canada employees and Suncor employees on this call -- is that one of my personal goals is that people that both stay with the organization and those that leave the organization are treated fairly and with respect. And just know we're working very hard on that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Now one of my favorite topics that I talk a lot about is strategy. So as we put these two companies together, I can promise you that the strategy will change slightly, but the new Suncor is going to look a lot like the strategy of the old Suncor. If you take a look, we have just in the northern part of Alberta alone, 26 billion barrels of resources. This is a company that is really designed to, and will be working hard to monetize those resources through our own systems in terms of upgrading, and our own refineries, and ultimately to our customers. I think that's an advantage that not many companies around the world can have.</p>
          <p>If you think about where we are in the cycle route right now, and certainly for the next 18 months, this Company's been very focused on driving these synergy values. But this is a good time to do that. If you think about the cycle, this is probably not a great time to over-invest in natural gas, with natural gas prices where they are and where they're likely to be for the next 18 months. It's also not necessarily a great time to over-invest in refining and marketing. Now, that doesn't mean I'm not proud about the assets that new Company will have. I'm very proud of those. But if you just think about changing fuel standards in terms of that, where demand is, it's a great time not to over-invest in that side.</p>
          <p>So you'll see us very focused on oil and again, looking at what provides the highest return, the lowest risk, and near term cash flow. So the strategy will alter some, but it's going to look a lot like the old strategy. And maybe that's because I've been here so long it's the only strategy I know. That may be the other part of that.</p>
          <p>So listen, we'll have lots of opportunities over the next several quarters and through the rest of this year and early 2010 to discuss strategy further. John, that's all I was going to say. I'm going to turn it over to Ken, if I can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone. I'm just going to talk briefly about the balance sheet as we head into the merger next month. As Rick said, I mean clearly the goal in the first half of this year has been to stabilize the balance sheet, and we've done that. I mean, if we look at capital spending, we've been tracking very closely to that 3 billion of capital spending and safe mode costs for the projects that we slowed down and stopped in the first half of the year, so tracking to that level of spending.</p>
          <p>You know, with commodity prices stabilizing, the balance sheet has stabilized. We did see an increase in debt in the second quarter. That really wasn't a surprise. Much lower than it was in the first quarter and net debt's come in around 9 billion. So that's pretty much in line with our expectations for the first half. We expect to see that much more stable as we go into the second half.</p>
          <p>So I guess I would say we're as well positioned as we could be, given what we've come through in the first six months of the year, moving into the merger, and integrating the assets, and having a consolidated balance sheet going forward. So I think we feel pretty good about where our balance sheet is right now. John, that's all I was going to cover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Ken. I actually &#x2013; I'm pleased to say I don't have a lot to cover. Normally I give you an update on the outlook, and other than a few minor tweaks in terms of the outlook really didn't change too much there. It'd just be a little bit different in the production mix but that has to do probably more with prior production as opposed to future production.</p>
          <p>I know there is a lot of stuff this quarter, in terms of the financials. Everything from mark-to-market, to foreign currency changes, to royalty changes, to the income tax, and if you can just kind of wait until after the conference call, Maureen and Tim  and I will be happy to help you kind of work through that in your models. Tim, I know in particular, is quite interested in helping you explain it &#x2013; or explain to you all the nuances around the accounting treatments as we go through it. So we really look forward to the one-on-one discussions after the conference call in terms of these things.</p>
          <p>What we would like to do is have that strategic discussion with Rick and Ken going forward, so Operator Luke, why don't we turn it over to the audience for their questions on strategy for the Company.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question today comes from Andrew Fairbanks of Banc of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Good morning, guys. I'll just starting with a strategic question. I wanted to ask you, Rick, that as you look forward at some of the non-Oil Sands core areas, how hard would you look at expanding projects in those areas? For example, on the East Coast, when Hebron comes up, that could be a fairly significant capital spend. Is the strategic view for these areas to keep them more as cash cows? Or would you seriously look at spending some significant capital on those areas as you go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, that's a great question, and thank you for that. I think the way I would put that is I haven't really have enough time to overly dig into that. I mean my view going into this is that those East Coast assets and the North Sea assets are key long-term keepers for us. What we will want to do is to take and make sure that we really understand the risk and also the return on capital numbers from there. If those are adequate, then I definitely would see that you're going to continue to invest in those assets. Petro-Canada has an interest in all of the oil production fields on the East Coast. That's certainly a core area, and we would certainly look at investing in that on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's great. Thanks. And I guess just one other on the capital cost front: how do you see the current state of the Oil Sands capital costs? I mean obviously we had Pearl come in lower than the original Petro-Can Fort Hills mine, but then you had the Steepbank mine extraction come in a little bit above budget. Where do you see costs? Are they actually coming down, or coming down very slowly? Or what do you think we can expect on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're coming down; never as quick as you want, I will have to say that. And the one thing we're not seeing on the construction side, so this is on the capital investment side, is wage rollbacks or anything. We, I think, are seeing better productivity in the field. That's quite helpful. And what I do expect on a go-forward basis is the industry to show a lot more discipline through this next cycle.</p>
          <p>I think this Oil Sands game is going to be a large company game in terms of who invests in it. I think people will go at it in a different pace. I think this is a good chance for the town of Fort McMurray to heal and get a lot of their growth issues behind them. And so I think I see a steadier state with better productivity numbers and a less of a fever pitch.</p>
          <p>Will capital costs go down? Yes, but I think that's more related to manufacturing capacity, steel prices and the ability to buy a lot of materials cheaper than we have, but also be able to plan these projects a lot better.</p>
          <p>You know, one of the things that has occurred is on the labor side, of course, we had foreign labor coming in and we had workers from all across Canada. Certainly some of that has come off. I mean, I don't know that there's many foreign workers in Alberta currently on these projects, virtually none, and we're certainly plying less people from across the East as well. But in a way that's kind of an elastic balloon, it'll kind of go in and out as we need these crafts.</p>
          <p>So don't expect any wage rollbacks, but expect improvement on the other fronts. So should we see it? Yes, absolutely, and my guess is we're already seeing a 10 to 15% kind of rollback from the peak. Now the peak was probably unrealistic as well. When we see it go down to the capital numbers we saw a decade ago, that's difficult to see unless this is a very, very protracted recession.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Several quick questions, hopefully. Rick, when we're looking at Steepbank in April you gave an estimate of say 850 million, and now it's 980 million. I'm a little bit curious that in terms of the labor market conditions over the last several months, I assume that it's nowhere near the tight situation, so what may have changed that? Is it because the management are just focusing too much on the merger, and as a result they did not realize that the cost is coming along much faster, or something has happened over the last several months to really throw you a curve ball here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paul that's a great question. What I would say about that, that project got to be very time sensitive, and so we actually need that plant on line here at the tail end of the third quarter. We spent quite a bit of overtime money that we didn't expect, in terms of completion of that project and so saw that 10 to 15% increase in costs. It has been a surprise, but on the other hand, in order to get it completed in the timeframe we need to operate it. So it was more a matter of the fact that we had to put enough manpower to it to get it done in the timeframe we -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But we know that from day one, right? Did we? Not like that all of a sudden that the last two or three months we realized that they need to be done by the end of September.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree with that. What I would say is that we weren't as far along on the project as we thought we were and just had to put the coal to the fire as we went through. John, you were going to add...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Paul, one thing I wanted to add, and just for the whole group, the reimbursement is that the &#x2013; I know the merger with Petro-Canada is a big deal and there's a lot happening around that. But really, the Oil Sands group, and to a large extent, the Project Management group for the Oil Sands is isolated from this transaction. So I think we should remember that we could never use an excuse that we are somewhat sidetracked by this transaction in our capital projects or in the operation of the Oil Sands, because we're doing our best to isolate that group from this total transaction that's taking place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I know it's early time, but can you give some kind of timeline of when that you will be deciding on the Firebag Voyageur and the Fort Hills?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It'll be &#x2013; I think we'll be able to talk about that in some concrete manner sometime towards the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In all three, or just one of the deals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I know these questions will come up. I know you want the information earlier, but I just want to make sure we go do our homework in terms of the sequencing of these projects. Now obviously, Firebag 3 is one that's high on the list. You may see that kind of roll out sooner than that. But before we go charge off on what is Firebag Stages 4, 5, and 6, look versus -- MacKay River versus Fort Hills versus our other opportunities, first of all, I want to go through and go through that, put everything on a common basis and look at those factors I talked about before, before we announce that. So that will take a little bit of time to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the hedging strategy going forward, I mean this quarter, obviously that is the fifth time on hedging that we have a big loss here. On a going-forward basis, Rick, how you look at hedging. I mean, is it really is something that you want to pursue in a reasonably aggressive way going forward, or that because of the instability in the market, that is really not something that you want to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul. It's Ken here, and I can address that for you. I mean, look, we've been clear all along where hedging has been for us. The hedging strategy is insurance for the balance sheet during periods of high capital spending. And as we look at the business model of Suncor going forward, broader-based, very focused growth plans in specific areas with the criteria that Rick talked about, we see a much stronger financial capacity and much stronger balance sheet going forward. So directionally, we would see less need for hedging as insurance for that balance sheet and to protect our capital programs than we've had in the past. So from time to time, you may look at it, you would never say never, but I would say we would expect to see less hedging going forward than we've had in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know I take up a lot of time. Two final questions. One, you talk about the East Coast; how about the international asset of Petro-Canada? Is that a coal kicker or not really?</p>
          <p>Secondly, that I think you have indicated that after -- if we do go with the Voyageur that after that, maybe you go with more in the bitumen only instead of the integrated model. But with more companies look like they're moving into that direction, would that maybe that trick you to think about differently; maybe the integrated model will still be a better one, if everyone goes for the bitumen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's two good questions. So the first one on international, again, I haven't got all the data that I require or all the conversations with that group that I need to kind of analyze that. We will be looking at those assets and again, we'll be lining those up based upon what has the highest return on capital. We will -- risk will be factor and I know the market has not really liked particularly the risk around Syrian and Libyan assets. That's an equation that I haven't actually had time to completely analyze or make a decisions on. We'll be taking a look at that.</p>
          <p>For this Company, again, we're going to line it up on return on capital considerations first. So no decisions have been made. And that's something we'll be looking at after close here.</p>
          <p>That's a great question, the strategy question around bitumen versus upgrading. You know what, the great thing about Suncor is we've got complete flexibility around that. We've got the ability to turn on in relatively short order and finish 200,000 barrels a day of an upgrader with the Voyageur upgrader when we so choose. I think the answer is, though, initially we want to be bitumen-long. But we will have the maximum flexibility.</p>
          <p>I'm not as worried, Paul, about all the announcements. Not all these guys are going to produce, and as you've seen, a number of them, they don't produce at the rates they say or as quickly as they say they're going to do it. So I don't think you're going to see a big flood of bitumen come on the market where you get, again, another big discontinuity.</p>
          <p>And if you look at it on a broader basis, on a global basis, you continue to see kind of production in Mexico decline. I would expect some big declines in Venezuela, where a lot of that heavy oil that comes in the Gulf Coast. We continue to see very good pull from customers in the United States or refiners for heavy oil from Canada.</p>
          <p>So you know, I expect that to be a fairly good strategy over the next -- certainly the next four or five years. Beyond that, again, we've got complete flexibility around where we do that. Suncor being an integrated oil company is certainly a big piece of our strategy. But there will be periods where we're definitely bitumen-long. And we'll be kind of looking at those on a go-forward basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just a couple questions on the growth project. I think you had mentioned that Firebag 3 may get the go-ahead sooner than other projects. And I guess the rationale there is you've already sunk a fair bit of capital into it. Just wondering, does the same logic then apply to the Voyageur upgrader? I guess there's probably about $3 billion spent already on that. So does that mean we could see the go-ahead of that key project sooner than, for instance, Firebag 5, 6, and the other feed stock sources?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andrew. I would say not as likely, because again, we want to be bitumen-long. There's no need to build the upgrader if you don't have the bitumen to fill it. So this is a priority basis. And of course, given the environment we're in right now, and given the fact there is demand out there for heavy oil, the way I would see this in sequence is make sure you get bitumen-long, get the volumes up, and then you can take a look at finishing the upgrader.</p>
          <p>I've been quite open on the fact that we would look at partners. So if there was a partner that was interested in up to half of that 200,000 barrels a day is something we would actually take a good look at. We also have pre-investments in Firebag 4, and to some extent in 5 and 6, only from the infrastructure viewpoint. So again, those are kind of low-hanging fruit.</p>
          <p>I also do know on the Petro-Canada side that they have some pre-investment on the expansion of MacKay River. And so you don't want to let just go-forward economics control you in that sense. But it is a consideration about how much is sunk in there. But I see first, the first priority for us is getting production up from those assets, and then the upgrader will be a secondary consideration.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. And then one other question, just on potential asset dispositions. I think you mentioned at the time of the merger that you had had some talks with the Libyan government and other host governments in terms of title transfers and whatnot. Has there been any complexities around that, or any pushback from title transfer standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't want to get into the details around that because obviously it deals with our relationships, which are very important to us on a go-forward basis with these governments. I would just say we've had great cooperation. We have the approvals that we feel like we are -- needed to have and are required to have to close. We feel very comfortable with that. And I personally have not been in discussion with any of these governments. That's one of the things that we'll be doing as we head into after the merger. So I would just say no over-complications at the moment.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wonder if I can just get a quick update on your thoughts around dividend policy for the combined entity, and if you just intend to maintain the current combined payouts flat and focus more on capital spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark, it's Ken here. I would say right out of the gate, we will be increasing the dividend from a Suncor perspective, Suncor shareholders, so we will be paying out sort of what was the combined payout of the two companies on a standalone basis. The Board will evaluate that on a regular basis, so I mean we can't say anything other than that at this point. That's their expectation for dividends right out of the gate.</p>
          <p>But I think directionally, Rick has talked about a company that has very attractive growth projects, high return, near-term cash flow and low risk, and that's going to be ratable for the foreseeable future. It's also in the context of a much stronger balance sheet. So we see through this combination the potential to generate more free cash flow through the cycle, not just to fund the growth but also to generate free cash flow over and above that. So our expectation directionally would be that dividend policy and dividend growth rate should kind of fall in growth as we go forward, and so that's generally our expectation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And in terms of Firebag, it seems to be ramping up quite nicely and just curious on your guys' expectations how that plays out going forward here. And based on, you know, steam-oil ratios you're seeing and the steam capacity you've got, would you see that ultimately get somewhere up into the 70 to 80,000 barrel a day range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, it's John. That's a great question. Obviously with production today at about 55,000, we've made some really good progress this year on that. We would expect that we'd be able to exit the year you know, right around 70,000 barrels a day. The ultimate capacity of Firebag 1 and 2, with the de-bottlenecking that we did should be at the range of 90. We are short a little bit of steam there, so we're probably going to be capped out at Firebag 1 and 2 somewhere in the mid 70s, around 75 or thereabouts.</p>
          <p>But we'll be approaching that number, be very close to it near the year-end, so we're pretty happy where we are. Steam-oil ratios should probably level off somewhere in the 2.3-2.4 on the mature wells that we have, and the productivity per well has been probably exceeding our own expectations; somewhere in the neighborhood &#x2013; it depends on the well of course, but anywhere between 1,800 to 2,000 barrels a day. So very, very solid performance out of Firebag and obviously we're delighted enough with Firebag and the performance there to continue that as a key part of our growth going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, and then just one last one if I could. With Shell's announcement on the Montreal refinery, I know &#x2013; I don't think you guys are &#x2013; I think you're quite happy with your capacity of the combined entity now and not looking to put a lot of money into the downstream, but would appear to be the natural buyer on that. Is that something that you would consider looking at? And would there be any potential benefits to the Montreal coker project in terms of if you could combine those two facilities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I think that's a great question. I really don't have the answer to it except to say that we're really not interested in buying the assets right now, not for the foreseeable future. I think our plate is really full on driving on the things I talked about and driving these synergy values. I don't know that there is a lot in the combination of those two refineries. I'm not sure, to be honest with you, whether you could actually get that approved either by the Competition Bureau, but it would be a big open question. I'm sure from a competition viewpoint, the government would be much more interested in having competitors there than having those two things put together. So I think our interest is extremely low on any of that. We'll kind of watch that from the sidelines and see what Shell decides and see where those assets end up. I don't see a real advantage on the coker project. The coker project's the one that we have under review, and we'll take a look at that in terms of whether we finish that project or put it on hold.</p>

So that'll be some work that we'll complete as quickly as we can after close, and we will come out with a more accurate number some time in the late August-September kind of timeframe, is what I expect.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, good morning. I have a, I guess, two-part question on the subject of integration. The merger will change very much, at least on a combined basis, the balance between natural gas production and Oil Sands production, which is something I believe the organization's been kind of strategically focused on. It will also change, from an integration standpoint, the balance between refining capacity and Oil Sands and syncrude production. How should we think about that in terms of the strategic implications of the significant changes in those balances and whether you will continue to think in terms of trying to keep the kind of balance that you've had prior to the merger?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Listen the way I would look at this natural gas business, particularly for the next several years, is we need to change our cost structure. And so what I'm expecting here, not that gas will stay where it is today at a $3.50 kind of number, but that we'll see quite a bit of variation.</p>
          <p>But with the new Company, I know the one thing that Steve Williams and Neil Camarta are very focused in on what does our cost structure look like, how do we compete, how do we get our costs in the kind of heading towards the top quartile kind of performance. And listen, we're a long ways away from that.</p>
          <p>So I think we'll focus return on capital and natural gas. I think the question about are you naturally balanced is over for a long period of time. So we're going to have plenty of gas in terms of that natural balance, so that equation's out. Real focus on cost structure and return on capital. You will probably see some of our natural gas volumes actually come off as we either look at our asset base or make other strategic decisions, or not invest at the rate that the two Companies were investing separately.</p>
          <p>That's a decision that Steve and Neil and their teams will be taking a good look at. So what I would think about that is the balance will change, but our focus on gas is going to be how do we get our costs to a position of being competitive, given what I see as a pretty volatile gas world and one in which we're going to see some real dips here, in terms of price.</p>
          <p>In that equation, of course, you've got this tight gas; what is a real cost structure and compare that against our cost structure. So make sure we've always got some margin at these lower gas prices. In terms of refining marketing versus Oil Sands, I mean, I see us having the syncrude interest as very important. I see that moves another roughly 30,000 barrels a day of synthetic crude that we will have in our portfolio. I see that as a plus, in terms of our customers at our own refineries then seeing less volatility from the swings in our two upgraders because now you have some other assets to balance off against. Very pleased with the balance we have between Oil Sands and refining.</p>
          <p>As you know, that Edmonton refinery of Petro-Canada's fits very well with Oil Sands production. About 60 to 70% of the flow-through, through our starter refinery comes right out of our own assets. I don't know what the number is but 10 or 15,000 barrels a day in Denver from our own assets as well, and we can increase that.</p>
          <p>One of the things we will look at is the reversal of line nine, in terms of moving Western product into Montreal. That is also somewhat tied in my mind to the completion of the coker there. And so I'm very pleased with how this whole thing ties together. And so I feel like that balance actually probably makes us in a stronger position and more integrated than most companies are, if not all companies in this field, so very pleased with that. One thing we're working hard on is taking a look at how those assets line up, and is there any low-hanging fruit in terms of small investments that can vastly change our efficiency or drive value on a go-forward basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, if I could just follow-up for a second. If I'm interpreting you, your response correctly, you would not envision a series of divestiture transactions to reestablish the fairly close balance that you've had with natural gas versus the feed requirements on the Oil Sands and a similar type of balance on the downstream side as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will look at divestments where it makes sense. We'll particularly look at divestments in the natural gas business, if that's what's required to get us through a low cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one more if I could please. You've repeatedly referenced return on capital employed as being a criteria for the evaluation of business units and/or projects. Are you speaking on a going-forward marginal return basis? Or are you looking at historical returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Sure, you got to look at both. And you've got to look is that's the reason we're driving so hard on the cost structure is your existing assets to get your margins up. And then that's where the international assets fit for us, in a good way, is you've got a very low operating cost structure in the North Sea and the East Coast that will help you weather through the lower part of the commodities price cycle. We know this Oil Sands business on a daily operating cost basis is one of the higher cost sources of oil in the world. Now when you add exploration, it actually balances out. But in terms of going through the trenches, your cost structure is very important. So you've got to look at return capital on your existing assets and look at return capital on a go-forward on an investment basis. So that's why I answered it in the flippant way that I did.</p>

          <p>Hi. Two questions. First of all, can you give us a sense of how labor productivity has changed relative to where you were, say, a year ago? And secondly, when you drill down closer into the Oil Sands division, and looking at where your pricing was for the quarter, can you give us a sense of whether there was any revenue adjustments or anything like that? And a follow-up to that is on the cost side when you guys show your Op costs are around $32, there's about $200 million of costs that you've adjusted for. Can you give us a sense of what some of those are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take the first question, and Ken will take the next two, Ken or John, one of the two, will take the next two. On the first question, I can't give you any hard numbers. I would just say that based upon our observance &#x2013; and you've got to remember, we're at the tail end of the two large projects that we have going on.</p>
          <p>But we have seen better productivity, better organization, stronger workforce, and with a more Western-based workforce on these projects, you got a better supervision with more knowledgeable skill basis. So a lot of that productivity comes in the fact that your more experienced crews are the ones that you retain on these projects and that certainly helps your productivity.</p>
          <p>I think it also helps though listen, there's less pressure in town, people can get to those job sites in a timely way, and they feel better about being there. And so, it's kind of the whole pressure on the whole system. All of that contributes to better productivity. And, you know, I think the other thing that I would always mention on that is part of that productivity has to be us doing a better job of engineering and planning these projects. I'm not a guy who just lays that off on the field labor alone. If you &#x2013; I'm of the firm belief that if you organize, do your planning and engineering well, you will get better productivity. It's when we don't plan well that these projects get off the rails. I think, John, you were going to take the next two questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and Kam those are pretty close to questions we weren't going to answer, but the question on the revenue at the Oil Sands has to do with the mark-to-market, and that's actually illustrated in one of our pages on the reconciliation of the earnings of 600 million. And on the cost side, the 200 million has to do with the inventory adjustment, which is on the cash costs reconciliation table, further on there, too. But if you would like to phone us after, we'll be around to talk to you. I'll be happy to into that in more detail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a couple questions for you. First of all, just on the guidance that you put out as far as cost structures, that 33 to 38 remains unchanged. But I do notice that you've changed your gas price assumption fairly significantly; you've gone from 7.50, down to 4.75. So can you maybe clarify, John, as to why on your go-forward look, your guidance, wouldn't it be reduced in step with this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly, I mean, that's a great question, Will, and you're ringing the bell because I think that was the one that we were hoping somebody didn't ask. We did reduce the gas price. You have to go back to the cost structure up at Oil Sands, and about 45% of that is labor. We did actually &#x2013; are in the final year of the contract up at the Oil Sands, and we did get a 5% increase. So there has been some cost pressure up at Oil Sands that has been there. We have seen things like natural gas reaping a benefit and on the materials side and contract side, I think as Rick said, we're hoping that we'll see more of a reduction going forward. So that was kind of the reason that we didn't make any adjustment right now.</p>
          <p>The second thing to keep in mind is the MacKay River volumes that are coming through the Oil Sands today do not include any component for the cost for the actual producing of those assets. So when they actually come in, and we start consolidating going forward, it will be consolidated within the Oil Sands operation, and that will actually have an impact on the cost, as we now have to account for the actual cost of bring those barrels to the upgrader.</p>
          <p>I should also say that we will see a higher revenue as a result of that, but in terms of the cost, because that's what we're talking about right now, you will see a higher cost there. The other thing is we are doing a turnaround in the vacuum tower in the third quarter for about 28 days, which will impact about 35,000 barrels a day, and of course that will have an impact on cost. So it's a very long answer to your question, but for those reasons we chose not to change the guidance from 33 to 38, even though we are hoping there are certain areas within that cost structure that we may see further declines.</p>

          <p>My second question would be related to Firebag. You did expand just briefly this morning that you are short steam there, and the cap production at around the mid 70,000 barrel a day range, yet you're also talking about steam/oil ratios going to 2.3 for the mature wells. So can you expand a little bit more on this as to what the challenges are, sort of overall productivity for the project, anything else that you can give?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It actually is a good news story quite frankly, because we had actually felt that the productivity wouldn't be quite as high as it is out of the well. It is higher than we had expected, but that did mean it we had to put more steam in to get the barrels, since we're getting more barrels out. So in that way, we actually landed up being just a little bit short of steam. So it's actually a good news/bad news story. It's good news because we are going to have all the barrels produced, you're going to have a low steam-oil ratio, and you're going to have high productivity. The bad news is you're a little bit short in the currents of the overall potential of the assets. So I think you've got both sides to that equation happening.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just circling back on a question that I know you don't really want to deal with on the conference call, but there's been a number of clients who have been calling about this particular question, is the fact that when you take your pricing and you take your costs that you've disclosed for the Oil Sands, yet you come up with a negative cash flow for the operations for the quarter, it's a fairly significant variance, John. And just in terms of the overall fair disclosure in terms of the market, I think people would like to understand a little bit more as to what the other costs were that were driving this variance that drove you to a negative, when looking at costs and revenue and sales volumes, it would tell you that you should have had a different number out there. So can you try to talk a little bit to that? I know it's maybe not the venue you want to, but I think there's a lot of clients on the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The real issue in terms of cash flow up at the Oil Sands, there was a number of things that were actually going through that were impacting the cash flow. The one thing you do have to do is when we did the mark-to-market adjustment on the hedges, because it's &#x2013; it'll end up being a current asset you have to look at the cash flow after working capital changes. You can't look at it before working capital changes because that adjustment doesn't come out in the line above it; it comes out the line below the working capital change, so you have to look at the Oil Sands cash flow in particular after working capital changes.</p>
          <p>The other thing, the impact, I think where there was a bit of a disconnect on the cash flow for the Oil Sands, was the royalties. And the royalties, that we did pay a higher royalty rate, and it looks like we paid a higher royalty rate in the second quarter than what you would have expected. There was a bit of a catch-up because if you remember, we did pay the 1% during the first quarter. And then we actually tripped from the 1% to the minimum pay &#x2013; not the minimum pay-out &#x2013; the 25% calculation in the second quarter, but that has to be done retroactively, also. So if you look at the royalties for the entire month, I think you'll find that it's pretty well within the range that we have predicted, given the price. It's about six percent of revenue. I think you'll look at our guidance, it's pretty close to that. There was a bit of a kind of a &#x2013; I think a miss in terms of the royalties.</p>
          <p>Certainly the mark-to-market had an impact, but if you take out the working capital changes, I think you'd get a better number than you had expected. Those are the two primary things. The other thing I think that people maybe were a little surprised with is the CapEx that we did pay during the second quarter; that certainly was a draw on cash flow. And I think we still are expecting to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of 350 to 450 for the year.</p>
          <p>But on the other hand, it certainly &#x2013; you see a cash tax component in there that affected your cash flow, so all of those things coming together kind of impact the cash flow. When you kind of step away from that, I think you should take a little bit of consolation in the fact that they tend to be kind of one-off changes that were coming through. We're hoping, anyway. So if you look at the base operations, the fundamentals of the business really look solid. We just had a number of different financial things coming through this quarter, which unfortunately do from time to time.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Rick, you always get lots of questions on Firebag bitumen production. But maybe looking at your other major source of bitumen production coming out of the mine, it looks like since mid-winter, bitumen production out of the mine's been real strong, running about 300,000 barrels a day. Could you tell us what's been the difference this year in the mine operations versus what we were seeing last year? And how might the Steepbank extraction facility impact the mining operations on a go-forward basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, thanks for that question. I think it's a good question, and I know that Steve and Kirk and the team up there could answer this a lot better than I can, but here's kind of my take from my viewpoint, and that is if you take a look at the first six months of last year, we had lots of issues in the extraction plant. We had several pipeline issues. We had several extreme events where we actually lost parts of the extraction plant for periods of days.</p>
          <p>What we've gotten through this operational excellence is a much more reliable, much more steadier operation. We're seeing better productivity in terms of being able to keep more of our trucks on the road. And so I would just say from my viewpoint, there have been a couple of really good moves, but it's been the combination of an effort of a lot of people to improve their individual work areas. I know they have an effort going on there where they really are trying to empower their work teams in terms of driving productivity increases, and I think that's starting to show big time, in terms of this.</p>
          <p>Now they still have events. I mean we had an extreme -- a couple extreme weather things go through the last month where heavy rains flood the mine. We actually had virtually no mine production a couple of times for 12 to 24 hours, and still, because of our excess capacity, because of Firebag, and in the future because of MacKay, I think what you're seeing is a lot steadier operation with the ability to bounce back from those things better than we have in the past.</p>
          <p>I think one of the interesting things is you think about the mine, and then they think about SAGD of the new Company between MacKay River and Firebag, you'll be 100,000 barrels a day of SAGD production and then you have the mine production. And as we continue to build up SAGD production, we should be able to take a little pressure off the mine in that overall sense. I don't actually expect it to mean less barrels, I just think it will hopefully mean a better reliability and a better way to manage it. That's kind of my view of where we're going here. John, what do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's &#x2013; and there's a couple of physical things. One is we do have more trucks and shovels this year, which certainly is helping. Some of the productivity things, I think that Kirk actually, and Steve would love to talk about is the labor force up there has really kind of taken hold, I think, in the environment we're in right now. And I'll give you an example, one thing that changed that they've been able to do is really set about the ability to, say, change an engine in a truck where before it would take three days, they now have it down to about a day in terms of doing that. So it has been a real turnaround, both physically getting more trucks and shovels but also being able to have higher productivity. And I think a lot of the credit has to go to our management and union work force.</p>
          <p>On the extraction plant, one of the issues that we do have and continue to have today is the containment problem of the pond. And actually, the new Steepbank extraction plant is going to alleviate to a large extent that as we move to a new extraction plant and are -- won't be as restricted in terms of the ponds as we are from the original. And the extraction plant we're now talking about is the one that goes right back to 1967 and some of the ponds around that. So really as you go to the new Steepbank extraction plants, you're going to have less issues in terms of pond containment than you do today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Rick, I guess one other question. Now with your interest in syncrude, I think historically the businesses up there have tended to operate in silos. Do you see now any opportunity for cross working in terms of bitumen sharing, etcetera with the -- having interest in two different operations? Will that in any way, I guess, foster a more, I guess, cooperative environment up there from a working position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a really good question, Brian, and the answer, I hope, is yes, I hope. We'll have to kind of see how the relationships play out. And I think some of this is historic because the two companies competed very fiercely down to hockey teams in town, even. And so that competitive spirit has always been an important part of that. And as we go forward, I think there's some real shared learnings between both organizations that can happen that will hopefully help everyone be more competitive.</p>
          <p>And in terms of bitumen sharing, I don't know. I've been a proponent of trying to hook all of these plants, including CNRL or anyone else up by pipeline to make sure that we drive efficiency and also effectiveness across the whole, entire system. I would just say having gotten that done to date, whether this helps foster that is something we have yet to see.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Mostly been answered but I wanted to ask an additional question on environmental issues. And policies are evolving in the U.S. and here, possibly with a trend to be more aggressive on reducing carbon emissions. And I wanted to ask how you see things evolving in terms of the impact on your business. Particularly I'm interested in how you might see the magnitude of additional costs on your business and what type of actions you think that you might be required to take in order to be in line with requirements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Barbara, this could take three days to answer that question because I've been doing a lot of work on this issue. Just remember, some courts have been on this page for a long period of time. We're, as you know, Barb, the largest bio-fuel producer in this country, and we've been in the top 10 in terms of wind power producers, and so we feel like we've got a pretty good, strong handle on this.</p>
          <p>I guess when I step back and look at this thing from a bit afar, certainly we're going to go to a carbon tax of some form. What form that takes and whether the Waxman Bill actually lasts through the Senate in the United States or not is something that I think is still really up in the air what that looks like. What you've got to remember is the U.S. has a big problem on coal. A much bigger problem than Canada has, relative basis, on Oil Sands or the emissions coming out of Oil Sands.</p>
          <p>The other way I'd like to frame this up for you is if all oil that's imported into the U.S. is treated the same, so whether your oil comes from Mexico, Venezuela, the Middle East, and that is on a full lifecycle basis to be the same, then listen, we're within 10% of that in any case. We feel like we can compete on that basis.</p>
          <p>What I always tell the environmental front that's very important Barb, is, I think what stakeholders really want to see out of the industry is continuous improvement. One of our low-hanging fruits is to improve our own energy intensity, reduce our own emissions. We're still working on that, and we've made great progress over the last decade where our emissions in our production are way down in terms of all kinds of measures. And you can pick that up on our sustainability report; those individual facts.</p>
          <p>I think what stakeholders don't expect perfection. I think what they really want to see is continuous improvement in terms of Co2 emissions, but also in terms of other air emissions, water use, land use, and I can just tell you we're working on all those fronts. We have shown very good continuous improvement over the last decade. I know it's never quick enough to satisfy everybody, but that's the job ahead.</p>
          <p>As long as we're put on equal footing with other producers on a worldwide basis, we can compete. I don't think there's any question about that. Is there going to be a cost impact? Probably. Do I expect it to be massive? Not if you treat all carbon equally. If carbon emitted from coal in the U.S. is treated equally to carbon emitted in the U.S., we can compete. That's my own summation of it. Short of that, we need three days, and we'll meet separately on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think at one point Alberta had proposed sort of a $15.00 a ton type of a charge for carbon emissions which, I think, translated to something probably less than a dollar a barrel in terms of operating cost impact. At this point, is that in any way a realistic guideline to go by? Or have we sort of, are we in a new world and we have to see what happens here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. By the way, Alberta is one of the few provinces or jurisdictions in North America that does have a carbon tax currently, and it is that tax you're talking about. It's actually in place, and take a look at that $15 a ton kind of number and I think it works out in the $0.20-some a barrel kind of range. And so, often Alberta's not given enough credit in terms of what they have put in place, which is really ahead of most jurisdictions. I think, John, you wanted to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You know, Barb, I might suggest that just for your own planning purposes that you use more like $1.00, in that range. I think $0.20 is good, but if you use $1.00, I think you can see that although it isn't the best thing that happened to this organization, the returns are still going to be okay, and certainly you'll be able to move ahead as you would expect with the Company.</p>
          <p>And that's what we're expecting and I think that's what Rick said is that there will be a balance for this particular situation going forward, that there is a need for hydrocarbons going forward. There will be some sort of tax put on the industry, and it's our belief that if we work real hard, there's going to be that fair balance between the need for hydrocarbons and more hydrocarbons in the future versus some kind of charge you're going to get coming into your costs.</p>
