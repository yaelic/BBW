        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and welcome to the Halliburton second quarter 2010 conference call. Today's call is being webcast and a replay will be available at Halliburton's website for seven days. The press release announcing the second quarter results is available on the Halliburton website.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Tim Probert, President, Global Business Lines and Corporate Development. In today's call, Dave will provide opening remarks. Mark will discuss our overall financial performance and liquidity position. And Tim will provide comments on our operations and business outlook. We will welcome questions after we complete our prepared remarks.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind our audience that some of today's comments may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events and their potential impact on performance. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could impact operations and financial results and cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2010, and recent current reports on Form 8-K.</p>
          <p>Note that we will be using the term international to refer to our operations outside the US and Canada, and we will refer to the combination of US and Canada as North America.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian, and good day to everyone. Overall, I'm very pleased with our second quarter results. Our total revenues of 4.4 billion were 26% higher than the prior year, and our first year-on-year increase we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2008. We were able to leverage our expanded market position to benefit from the significant increase in US land activity and the seasonal recovery in the international markets. Our operating income grew 60% from the prior year, led by more than a 400% increase in North American profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me talk first a little bit more about North America. North America was our stellar performer in the second quarter, with sequential revenue increasing 24% versus US land rig count growth of 13%. This is the first quarter that our sequential revenue increase outpaced rig count growth since the recovery began last year. Operating income improved over 90% sequentially despite the negative earnings impact of the Canadian seasonal slowdown and the deepwater drilling suspension in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>The gas directed rig count rose 8% during the quarter. Gas operators are benefiting from productivity gains, driven by improved drilling and completion times that lower their breakeven thresholds and enhance their returns. Also, drill to hold activity continues to also influence gas directed activity.</p>
          <p>The US oil directed rig count grew 19% over first quarter levels, buoyed by stabilized commodity prices for liquids. Oil rigs now number close to 600 in the US, a level which we have not seen since the early '90s.</p>
          <p>The continued rebound in oil and gas directed activity in the second quarter led to increased utilization levels for our equipment, and provided us opportunities to increase prices for several of our product lines, led of course by our stimulation business. We have also experienced smaller increases for directional drilling, cementing, and drill bits, as our ability to integrate services together creates a proposition that adds value to our customers.</p>
          <p>In this upturn, however, price increases have not been uniform across all the various land basins in the US because we're taking a different approach in today's market environment. We are working with customers to understand their production economics, developing equipment efficiency models, and setting prices at rates that allow them to earn the returns that they require while enabling us to also generate an appropriate return for our capital investment in that particular basin. I see this as a win-win situation, as it allows our customers to keep their rigs running but does not force us to leave a particular basin to seek higher returns for our equipment. Across this spectrum, pricing power is highest in the oil and liquid rich basins and lowest in the conventional dry gas basins, with dry gas shale plays somewhere in between.</p>
          <p>Utilization levels for our equipment have now surpassed those at the rig count peak in the third quarter of 2008, and are fast approaching levels not seen since the fall of 2006. Utilization levels are highest in the plays with the strongest growth, such as the Bakken and the Eagle Ford, where we have significantly expanded to 24-hour operations. Discussions are underway with some operators regarding longer-term contracts, and we are experimenting with a few of these. These contracts may contain take-or-pay or standby rate provisions, which can provide a certain level of revenue stability for US land operations. We are currently evaluating these types of contracts, but I am not yet convinced that they generate the highest returns for our equipment over a full business cycle, and we are not pursuing these arrangements aggressively at this point in time.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter, interest in liquids rich gas plays remained high because of the relative stability of oil prices and improved operator returns on these resources. These plays now account for 10 to 15% of total rig count. And while they are typically counted as gas rigs, they are dependent economically on commodity prices for liquids. Their continued development, however, generates incremental gas production in an already oversupplied gas market, and may exert additional downward price pressure for natural gas in the coming months.</p>
          <p>One of our key strategies in the downturn was to build market share based on our strong belief in the long-term potential of the North American market, and I believe we were very successful in that effort. Our strategy now is to defend this expanded market position. We have been and we will continue to do this by deploying sufficient incremental capacity to meet the robust demand for our services. We believe the actions we are taking will strengthen the long-term health of our franchise.</p>
          <p>So even though we see potential for additional upward pricing improvement, these increases will moderate, and we expect our sequential revenue growth will more match the rig count in the coming quarters. Any improvement in our margins may also be limited due to increased oil field costs as we are now seeing significant inflation creep into our US cost structure in such areas as higher commodity, freight, and labor costs.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a few moments discussing the situation in the Gulf of Mexico. The tragic incident that occurred on April 20 and the subsequent suspension of deepwater drilling we believe will usher in a new regulatory climate and have a profound impact on how future deepwater drilling is performed. Uncertainties around new drilling requirements and the extent of activity decline during and after the drilling suspension will influence the future actions we will take in the Gulf.</p>
          <p>In addition to the impact of the contraction in the deepwater Gulf, we are also seeing considerable delays in shelf drilling as a result of the new requirements for shallow water permits. I believe these delays combined with the drilling curtailment in deepwater will cause E&amp;P spending to shift onshore and outside the US to enable operators to meet their production targets. Gulf activity may also remain restrained after the drilling suspension as operators need to adjust to more stringent drilling and permitting requirements. Further, I do not believe that the deepwater offshore rigs that were mobilized to international locations during the suspension will return to the Gulf for some time, if at all.</p>
          <p>Based on this scenario, we're taking the following actions in our Gulf of Mexico business. First, we are rationalizing our equipment capacity in the Gulf. We are transferring drilling and downhole wireline tools to international locations to support new projects that we have already won. Cementing, mud logging, and wireline skid units are all rig based, and typically their transfer will go with the rig as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico. We have two stimulation vessels that have been working in the Gulf of Mexico and will continue to work in the shallow water, and we intend them to keep them in the Gulf during this period. At this point, overall equipment movements are just starting, and it is too early to tell if this will meaningfully impact the pricing dynamics in the international markets.</p>
          <p>We also currently have an aggressive hiring program in our US land operations, and we are transferring a significant number of our Gulf field personnel to satisfy this need. In addition, we are relocating some of our engineering personnel to the international offshore market to retain our extensive deepwater talent. In the near term, we intend to keep our infrastructure intact in the Gulf of Mexico. This obviously will impact our short-term results, but will allow us to be competitive once activity resumes in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Despite these short-term impacts, the events in the Gulf of Mexico have not at all stifled our enthusiasm for increased global deepwater activity in the upcoming years. Contributions from the service sector can play a valuable role in developing new technology, innovations, and best practices to help our customers operate safely and efficiently in these challenging conditions, and I believe will generate a corresponding increase in service intensity. Tim will talk about this a little bit more later.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our international business, starting with Latin America. Latin America posted strong improvement from the first quarter's weak results. Brazil continues to stand out in terms of revenue growth. In the second quarter, our Brazil operations generated sequential double-digit revenue increases and year-on-year growth of close to 30%, driven by our well construction product lines.</p>
          <p>In the past year, we have made significant strides in solidifying our market position in Brazil, with wins in directional drilling, wireline, fluids, testing, and completions. Additionally, we have and continue to make infrastructure investments in Brazil. We believe that these investments combined with our unique deepwater capabilities will ensure that we continue to be well positioned to benefit from Brazil's long-term growth prospects.</p>
          <p>Mexico also had improved results in the quarter. However, we believe that the current quarter activity levels from Mexico aren't likely to be sustainable. Our customer has informed its service providers that due to budgetary constraints, it will be reducing the number of rigs allocated to Chicontepec for the remainder of the year to about two rigs per major service company. We are currently operating on four rigs and were about to add a fifth. Additionally, we anticipate activity in the Burgos Basin to remain depressed given the continued weakness in natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>To counteract this, we have started adjusting our Mexico cost structure and are transferring equipment to other locations in Latin America and the US. As a result, we may incur some restructuring charges in Q3 to account for these actions.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year, we see strong growth from Brazil, Colombia, and hopefully Argentina, which may offset weaknesses in Mexico and Venezuela. Given the unevenness of the growth prospects in these countries, we are not anticipating a material net improvement in overall revenues and margins for our Latin America region in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Now for the Eastern Hemisphere; Eastern Hemisphere revenue and operating income increased 9% and 23% sequentially, while incremental margins were 36%. Our second quarter results reflect a seasonal rebound from bad first quarter weather experienced in Russia, China, Australia, and Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Despite the strong rebound in our Eastern Hemisphere results, we are cautious about a number of factors that may impact the rate of the industry's growth the rest of the year. Continued concerns around the current pace of economic recovery and corresponding energy demand are causing some of our customers to reevaluate their execution plans for the second half of the year. Furthermore, based on the Gulf spill, international customers are revisiting their deepwater processes, and that also is causing short-term delays in the startup of certain projects. These factors together with continued very competitive levels on international pricing may lead to a slower ramp-up in revenues and margins in the third quarter, with stronger growth resuming toward the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So our second quarter results show the successful execution of our strategy of balancing our geographic technology and services portfolio. In the second half of 2010 and beyond, we will continue to increase our exposure to the industry's highest growth markets like deepwater and unconventional resources to optimize our growth and returns.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn it over to Mark, and he'll go into a little more detail on the financial results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As I go over our financial highlights, I'll be comparing our second quarter results sequentially to the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Our revenue in the second quarter was $4.4 billion, up 17% from the first quarter. Total operating income for the second quarter was $762 million, up 70% from the previous quarter. All of our regions registered double-digit increases. International margins in the second quarter improved to 16% as all of our international regions registered steady improvement from first quarter levels.</p>
          <p>For North America, margins in the second quarter increased from the prior quarter due to strong activity and improved pricing across most basins with overall incrementals exceeding 50%. North America margins were generally consistent month to month throughout this quarter.</p>
          <p>Now I'll highlight the segment results. Completion and Production revenue increased $429 million or 22%, and operating income more than doubled, with solid contribution from all regions.</p>
          <p>Looking at Completion and Production on a geographic basis, North America revenue increased by 27%, while operating income grew by 126% from better activity and pricing. Increased completions intensity, particularly in unconventional shale basins, has led to high utilization rates that are exceeding levels experienced during the 2007 &#x2013; 2008 time period.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, Completion and Production revenue increased by 5%, and operating income increased 17%, primarily from improved performance in Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina.</p>
          <p>In Europe/Africa/CIS, Completion and Production revenue and operating income increased 19% and 144% respectively due to strong production enhancement activity in The Congo, Algeria, and the North Sea, and increased completion tool sales in Norway and Nigeria.</p>
          <p>In Middle East Asia, Completion and Production posted sequential increases in revenue and operating income of 14% and 76% respectively, due to strong completions and production enhancement activity in Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>In our Drilling and Evaluation division, revenue and operating income increased by $197 million and $48 million respectively, primarily as a result of higher activity across all of our regions except Europe, Africa, and CIS. In North America, Drilling and Evaluation's revenue and operating income increased 17% and 41% respectively, as most of our product service lines continue to benefit from increased horizontal drilling, which grew approximately 18% from the first quarter. Current horizontal rigs represent over 50% of total US rigs, and are now about 33% higher than the levels we saw at the peak rig count in the third quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Drilling and Evaluation's Latin America revenue and operating income increased 21% and over 224% respectively, from higher testing activity in Brazil and increased software sales and project activity in Mexico.</p>
          <p>In the Europe/Africa/CIS region, Drilling and Evaluation revenue and operating income were down 13% and 38 million respectively, due to lower activity in the North Sea and certain locations in West Africa, which were partially offset by the seasonal recovery in Russia. And Drilling and Evaluation's Middle East Asia revenue and operating income were up 13% and 14% respectively from higher drilling activity in Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, increased fluids revenues in Australia, and from wireline services in Iraq. In the second quarter, we completed seven wells relating to our Ghawar project in Saudi Arabia as scheduled.</p>
          <p>This quarter's effective income tax rate was 30%. That's lower than our previous guidance due to the favorable impact of an R&amp;D credit settlement that we received late in the quarter. We continue to forecast that our effective income tax rate for the balance of the year will be somewhere between 32 and 33%.</p>
          <p>Dave discussed our current plans to address the deepwater drilling suspension in the Gulf of Mexico, but I'd like to provide some additional color, if I may. Our Gulf of Mexico region business represented approximately 6% of our total revenues for the first half of 2010. We have said before that roughly 65% of our Gulf of Mexico region business relates to deepwater. We have also said that labor costs represent about a third of our total cost structure.</p>
          <p>Based on our current assumptions on activity levels during and after the deepwater drilling suspension, we have started redeploying to other markets close to 20% of the 2,200 employees serving in the Gulf of Mexico region as well as some of our other assets. Despite our mitigation efforts, we're currently estimating that the drilling suspension will impact our earnings by somewhere between $0.05 and $0.08 per quarter starting in the third quarter and continuing for a few more quarters.</p>
          <p>As all of you would appreciate, the situation in the Gulf continues to evolve, and there will continue to be some level of uncertainty around the full impact of the drilling suspension on our future financial results.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Deepwater Horizon incident, we continue to be confident that Halliburton performed all work with respect to the Macondo well in accordance with BP specifications for its well construction plan and BP's instructions. Our contract with BP Exploration provides specific indemnification of Halliburton for claims and expenses relating to situations just like the Macondo incident. However, this obviously could be subject to challenge by various parties. In addition, while some of have questioned BP's financial survivability, we do not believe this is a likely outcome. But clearly our indemnification is dependent on BP's financial ability to perform under its contractual indemnity obligations.</p>
          <p>As you know, there are also a number of announced Congressional and other governmental investigations that are currently ongoing. We are and will continue to cooperate fully with all these efforts. However, because of these investigations as well as various lawsuits pending on this matter, we will not be taking further questions regarding the Deepwater Horizon incident during this call.</p>
          <p>Tim?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. As Dave discussed, we remain very positive about the long-term prospects of deepwater activity despite the recent events in the Gulf of Mexico. I'll provide a few additional observations on the development of these resources.</p>
          <p>The US has had around 15% of the world's 242 floating rigs, the third largest market after Asia-Pacific and Latin America. IHS data indicates that over the last five years, deepwater and ultra-deepwater accounted for some 40% of global new discoveries, with the size of deepwater discoveries being about three times those of shallow water. Core deepwater areas like Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico, and central West Africa basins are being supplemented by expansions in Australasia, North and East Africa, and the North Sea, stretching geographical boundaries of deepwater activity and providing increased opportunities for oil field service companies.</p>
          <p>The application of new technology to aid our customers in the planning and execution of their deepwater developments is critical for them in balancing their risk/reward matrix, and is an area of significant focus for Halliburton. For example, Landmark's suite of advanced 3D seismic interpretation and analysis tools are providing real value in West Africa and Brazil in helping customers gain an understanding of complex reservoirs, including subsalt.</p>
          <p>In the area of reservoir characterization, Halliburton's GeoTap IDS technology is allowing operators for the first time to capture and analyze reservoir fluids during the drilling process. While after drilling, during well testing, newly introduced DynaLink technology offers analysis of reservoir flow potential, also in real time, reducing uncertainty and improving efficiency.</p>
          <p>Deepwater production represents roughly 6 to 7% of total world oil production today, and is expected to double in the next five years. Oil field service companies that have the unique combination of technology, expertise, and infrastructure will participate meaningfully in the development of these reservoirs. We believe that Halliburton's past and current investments are placing the company in an excellent position to benefit from the growth of deepwater activity worldwide.</p>
          <p>Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. Let me now just quickly summarize where we're at. The increase in overall activity and completions intensity in the second quarter have led to very high utilization rates and increased pricing for most of our product service lines in the US. Going forward, we expect that the overall rig count will continue to grow, but at a slower rate. And also we expect further pricing opportunities, our already high utilization rate, and growing cost pressure will serve to somewhat slow down the rate of improvement in our margins.</p>
          <p>Our international business showed progression in both revenue and margins during the second quarter. We continue to believe that the second half of 2010 will be better for our international markets. However, we now expect that the growth will be more weighted toward the end of the year than we had originally anticipated.</p>
          <p>So we remain very bullish about the prospects of global deepwater activity, and we will utilize our technology, capabilities, and global infrastructure to benefit also from this secular trend.</p>
          <p>Let's go ahead and open it up for questions at this point.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Dan Boyd of Goldman Sachs; your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we understand what the progression of margin was throughout the quarter in North America? Presumably the exit rate was much higher than what you reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Dan, this is Mark. As I mentioned in my comments, the margins were actually fairly consistent in North America month to month. We had seen in the first quarter a steady progression upward at quite a rapid pace. In the second quarter, they leveled off quite a bit. And so the June margin itself wasn't that far off of the quarter average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think let me just add a little bit to that because it's not that our ability to increase pricing slowed down. As I mentioned a couple of times, we're starting to have to deal a little bit with the effect of increasing costs, so we are attempting obviously to continue to raise pricing and raise margins, but our vendors are wanting a piece of that ability at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as a follow-up, Latin America is the one area that also surprised us with margins coming in a little better than expected. Understanding that Mexico is going to pull back a little bit, can you help us understand what sequentially drove the increase in Mexico? And have you started the cost &#x2013; cutting costs there already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The big story in Latin America is Brazil, and Brazil is really what was the primary driver of the strength of Latin America during the quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to Mexico, I think the best way to think about Mexico is that the current quarter provided a peak, if you like, of Mexico's performance. And as Dave alluded to, we do not expect that to continue. Clearly, the budgetary constraints are going to have a significant impact on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As you go to I guess right-size your cost basis in Mexico and you potentially look to take a charge, excluding that charge, should we expect Latin America margins more or less flat from here?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Dave, you mentioned that your international and especially your Eastern Hemisphere customer base was a little bit more reticent with regard to the pace of spending increases given the economic outlook. Is that reticence coming predominantly from IOCs, or is it NOCs as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's primarily the IOCs, and it's really hard to tell what &#x2013; there are two things at play here. One is them taking a look at the economic conditions and getting these big projects started because on these major projects, once you start and sanction them, there's really no turning them off until you've spent a lot of money. So I suspect that a lot of our customers are using a pause from the Gulf of Mexico to do a last study of their processes. It's really a way for them to step back, take a couple of more deep breaths before they embark on some of these major long-term projects. So we're not concerned that these projects are not going to go forward. They will go forward. But I think that everybody is just, as I said, taking a last breath or two and maybe delaying by a quarter or half a quarter the sanctioning of these projects.</p>

          <p>Right. And I get the fact that clients are more introspective with regard to deepwater well designs and processes, and that's mostly IOCs. But the reticence with the regard to the overall development, that's IOCs as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. And I would say it's actually primarily IOCs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. And then secondly, again focusing on the second half of this year, which Eastern Hemisphere markets do you think relative to the first half are going to show the most positive rate of change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The most obvious one will be the North Sea. The North Sea has really struggled through the first two quarters, and I think any help in that market can't help but look better against the first half performance. And Algeria has been another one that has been troublesome in the first part of the year. That's a big business for us and for other service companies. And with the changeover in management and some of the delays sanctioning projects, that has been a country that has relatively underperformed our expectations in half one, which we would hope would get better in the second part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I will sneak one last one in here; any comments with regard to Russia, how it's performing, and outlook for the second half of this year relative to your expectations coming into the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we would say in general that Russia is a little bit below our original expectations for the second half of the year. That obviously remains to be seen, Bill, but our general sense of this at the present time is that it may not perform quite as strongly as we had originally intended, and that was in the double-digit growth range that we had announced I think at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from David Anderson of JP Morgan; your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Dave, I just wanted to get back to you and let you talk about some long-term contracts in the US land market. It's pretty clear you're trying to avoid the '05 &#x2013; '06 repeat when too much capacity entered the market, but now obviously access to capital isn't what it used to be, but I would just think that long-term contracts seem to be the best way to offset any kind of capacity concerns; so I guess a two-part question. One, how concerned are you about capacity over the next 12 months in the US land market? And second, what do you need to see in the contract structure to make it more attractive to you? Is it a function of locking up a prescribed utilization rate? Is it indexed pricing? I'm just curious what it would take for you to enter into more of those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. I made the comment that I'm not yet convinced they're the way to go for a couple reasons. Especially they're not the way to go for us where we are in the cycle right now because you're essentially locking in essentially a fixed price for a set amount of utilization. And as I indicated, I believe that we have upside to prices in North America, and I would not want to tie equipment down with a long-term contract and miss some of the pricing upside while at the same time not being able to fix the cost side of the equation.</p>
          <p>The second is that although people get enamored or sometimes our people get enamored with the recurring fixed price nature of these, our customers have shown no compunction to just tear the contract up when it's to their advantage when pricing is going down. So I don't see that we're getting any downside price protection. And I believe we are limiting our upside return potential by entering into some sort of a long-term contract that has got a fixed price component to it right now.</p>
          <p>The ones we are experimenting with have an element of a fixed price and a commitment as to percentage utilization, but again those are very difficult to measure in practice. And therefore, we're just going to stay away from them right now for the most part, as I said, because I'm not convinced they yield us the highest overall return over a cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That contract you had indicated last quarter, that $750 million contract in the Williston, does that qualify for that evaluation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it doesn't. That was a different kind of contract.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On a different subject, you were talking about reallocating the cost structure in the Gulf of Mexico, I guess two questions. How quickly can you get this done? Is that by the end of the year? And also internally, how many active rigs are you guys counting on the deepwater 12 months from today? I think last I spoke with you guys, you were thinking about 17 rigs. That was about a month and a half ago. I can't imagine things have gotten any better in your opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to our planning, what we told you last time was that we were planning on about 50% of the level of activity, roughly 17 rigs approximately 6 to 12 months after the suspension was lifted. There's probably no reason to change that right now in terms of an assessment of what might take place, and you have to have a basis for planning your business. That's the one that we have used, and we'll obviously modify that based on the flow of information that we receive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But with respect to the movement of capital items, that happens relatively quickly. And yes, that reallocation will be complete by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then if you took your offshore margins, you're moving obviously. Everybody else is moving as well. I think you highlighted that you're not too sure margins are going to go. How concerned should we be about excess capacity? I didn't think there was a big capacity issue with a lot of this equipment internationally. Is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a limited amount of assets that are likely to be moved into the international markets for a variety of reasons. Some of it is the type of equipment. Some of it is size. Some of it is suitability. So there's always that potential that everyone doing everything at the same time may have an impact, but there's certainly no evidence that that's taking place at the present.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to start to turn back to the guidance for the earnings impact from the drilling suspension in the Gulf. Do you assume any deepwater activity in those figures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think in the &#x2013; if you think about the 5 to 8% we announced, if a reasonable level of shelf drilling goes forward in the next couple of quarters, and I think that's a little iffy at this point in time, then I think the hit to earnings will be at the low end. If the shelf continues to find it very difficult to get permits and therefore they can't drill, then I think it's going to be toward the upper end.</p>
          <p>One of the things we are not doing is we are not going to diminish our infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. So yes, we're going to try to move people. Yes, we're going to try to move equipment, but we are going to maintain our vast Gulf of Mexico facilities, lab, manufacturing, all of those facilities on the basis that the Gulf is going to come back, which we believe it will. And that will be part of the drag on earnings for a period of time. But in our view, when the Gulf comes up again, you're going to have to have that stuff in place. I'd just rather keep it and pay for it on an as-we-go basis than try to recalibrate it and reconstitute it at some point in time in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to be clear, the upper end of the range includes an anemic outlook for shallow water activity and virtually no deepwater activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the 8% is anemic shallow water, and the bottom of the range is a more robust shallow water environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's $0.05 to $0.08, of course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The lower of five and the higher of eight, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think it is interesting to note that we were mobilized last week on a shelf well construction project. So it's not &#x2013; it's by no means a trend, but it does indicate that we're starting to see some movement on the permitting front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and an unrelated follow-up. Can you provide some color on where you think the industry stands in the drill-to-hold acreage by production trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, there is no repository of this information, but the general information that we have from our own organization suggests that we saw a decline in Q1 in the overall position. Drill to hold &#x2013; the inventory of wells that is out there increased somewhat in Q2, and we expect to see a sharp increase in Q3 based on the information that we have, particularly Bakken and Eagle Ford. So we'll see that inventory continue to rise.</p>
          <p>With respect to drill and hold specifically, most of our customers really indicate to us they still have a fair amount of activity to take them through into 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think one other area that is pushing drilling that a lot of people have not focused on, and that is companies that are drilling with other people's money. And keep in mind that over the last year, a number of big US gas players have announced transactions with primarily outside of the US IOCs, and in some cases other money players to essentially have them carry their drilling programs for them. And I think that is actually going to also drive some additional drilling because the customers have the liquidity provided by others to be able to do so.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a quick follow-up here on once again that $0.05 to $0.08 impact in the third and fourth quarter. Do you think the increase in your North American land related business will fully, partially, or more than offset that $0.05 to $0.08 impact from the Gulf of Mexico in the second half of the year? Better activity, better pricing on North American land, is that going to offset that $0.05 to $0.08 cent number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kurt, this is Mark. I think as we look forward in terms of what the US business is doing that in the third quarter it seems like that US land will probably fully offset or at least get very close to fully offsetting the weakness in the Gulf. Fourth quarter, as we move into winter stips [stipulations] in our business, it might be a little less. But we're still very excited about what's happening on US land right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and then a question for Dave. In your discussions with your varying oil company customers, how do those customers handicap what the Gulf of Mexico could look like 12 months out? What kind of rules and regulations are they preparing for? And when are they &#x2013; when do they think that they're going to be able to start to ramp up their activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the discussions are many and the conclusions are varied I guess would be the best way to put it. I think that nobody believes that they will be out of business in the Gulf of Mexico let's say a year from now. I think one of the big concerns is going to be the ability to get the deepwater rigs to come back into the Gulf of Mexico market. If they're absorbed in other parts of the world &#x2013; remember, these things take a long time to drag out of the Gulf and halfway around the world. It's a lot of down time on those rigs. So the concern is the ability to get the rigs, bring them back in here, what is the insurance cost going to be, what are the new regulations going to be.</p>
          <p>So I would say that in the next 12 months that there's probably very little discussion taking place about the ability to ramp up to anywhere near the level that we were at. But if you look at the prospects, if you look at the reservoirs there, a number of the big IOCs are very heavily committed to the Gulf of Mexico, and they certainly will start up as fast as is practical after they get the go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, then my final follow-up here. Your reference on pricing, I was wondering if you just might be able &#x2013; fair to assume that pressure pumping has the best pricing dynamics at the moment. I'm just wondering what product lines have the least ability to get pricing at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly our stimulation business leads the pack in terms of pricing. I think the important thing really to understand here from our standpoint is the way we try and use our stimulation business to provide an integrated package of value proposition for our customers. Probably as we look across the board, clearly stimulation is at the high end. Directional drilling, drill bits, completions in the middle; and wireline probably is at the bottom end of the range in terms of pricing realization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But all product lines are getting some element of pricing at this point? Is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mark, can you give us an update on CapEx for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ole, we're still looking at approximately $2 billion, in that range, but -- the $2 billion range for total CapEx for the year. So that's still in line with the previous guidance at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And when you increased the previous guidance, it was because you saw some international projects from 2011 move to 2010, and it sounds like some of that is slipping a little bit again. So does this mean that you're tweaking your CapEx more in favor of North America stimulation at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think part of the increase the last time around was also an acceleration of some captive deliveries into the US market where we saw demand for things like pressure pumping equipment increasing. So that was serving to offset that, and I think that continues to be the case. Any kind of weakness that we might see in captive deliveries in international would be offset for deliveries for additional capacity in the US land.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you; Tim, second question to you. There has always been to me a somewhat bizarre relationship to psychology around international pricing relative to what's going on in the North American market. And right now clearly the North American market is divided between the very hot land market and the not so hot deepwater offshore market. So what are you seeing in terms of the psychological impact on overseas markets based on what's going on in the US at the moment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, international pricing is still very competitive, Ole. As you recall, we had a very active 2009 in terms of bidding processes as our customers took advantage of the changing dynamics in the industry. And those contracts clearly have come into play during the course of 2010. And as you would appreciate, there is some time between the ability to move those prices and the startup of those contracts.</p>
          <p>So I would say in general, international pricing is still quite challenging. There are a few areas that are a little brighter than others. But in general, that psychology if you like from the North America market is still prevailing in the international markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Tim. That sounds very similar to what you said last quarter, and yet you increased Middle East margins by 300 basis points and the rest of the Eastern Hemisphere by 100 basis points sequentially. So is there a volume effect here? What's going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think, Ole, one of the things is that once you get a handle on what your pricing dynamics are in the Eastern Hemisphere market, because of the longer-term nature of those contracts, it's easier to get your cost structure in line to support those contracts at what is a sufficient margin to take them on. As Tim said, in 2009, we were really dealing with a rapidly changing pricing environment. We really didn't have an idea where that was going to settle down, and therefore we did not do a lot of changing to our cost structure last year.</p>
          <p>Now that we know what these contracts are, what we've won, what the pricing is on them, we can make sure that our organization by country by product line is now aligned with supporting that contract but also being able to give us a chance to increase our margins going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes. I mean every quarter that's something that we work on and we try to focus on and sharpen up our operating capabilities by country at a lower cost.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just finally one more on Iraq. There have been a whole bunch of announcements over the past 24 hours with LUKOIL or BP and some very large headline numbers. Is this 2010, '11, or '12, or when should we expect that this will be a meaningful contributor for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think you should expect to see anything in 2010. We're in the back half of the year now. You see a lot of headline numbers. I saw the same ones you did. We're having the same discussions with a lot of these customers. It will take a while to get these contracts awarded. Typically then, they don't have startups for three to six months after award. So I would say that you'll see awards in 2010, probably costs and ramp-up in 2011 with some commensurate revenues, and then a more reasonable operating environment probably into 2012.</p>

          <p>The first question, talking about pressure pumping which we have at length already, but do you have any concerns? You said you were going to protect market share; any concerns so far in what you're seeing from your peers as far as new capacity additions? And then coupled with that, one of your peers obviously with the recent merger and then your other peer with a renewed focus on North America, are you seeing any change in their behavior specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think at this point in time, everybody appears to be acting pretty responsibly. We did work hard to increase our market share in the last downturn, and we believe we have. That market share is ours to keep, and we're going to bring the equipment in necessary to support it. We don't see anything happening right now which would let us conclude that there's a big wave of equipment coming into the North America market other than what an individual company believes is necessary to support their own market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good to know. And then finally &#x2013; and then another as a follow-up to Bill's question earlier in the call. He asked about where you expect to see stronger growth internationally. What markets outside of Mexico and Venezuela could see a slower recovery in the back half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which markets could be slower than expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You already touched on Mexico. I think that clearly North Africa, particularly Algeria, as Dave mentioned a little bit earlier, is somewhat of a concern, primarily because we see some shall we say slowness in decision making there, causing some holdup in overall activity. West Africa in general, there has been a little bit of a slowness there in terms of the mobilization of new contracts which we had expected to take place by now, though the full force of those I think will come in during the course of late 2010.</p>
          <p>Other than that, Angie, I don't have any specifics other than of course the North Sea continues to be a bit of a challenging chestnut here. Activity has been quite slow in the first half of the year. We have better expectations for the second half, but we've said that before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then finally just as a follow-up to that, do you think there is any risk to a push-out to the international recovery to 2011 given global economic conditions, the Gulf of Mexico, a little bit of nervousness by the IOCs, or do you think clearly the NOCs should start to pick up in Q4 and we'll see at least some of it this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, every indication at the present time is that, as Dave said in his comments, that we'll see a slightly slower rate of change in Q3 than we had originally expected, picking up momentum in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jim Crandell with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Dave, last cycle in US pressure pumping, there were shortages of equipment. Competitors built capacity, and you and your main competitors lost considerable market share, and I think you said you will not let that happen again. You seem to be more restrained on prices and seem to be planning to be more aggressive in adding equipment early on than you were last cycle. Am I assessing things correctly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Jim, one of the lessons we learned from the last time is that you can push pricing up so hard, so fast across all basins that you make it uneconomic for your customers to continue to drill. And once that cycle turns over, it can get pretty ugly, as we've seen.</p>
          <p>So as I indicated in my comments, we're trying to go basin by basin this time, work with our customers on understanding the returns they need and helping them understand the returns we need. And the returns we need sometimes are more about efficiency than they are about pricing. And so we're trying to do more of a rifle shot approach than a shotgun blast in the market. And we have a targeted market share that we have right now, and we are going to build equipment to meet that targeted market share. But we're not going to build any equipment beyond being able to do that. And I hope everybody else is equally responsible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on that last point you made, David, what do you see on that score today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see everybody being pretty responsible right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question is exclusive of Iraq, how active do you see bidding on IPMs [Integrated Project Management] in the second half and over the rest of the year? And specifically, where might that bidding activity occur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IPM market right now, if you look at the markets that were embracing IPM in a big way obviously were Iraq, a little bit in Saudi Arabia. As you know, we won the South Ghawar project, which by the way is going very, very well. And Algeria, and then of course Mexico is a story everybody knows about. Obviously the IPM day seems to be coming to an end in Mexico. Algeria, it's still a market that there's a lot of IPM activity in, but we have been successful, as have our competitor &#x2013; unsuccessful as have our competitors in getting extensions signed by Sonatrach on a lot of the existing ones. So that's out there as a market, but right now it's pretty slow in Algeria. Iraq will obviously be a big IPM market.</p>
          <p>But you see scatterings of it here and there, but it doesn't seem to be developing a big bow wave out in front of it right now. And I think that as commodity prices have stabilized, especially liquid commodity prices, I think you're seeing more and more of the standard type of contracts more than a reach for an IPM type of an engagement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, Dave, on Iraq, what would you &#x2013; do you think that all 11 or 12 sanctioned projects by the major oil companies will in fact be awarded this year? We've seen announcements, as was alluded to, on West Qurna and Majnoon and Zubair. But do you think that other companies like PETRONAS and Gazprom, do you think that all 12 will go forward with contract awards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think all 12 will get done this year for a couple reasons. One, our service industry capacity to handle all that is going to be stretched with just some of the major initial big ones. Number two, I think our customers are finding it may be more difficult than anticipated to get a tender award through the national oil company approval process, which all of them are required to do in Iraq. And therefore, I don't &#x2013; you will see the major ones awarded this year, but you definitely will not see them all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And would you expect to see, Dave, the bidding for the first on Rumaila one wasn't so hot. Do you think that the bidding will be reflective of the fact that capacity is going to be tight as we get into the second half of the year and we hopefully will see better margins and pricing on future contracts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>We'll take one more caller.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question comes from Stephen Gengaro with Jefferies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Good morning, gentlemen; just a quick follow-up on North America, if you don't mind. Over the last six months, we have certainly been surprised by the pace of utilization increases. And can you highlight, if you will, the areas where that has been maybe the strongest and the biggest surprise to you? And then second, when you look at the market now, do you feel like the benefits of being big in North America are improving because of that versus a couple years ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly the benefits of being big, we believe in it. And when we say big, I mean to have the ability to bring multiple product lines to a customer offering and have one pull through the other. So I think that being integrated and having multiple product lines is certainly working to our advantage.</p>
          <p>If you look at why the sudden increase in capacity, one, we have been talking for a number of quarters about the higher horsepowers that are needed to frac these shale plays. You now need to show up on a major shale play 40,000 horsepower just to ante into the game. And if you look at the average horsepower per job all the way across the US, it has doubled in the last 6 to 12 months. So not every job takes 40,000 horsepower, but the average job in North America has doubled its horsepower utilization. So that in itself is absorbing a lot of the industry capacity.</p>
          <p>The more aggressive horizontal drilling, especially in some of the hard to drill hotter shale plays are eating drilling tools up. The higher horsepower, higher flow rates on the fracing is eating frac equipment up. It's eating drill bits up. And so the nature of the drilling, the more difficult type of situations, and the higher horsepower needs all are increasing the demand for what you have to show up with on the job, and it's also consuming that equipment a lot more quickly. And that in itself, as we have said in prior quarters, we thought would help balance out the supply and demand of equipment in the US, and I think that has turned out to be a dead-on call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that phenomenon is obviously pretty sticky versus normal cyclical dips and peaks?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
