          <p>Great day, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to the Ford conference call.  My name is Katina and I will be your coordinator for today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to our host, Mr. David Dickinson, Fixed Income Investor Relations Manager.  Please proceed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast.  On behalf of the entire Ford management team I would like to thank you for spending time with us.  Our speakers this morning are Peter Daniel, Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, K.R. Kent, Ford Credit Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, and Neil Schloss, Ford Vice President and Treasurer.  We do have some other members of management who are joining us for the call, including David Brandeis, Assistant Treasurer, Scott Stewart, Assistant Treasurer, and Mark Kasman, Director of Accounting.</p>
          <p>Before I hand the call over to Peter, I would like to review a couple of quick items.  A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we will be using today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's Investor and Media websites for your reference.  The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis.  Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q for the second quarter.  Additionally, the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis.  Any non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to their GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.  Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance.  Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here.  Additional information about the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation.  These risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-Ks.  With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Ford's Senior Vice President and Controller, Peter Daniel.  Peter?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave.  I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results for the second quarter on slide one.  During the second quarter we completed sale of Jaguar/Land Rover, and as discussed in April we've excluded its results from continuing operations in 2008.  Shown on the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales last quarter were about 1.6 million units, down 212,000 from the same period in 2007.  This reduction includes 78,000 Jaguar/Land Rover and Aston Martin units.  Ongoing company revenue was $38.6 billion, excluding Jaguar/Land Rover from 2007 data, revenue was down slightly with lower volume, adverse product mix and lower net pricing, partly offset by favorable exchange.  Pre-tax results from continuing operations were a loss of one billion, 1.5 billion lower than a year ago.  This reduction included about one billion in Automotive and about 500 million at Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter net loss was 8.7 billion, including about $8 billion of pre-tax special charges, primarily related to non-cash impairment charges that I will discuss shortly.  This primarily reflects the impact on both automotive and credit company of the tremendous shift in demand in the US market away from large trucks and SUVs. We entered the quarter with 26.6 billion of cash, down 10.8 billion from a year ago.  This reduction in part reflects implementation of the initial part of our retiree health care agreement with the UAW, as well as our planned payment of subvention payments upfront to Ford Credit.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide two, which covers special items in the second quarter. On this slide we will cover the 426 million of pre-tax charges excluding impairments.  I'll address the impairments on the next slide.  We recorded a net charge of 274 million associated with personnel separation programs in North America, largely related to the early programs in the US.  In addition, there was a gain of 100 million <mark type="inaudible" /> related to the North American early separation programs.  We have recognized a charge of 303 million primarily associated with the sale of our ACH Glass Operations during the second quarter.  And the 75 million for Jaguar/Land Rover reflects an operating profit through the closing date of June 2, partly offset by a loss on sale.</p>
          <p>Slide three provides details on the asset impairment which in total represent a non-cash pre-tax charge of 7.6 billion.  Note these charges have no impact on access to our credit lines or overall liquidity. The pronounced shift in consumer preferences away from full-size pickups and traditional SUVs to smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles has caused us to review the fair value of our long-life automotive assets in North America, and we have determined that the future discounted cash flows generated by those assets was lower than their carrying value.  As a result we recorded a pre-tax non-cash charge of 5.3 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The consumer shifts mentioned above coupled with reduced overall demand for vehicles in North America has also caused significant reduction in second quarter auction values of used full-size pickups and traditional SUVs.  Ford Credit reviewed its US and Canada operating lease portfolio and determined that lease-end residual values would be significantly lower than previously expected resulting in an impairment; and K.R. will cover this more in detail shortly.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter results also include a charge of 214 million representing the impact on Ford of a goodwill impairment related to Mazda dealerships in Japan.  Slide four shows our Automotive cash and cash flow.  We ended the second quarter with 26.6 billion in gross cash.  Our operating related cash flow was 3.1 billion negative in the second quarter, reflecting an Automotive pre-tax loss of 700 million.  Capital spending during the quarter was 100 million, higher than depreciation and amortization.  Changes in working capital and other items of 1.5 billion negative &#x2013; this is more than explained by working capital changes that are expected to be temporary in nature.  And payments of 800 million to Ford Credit, reflecting that change to upfront payment of subvention.  Excluding the upfront subvention payments, our operating cash flow was 2.3 billion negative.  Separation programs resulted in an outflow of 200 million for the quarter, and we contributed 200 million to our non-US pension funds.</p>
          <p>Ford Credit did not pay Ford a dividend during the second quarter.  And net of pension contributions, we received 1.7 billion from the sale of Jaguar/Land Rover.  Including all of these impacts the total decline in gross cash during the second quarter was 2.1 billion.  Slide five summarizes our net liquidity.  Total liquidity including available credit lines was 38.2 billion.  As I mentioned earlier, the asset impairments did not effect the access to our secured credit facility.</p>
          <p>Automotive debt was 26.5 billion.  Upon implementation of the independent VEBA, debt will increase by about 6.3 billion.  And we have less than 3 billion of maturities in the next three years.  Now on to slide six, which shows where we are on our planning assumptions and operational metrics for 2008.  Total industry during the first half we'll speak to was 15.1 million units in the US and 17.5 million units in Europe.  Based on continued decline in economic conditions in the US market we now expect that the industry will be lower than the outlook that we communicated previously.  We are now projecting total industry, including medium and heavy trucks, to be in the range of 14 to 14.5 million units for the full year.  We are also seeing some softness in several European markets.  And we are now projecting that industry volumes will be between 17.2 to 17.4 million units for the full year.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, our current model quality continues to improve and the initial quality of the Ford brand in the US improved at a faster rate than the industry average based on the most recent J.D. Power survey.  Automotive costs have improved 2.7 billion through the first half, which was a little better than our plan.  US market share for the first half was 14.7, down seven tenths of a point from the same period a year ago.  We presently project that our share will further decline in the second half due to continued vehicle segmentation shifts away from areas where our share has been high.</p>
          <p>Absolute operating cash flow during the first half was 4.8 billion negative.  This was higher than planned and we expect the full year net outflow to be worse than previously projected.  Capital expenditures through the first half were 2.9 billion, in line with our plan and full-year outlook.  Overall, as communicated previously, we now expect 2008 operating and overall results to be worse than comparable 2007 levels.  With that, I'll turn you over to K.R.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter.  Slide seven shows Ford Credit's operating results and key metrics for the second quarter of 2008.  As shown in the top left box, our second quarter pre-tax loss was $2.4 billion compared with 112 million pre-tax profit in the second quarter of 2007.  This quarter's loss includes a 2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge for certain operating leases in the US and Canada.  And I'll speak more about the impairment charge on the next slide.</p>
          <p>In the lower left box, our second quarter pre-tax loss, excluding the impairment for operating leases was $294 million, down 406 million from the second quarter 2007.  You can see in the right box our June 30, 2008 managed receivables were 140 billion.  This is about nine billion lower than a year ago, and about eight billion lower than the first quarter.  The $9 billion decline in receivables was due primarily to lower North American receivables, the impact of divestitures and the impairment charge for operating leases, offset partially by changes in currency exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Charge-offs for managed receivables in the second quarter were $254 million.  And the worldwide managed loss to receivables was 70 basis points, up substantially from last year.  I'll speak more about this as well in a few minutes.  At June 30, the allowance for credit losses for on-balance sheet receivables was $1.5 billion or 108 basis points of receivables.  This was up about 300 million from the first quarter, and up about 500 million from a year ago.  Also at June 30, our managed leverage was 10-1 compared with 10.6 to one at June 30, 2007, and below our 2008 originally planned leverage target of 11.5 to one.</p>
          <p>At the end of second quarter our equity was over $12 billion.  Further, we did not pay a dividend to Ford in the second quarter of 2008 and we do not plan to pay a dividend for the remainder of 2008.  In addition, we did not request a second quarter payment from Ford under the terms of the profit maintenance agreement.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide eight, during the second quarter we experienced a significant decline in used vehicle auction values, particularly on full-size pickup trucks and SUVs.  I'm sure many of you have been tracking its declines through some of the monthly reporting in the industry such as the Manheim index.  Higher fuel prices and the weakness in the economy has accelerated the shift to smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles.  This demand shift has manifested itself in the auction market with lower prices on many of the larger vehicles as well as some strength in the smaller cars.  As part of the our review of the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation at the end of the second quarter, we have included a $2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge on some of our vehicle lines by reducing the carrying value for these vehicles from $11.5 billion to $9.4 billion.</p>
          <p>At the end of the second quarter our net investment in operating leases was $26.6 billion.  The impairment charge is essentially a recognition that the carrying value of our US and Canadian operating lease portfolio at the end of the second quarter would have been higher than the expected discounted future cash inflows related to certain vehicle lines.  The impairment was primarily related to full-size pickup trucks and traditional SUVs.</p>
          <p>Slide nine explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax results for the second quarter of 2008 compared to the second quarter of 2007.  Excluded above is a 2.1 billion pre-tax impairment charge for the operating leases I discussed.  As previously mentioned, Ford Credit's pre-tax loss was $294 million in the second quarter, about $400 million lower than in 2007.  The decrease in earnings primarily reflected higher depreciation expense for leased vehicles and higher provision for credit losses.  These factors were offset partially by the non-recurrence of net losses related to market valuation adjustments from derivatives, higher financing margin, the gain related to the sale of about half of our ownership interest in our Nordic operations, and lower operating costs.</p>
          <p>To be clear, a large portion of the decline in auction prices has three impacts to our profitability.  The first is in our operating results for vehicles sold at auction in the second quarter, and that's included in lease residual on the slide.  The second is on the credit losses reflecting higher severities and the implications to the reserves included in the credit loss on the slide.  And the third is the impairment itself of the leases in our portfolio at the end the quarter, reflecting expected future auction prices.  In addition to the impact of the auction market decline, US delinquencies and repossessions have increased since last year, which I will cover as well today.  In summary, the impairment charge, lease residual deterioration and over half of the credit loss deterioration is primarily attributable to the significant decline in the auction prices for used vehicles in the US and Canada, resulting in a loss for our North American segment.  Consistent with last year, however, our international segment, which is primarily Europe, was profitable in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We do expect Ford Credit to lose money in the second half of this year, about the same or better than the $262 million we lost in the first half.  Slide ten shows quarterly trends of charge-offs and loss to receivables ratios for our on balance sheet and managed portfolios.  The top left box shows loss to receivable ratios for the worldwide portfolio.  The top right box shows loss to receivable ratios for the US, Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and lease business.  Both the on balance sheet and the managed loss to receivable ratios are up in the second quarter of 2008 from a year ago levels, reflecting primarily higher severity per unit and higher repossessions in the US retail and lease portfolio.  About half of the year over year increase is primarily attributable to the significant decline in auction prices for used vehicles.</p>
          <p>Second quarter 2008 worldwide loss to receivable ratios shown in the top left box were up from first quarter, primarily reflecting the higher severity in the US and higher losses and lower recoveries in our international regions, offset partially by fewer repossessions.  Shown in the top right box, the higher loss to receivables ratio in the second quarter compared to the first quarter for 2008 for Ford, Lincoln and Mercury in the US primarily reflects the higher severity, offset partially by fewer repossessions.  Consistent with this, managed charge-offs in the second quarter 2008 were $254 million, up 115 million from a year ago &#x2013; again, reflecting primarily the increased severity per unit, higher repossession, and other charge in the US retail and leased portfolio, as well as higher international losses.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the US Ford, Lincoln and Mercury retail and leased business.  Repossessions in the second quarter were 18,000 units which was up 2,000 units from the second quarter of 2007, and down 2,000 units from the first quarter of 2008.  Severity of $10,000 in the second quarter is $3,000 higher than last year, primarily due to the auction market weakness.  Along with an increase in the amount financed as well as a higher mix of 72-month contracts.  Severity is $1,200 higher than first quarter 2008, reflecting the same factors.  Over 60-day delinquencies totaled 20 basis points in the second quarter, down two basis points from the first quarter of 2008.  Although still very low and within our expectations, delinquencies are up five basis points from last year.</p>
          <p>Bankruptcy filings totaled 9,000 in the second quarter, up 2,000 compared with the second quarter of 2007, and up 1,000 from first quarter of 2008.  Bankruptcy filings continue to be at a very low level but are increasing.  The credit quality of our portfolio is very good.  We continue to closely monitor our key loss metrics as mentioned above for any additional deterioration related to broader trends in the economy.</p>
          <p>On slide 12 it shows the lease residual performance for Ford and Lincoln Mercury US brands.  These return volumes totaled 43,000 units in the second quarter, down 5,000 compared with the second quarter of 2007.  Return rates were up six points to 87%.  Again, consistent with the auction values that were lower than expected at the time of contract purchase and a general shift in consumer preference away from full-size trucks and SUVs.  In the second quarter, auction values for 24 and 36 month lease vehicles at constant mix were down on average about $2,700 per unit and $2,400 per unit respectively from a year ago level, primarily reflecting the weakness in the auction market &#x2013; particularly with the full-sized pickup trucks and SUVs.  For the same reason auction values were also down for both terms compared with the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Our worldwide net investment and operating leases was 26.6 billion at June 30, down about 2.8 billion compared with the first quarter 2008, primarily reflecting the impairment that we took in the second quarter.  With that I will turn it over to Neil.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, K.R. Slide 13 shows trends in funding for our managed receivables.  As K.R. mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, managed receivables were 140 billion, down 7 billion from year-end 2007.  Our year-end 2008 managed receivables forecast is in the range of 130 to 135 billion.  We ended the quarter with 19.6 billion in cash, including 5.4 billion to support on-balance sheet securitizations.  Our year-end forecast for cash remains in the 13 to 16 billion range, which will provide us flexibility going forward.  Securitized funding was 55% of managed receivables at the end of the second quarter.  We would expect the securitized funding levels will be in the range of 52 to 54% at year end.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 14:  Ford Credit's funding strategy includes maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations by having a substantial cash balance and committed funding capacity with eligible assets available for funding.  We plan to continue to diversify our global asset-backed funding capabilities and renew global asset-backed funding capacity.  This includes maintaining a diversity of liquidity providers.</p>
          <p>We will continue to explore and execute alternative business and financing arrangements in those locations where we lack diverse funding capability while also ensuring that Ford has continued support in these markets if needed.  And as K.R. previously mentioned, another recent example of this was the June sale of about half of our ownership in certain Nordic operations in order to get committed, lower cost funding for these locations.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows our term funding plan for Ford Credit, which does not include our short-term funding programs, asset sales to our on-balance sheet asset-backed commercial programs or proceeds from revolving transactions.  For 2008 our public term funding plans are in the range of 13 to 18 billion, consisting of 12 to 15 billion of public securitizations and up to three billion of unsecured debt.  Year-to-date we have completed 11 billion of public term funding transactions in the U.S. and in Germany, including a 5.4 billion US retail transaction and a 1.1 billion unsecured transaction, both of which were completed in May.  As shown at the bottom of the page we have substantial private funding sources in addition to the public markets.  These are largely asset-backed securitization programs for retail, lease and wholesale assets, in various countries around the world.</p>
          <p>This private funding provides us flexibility in executing our funding plan.  For 2008 we are forecasting 12 to 18 billion of private funding.  Year to date we have completed 11 billion, including retail, lease and wholesale asset-backed securitization transactions.  Through June 30 we have completed in total 22 billion or about two-thirds of our 2008 term funding plan.  And we will discuss the renewal our committed capacity on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 details our liquidity programs and unitization.  The top box shows Ford Credit's committed capacity in our liquidity programs which include unsecured credit lines, FCAR lines, an unrated notes facility and conduit capacity.  The unrated note facility is committed to fund multiple asset classes including US lease.  As of June 30, we have 74 billion of capacity in cash.  At June 30 we had 54 billion of committed.  Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was 60.8 billion, of which 37.8 billion was utilized, leaving 23 billion available for use given our present level of eligible receivables.  This is down about a billion from the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Most of our available liquidity is in bank-sponsored conduits which are accessible within two days and in cash.  Our cash that is not related to securitization totaled 14.2 billion at the end of the quarter.  In addition to the 23 billion of liquidity that we have available for use we also have 7.8 billion of excess capacity which provides an incremental funding source for future origination, and gives us flexibility to effectively and efficiently shift capacity to jurisdictions and asset classes where they can be used.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date June we successfully renewed about 16 billion or about 90% of our committed capacity that came due.  And this included our 364-day FCAR commitments.  Of the 54 billion of total committed capacity we have about one-quarter remaining to be renewed this year.</p>
          <p>So in summary, slide 17, Ford Motor Company had a pre-tax loss excluding special items of 1 billion.  Special items were 8 billion including 7.6 billion of asset impairments.  Automotive cash at quarter end remains strong at 26.6 billion.  Cash together with available credit lines provided total Automotive liquidity of 38.2 billion.  For Ford Credit, pre-tax loss was 294 million excluding the impairments.  The charge for the impairment of US and Canadian operating leases for certain vehicles was an additional 2.1 billion.  Ford Credit's pre-tax loss in total was 2.4 billion and a net loss of 1.4 billion.  Ford Credit has completed 22 billion of its term funding year to date, about two-thirds of our plan.  Ford Credit's liquidity remains strong with available liquidity for use of 23 billion and committed asset-back funding capacity beyond our present needs.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Dave to start the Q&amp;A session.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Your first question comes from the line of Eric Selle representing J.P. Morgan.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  Looking at just a couple of things.  Looking at slide eight, I believe it is.  I'm having to go back.  People are pinging me right now.  But looking at the lease write down, you listed about 11 billion &#x2013; 11.5 billion of carrying value.  Is that 11.5 billion the amount of truck carrying value; and does that incorporate your whole $30 billion book?  I mean I guess what I'm asking is that 11.5 billion, should we assume a third of your lease book is trucks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Eric, let me see how best to explain this.  The carrying value of $11.5, that would have been the carrying value in our operating leases had we not done the impairment.  So we ended up doing the impairment, taking down to 9.4 out of the 26.6 billion in total that we have at the end of the second quarter.  When you get behind the details of the vehicle lines that were impaired, we did go through an analysis that looked at the individual vehicle line, both in the US and Canada to make the determination if it was necessary for an impairment.  And many of the vehicles primarily as I mentioned, pickup trucks and full-size trucks, were the ones that needed to be impaired.  There were some cars and some crossovers that were impaired as well.  But out of the total 2.1 billion, a little less than 85% were trucks and SUVs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok.  That is fair enough.  And then, you know, looking forward into Q3, we obviously saw a jump in delinquencies and losses last year, primarily, I think, driven by some of the prime mortgage problems we had last summer trickling into autos.  And if you flash forward to this year, we definitely have a back-to-school spending, which is a seasonal effect.  Plus you've got the back draft of the relief checks.  Do you expect to see similar delinquency and loss rate jump Q2 to Q3 that we saw last year or do you think we've incorporated most of it into the current numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the seasonality goes, there generally is a bit of seasonality that goes through the delinquencies and the like.  Whether it's as large as it was last year because it's kind of when things started to really pop in the marketplace, I'm not sure it will be as large as it was last year.  I do think it will be up compared to last year though.  When I said as large as last year I'm talking about the change between third and second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So we shouldn't see that same jump, but we will have a seasonality factor?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure if we will see it or not.  I would kind of be surprised but I think we will see a number that is higher than what we experienced last year for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, on slide 15, your funding plan has shifted around a little bit.  I think it's gone down a little bit.  Is the shift towards public and away from private merely because of your successful public transaction in the second quarter?  Or could I read into this and say, you know, the private demand is a little bit less than we expected.</p>

          <p>No.  I think there are two factors.  One, as you've mentioned, the $5.5 billion asset backed transaction in the unsecured deal we did in May.  But also the fact that our forecast for year-end receivables has dropped.  We're down now to 130 to 135 where at the first quarter we were at 130 to 140.</p>

          <p>Okay.  And if I could slide in one more question.  You guys on the auto side have a 5 to $6 billion, you know, restructuring charge from '07 to '09.  I think a lot of people wonder -- that leaves kind of like a $2 billion restructuring in the year of '09 if you do the delta between what you guys have done in '07 and '08.  I've gotten a lot of questions.  And I pose to you.  That $2 billion, is that buying back dealerships?  Is that another attrition program?  We really haven't identified what that's for.  Or is that going to help out with the truck to cars transition?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.  I understand that you guys chose not to ask Ford for the cash back under the profit maintenance agreement.  If you guys got into third quarter or fourth quarter for any reason and you found out that the funding that you expected wasn't there and you needed that liquidity, can you look back and ask them for it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think at this point in time based on our leverage where we're at as well as our funding plan, and as well as where we are on liquidity that we would be in a position where we'd have to ask for something on the profit maintenance agreement.  The profit maintenance agreement is still in effect.  It has not been canceled.  It was just a matter of that we took a look at where we were in the end of the second quarter.  Where we were projected to be at the end of the year on our liquidity, our leverage, and it was decided that it was not actually needed to request the payment under the profit maintenance agreement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The profit maintenance agreement &#x2013; the agreement itself is still in effect.  In order to get payment under the agreement, Ford Credit needs to make a demand to the auto company for a payment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok.  And then on the losses &#x2013; I imagine you guys have a lot of historical data in terms of delinquencies.  Is it the severities that are kind of catching you off guard?  And what is your expectation for the second half of 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sarah, in total for the losses, like the LTRs, for example, we are seeing an increase in delinquencies.  We are seeing an increase in the repo ratio as we showed on slide 11 as compared to last year.  The real thing that's really hitting the charge-offs is the severity.  That's been increasing dramatically.  And in the second quarter, I mentioned that it was up to $10,000 which was about $3,000 higher than last year.  And if you break down that $3,000, roughly $2,400 of that is the auction market itself.  The one thing that does happen with our vehicles, whether they're repossessed or they come back off lease is that they will go through the auction market.  There generally is a clearing price in the auction market.  And so what you see is the weakness on the trucks and the SUVs coming through.  And as I mentioned, we have seen, for example, the Focus is actually doing better this year compared to last year.  So you see a strength in like some of the small cars but a lot of weakness in the trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you took this charge, is that assuming that severities stay where they are right now or is that expecting them to get worse?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the severity goes, we did increase our credit loss reserve this year, taking into account that the severities have grown rather dramatically.  It will probably be a little bit higher than the 10,000 in the second quarter for a while.  But to give you perspective, the way we were thinking about the auction market itself is that we saw the deteriorations through the end of June from the beginning of April, for example.  Then when we did our accounting for the close, we were projecting that there might be a little bit more deterioration for a time and then kind of recover back to, say, a June level for a longer term outlook.  And really why I talk about the longer term outlook, because we have leases out there for 24, 36, and even up to 48 months up in Canada.  So it really depends on when the economy is going to recover.  So with the expectation that the economy is not going to recover for a while or at least not until 2010 or so, we thought it was prudent to project the auction values fairly flat.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions.  First one is on slide 16.  Regarding the various liquidity programs in place.  I think it was mentioned on the call that about a quarter of the committed capacity is still up for renewal this year.  Can you help us put that into a couple of the buckets up there, how much of that might be the FCAR lines, how much conduits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The bulk is in the conduits box.  The FCAR lines were all renewed in the second quarter; the ones that were coming due in 2008.  So the bulk is in the conduit section and the majority of those are in retail assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you comment on how difficult you think that's going to be to renew that capacity and what's your expectation?  Do you think you can get about 90% of that, or should we think that it's going to be more difficult than the lines you've been able to obtain to date?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess our best judgment today is you know, the first half was &#x2013; in the environment, the funding environment, given the capital markets &#x2013; this was not an easy market at all.  And we were pretty successful getting the 90% done.  And given the makeup of what we've got coming due, we're very confident in our ability to renew the majority of what's in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And another question on the impairment charges and just the overall increased depreciation.  My question is, what are the measurement dates for those calculations?  I want to understand how much of the risk is incorporated, are auction values, in other words, incorporated through the end of the quarter or is there kind of an April or a May cutoff date where those calculations were performed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Jim.  To give you perspective, because we had seen a large decline in April followed by another large decline in May, normally we would have completed our adequacy study, you know, the back half of June.  But we actually delayed it a little bit this year this quarter.  And we took into account in our adequacy study auction values all the way up through the end of June.  So we actually had the actual results through June to help us do our adequacy study.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can, I want to give you one bit of perspective on this.  As I mentioned, we only impair a certain portion of our vehicles, individual vehicle lines, which effectively pulls ahead a bunch of the depreciation into the second quarter.  There were still a lot of vehicle lines that had a decline in the auction values but they will still follow the standard process that we have where the A.S.D. &#x2013; the accumulated supplemental depreciation &#x2013; will still build for the future.  So I don't want to leave anybody the impression that depreciation has been reduced dramatically.  There are still a number of vehicle lines that will have higher depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that will come in the form of just higher depreciation, period to period as opposed to additional impairment charges, I would assume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.  The impairment charge was basically driven by under accounting standards an event.  And there was what we considered an event in the second quarter with the dramatic decline.  It would have to be another major decline to have an event again.  So going forward, assuming that doesn't happen, and we don't believe it will, it would just be our standard accumulated supplemental depreciation approach, which does an adequacy view every quarter and determines what we think the final auction prices will be; and then we depreciate to that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  One final one:  This one should be a softball question, but I actually get it a lot and I want to make sure I'm calibrated correctly.  with regard to the former cash flow guidance which I think was in the negative 14 to $16 billion range from '07 to '09, am I correct in assuming that the comparable number plan-to-date, so I'm going to include full year '07 plus the first half of this year, is a burn of 4.2 billion?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  The previous operating-related cash flow guidance I believe was 14 to 16 billion and I think you've pulled that since the end of May.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>16 plus, right, right.  Okay.  And what I'm asking is, so that I'm calibrated correctly, what is the comparable number plan-to-date?  Meaning '07 and first half of 2008.  If I look at slide four, see a negative 4.6 billion for the first half of the year.  I think that number was slightly positive for 2007.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, guys.  Question &#x2013; not to beat up on this but just to try to get around this a little better.  With respect to the timing and the measurement dates on when you look at this with the leases, maybe you could put it in perspective.  How do you guys look &#x2013; in the past the automotive lease guide was used by some of us just to get a gauge for where residual values should be.  I know in the past one of your competitors would take 90% of what A.L.G. has.  Can you tell us, maybe, a little bit about, you know, where you stand relative to, say, where A.L.G. would be?  Are you taking 80% of what A.L.G. looks at?  Try to give us some assurance or idea as to how conservative this $2.1 billion write-down actually is.  And I just had two other quick questions after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brian. As far as our process on the adequacy study, we actually as part of our process send out our lease vehicles to A.L.G. and get a -- their version of the mark for those vehicles.  That's one of our data inputs into our study.  Now, unfortunately we do that typically about the middle of the second month of the quarter.  So that was done in mid May, call it.  So by the time we get to the end of June and end of June, it was substantial different.  And we're substantially below what that level is.  My understanding is that A.L.G. is about to come out with their latest &#x2013; I can't remember what month they call it.  They have a title for it.  About to come out with the new one.  I have not seen those ones yet.  But I know we're substantially below what we had in mid-May which is pretty obvious based on where the auction prices dropped after mid-May.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I had just a follow up question on the support agreement.  I was curious as to why you would have -- it would have been invoked in Q1 but not Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question, Monica.  Basically in the first quarter we had the view that we would not need the profit maintenance agreement for the full year in 2008.  And because of that view it was seen as we should probably follow the agreement, go ahead and demand the payment in the first quarter and then pay it back at the end of the year.  Then as we got toward the end of the second quarter, and into our results for the second quarter, with the huge impairment we took a look at it and came to a different conclusion based on our leverage and our liquidity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And do you still have a target &#x2013; should leverage be hovering around here for the rest of the year?  I know you had said your initial target was 11.5.  Now you're at 10.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We started the year targeting that our leverage would end up at the end of the year about 11.5 to one based on where we thought liquidity and what support we might need to support the balance sheet. That was seen below the riskiness of the assets were or are, which is a little bit higher leverage that you could have.  But the reality is where we ended up now is we're at about 10 to one today.  We don't plan to pay a dividend in 2008.  As well as we also talked about that our second quarter results would effectively be about the same or slightly better than 262 million pre-tax loss on an operating basis in the first half the of year.  So you can kind of calculate it out and our leverage coupled with decline in receivables will result in slightly better than 10 to one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you talked about you had a view in terms of severity and how you were thinking about depreciation of the residuals going forward that it would for a time worsen and then it would get back sort of June levels.  For what time period do you think it's going to be worsening?  To the end of '08?  And how much worse do you think it could get in that interim period where you sort of assume that it resumes back to the June levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Quarter two on average was about $10,000.  The end of June or the month of June was more like 10,500 to 10,600.  I could see it creeping up to about 11 &#x2013; and for most of the rest of the year.  Although I will admit we have seen some firmness in the auction market over the last few weeks through July, which wasn't exactly in my expectations.  Normally as a model year gets older, the worst selling time for a used vehicles in a model year is the end of the model year which is the summer months.  But we have seen, for example, F-Series have improved over the last few weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one question:  Is there any way to help us think about what the timing of the cash impact of the residual write-down could be?  How should we think about how that rolls out?  And do you have the percentage in the lease book of what's SUVs and pickups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed the second part of your question, Monica.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have in terms of a breakdown for us in the lease book what percentage of the lease book currently that is on the books is SUVs and pickups?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  As far as the cash flow goes, it ends up being an average life.  We're doing 24 and 36-month leases for the most part.  It will just be pretty much spread over the life of the remaining lease portfolio.  So it's not anything magical about the cash flow that will impact it.  Obviously it is at the end of each lease.  When we did our impairment, for example, we did the F-Series.  It was all F-Series, all terms for both US and Canada.  So it's over time that it all comes back through the cash flow.</p>
          <p>As far as the portion of the portfolio, let's see &#x2013; the portfolio, at the end of the second quarter.  This is for a Ford Lincoln Mercury US was about 48% cars and crossover vehicles, 52% trucks and SUVs.  And to put that into perspective as we talk about the market moving a bit.  You go back one year, the same portfolio or the same mix was 34% cars and crossovers and 66% trucks and SUVs.  There's been a lot of movement away from the trucks and SUVs in our lease portfolio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys.  It looks like Ford unit volume was down about 17% in North America.  I look at slide nine, your volume year over year is flat as far as contribution. I'm wondering, how did originations look?  And why is the unit volume flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's another good question.  You look at on year over year basis, the volume which is measured off the receivables came down $9 billion from 149 to 140.  And essentially what happened are a number of elements in that.  One is, I mentioned, we did the joint venture for our Nordic market.  Our Nordic markets in Europe which effectively took out about $2 billion of receivables.  That happened on June 30.  So you're not going to see much of a volume decline because it happened literally the last day of the month.</p>
          <p>The second one is the $2 billion impairment which reduces your receivables.  The third one is Japan, where we sold off Japan &#x2013; our portfolio in Japan at the beginning of the second quarter, which is roughly about $2 billion of receivables itself.  We weren't making very much money in Japan so there's not much of a volume implication on that one.  And then finally, it's all other, which ends up being US operations having volumes down, offset by a little exchange from the other operations.  I think when the final calculation was even though we show it as a zero I think it was 21 to $25 million in volume decline for the quarter.</p>

Is there any shot of some flexibility to not require the five billion that they have promised if the cash flow at Ford gets worse?  I was wondering if there is some flexibility built in there, in the agreement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The basic agreement, basic understanding is that Ford will pay the subvention upfront.  It's included both in our plans as well as in Ford's plans as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Then finally, it looks like second half performance could potentially be better than first half.  Which in this market seems &#x2013; that would be great.  How would that be driven?  What would get it better than the first half?  Because it seems like things are getting worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what I was trying to point out when I was talking about second half results and that's the credit losses and the lease residual decline in the auction market &#x2013; their implications.  Because the impairment itself is actually the charge for the future auction returns after the end of June.  So there was already a large penalty in the second quarter associated with that.  So when you take out the impairment itself for the second half, we would expect residual losses and the provision for credit losses to improve a bit from what we saw in the second quarter, specifically.  Primarily reflecting the pull ahead of the depreciation associated with the impairment as well as a lower build of the credit loss reserve associated with the increasing severity.  Then offsetting those improvements, there will be a little bit of a decline in volume from the lower receivable levels.  There is a non-repeat of one-time gains associated with the divestitures of Japan and/or the Nordic markets which was roughly 85 million.  Then we get a little contingency as well to cover other impacts or other uncertainties, because we get some volatility associated with FAS-133 for example.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I was just wondering if we could get a little bit of color on FCE for the first half since we haven't really seen any numbers since the annual report.  I know people over here are looking at the same things that you guys lay out here.  So just residual value trends, delinquencies, particularly for the UK, Spain, and also just any change in funding plans.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as FCE itself goes, FCE proper, I guess, they will show obviously the gain from the Nordic market JV &#x2013; the 85 million &#x2013; a large portion of that.  Another piece is the large foreign currency translation adjustment.  But I think &#x2013; I'm going off memory here a little bit, Stephanie.  I apologize.  Their profitability, while still strong will be slightly down year over year.  They are facing a few headwinds, I'll call it.  And especially weakness in certain countries like Italy, as well as Spain, they're starting to see a little bit of weakness in those areas, for credit losses.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I think one other point on the FCE business is they don't -- you mentioned residuals.  They don't have the same lease product as we have here.  So the risk associated with the returned vehicles is not a problem for FCE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They do have a lease product.  But the returns -- the way the product structured, the returns are less than 3%, 5%, in that range.  It's very small.  Not like what the product is in the US.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Randy Gaul, representing Muzinich.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi.  Thanks.  Just had a question on the &#x2013; if I take out the $2,086,000 of the impairment then the depreciation on the leased vehicles for the second quarter is basically $2.084 billion or so.  And relative versus 1.8 billion in the last quarter.  If I want to be sure I understand you correctly, what you're saying is the impairment was basically on the cars &#x2013; or on the trucks, large trucks and SUVs; so that increase in the rest of the depreciation was on the rest of the assets that didn't take a one-time impairment charge.  Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, Randy.  Yes, let me be a little clearer on that.  I'll give you an example.  The F-Series.  Some of that depreciation in the second quarter increases because the F-Series that did return came in at a lower auction value than we had expected.  But the impairment would only pick up F-Series that will plan to terminate after June 30.  So you'll see an increase in the second quarter for depreciation for the large drop-off in auction prices for the vehicles that terminated and then were sold through auctions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  A couple of questions on the accounting aspects:  First of all, was Ford required to take this write-down?  My understanding of the standard is that the impairment is determined to exist if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the assets.  Is that correct?  And if so was that a requirement by the accountant standards or did you just choose to do that because you thought that was an appropriate thing to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll speak for the credit company.  It's the same thing for the auto company as well.  It's a couple of tests that you have to go through.  The first one is the undiscounted test to see if you have an impairment.  The second one is to determine what the final number is for the impairment, which is a discounted test.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok.  And then, as far as the write-down goes, do you also take write-ups?  In other words, there are &#x2013; the small vehicles appreciated in terms of their residual value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is no.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Then just a question on the margins:  Can you comment on the dynamic of lower LIBOR versus higher spreads and your expectation going forward on that?  How's that going to impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's certainly been a dynamic.  We've seen lower LIBOR and we've seen higher spreads.  In total what we've seen -- mainly for the US I will talk about &#x2013; with the Fed reductions as well as some of the volatility in the market, LIBOR has come down dramatically.  You can actually see it in our release, our borrowing costs are down compared to last year a little bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You expect that to remain the case for the balance of the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I had my crystal ball and could tell you what the market is going to do and what the Fed's going to do.  I don't know.  I don't believe that there's going to be a huge change in the second half of the year.</p>
