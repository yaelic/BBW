          <p>Please be advised that this conference call is being recorded. Good afternoon, and welcome to the BMO Financial Group's Fourth Quarter 2012 Conference Call for December 4, 2012. Your host for today is Ms. Sharon Haward-Laid &#x2013; Laird &#x2013; sorry, Head, Investor Relations. Ms. Haward-Laid &#x2013; Laird, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Our agenda for today's investor presentation is as follows. We will begin the call with remarks from Bill Downe, BMO's CEO; followed by presentations from Tom Flynn, the bank's Chief Financial Officer; and Surjit Rajpal, our Chief Risk Officer. After their presentations, we will have a short question-and-answer period where we will take questions from prequalified analysts. To give everyone an opportunity to participate, please keep it to one question and then re-queue.</p>
          <p>Also with us this afternoon to take questions are BMO's business unit heads: Tom Milroy from BMO Capital Market; Gilles Ouellette from the Private Client Group; Frank Techar, Head of P&amp;C Canada; and Mark Furlong, Head of P&amp;C U.S.</p>
          <p>At this time, I caution our listeners by stating the following on behalf of those speaking today. Forward-looking statements may be made during this call. They are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from forecasts, projections or conclusions in the forward-looking statements. Information about material factors that could cause results to differ and the material factors and assumptions underlying these forward-looking statements can be found in our annual MD&amp;A and our fourth quarter earnings release.</p>
          <p>With that said, I will hand things over to Bill.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thank you, Sharon, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, BMO reported a strong finish to a pivotal year for the bank. In the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the conversion of the core banking platform in the U.S. and turned the page on the purchase of M&amp;I, announced 24 months ago. With our stronger, expanded North American platform, BMO is now the second largest Canadian bank, measured by the number of retail branches in Canada and the U.S.</p>
          <p>And adjusted earnings from BMO's U.S. segment tripled from 2011 to over $1 billion, benefiting from growth in our business and strong credit performance. And I'll comment further on a number of milestones achieved later in my remarks.</p>
          <p>The bank had record results in 2012. Reported net income was $4.2 billion or $6.15 per share. On an adjusted basis net income was $4.1 billion, up 25% from last year. Revenues increased 10% to $15 billion. ROE was 15.5%, and return on tangible common equity was 19.6%. We also increased the dividend, grew loans by 7.4% and deposits by 7.1%.</p>
          <p>With the majority of M&amp;I conversion work complete and initiatives to improve productivity taking hold, the adjusted efficiency ratio improved in the quarter, and we reduced head count by 700 during the year. BMO continued to build its strong capital position, finishing the year with a pro forma Basel III common equity ratio of 8.7%, assuming full implementation of Basel III reforms and the full impact of IFRS.</p>
          <p>Concurrent with our earnings release today, we announced our intention to establish a normal course issuer bid, subject to regulatory approvals. This will give us additional flexibility in managing capital.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to the operating groups, P&amp;C Canada's reported net income for the year was $1.8 billion, up 3% on an actual loss basis. We had good loan growth across most products, an increase of $11 billion or 7.3%, supported by two strong quarters of sequential growth to end the year with momentum. Importantly, in the last two years, we've significantly shortened the average term to maturity of our mortgage book, reducing the risk to our customers from home ownership. Our net interest margin remains above the peer average, despite margin compression. And we've continued to invest in this flagship business to generate consistent, quality, long-term growth. And we remain very confident in the success of our customer-focused strategy.</p>
          <p>P&amp;C U.S. delivered adjusted net income for the year of $579 million in source currency, up 48% over 2011. Our fully integrated Commercial Banking team continues to perform very well, with strong momentum in core C&amp;I growth, which increased 15% from a year ago. I'll comment further on our overall progress in the U.S. in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>The Private Client Group had good growth in 2012. Adjusted net income increased 12% to $546 million, with over $100 million contributed from the U.S. During the year, we made a number of strategic acquisitions to enhance our global presence and wealth offering for both asset management and private banking customers. BMO Capital Markets delivered annual adjusted net income of $949 million, with strong ROE of 20.2%. During the fourth quarter, we were recognized as the North American M&amp;A Investment Banker (sic) [North America M&amp;A Investment Bank] (5:34) Team of the Year by the Global M&amp;A Network.</p>
          <p>In sum, BMO achieved three of our four medium-term financial objectives in fiscal 2012. We</p>
          <p>delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18%, well above our target range of 8% to 10%. ROE was within our 15% to 18% target, and we maintained strong capital ratios, exceeding regulatory requirements. In regard to the operating leverage measure, we intend to meet this objective in 2013. Our medium-term objectives remain unchanged and have been set in the context of our performance, and that's the source of our confidence looking ahead.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like to spend a moment highlighting our accomplishments since we announced the M&amp;I transaction 24 months ago. We've achieved what we said we would. First, we have stronger, expanded platforms in North America in both banking and wealth management. We doubled our U.S. footprint, adding both scale and reach. The conversion of our core banking platform was completed on schedule in October. We upgraded U.S. online, branch, core banking and mobile banking platforms at the same time.</p>
          <p>Second, we've completed rebranding. Over 600 U.S. bank branches have been refreshed. High-visibility BMO signage and promotion have been put in place, and over 1,300 bank machines were raised to a new standard. We've increased our brand presence through our sponsorships and community affairs partnerships, supporting and being part of local communities, which has always been a guiding principle at the bank.</p>
          <p>This month, we're blanketing our U.S. footprint with some of the strongest advertising and promotion the bank has ever developed; online, outdoor, broadcast and in-branch. We've launched an omnibus campaign that covers TV and radio, newspapers and magazines, billboards, branch and digital for our brands BMO Harris Bank and BMO Private Bank. In short, we've galvanized the valuable franchise, one with a leading position in markets we know very well. A significant increase in the value of our U.S. business has been realized, and 100% of our efforts are now back on our first priority, being in the market with confidence, growing our customer base and building the bank and its earnings as a consequence.</p>
          <p>Finally, we've enriched shareholders by generating excellent financial performance and enhancing the long-term value of the bank. We delivered consistent earnings accretion throughout 2012, well ahead of our 2013 target, exceeding our business case.</p>
          <p>Credit performance has been better than anticipated, and recoveries on the acquired portfolio have paid for the cost of integration. Cost synergies are expected to exceed U.S. $400 million, up from our estimate of $250 million at announcement, and realization is progressing well. The U.S. contribution to total bank adjusted net income increased to 25% this year, up from 10% in 2011. And both our Basel II and Basel III common equity ratios have been rebuilt to above pre-transaction levels. And in the same period, our dividend payout ratio has come down.</p>
          <p>Before I wrap up, some brief observations on the economic outlook. Negotiations between Congress and the President about taxes and spending are moving to a critical phase. And if an agreement can be reached relatively quickly &#x2013; and I believe that's almost as important as the actual terms of any agreement &#x2013; there will be a lift in business confidence that will accelerate investment and hiring.</p>
          <p>Job growth will benefit, and consumer confidence and spending will strengthen. Assuming lawmakers do the right thing &#x2013; and I believe they will &#x2013; the U.S. economy should strengthen through next year, pulling Canada's economy along with it, even with the strong Canadian dollar, fiscal tightening and expected moderation in consumer loan growth.</p>
          <p>To conclude, BMO's market position has visibly changed. This gives us confidence in our ability to produce quality and sustained growth across our North American footprint. The bank is fully repositioned, and customer loyalty has become a source of strength. In 2013, we'll move forward, taking advantage of the opportunities that flow from leading customer loyalty. We're running a business with a clear identity and a shared, underlying infrastructure. And we'll continue to capture the value of increasingly integrated North American delivery.</p>
          <p>We have clear opportunities for organic growth across all of our businesses. Commercial Banking is a strength for BMO in both Canada and the United States. We're looking to leverage our expertise in a business-led recovery. Capital Markets has a diversified, balanced portfolio of businesses with leading expertise in relationships and strategic sectors. We're well-positioned to leverage our U.S. investments to drive better operating performance.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management has established momentum, with a strengthened U.S. market position. We see particular opportunities in BMO global asset management, which has $110 billion in assets managed, and then in Private Banking, with our premier service model. In Personal Banking, we have a differentiated customer focus strategy and will drive growth from achieving industry-leading loyalty and delivering on our brand promise to make money make sense.</p>
          <p>I'd like to thank our customers for the trust they place in the bank and, in particular, acknowledge the customers who were part of the conversion of the core banking platform in the U.S. for their continuing loyalty. We recognize that critical to the bank's success is our ability to serve customers exceptionally well and help them succeed.</p>
          <p>The bank's employees are at the heart of our differentiation strategy that continuously drives forward our vision to define great customer experience. And I'd like to acknowledge them for their commitment and the great improvements being made in the way work gets done more efficiently for our customers. As we look ahead to 2013, we're confident that each of our businesses is positioned to deliver quality, sustained earnings growth against a high standard of customer experience.</p>
          <p>And with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9. BMO had a strong fourth quarter, with good operating group momentum. Reported net income of $1.1 billion was up 41% from last year. On an adjusted basis, net income was $1.1 billion, up 35%. EPS was $1.65, up 38%. And ROE was 16.3%. Our businesses delivered good results in the quarter. There was good loan growth in our P&amp;C businesses in both Personal and Commercial in Canada and core C&amp;I in the U.S. And the Private Client Group and Capital Markets had very strong quarters.</p>
          <p>Adjusted provisions for credit losses were lower year over year and relatively stable quarter over quarter. Surjit will provide more color in this area in a moment. Items removed to arrive at adjusted income were similar in character to prior quarters and totaled $43 million or $0.06 per share. Slide 14 shows details on the adjusted items, including a restructuring charge of $53 million after tax, related to our ongoing focus on managing productivity.</p>
          <p>Slide 10 shows highlights of our annual results. Total bank income and EPS were records. On an adjusted basis, revenue was $15.1 billion, up 10%, income $4.1 billion, up 25%. EPS was $6.00, up 18%, and ROE was over 15%. Our retail businesses in aggregate increased significantly during the year and contributed over 75% of operating group adjusted revenue and income.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 11, adjusted revenue in Q4 was $3.9 billion, up 6.8% year over year and 6.7% quarter over quarter. Both comparatives reflect strong performance in BMO Capital Markets and PCG. On an adjusted basis, net interest income was down 2% year over year and 2.7% quarter over quarter, as volume growth was offset by lower margins. Quarter over quarter, the more significant decrease was in BMO Capital Markets.</p>
          <p>Noninterest revenue on an adjusted basis was up 17% year over year and 18% quarter over quarter. As shown in the graph on the right, adjusted total bank margin, excluding trading, was 202 basis points, down one basis point from last quarter. Decreases primarily in P&amp;C businesses were offset by an increase in Corporate.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 12. Good revenue growth, and our focus on productivity contributed to positive operating leverage in the quarter and a lower efficiency ratio. Adjusted expenses of $2.4 billion were up year over year and quarter over quarter, largely due to higher variable costs, in line with strong revenues, and increased initiative and technology investment spending, some of which reflected higher year-end-related spending.</p>
          <p>As shown on Slide 13, capital ratios strengthened in the quarter. On a Basel II basis, the common equity ratio was strong at 10.5%, as is the Tier 1 ratio at 12.6%. Our pro forma Basel III common equity ratio moved up to a very good 8.7% in the quarter. And as a reminder, we calculate the number, including the full impact of adopting IFRS. As you have seen, we announced today our intention, subject to regulatory approval, to establish a normal course issuer bid to repurchase up to 15 million common shares.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 16. In Q4, P&amp;C Canada net income was $439 million. Results reflected higher volumes across most products and the impact of lower margins. There was very good loan growth in the quarter with personal lending balances up 7.8% and commercial loans up 8.1% from last year. There was also good sequential loan growth for the second consecutive quarter, with total loans up 2.5% quarter over quarter.</p>
          <p>NIM was down in the quarter, due to deposit spread compression and the low rate environment and changes in mix, including growth in loans exceeding growth in deposits. Lastly, expenses continue to be well contained as we actively managed productivity while investing in the business. Q4 expenses reflect some up-tick in investment spending late in the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 17, P&amp;C U.S. adjusted net income was U.S. $147 million, up 3% quarter over quarter and down from strong results a year ago. Revenue of U.S. $743 million was up 1% quarter over quarter, due to a higher fee revenue on the sale of newly originated mortgages and increases in commercial lending and deposit fees, partially offset by lower spreads. NIM was down 12 basis points from Q3, mainly due to deposit spread compression and lower loan spreads due to competitive pressures. NIM increased last quarter, and so the average quarterly change over the last two quarters is a more modest five basis points.</p>
          <p>Expenses continue to be managed actively. We are achieving synergies and, at the same time, making some investments in areas to take advantage of growth opportunities. Core C&amp;I loan growth continued to be strong. Balances were up 15% year over year and 4.3% quarter over quarter, and the pipeline remains strong.</p>
          <p>Turing to Slide 18. Private Client Group adjusted net income was $171 million, up 20% year over year and 48% from the prior quarter. Revenue was up 11% from a year ago and 16% quarter over quarter, driven by higher insurance results, which benefited from changes to our investment portfolio and the annual review of actuarial assumptions. Assets under management and administration were up $40 billion year over year and a nice $20 billion quarter over quarter, due to market appreciation and new client assets.</p>
          <p>Turing to Slide 19. BMO Capital Markets delivered strong results, with net income of $293 million and ROE of 25%. Earnings more than doubled from a year ago and improved quarter over quarter. The good performance reflects higher revenues as the market environment improved; our businesses executing on their strategies and taxes.</p>
          <p>Turning now to Slide 20, Corporate had reported net income of $54 million and adjusted net income of $74 million. Year-over-year adjusted net income was up $141 million, largely due to lower provisions for credit losses. As a reminder, we record all acquired loan accounting items in the Corporate segment. Quarter-over-quarter adjusted net income was little changed, up $9 million. Revenues were up from the low level in Q3, due to a number of smaller items, partially offset by higher expenses as a result of higher technology investment spend in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>To conclude, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter and for the year. We feel good about the performance of our businesses and how they're positioned heading into fiscal 2013. And with that, I'll now turn it over to Surjit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tom, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to say we have another good quarter from a risk perspective.</p>
          <p>On Slide 27 we show that the specific provisions of the legacy portfolio was $245 million, marginally up from $234 million in the prior quarter. The provision for the acquired performing portfolio was $103 million, a decrease of $10 million. The provisions this quarter included $71 million as a result of regulatory guidance related to certain performing U.S. consumer loans. The purchased credit impaired portfolio had a recovery this quarter of $132 million versus the $118 million in the third quarter. Our focused management of this portfolio has resulted in $509 million of recoveries for the full year.</p>
          <p>As I have mentioned on previous calls, we have been proactively managing down this portfolio. And as the portfolio shrinks, along with the associated mark, future recoveries will moderate. Our impaired formations can be found on Slide 29. Formations in the legacy and purchase performing portfolios were $787 million this quarter compared to $791 million in the third quarter. Total gross impaired loans increased $109 million this quarter to $2.976 billion. This increase is related to previously mentioned regulatory guidance, has contributed $142 million to our formations.</p>
          <p>On to a topic of broader interest, the Canadian real estate market and consumer leverage. We remain comfortable with our exposures, as we have strong loan-to-value ratios on our mortgages and home equity loans. The quality of our new originations is high and, overall, we feel significant shift to fixed-rate products.</p>
          <p>In closing, we have successfully integrated M&amp;I into our credit risk framework and culture and have reduced our impaired commercial real estate assets. We are comfortable with our risk profile. And through our strategic and capital planning processes, we continually assess our current and forecast portfolios in both expected and adverse environments. Our ongoing focus on a strong risk culture and risk management gives me confidence as we move into 2013.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And we will now turn over to the operator for the question-and-answer session portion of today's presentation.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Just a big-picture question here. Slide 5, I see the earnings growth by segment. And the one that jumps out at me is P&amp;C Banking, 3% year over year. You're trailing your other segments and, more likely than not, your peers in Canada. I just wondered what the action plan is for next year to drive earnings growth higher in P&amp;C Banking. Also, the U.S. margins, down 12% &#x2013; 12 basis points &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; sequentially. Is that an unusual decrease? What should we look for going forward? And the last one's on the buyback. I think I asked about that last quarter, and it kind of got downplayed. And now you're pursuing it. I think it's the right move. I'm just wondering what changed in your thinking in the span of a quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe we'll do them in reverse...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Order, Gabriel. Thanks for the question. I think that, as always, we pay very close attention to your questions. And when there's merit in them, it stimulates thinking. But as well, the capital build, as I think you know, has been very significant. We've restored our B III common ratio, which was, as I recall, as low as 6.6%, immediately after closing the purchase transaction, to 8.7% in this quarter. And so we have very clear visibility around the degree of flexibility that we have now in capital to invest organically. And I think the timing around re-instituting the capability to repurchase stock, as we have done in the past, is appropriate. Obviously, it's not immediate because we're going to await regulatory approval. But it's simply an integral part of long-term capital planning, and the timing seemed just about right. Mark, why don't you comment on the U.S. margin, and then we'll let Frank take what I think was the larger question that you asked, Gabriel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the U.S. margin &#x2013; this is Mark Furlong &#x2013; our view this quarter is really pretty much the same as it was last quarter, that if you look at the average of the last two quarters, we're down about five basis points a quarter. The margin, kind of on a quarterly basis, gets influenced by a couple basis points, depending on, like last quarter, on interest recoveries. We didn't get any this quarter. And right now, we're in that period of time where just the absolute low level of interest rates and deposits and some competitive pressures on the lending side have caused that kind of decline. So that's really kind of the near-term range. And it's kind of hard to predict going forward, but that's really what's going on; really nothing different from what I talked about last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That five point average that you talk about, that's more indicative, you think of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the near term, I'd say yeah. Yeah. And I don't see anything much bigger than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just refresh my memory, please. What was the interest recovery last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was, yeah, a couple basis points in the third fiscal quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Frank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Gabriel. For us, it's pretty simple. We need faster balance sheet growth. And I think you can see over the last couple of quarters, in particular in Q4, we had a really good quarter in the areas that we've been focused on most recently. Mortgage growth was 9.4%, commercial loans 8.1%, mutual fund balances were up 10%, commercial deposits 6.2%. And all of those were significantly above Q3. So as we've come through the second half of the year as we focused on those areas, we're seeing much stronger momentum. There's no doubt that we've turned the quarter, and we're going to see stronger balance growth in 2013. So I've got a lot of confidence that we're doing the right things from a balance sheet-focus perspective.</p>
          <p>I will just point out a couple of other things. Even though the 3% headline number looks a bit low, for the last three quarters of the year, our net income growth with actual losses has been over 6%. So we've done better in the second half, and my expectation is we're going to carry that into 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're expecting to see the margin declines moderate in 2013 because of stronger balance sheet growth. And we're going to continue to focus growth on certain credit products that we're comfortable with, given the environmental risks that exist. We're happy with that growth and momentum. But we are turning our attention to deposit growth. I mean the single biggest opportunity we have to mitigate the pressure on margins at this point in time is to increase our retail deposit growth, and that's what we're going to be turning our attention to. We're not expecting interest rates to change in the near term. We're going to continue to see pressure on deposit spreads going through 2013. And our biggest opportunity is to get the deposit side of the balance sheet growing faster.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. First one is a quick numbers question, hopefully, for Tom Flynn. Tom, you mention that the net interest income or net interest margin contribution in the segments was lower. But on an adjusted basis, you had a benefit in Corporate. If I've gone through the &#x2013; the way I've gone through the adjustments, looks like about a $50 million pickup, 5, 0, quarter over quarter. Can you help me understand what's driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There're a variety of items that go into the Corporate revenue item, and they move around quarter to quarter. They tend not to be individually large. And I'd say what you're looking at is just what I would characterize as normal volatility or variability as we move through quarters as opposed to anything more reflective of a fundamental shift in the level of revenue that we would expect. The Corporate revenues were low last quarter. And so to some degree, the up-tick this quarter was just a normalization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll leave it here. I'm kind of looking at it just on the net interest income portion. And it does look like this quarter was materially better than the first three quarters of the year. Would you expect that this is a &#x2013; more of a reflective level of what you think it'll look like going forward? Or will it revert to the larger negative that we saw earlier in the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would look at it reverting to a number that's more reflective of the average during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then my actual question is probably for Surjit or maybe Tom as well. If I look at the loan loss ratio for the bank in 2012 and if I go along with what's included in the adjusted number, you have a PCL ratio of roughly 19 basis points. And, Surjit, you made reference last quarter to the recoveries likely starting to slow. That didn't happen this quarter. And I get the feeling you're indicating we will see that in 2013. So relative to that 19 basis point level on the adjusted, what do you see as more reflective of the aggregate portfolio now that you've had M&amp;I under your control for five full quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me answer that question and more in terms of our legacy book as well. If you look at our legacy book, in Canada for the year, we've had 35 basis points. And in the U.S., it's about 100 basis points. So I think what we're expecting to see from the M&amp;I portfolio is the same kind of performance as we expecting in our own legacy portfolio down the road. So that's more like what we would expect. Now to &#x2013; this is unadjusted for any recoveries we may have. The recoveries that you talk about, yes, I did indicate last time that it's going to &#x2013; they're going to moderate, and I said the same thing this time.</p>
          <p>One of the reasons why I think we don't have &#x2013; it's difficult to give you too specific guidance because we are adopting what I've referred to in the past of value maximization strategy and, at the same time, we balanced that with our desire to reduce our credit impaired loans. And to this point, we've had really good results. And we've done &#x2013; we've got strong work-out capabilities, and we're giving it focus attention. But we've never put ourselves under pressure to be able to sell for the sake of selling, and we've had really good results.</p>
          <p>The market also, commercial real estate market in the U.S. has helped in that it's picked up. And so I think that number that you've seen in the past, on the one hand, is a very good number. On the other hand, what you're left with now is about $1.7 billion in impaired assets with the mark of &#x2013; I think it's about $445 million. So it has to naturally slow down a little bit. But I would think the slowdown will be somewhat &#x2013; will be moderated. It'll be gradual. But that doesn't mean that there won't be variability. Long answer. I hope that satisfies you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well &#x2013; and just to &#x2013; I'll leave it here. So from the level that we're looking at this year, it sounds like just because of the recovery slowing, you're going to have a gradual up-tick. But in terms of how the actual portfolio is performing, you're not expecting a significant worsening in underlying credit quality. Is that a fair assessment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's a fair assumption. I think over the year, we've recovered $509 million. And I would think one can &#x2013; given where the mark is right now, we &#x2013; and the portfolio sizes, I think 200, 250 would be an estimate that I would have, but I have no basis for giving you that estimate right now.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Steve Theriault from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. First, a follow-up question for Bill, if I could. Bill, you said you'd await regulatory approval before using the buyback. So can I infer from that, that you would expect to use the buyback in the near term to do more than offset option dilution? Or should we think of this a little further down the road once you get the B III core Tier 1 sort of north of 9%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; well, the 9% number, I don't think we've ever used. The number is now well above the public regulatory guidance. I think going into 2013, the way we think about that buyback capability is to offset dilution, as we said and as we have historically done, recognizing in the last couple of years we haven't. So I guess you could entertain a little bit of catching up, if you will. But the fact is, it's a good-sized program. And depending on earnings in 2013 and the continued build of capital, it's something that we would revisit, I think, later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's fair.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's one &#x2013; I think the one thing that I would say, Steve, on the topic of capital is it now puts us in a position where we have an awful lot of flexibility around reinvestment in organic growth in the business. And with the conversion behind us, within our established footprint, I think there's a lot we can do to grow the business. And we have the flexibility to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. I wanted to come back to Frank, also, for a minute, if I could. Frank, you talked about balance sheet growth, but mostly on the asset side. I know you've lost a little bit of share on the deposit side, and I think that's a focus for next year. But I was hoping you could talk a bit about your strategy with regards to deposit taking in general for 2013. Is there anything specific you have in mind which, hopefully, will benefit the margin after loan growth exceeding deposit growth, hurting you a little bit this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Steve, I'm going to start with the commercial side. I already mentioned that our commercial deposits were up 6.2% this quarter. That, given the fact that we're expecting the business environment to be a little more positive than on the retail side is important to us. So I'm really happy and I'm confident about the expectations, continuing to grow our commercial deposits more rapidly in the future. And, in fact, some of the re-tooling we've done in our business, focusing our sales force on a broader share of wallet rather than just credit, is paying off. Just to give you a stat, our cash management sales in Q4 were up 28% over last year. And that's a big tie and link into our ability to attach ourselves to those core operating deposits of our customers. So that's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two is on the retail side, our share has been sort of meandering down, primarily because of our competitiveness on the term book, itself. Our growth in core checking and savings has been solid, on the back of continued investment in our distribution network, in our online capabilities, building our sales forces and our great customer experience. And I would expect that to continue. We do have some work to do on our term strategy, and that's underway. So we do have to see stronger growth in both of those segments. We're well underway on the commercial side, and more to come on the retail segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Has there been some near-term price pressure on the term side? I noticed some pretty aggressive marketing from one of your competitors in the last couple of weeks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer to that would be yes, coming from two places. One would be the sort of non-big bank competitors are always aggressive, given their funding options. And my big-five competitors, just depending upon which quarter it is, there seems to be someone who's strongly going after one part of the term market. And I don't see it as a systemic issue, but it happens. And I expect it will continue to happen going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just for Frank on &#x2013; I guess the underlying question's on NIM compression. But I'm looking at &#x2013; you have a great table in the annual report. Table 9, Page 106 shows that the yield on average Canadian dollar mortgages was 3.41% this quarter &#x2013; I'm sorry &#x2013; this year, 2012. It was 4.15% in 2011. So it just sure feels like that mortgage product is just really squeezing your NIM more than deposit compression. Do I understand that right? And then what would be the drivers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter, those numbers are the total bank numbers, which would include securitization activities as well. The P&amp;C business is kept whole. That's the first point. Those are obviously customer yields; they're not spreads. And cost of funding has come down as well over that period of time. And I think we've talked in previous quarters about our spread in P&amp;C Canada that flows into our P&amp;L not being under pressure. And over the last couple of quarters, we've seen our mortgage spread on our entire portfolio move down in the order of one or two basis points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And I appreciate that with respect to looking at the P&amp;C Canada segment. Maybe the bigger picture, people are really not paying as much for a mortgage as they were last year. And although from a capital common equity Tier 1 ratio, it's not a capital-intensive product. You start thinking on a leverage ratio basis, it kind of is. So is the mortgage product still an attractive product strategically for you and, presumably, for your competitors? The Canadian mortgage product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we think it is. We think it is, in certain circumstances, through certain channels, at certain prices, with a focus on a broader share of wallet. Peter, it's interesting, it wasn't so long ago that people were questioning the fact that our mortgage balances were shrinking. And now, all of a sudden, it seems that there's a problem because they're growing faster than everyone else's. We've been very focused on growing our mortgage balances in a particular way, with a particular segment. And we think that we've done a great job in 2012, and we're going to continue exploiting the opportunity that we have. Our credit quality has improved. We've brought new customers into the bank, and the returns we're earning on the products that we're selling at this point in time are attractive.</p>

          <p>Okay, Michael. As you know, the results of the insurance line of business is very &#x2013; is impacted quite &#x2013; is impacted by interest rates. And just go by memory here, the previous quarter, I think the decline was something in the order of about $45 million after tax. And in this quarter, there was another decline of about $7 million. We're able to &#x2013; and there was a gain also from a year-end kind of actuarial assumption true up, I think, in the order of about $10 million. But the bigger impact came from the fact that we were able to buy longer-term, higher yielding assets. And that allowed us to release some reserves and policyholders' liabilities.</p>
          <p>When you look at the number from this quarter, if you go to the previous press releases, kind of a normalized number is something in the order of about $55 million to maybe $62 million a quarter for the insurance line of business. So obviously, it's growing every quarter. But it's also impacted, and this volatility comes from interest rate movements. Okay with that, Michael?</p>

          <p>Hi, gentlemen. This is Charles Nabhan for Chris Mutascio. Thanks for taking my call. My question is about the effective tax rate during the quarter. It was around 16%, and I realize that it's impacted by the run-off on the structured portfolio, which is somewhat of a wildcard. But looking ahead, do you see the tax rate reverting back to the 20% range, where it's been historically?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom Flynn. A few things on that. The reported number, as you said, was about 15.7%. We do focus more on the adjusted number because some of the items that go into reported are not taxed. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 17.9%, and that was up from 16.9% in Q3. On a normalized basis, looking forward, we've had this question come up before. And we've said that we expect the tax rate to be in the 20% to low-20% range going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. And I apologize if I missed it in your materials, but can you just tell me where you are in terms of the $400 million in synergies so far? And now that the core banking conversion is done, should we expect the rest of these synergies to flow pretty quickly from here? In other words, basically H1 of 2013, and you're going to be fully loaded with the synergies in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom. On realization against the $400 million, we've said in the disclosures that we're through the two-thirds point in terms of realizing the synergies. We did do the main core banking platform conversion in the fourth quarter. It was done late in the fourth quarter, and so the benefits of that are more likely to show up in a more pronounced way into Q2 of next year versus Q1. In Q1, there's still some clean-up activities underway, and also there's work to do just to dismantle the effort that we had underway to complete the core conversion. We are also investing in the business. And so as you look at the segment results, you'll see the benefit of the synergies kicking in, but also investments that we're making in a couple of areas to grow the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that imply, Tom, that perhaps not a net decline in expenses as we look into next year? Or is just the magnitude of the synergies still to come enough to give you a lower expense rate as you look into the second half of next year compared with what it was this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect the expenses to be down on a net basis. The synergies will outweigh the investments.</p>
          <p>&lt;Q &#x2013; [05QJVF-E Robert Sedran]: Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Brad Smith from Stonecap Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. This would be a question for Bill Downe. Bill, looking at the P&amp;C segment for the bank, I note that the return on equity that you're presenting in your supplementary has fallen from about 29% in the fourth quarter of 2010 to around 18%. And I was just wondering, in view of the sharp correction in that return, if you don't think it would be helpful to provide us with a breakdown between the Canadian and the U.S. return in that regard so that we could see how it's moving. And perhaps provide a little bit of guidance as to where you think that's going to recover to as we go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks for the suggestion, Brad. We'll take that under advisement. I think one of the challenges in that return-on-equity calculation is the U.S. business has, as I'm sure you appreciate, significant goodwill and customer intangibles. So doing a direct ROE comparison between the mature Canadian business and the acquired business is a little bit problematic. But we'll look at return on tangible common equity as a way of evaluating return on tangible common equity as a way of expressing progress. But I think, clearly, it's our expectation that the much larger business with the synergies out of it, over time, is going to move to a return that looks a lot more like Canada, at least on a tangible-return basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And I would just simply make the comment that shareholders are earning a return on the entire investment as opposed to just the tangible component. One last question on the ROE. If I look through this segment report, 29% to 18% in the total P&amp;C; it's down also from 39% to 30% in the Personal and the Personal Client Group. The only place where it's up at all from Q4 2010 to where we are today is up 5% in the Capital Markets. And yet, the consolidated ROE hasn't moved at all. It's around 15%, 15.5%. I think that leaves me with the conclusion that the bulk of that maintenance of the consolidated ROE is coming from the Corporate segment. Would that be correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Tom, Brad. I think the biggest contributor across the groups to the ROE trends that you're looking at relate to us moving to allocating more capital to the operating groups in response to the Basel III changes. And it's clear that the Banking sector needs to operate &#x2013; will need to operate with higher capital levels going forward than it did before the downturn. And in response to that, we've increased the allocations of capital to our businesses, and that has had some downward impact on the segment ROEs.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A question, perhaps, for Surjit and for Bill. Surjit, you're helpful in offering us that sort of $200 million to $250 million guesstimate, and I appreciate that that's all it was for the recoveries in the impaired book. It's about half of what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What the bank had this quarter &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; this year. If you tax-affect that, that takes out a good amount of growth, looking out to 2013. It takes out roughly $0.25 from EPS in 2013 relative to what it was in 2012. And, Bill, this is where it would be helpful if you could offer some comments. Your growth objective is 8% to 10%, and I appreciate it's medium term. But if you've given up as much as $0.25 from one year to the next or about 4% of EPS, are you really offering us a growth objective that's well above 8% to 10%? Or should we just interpret this as a medium-term objective and not get too fixated on year to year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom is looking at me like he understood your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd have to ask you to repeat it, but I'll let him answer. And then if I need to provide a supplemental, I will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well I'll take a shot at it. The adjusted earnings for the year were $6.00, as you know. They did benefit from very strong credit performance, and a good part of that related to the recoveries on the M&amp;I impaired loans. As we think about earnings going forward and our earnings target, a couple of points. The first would be that we do issue mid-term targets, so we do not use the targets as being one-year targets. They're defined as mid-year targets, and they're targets that we would expect to achieve over the mid-term, on average. Looking back at this year, we had 18% EPS growth, and so growth significantly in excess of the mid-term target.</p>
          <p>And as we look forward to next year, we're focused on growing on the base of adjusted earnings that we had this year, recognizing that we've got a headwind from potentially lower recoveries on the M&amp;I portfolio, as Surjit talked about. But we're focused on generating growth off of that base.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you &#x2013; again, so the main point to take away from this is that the 8% to 10% is medium term, not annual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we said the same thing a year ago as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We said the same thing a year ago, and you saw the results for the year. I think that it is a medium-term target. You have to bear that in mind, but you also have to bear in mind that in 2012, we had a heavy integration cost. There's no question in my mind that overhead numbers are probably higher because of the amount of work that was going on in connection with integration. And we have some fairly significant costs that related to work force adjustment. And if you take all of that into effect, as I said in my opening comments, we have a great deal of confidence in the ability of the businesses to grow in 2013.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple numbers questions. Could Tom Milroy or someone help me with trading? Was there a CVA adjustment in the quarter? And if it was, how much? And if I miss it, I apologize. And then just for Frank, could you give us your LTVs on your HELOCs and what's happening in the HELOC portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, John. It's Tom. And why don't I just start that &#x2013; when we look first at the quarter and then at the year, I mean there's CVA in our business all the time. In the quarter, it would have accounted for about half of the quarter-over-quarter increase in the interest rate trading line on Page 12 of the sup pack that you see. So that's what it was. For the year, the number was a few million dollars and not material in any fashion. So I think that when you look at the trading numbers for the year, they're pretty good and not impacted one way or the other by CVA. With that, I will turn it over to Frank.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Question for Mark Furlong. Just looking at the portfolio in the U.S., I'm wondering if you could first give us a little bit more color on the particular areas of strength in the CNI portfolio. Just wondering if it's more targeted industry growth, or is there market share gains in specific MSAs? Any color you can share there. And then secondly, on the consumer portfolio, outside of the indirect auto, are you sort of where you'd like to be in terms of balances, particularly on the mortgages, home equity? Or should we expect further shrinkage in the consumer side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I'll start with the commercial portfolio. So it's really not geography driven so much as industry driven. Kind of what we see building up in pipelines and the performance for this year, the corporate finance businesses has done well and continues to do well. And I see the pipelines early into 2013. It'll, I suspect, will have another good year. The equipment finance business, that joined from the acquired organization, and we had some pent-up demand that was going elsewhere that now is coming through our organization. We have a financial institution business that's done well, and national food and consumer business that's also done well and expect that we'll continue to see growth in that dealer finance business that was larger in the acquired bank but building in our bank. And that has great expectations to continue to grow.</p>
          <p>What I'm trying to say is if &#x2013; really, if you look segment by segment, all of them seem to be positioned very well to grow. And the pipelines are &#x2013; stayed strong all during the year and actually grew a little bit more in the fourth quarter. So a good sign for going into 2013 and gives us good optimism. On the commercial side, see no reason not to have expectations that we'll have another good year.</p>
          <p>I'd also tell you that on the commercial real estate side, after going through some shrinkage in 2012 that, I think, that portfolio's finding a floor. And we'll begin to see some growth in that portfolio in 2013 as well, too, based on pipelines and kind of things closing at the end of the year and early into 2013. So feel very good about that.</p>
          <p>On the consumer portfolio, just to take a little turn here. So on the mortgage portfolio, just as a reminder, you recall that we sell &#x2013; if you picked the quarter &#x2013; 60% to 65% of production, and that's what we did into the fourth quarter as well. And I expect, based on what we see in the pipeline, that the 30-year and 15-year fixed are still the kinds of loans that have performed well in the secondary market and with good spreads. And expect that we'll continue to do that.</p>
          <p>And we focus really on the mortgage side on growing the total servicing portfolio so we can build relationships. And not that we don't want to retain the balances, but we do. We just want to make sure that the price &#x2013; the portion that we originate that's priced well to go into the secondary market, that that's where it goes. And really don't want to keep 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and really not 15-year fixed-rate mortgages on the books.</p>
          <p>Home equity shrank during 2012. But when you look at the home appreciation that's occurred in the U.S. the last four or five months, almost any service that we look at projects that to continue to improve in 2013. The mortgages underwater in total in the U.S. continuing to decrease month by month. That, in itself, is going to build up some purchasing power for consumers. And that will give us, I think, some wind in terms of being able to grow that portfolio as well, too.</p>
          <p>The pipeline &#x2013; I should have mentioned, by the way, in mortgage, pipeline in mortgage was over $1 billion at the end of the year. So kind of hitting all-time highs for us; real close. Home equity pipelines are relatively flat and kind of end of third quarter and fourth quarter. But we can see there'll be some demand building.</p>
          <p>Business banking, which you kind of also see in there, which is kind of that middle-to-smaller end business portfolio, I think, also is kind of nearing the bottom. And we should begin to see some growth in that portfolio as well, too. So really feel pretty good about each one of the portfolios and the sales teams that are chasing it and I &#x2013; that are responsible for those portfolios. And expect to see, as we move later into kind of the mid part of 2013, to have caught almost all those portfolios in terms of growth. We really feel pretty good about where we're at.</p>
          <p>I mean you think about all the change that took place in this business during the course of the year, I mean pretty remarkable where we're at and the &#x2013; and really the high-quality franchise we ended up with and the high-quality customer base we ended up with, and really have an employee base as well in the P&amp;C U.S. business. It's really energized by where we're at. All the markets that &#x2013; I should say the two biggest markets we're in, we had good growth in terms of deposit share, which tells you that's building relationships. I can go over that in detail if you wanted, if you ever look at the U.S. numbers, but feel really good about where we're at.</p>
          <p>And then kind of finally, really for the first time, we have an integrated advertising campaign that launched early in November and has really been a big push, both for the employee base that went through the integration exercises in the last 18 months or so, but as well really in creating brand awareness across the entire footprint. And that really didn't exist before, certainly, in one of the franchises, and a lesser extent, maybe in Chicago. So I would tell you that the campaign is strong. It's strong in all the markets that we do business in and will be one of those &#x2013; one of the tools that drives customers into us over time.</p>
          <p>So I just conclude by saying we feel very good about where we're at in the portfolios; feel very good about the strength of the activity we have underway in each of the markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I think it really fits in with the whole call and the points I want to make in wrapping up around what's been accomplished in the last two years because we've combined two organizations that are now operating as one with tremendous opportunity. We're expanding in a six-state area with a population and gross domestic product in excess of Canada as a whole. Across the whole bank, our employees are energized by the strength and capabilities of our businesses. And they're focused on opening new customer accounts and adding products to customer relationships and, at the same time, enhancing productivity.</p>
          <p>We delivered record financial results this year, and we're confident in the earnings momentum of the bank. And I just want to thank you all for joining us today. And if I don't speak with you individually, wish you all the best for the year and in the holidays.</p>
