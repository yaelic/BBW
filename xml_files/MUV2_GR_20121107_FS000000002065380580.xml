        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everybody. A warm welcome to our call on the occasion of Munich Re's Q3 and nine months 2012 results. Today J&#xF6;rg Schneider, our CFO presenting the financial developments in more detail and discussing your questions. J&#xF6;rg will start with an introductory statement providing a short overview highlighting the most important topics. Afterwards, we invite you to the usual comprehensive Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>So, let's get started and I hand it over to J&#xF6;rg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Our results and the very positive development of our Group equity capital are not only due to a random low burden from natural catastrophes, they also reflect our forward-looking risk management prudence, investment policy and our bottom line oriented underwriting approach. We are well on track to beat our &#x20AC;2.5 billion target by a substantial amount and we are confident that the renewal of reinsurance treaties for 2013 will work out well.</p>
          <p>Let's dive into our presentation with an overview on slide three. Net profit of over &#x20AC;1.1 billion for the third quarter and &#x20AC;2.7 billion for the first nine months are way ahead of our expectations. The annualized results on risk-adjusted capital totaled 14.9%. The return on equity amounted to 14.5%. We have a strong capitalization according to all metrics, and for this year an increase of 16% in our shareholders equity. Our return on investment of 3.9% for the first nine months and 4% for the third quarter on a standalone basis is very satisfying. We indeed made good progress in most parts of our core businesses. You'll find the numbers on the bottom of the slide, and we'll come to it later in the presentation.</p>
          <p>On slide four you can see that each of the three quarters of 2012 even exceeded the very satisfying level of the good second and fourth quarter 2011. For Q4 2012, Hurricane Sandy will interrupt the positive trend. What we expect here is a mid-triple digit euro amount, but we are still not on safe ground with regard to our estimation. We see a wide range of estimations by modeling agencies and external observers between something like $7 billion and $20 billion, perhaps even as high as US$25 billion for the insured market loss, and we base our estimation internally at the moment on the high end of that range. But we can't give you more clarity here. We still have to wait how the losses will develop during the next couple of days, days and weeks.</p>
          <p>The effect of Hurricane Sandy will help to restore risk awareness and discipline for the ongoing renewal negotiations. The decline of other in the bottom right corner of the slide is due to very moderate tax expenses of only 16.1% of pre-tax income and an almost neutral currency result after a negative earnings contribution. In 2011, it was minus &#x20AC;230 million.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter 2012, it's the most profitable quarter for five years. Our shareholders' equity has grown by &#x20AC;3.8 billion or 16% in 2012. In Q3 the sharp increase of &#x20AC;1.75 billion, that is the right column here, was due to the strong result and the interest rate related increase of the shareholders' share in our unrealized on-balance sheet gains. Meanwhile, the unrealized on and off-balance sheet valuation reserve climbed from &#x20AC;11 billion to &#x20AC;20 billion or 9% of the market value of our investment. You can see a breakdown on slides 47 and 48. As you see on the bottom of this slide, our debt leverage is down to 17.7%. This is a ratio which is among the lowest in the European insurance industry.</p>
          <p>Our economic capital position has further improved. As you know, we do not publish numbers on a quarterly basis since our market consistent embedded value is precisely calculated only once a year. But I can give you an indication, just to remind you, at the end of 2011, our available financial resources were 111% of Munich Re's target level or in other words 194% of the Solvency II like capital requirement based on a 99.5% confidence level.</p>
          <p>Although we have suffered in 2012 from declining swap rates and increasing interest rate volatility, our economic solvency ratio has increased in the first half of 2012 and went up further in the third quarter. And this is mainly due to the good underwriting performance. With regard to raising capital, we anyway have nothing to worry about. We have a substantial low single-digit billion buffer above the AA requirement, and we can draw on an excellent capital quality as was recently confirmed by Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
          <p>Our Group Solvency I capital is more than seven &#x2013; sorry more than 2.7 times the required level. The German GAAP revenue reserves are on a very comfortable level. The buffer for future dividend distributions is increasing even after strengthening the equalization reserve against the backdrop of low large losses in 2012 to date. The losses from Hurricane Sandy will be absorbed by a decrease in contributions to the equalization reserve and will therefore not have much relevance for the revenue reserve. So all these metrics are currently pointing in the same direction. We are well equipped to seize business opportunities and continue with high profit distributions at the same time.</p>
          <p>Slide seven shows the customary overview of our well-diversified investment portfolio, and you'll find many details in the annex. Our total investment portfolio is &#x20AC;222 billion of market value, up from &#x20AC;207 billion at the turn of the year. We still have an emphasis on highly rated securities and made only small changes in the asset allocation. The market value of our safe-haven assets increased also due to currency effect.</p>
          <p>Except for our home bias in favor of German and U.S sovereign debt, we are continuing to diversify our portfolio in order to be able to cope with all kinds of scenarios, as the capital markets remain very volatile. In the third quarter we reduced our exposure to French government bonds and to covered bonds from Italy, Ireland and Spain. We bought Dutch, EU and Brazilian government bonds and covered bonds from the UK, and we continued reducing our anyway quite low exposure to bank bonds.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we increased our exposure in inflation-linked bonds and swaps to almost &#x20AC;13 billion and cautiously expanded our net equity holdings to 2.9% of total assets. On the bottom of this slide, you can see our almost perfect duration hedge between opposite positions in primary and reinsurance. Up to now we have been pleased about our long duration in reinsurance because we have not seen the long-awaited spike in interest rates.</p>
          <p>Anyway, we gave a selection of our investments to the characteristics of our technical provisions and liabilities and we have to accept some P&amp;L volatility from accounting mismatches. But we will not take risky economic bets.</p>
          <p>Let us move to slide eight for the composition of our investment results. &#x20AC;6.3 billion, this is an ROI of 3.9% for Q3 even 4%. Our regular income equals a running yield of 3.6%. It proved relatively resilient and here the long duration is paying off. But we are reinvesting at lower interest rates, as you can see on this slide, 2.3% for the period of April to September.</p>
          <p>The contribution from net capital gains and write-ups was only moderate. We made gains on our swaptions and other interest rate derivatives as their market value had been bolstered by falling interest rate levels. In the first three quarters of 2012, we posted net gains on disposal of &#x20AC;525 million through active asset management, especially from gains realized on equities. And also we had some gains when reshuffling our investment in government bonds, covered bonds and corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we posted losses on disposal when selling a substantial portion of the equity derivatives we use to hedge our equity portfolio against price setbacks. So overall, a high IFRS return on a low-to-moderate risk investment portfolio while leaving the growing unrealized gains almost untouched.</p>
          <p>As far as the segments are concerned, I will start with primary insurance on slide 10. Premium income was down by 1.9%. Half of the effect is due to divestment. In life, minus 5.1%, the development of new business in private provision for old age was weak chiefly because of the wide spread economic uncertainty. And we did not push sales in an environment of low investment yields. In total, the new business volume declined by 14% in terms of annual premium equivalent and was not sufficient to compensate for the expiring business in our books.</p>
          <p>Only in Belgium business grew. Health insurance showed a marginal fall in premium income. Supplementary health covers rose by 3.2% year-on-year. And we had a slight dip in comprehensive health insurance. Property casualty was stable. Premium in international business was affected by the turnaround initiatives in the sale of our Portuguese subsidiary, whose premium income had been included in the first nine months of 2011.</p>
          <p>The sale of our Korean subsidiary will only be effective as of fourth quarter 2012, so not visible yet. Growth came from the strong German economy. Our German PC business accounted for an increase of 3.1% to &#x20AC;2.6 billion. As in the previous quarters we grew in commercial and industrial business plus 7.7%. In motor, our premium rose by 1.7%, while legal protection was roughly the same as in the first nine month of 2011.</p>
          <p>Primary life, slide 11, had a satisfying result for the nine-month period. As indicated already in August, the high technical and net result in the first half year was partially reversed in the third quarter. Due to the low interest rate expectation, we had to write down deferred acquisition costs with a negative bottom line impact of roughly &#x20AC;30 million. Nevertheless, for the first three quarters, the net profit increased by 58% to &#x20AC;175 million. This was driven by a good investment result with an ROI of 4.4%, 20 basis points was due to the increase in value of our swaption program and another 0.7% from investments for unit linked business, which are not relevant for our bottom line. Some investment gains were realized to compensate for losses from further derisking of the investment portfolio. And also, in order to provide an additional interest rate reserve in German Zinszusatzreserve for the low interest rate.</p>
          <p>Therefore the companies realize some of their valuation reserves. This realizations are reflected in IFRS. The increase of the Zinszusatzreserve is only booked under local German GAAP. More details on the Zinszusatzreserve you can find in the next of the slide deck. We welcome this additional reserve because it will have a dampening effect on policyholder bonuses and will improve competitive discipline.</p>
          <p>The reserve belongs to a couple of regulatory changes, which will gradually improve the framework for German life insurance while we still have to wait for the implementation of Solvency II. My personal take is, in the past we had unhealthy competition for business in a challenging economic environment. Going forward, we should see more rational behavior and product offers, which provide the shareholders with better risk reward features than the traditional portfolio. At least Munich Re will change its product profile in the course of 2013 quite drastically.</p>
          <p>German health, slide 12, the technical result was down mainly due to higher medical expenses and lower lapse assumptions. The investment result developed favorably benefited from not having to absorb write-downs on Greek government bonds like last year. All together both the operating result and the consolidated result improved.</p>
          <p>Property casualty, we had an improved technical result from a slightly better combined ratio and also due to refinement of the calculation of technical interest for the international business. On slide 14, you see the combined ratio for Germany was 1.2% higher than in the first nine months of 2011 and this was partly due to freezing damage, the weather related losses and a couple of random, major man-made claims and also a technical one-off factor from the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>And these man-made claims, I should mention that they are reinsured. So ERGO reinsures itself with relatively small net retentions. But the sessions go to parent company Munich Re AG and they are &#x2013; the reinsurance is eliminated in the intra-group consolidation. So all these numbers are accounted for on a gross basis as large losses in the primary PC segment, which for that reason looks worse than it is in reality. The combined ratio of the international business improved nicely by more than 5% to 99.1%. If you can see on the next slide, there is still some way to go for our Turkish subsidiary. But we can see the first signs of improvement. It is on the right track. There may be setbacks, but the turnaround is working according to plan. It will need some more time. And the development of our Polish subsidiary ERGO Hestia is very pleasing.</p>
          <p>Munich Health; Munich Health is German &#x2013; it's all our health primary business without the German part which is belonging ERGO. So all primary health business plus the worldwide reinsurance business. Gross premiums written were up by 14%, both in reinsurance and in primary insurance. One half of the growth was caused by a foreign exchange effect. In reinsurance, premium income grew mainly in North America, Middle East and in the U.K.</p>
          <p>In primary health, growth was mainly achieved in the U.S., U.K. and with our international business for expatriates. The combined ratio for the nine months was unchanged compared to last year and stood at 99.2%. Reinsurance, a bit better than primary insurance. There was some deterioration due to cuts from U.S. Medicare business. This will also particularly burden our fourth quarter results. Therefore the very strong Q3 result of &#x20AC;58 million, which by the way includes a true-up for the first two quarters. So it's somewhat technically overstated. For the year as a whole, we expect a net result of slightly above &#x20AC;50 million from Munich Health.</p>
          <p>We had a good performance from ours subsidiaries in Spain and also a strong improvement in Belgium. Let's move to reinsurance and we can be very pleased with the development of the two segments here.</p>
          <p>Premiums on slide 20. Overall, plus 8.1%. This is somewhat similar to the currency effect. In property casualty, it's only plus 4% with a foreign exchange impact of 7 percentage points, so an organic decline of 3%. But this is more than explainable by the decline of quota share treaties from our Chinese clients. So these are surplus release treaties which &#x2013; and the decline makes up for almost &#x20AC;600 million or 5 percentage points of net written &#x2013; of gross written premium. So on a fully-adjusted basis, it's plus of 2% and we are very satisfied about it. It fits well to the pricing environment we found in the course of 2012 renewals.</p>
          <p>In Life, plus 15%, almost half from organic growth, the other half based on capital relief deals and the expansion in Asia. 21 life insurance &#x2013; life reinsurance and net result which more than doubled to &#x20AC;390 million and a very good increase in our technical results by 28% to &#x20AC;370 million in the third quarter alone. &#x20AC;150 million, we benefited from good business developments and claims developments in our core markets. We also had a strong contribution from the major capital relief deals. So on balance, we are very satisfied about our life reinsurance business even more for property casualty in such a good year.</p>
          <p>On slide 22, net results &#x20AC;1.9 billion, technical result &#x20AC;1.77 billion. This is mainly due to low major losses in 2012 compared with a very high level in 2011. But it's not only due to good luck, but also very good underwriting discipline, bottom line oriented, very much focused on serving the client with a very broad expertise of Munich Re.</p>
          <p>On slide 23, you see the development of the combined ratio 93.6% for the first three quarters and for the third quarter 89.4%. We have also written on that slide, the development of the run-off of the major losses. We strengthened the reserves by &#x20AC;200 million and the basic losses we could release reserve in the three quarters to an amount of almost &#x20AC;300 million, of which only 20% is from Casualty business and 80% from Property, Aviation and other short tail lines. So the major reserve review is ongoing and there are further reserve releases possible, one could also say probable, especially from the long tail lines, which we have almost not touched yet.</p>
          <p>You know that we continuously set the reserves for the new underwriting and accident year with a conservative approach. This conservatism will be offset by favorable emergence from prior years over time. And for the first three quarters, our basic loss ratio reflects this conservatism, but not yet reflect the outcome of the reserve reviews.</p>
          <p>In my view, it is therefore &#x2013; it doesn't give you a very realistic picture. If you adjust for the reserve releases, relatively small reserve releases which we have already done for the calculation of the basic losses because that can bring a distorted and a somewhat overstated picture of our losses. So I'm pretty confident that we can show a very attractive number when we add up all the four quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me briefly interrupt the comments on 2012 by an outlook for the January 1 renewals. We expect flat to slightly higher prices on average with variations between markets and segments like always. Hurricane Sandy is not a market changing event, but it will likely help to support the pricing in the U.S. and also most probably pricing in catastrophe lines all over the world.</p>
          <p>There is still sufficient reinsurance capacity available. But in our view, the players are aware of the fact that the high shareholders' equities of the respected players are influenced by the very low level of risk free interest rates. And therefore, we expect the market in total to behave in a rather disciplined way. We see positive impulses rising from primary insurance prices, especially in the U.S. and in some European segments. And there is an upward pricing pressure in the long tail lines due to the low yields. Terms and conditions are expected it to remain largely unchanged.</p>
          <p>So far for reinsurance and before starting the Q&amp;A session, I will close with an overview of our outlook for the financial year 2012 on slide 25. So we expect higher premiums than previously. Return on investments could come in a bit higher than 3.5%. But it cannot be predicted precisely due to equity market movements which have an impact on the valuation of derivatives through P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Although we are economically matched, we always have this accounting inconsistencies. I will come to that later. If Sandy had not happened, I would have been able to give you a net target result of substantially above &#x20AC;3 billion. With the remaining uncertainty, we tend to be more restrained. But I'm pretty confident that we could have further substantial reserve releases in Q4 without sacrificing our conservative approach to reserving. The same applies by the way to the prognosis for the reinsurance combined ratio, therefore we stay substantially below 96%.</p>
          <p>ERGO is well on track to meet its target operating result. However, the recognition of expenses for the restructuring of the sales organization will mean that we will be unable to achieve the original envisaged &#x20AC;450 million for the primary insurance segments. Munich Health will probably show a small profit of &#x20AC;50 million on the basis of a combined ratio around 100%.</p>
          <p>And let me stress again, the uncertainty with regard to the IFRS results, it does not only come from further caps or capital market risk, but also from the usual accounting noise. There are distortions between economic and accounting view. From an economic view, we are pretty well matched with regard to currencies or interest rate durations. But due to this inconsistent accounting treatment, small changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates can have substantial impact on our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>If the annual result is good and the general situation allows, we intend to pay a dividend that is higher than the &#x20AC;6.25 paid for 2011. In that case, our capitalization would still remain strong enough for us to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities at any time. So, overall, it seems as if the losses from Hurricane Sandy have brought our results somewhat back into a normal range, but this should still provide a very attractive absolute and relative return level.</p>
          <p>Going into 2013, Munich Re is well on track to capture the business opportunities, which in troubled times offered to those who stand on solid ground.</p>
          <p>With that, back to Christian.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fantastic, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Amazing results. Two questions, the first one, it was interesting; you said Sandy brings your results to more normal level and you've got obviously the stated target of &#x20AC;3 billion. Does this mean that 2013 we should think of upwards of &#x20AC;3 billion as a kind of normal earnings going forward? And then the other question is, can you possibly give a little bit more color on the German primary miss, those one-off claims. The reason I ask that is from experience insurers normally say, oh no, it was a one-off and then they say, well, we dance with it now. And then the third year it's finally dealt with. So there's always a concern that if one-offs arrive first, you kind of think, well actually it may take time to sort out. So, a bit of color on that will be really helpful. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael. To your first question, for 2013, we expect a result which is definitely &#x2013; definitely is always wrong in insurance, but which is substantially higher than our original target for 2012 &#x2013; for 2013. And it would be unrealistic to assume that we can match potential result for 2012, which is supported by very strong investment results and by a very low level of major claims.</p>
          <p>So perhaps somewhere in between, but it's not precise art at the moment and more of a prognosis only in the Analyst Conference in March 2013. German primary non-life I assume, I share your view that there's always concerns that one-off claims can be of a more systematic nature and can repeat. Here, when we talk about one-offs, it's three major claims. And we are pretty sure that these are really random losses and since they fully go into the ERGO account, although being to a large extent reinsured, they overstate somewhat the claims burden at the moment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And also another aspect is in the previous year, we had a special effect from the sale of our Singapore real estate investment and therefore the number was pretty high. So for the time being, I would say, I'm not too concerned having seen the details of the current loss burden for our German primary book.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions please, on the primary life business first. Could you explain the &#x2013; how you funded the increase in Zinszusatzreserve. I think in the slide 31, you gave some possible ways to finance it. I was wondering if you can explain how you did that and what available resources you have going forward to continue to finance that if you need to? And the second question is &#x2013; and also within that, can you just perhaps explain a little bit better the 3Q primary life number because the DAC quite down doesn't fully explain the result there I didn't think? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With Zinszusatzreserve, I cannot say we financed it by this or that gain because it's financed out of the total interest &#x2013; of the total investment income. But we specifically realized some gains, and we realized them to compensate for some losses we had on the de-risking of the portfolio and also for financing the Zinszusatzreserve. These gains showed up due to the low interest rate level. And in a way this fits because on one hand we have the Zinszusatzreserve; on the other hand we have to increase in value of our safe haven bonds. And therefore, in my view, it is economically justified to realize part of these unrealized gains &#x2013; formerly unrealized gains to build up the Zinszusatzreserve. And the beauty of the Zinszusatzreserve is that unlike without that reserve, these gains are not distributed to the policyholders to a large extent, but remain in the company to protect policyholders against very long-term low interest rate levels. Therefore, we very much welcome the Zinszusatzreserve.</p>
          <p>On your second question the write-down of the DAC explains a lot of this effect. So therefore there is not much more. We also had similar effects in earlier years and also on a quarterly level it is always difficult to translate German GAAP accounting into IFRS, and therefore on a quarterly level there are always some distortions. And here there is also some true-up in comparison to the first two quarters, which were relatively high.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just quickly on the Zinszusatzreserve, the matching argument or the concept of locking in gains from interest rates, that works if you had a matched portfolio which you don't on the primary business. Is that fair? And then the second part is the conclusion is you haven't used the RFB to fund or finance that at all yet.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You haven't used the RFB to back into the Zinszusatzreserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's not necessary for the time being. What we could also do is realize all unrealized gains at a time and push them into the RFB and then use the RFB for the later contributions to the Zinszusatzreserve. But we would need the approval of the regulator for such a step. And so for the time being we are not concerned. It's well financed. It can easily be financed. What is important here is that the reference interest rate is based on a basket of AAA European government bonds.</p>
          <p>If France gets downgraded and would fall out of that basket, then we would have a lower reference rate, which could cause some concern. But in such a situation the regulator or the legislator could also easily react and widen this basket again. And we are not fully matched that is true. We have I would say somewhat unavoidable but short duration of our asset portfolio, perhaps less than some competitors. So we do not run high bets here, and we also use the swaption program to protect ourselves against very long-term low interest rates.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, good afternoon. The first one is, when you are talking about the outlook for pricing in the property and casualty reinsurance, you mentioned the positive impetus of price increases at the primary level. I was wondering to what degree do you think there is a risk that actually the primary companies in that environment start increasing their own retention?</p>
          <p>And the second question was you sort of revisited the topic of the product portfolio in primary life in Germany, mentioning that you're going to, sort of, look to change it quite aggressively next year and I know we've sort of talked about the ratios you had been looking up previously, but I wondered if there is any more detail you can give us in terms of what you intend to do on that front? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Spencer, increasing retentions, we don't see that at the moment to a large extent. But it's too early to give you more clarity in the renewal negotiations. But I had the impression from the talks with my colleagues that clients are very much aware of the need of a strong reinsurance protection, also a long-term protection and not fiddling around with it each year. Your second question, product portfolio, in Germany, it's perhaps too early now to give you details because we first have to talk to our sales forces in more details. All the development and the very demanding key projects are well underway at the moment.</p>
          <p>The product will be based on a very limited guarantee, which is far away from what we give at the moment. And with the participation in the capital markets performance, which is based on a concept of funds, the higher the volatility of the capital markets, the lower the participations, because we have higher costs for the hedging and vice-versa. It will not be that easy to explain at, first glance, but we are confident that the attraction for the clients will be very obvious and so we're optimistic that we will bring that product as a success to the market.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Maciej Wasilewicz of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maciej from Morgan Stanley. Thank you very much for taking my question. I have two, if you will. The first question, I wanted to ask about the dividend. Your comment about raising the dividend above last year's level. I actually found a little bit &#x2013; obviously positive, but also little bit surprising, because if I understand your philosophy correctly, you wouldn't indicate the rise in dividend unless you see sustainable earnings also rising into the future. So I'm wondering whether or not we can read from your potential increase of the dividend into a great confidence into earnings into the future. So perhaps, we should be expecting a higher guided net income for next year than perhaps we received this year?</p>
          <p>My second question would be on ERGO. I mean there is some pretty massive changes going on in terms of restructuring of that business in Germany. I just like to hear just a little bit more detail on what you are trying to achieve there. I guess you already told us there is going to be restructuring costs. What kind of a run rate savings you really are expecting? Do you think there will be a negative impact on scale? I mean, if you could just give us just a little bit of color of what you're trying to achieve and what we &#x2013; what changes we're likely to see in the coming years from that project, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maciej, thank you for these questions. Let me start with ERGO, you are right, there are many changes going on at the moment, in my view all in the right direction. The restructuring should bring run rate of savings as of 2014 of &#x20AC;160 million per year. And this is very important to bring down our distribution costs to the necessary extent. We will reduce especially the complexity in steering the sales forces and we will, that is perhaps most important, improve further the quality of the advice for the customer, which perfectly fits to our general philosophy here. So we are confident that the high upfront expenses will be worth that effort.</p>
          <p>Second, on the dividend, you're right. Munich Re wouldn't talk about an increase in dividend if it were not confident to be able to keep increased dividends for the years to come. When I look at our capitalization and I have to blame myself a little bit for having raised some doubts, because of 2011 after the earthquakes. Because at no time we were in any danger here. We had just lost some money and therefore some buffers, but we were always in very safe territory. But since the capitalization has increased substantially, we are in the course of refilling our equalization reserve at a higher pace than originally anticipated with a reservation now of the Hurricane Sandy where we do not exactly know the outcome. But perhaps also taking into account the losses from Sandy and in spite of the strengthening of the utilization reserve, our revenue reserve increased nicely and according to our plans, we'll be increasing during the next couple of years and these plans are not very aggressive. So there is a lot of confidence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think we should be looking at the IFRS guidance of &#x20AC;2.5 billion for this year as being perhaps underneath what you expect in future years because I mean, I know that the actual German GAAP is the most important for actually constricting what you can pay. But I'm guessing that we should probably be expecting an increase in IFRS as well. Otherwise, you wouldn't be telling us that the dividend could be raised?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, what you say. And in eternity IFRS and German GAAP will lead to the same number. But IFRS is highly distorted by effects like foreign exchange or by movements of interest rates which effect of the derivatives which go in the revaluation through the P&amp;L whereas the underlying doesn't move. So it's a bit more difficult for us to predict IFRS than German GAAP, because German GAAP is based on the principle of the lowest value between market value and the purchase value. And so it's much more stable.</p>
          <p>And even in case of an increase in interest rates, we have possibilities to change the bookkeeping to push part of our fixed interest portfolio to maturity and by that immunize it against the effect of increasing interest rates. So I can never say we are certain. But our confidence has clearly increased during the last 10 months I would say.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two question, one related to ERGO as well just in terms of the restructuring and I understand that it's still in discussion in terms of when you can actually take it through your P&amp;L. But if it were in Q4, would you &#x2013; are you still comfortable with your guidance of &#x20AC;3 billion and also I think &#x2013; I saw in the press that there might be a new program on top of the sales reorganization, would that be included in the restructuring cost and the &#x20AC;160 million of cost savings run rates that you have been mentioning?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on Hurricane Sandy and really appreciate that you are giving us some guidance or indications that your loss might be, and I understand that it's still highly uncertain. But just to have a little bit more understanding what kind of assumptions you have, could you maybe give us a little bit of an indication of what kind of market losses you're assuming underlying and also maybe talk us through a little bit about your market share in the Northeastern region of the U.S? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on ERGO, the restructuring is an isolated project and has to be distinguished against the normal or from the normal savings initiatives which are always underway and the talks in the German press were based on an internal paper, which showed that the cost savings initiatives will be always ongoing, like a very normal thing in a company in a changing industry and therefore, it is not part of the restructuring expenses and therefore there will not be reserve for that purpose.</p>
          <p>But we should see more savings in the years to come. Our profit estimation of roughly &#x20AC;3 billion is including the impact of this restructuring expense, which will be reduced by the impact of taxes and the policyholder participation. With regard to Sandy, this is a very difficult one. So we have our own first internal studies, but since our experts, our scientists here are always keen on going out only with somewhat more mature material. They have asked me not to disclose something which does &#x2013; it's not standing on safe ground.</p>
          <p>Our estimation of this market loss is based on the high-end of the current range. We read in external sources here between &#x20AC;7 billion and &#x20AC;20 billion, perhaps even higher. But since a notion like middle triple digits euro amount is very wide, that doesn't help you a lot. I'm very sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it just seems when I look at sort of the mid-point, maybe &#x20AC;500 million loss, that's &#x2013; if you take a &#x20AC;20 billion insured loss, it seems like somewhat small share of about 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I can only confirm what you say. But please bear with me. I don't want to be more precise because it would be pure speculation. And also, our share in the market loss is not proportionate. So when we have a market loss of say some &#x20AC;5 billion, we have relatively low share. When we have a market loss of some &#x20AC;100 million, we also have a low share.</p>
          <p>And in between, there's a relatively high participation of re-insurers because the programs are fully intact there. But they are more or less all triggered. And therefore, it is not so easy to give proportional and constant share in total loss which has not been known yet.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I just had one question really, I'd like to sort of come at it two ways. What is the sustainable pace of reserve release? You're on pace this year to have really very large releases again for the full year. And you're going to &#x2013; you said at the beginning, it's unfair if analysts maybe just took that out and just looked at the underlying accident year performance. But it's awfully hard for us to judge what lumpiness maybe in reserve releases. So, I don't know, perhaps you would say, what the size of buffer goes into the balance sheet when you establish your year one accident year loss ratio? Or perhaps, you would want to comment on &#x2013; if you just looked at the bottom line, calendar year combined ratio for 2012 and just maybe we should ignore the detail and just take the bottom line and make it a little bit better, about the same in 2013. How would you suggest we should be approaching this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian. It's again difficult because now to give you guidance without anticipating and giving in prejudice for what will happen in the fourth quarter is very difficult. And I can tell you I have the auditor in my neck. If I knew what the reserve release would be in the fourth quarter, then I would have to do it immediately. So, we have a very well organized process. We get a range of reasonable best estimates. There is a midpoint and we have always been at the very high-end of reasonable range. If we would leave everything as it comes out of our books perhaps, we would be out of that range, north of that range and therefore, they would be &#x2013; we would be forced to release reserve.</p>
          <p>Anyway, it's what we call the bow waves. We had &#x2013; since we had so bad experiences up to 2005, we tend to be perhaps more on the conservative side and reserve all losses in a more conservative way and then release reserves also perhaps a little bit slower than that could be. So, sorry, like with the Hurricane Sandy, I can't give you a better indication for the time being.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if I could just, a factual historical question, what degree of buffer has been established to date as you book your accident year loss ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also not so easy to define what is a buffer because there is a range of right numbers in a way and it depends on how you want to position yourself. So a couple of years ago we said that we would go for a 3% buffer on our claims reserve. I would guess this is not a sufficient range. We are clearly above that range at the moment. We will most probably increase in the course of 2012 our confidence level even further, even after the reserve review in the fourth quarter, but going forward we become more and more confident on the quality of the underwriting years 2002 and following. And that will have an impact on what we regard as being conservative or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, one on the return on investment at Q3, we had 3.9%, you have now the forecast 3.5% for the year. Why are your sort of scaling down given the outlook for equity markets are actually quite stable towards the end of year and what is your outlook going forward on this one?</p>
          <p>And secondly, the tax rate, could you please provide some color, why it is now at 16% and again what is sort of the going rate on this? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with the tax rate. The tax rate is low for a couple of reasons. Our normal Group tax rate is 33%. That is the tax rate we pay in Munich here for fully taxable income. It is lower because we still have losses carried forward for which we have not set up deferred tax assets, because we have a lot of income in territories, which have a lower tax rate and this mostly affects reinsurance. And for very specific one-off reasons going forward, I would guess between 20% and 25% is reasonable to expect here.</p>
          <p>With regard to the decline of investment results, you're right that our estimation is perhaps somewhat low. We do not expect more realized gains for the last quarter. So we have stopped trading wherever it would trigger the realization of gains, especially in reinsurance because we do not want to speed up the reduction of our running yield and we also calculate here the impact of a slight increase in interest rates. But this is also part of the prognosis, but there's nothing negative to expect with regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The interest rates, I mean, although you expect a slight increase, even though it has &#x2013; even recently been shrinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a very complex task to do such planning and prognosis for Group. So we have to set interest rates at a given date and have the whole system, which is composed on a couple of hundred companies and a couple of accounting centers all around the world to calculate at the same date. And it's not so easy to adjust that on a daily basis. Therefore, there's a slight increase of interest rates involved in that number, but not to a large extent.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from William Hawkins of KBW. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you very much. Two questions, both on the primary business. Could you just go back to your tax charge in your life business and maybe just help me understand if there's any way I could do sensitivities from the outside about what future risks may be? I mean I ask because my understanding is the DAC asset is your old style Zum from German GAAP. And that should be incredibly prudent. And so there should almost never be any circumstances in which you have to impair it. So the fact that on a gross basis you've just impaired 4%, just sort of worries me that this is the thin end of the wedge. So, if you could just help me understand, I've no idea how to do any sensitivities about the vulnerability in the remaining &#x20AC;5 billion. I think it's that number in the primary life.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in your non-life business, you've flagged once again the growth in commercial and industrial lines in ERGO, that's not historically a core skill. One of your friendly competitors is showing that it can be very expensive to try and poach that business from third-parties. So how exactly is ERGO able to win industrial business without just pricing incredibly competitively? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, start with your second question, William. It is not true that it is not the core skill of ERGO because we are not talking here about the very big accounts. And ERGO has been historically very successful with commercial business on a very selective and highly professional underwriting approach and as a follower for other programs. And we observe the performance and it's very satisfying.</p>
          <p>And also what they are doing in the current expansion is pretty conservative. They stick with their knitting, I think is the phrase here, and do not expand into areas where they do not have any expertise. So I'm more optimistic with regard to that. With regard to the deferred acquisition cost, as far as I know and it's confirmed here by my colleagues around me, the deferred acquisition cost is calculated using U.S. GAAP rules and not German GAAP rules.</p>
          <p>So this is kind of application of IFRS as long as we do not have decent standards for valuing insurance contracts, which we would hopefully get very soon with IFRS 4. And therefore, <mark type="ph" /> same account (01:06:46) cannot easily be transferred to the DAC calculation. I can't give you the sensitivities for the DAC charge. I asked colleagues what and when can we expect for the next couple of quarters. And they said nothing. If the interest rates decline by another 100 basis points or so, then we would have another very substantial write-down, but they are not so fragile as they might look like at the first view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I appreciate it. It's not a killer issue for the whole Munich Re regroup, but it strikes me that the 4% charge raises as many questions as it answers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that quite well. And we also rose these questions, but found that the calculations are rather stable. But you must see where the interest rates come from. So they declined by 70 basis points or so in the course of this year. So this is quite, quite heavy. And when you apply that to an even conservative calculation, then the outcome is perhaps not so surprising. Thank you, William.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have one question. That's regarding your dividend. Given the strong result now for 2012 and also the strong capitalization that you referred at the beginning of your presentation, does this change your view also in respect to dividends versus share buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Frank. Thank you. I've been telling during the last couple of weeks and I personally haven't changed my mind that this is not the right time for share buybacks for a couple of reasons. One is, 2011 was a year of extremes with regard to natural catastrophes. Therefore we have to refill our equalization reserve and would like to have achieved higher level than we have at the moment before talking about aggressive capital repatriation.</p>
          <p>Then we look at the sovereign debt crisis, the banking crisis around us, crisis is not over. Strong capitalization can be of enormous value in the competition. Then the introduction of Solvency II, we have not given up hope that it will come one day. And what we also see and where we prepare ourselves is not only our own duties as a regulated entity, but also in the course of our advisory of clients, we see that people more and more look at market, valuation methods that will be used under Solvency II, that it will influence the practice of reinsurance buying over time, perhaps not today, but tomorrow and not only with the implementation. Therefore, we see a lot of chances now, and therefore, we think that this is not the right time for doing share buybacks. We are very much in favor of a dividend increase also based on what we discussed before, our confidence with regards to our cash and earnings originating capabilities. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We will now take our next question from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hi there, Thanks for taking the question. Two quick questions, first of all just going back to the running yield and the running yield outlook, so &#x2013; but also I'm referring to recurring income yield. If I look at the reinsurance division standalone, at the nine months 2011, the running yield was 3.9%; at the nine months 2012, the running yield stands at 3.4% according to slide 35. So, it's declined 50 basis points year-on-year, obviously I'd expect it to continue declining that seems like quite an aggressive rate of decline. Can you just give us some sense as to what rate of decline you expect in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>And, I guess, it could accelerate, again, because you have realized and you've been doing some portfolio shifts, which may accelerate the decline in the near term, so just to be clear specifically for the reinsurance business? Second question, I am sorry to go back to the primary life business. I am still confused at what point there would be any kind of capture in IFRS versus the adjustments you made on their local cap accounting with respect to the Zinszusatzreserve? What circumstances would there be where IFRS results would be impacted by this Zinszusatzreserve charge? I am sorry if you explained, I am still not clear when that would occur?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, second question, again first, difficult to answer because these are totally different accounting methods and the DAC impairment is the first time of the low interest rate and the stress under which we are here. Apart from &#x2013; it is pretty resilient for the timing. Our best calculation we have is market consistent embedded value, which we by the way will again calculate on the basis of our traditional market consistent measures, not taking into account liquidity premia and so on, but we will get the necessary sensitivities to allow you to compare it. And running yields, we have a double effect, one is that of the increase in market values and the other is the effect of the reinvestment and both accumulate. So, the more the market values increase, the lower the return, which has been calculated here against the market values.</p>
          <p>So, the 50 basis points are pretty high, 20 basis points of that due to the increase in market values and another 30 basis points in the reshuffling of the portfolio. And since reinsurance has a lower duration than primary insurance and a different asset profile, also lower risk profile. If I may talk about risk in the quarter, for example, sovereign &#x2013; the different composition of the sovereigns, the reinsurers have lot of U.S. treasuries and have German-bond portfolio whereas ERGO has a more mixed portfolio. So, therefore, it's not surprising what we see here.</p>
          <p>We do not expect the same pace of decline in 2013 rather in the order of 30 basis points instead of 50 basis points. But it's still declining. And therefore, the reinsurance prices must compensate it at least partially and we believe they will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful on the running yield. I mean, I guess just to comment on ERGO or the primary life, it sounds like the visibility you have on the IFRS results of the primary life business which has always been low, is even lower than normal, particularly given the extreme disconnect now going on between local GAAP and IFRS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is true. And you see especially on a quarterly basis how difficult it is because we have this true up from one quarter to the next because it's totally different accounting rules, which are constantly, how can I say, recalculated and then you have shifts in that or the other direction which on a quarterly basis can be substantial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You have given guidance in the past. I think it was &#x20AC;100 million technical result roughly for primary life &#x2013; I think that was the number. Most of it was technical operating presumably you wouldn't want to give any sense of the kind of profit run rate we can expect from primary life at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What Nikolaus told last time was &#x20AC;100 million net result. And since we have been above that number in the first three quarters, there is still some buffer downwards and we do not expect high profits in the final quarter. But even with the &#x20AC;170 million or so for a year we would be rather satisfied. For us to make it clear, primary life is about protection of the shareholders fear not about raising a lot of profits, out of it in that low interest rate environment. And this is by the way also the reason why we invest constantly in the cost for the swaptions, which we buy in order to protect us partially against a lower reinvestment environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh! Great, thank you. Thank you, J&#xF6;rg. Just one thing here. On this duration issue posted on slide seven. I noticed that the liability duration &#x2013; so the duration of liabilities for reinsurers is also moving quite a lot. It used to be &#x2013; not a quite a lot &#x2013; used to be 6.7% at 2Q and then it's coming back to 6.4%. Even your primary insurance duration had increased a bit in 2Q and that would have been expected because of convexity because of low interest rates but even that is going down.</p>
          <p>And I would appreciate any comments around this duration on the liability side. And on the same topic, just want to confirm that the asset side of the reinsurance has moved down as well, and your equity hedges are also moving down. So, is that meaning that you are trying to take more risk on the investment side, so if that is allowed is as one question? I'll be grateful. And second question is more simple or more straight forward not simple, but page 25 has the target and the difference between the sum of these parts, the reinsurance plan, Munich Health. And the &#x20AC;3 billion is it all due to restructuring charge at ERGO, and just on that point is that also factoring in and there is also a mention in the report of a legal judgment on ERGO, sorry if had too many questions, but they are two topics really. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There seems to be &#x2013; yeah, there seems to be a judgment in third quarter end. I think I have made a note of the report where this is mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's in page 13 of the note.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I remember. Yes. Thank you. So, first of all, the restructuring will go perhaps with 50% to the shareholders, 50% to the policyholders, but it's premature to say it at the moment because it's also dependent on the interest rate level and how it will be calculated. So your sum of the individual quarterly results has been set up nicely. That is correct. Because we now book on a fully consolidated basis and so these profits can be added up.</p>
          <p>And on the liabilities &#x2013; on the asset liability matching, on the duration matching, <mark type="ph" /> Joe Rexine 79:55) will help out. But first I cannot confirm that we are on a risk on policy at the moment. So I would say moderate risk policy, not much change because we have recently done, again, again and again studies what could be the potential future economic scenarios and how we are positioned and we found that our current portfolio provides us with enough protection on each side. Joe on the duration of the liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is Joe. The duration of the liabilities, as you already alluded to is driven a lot by convexity. So it's not so much the cash flow profile that changes, but it's really the interest rate level with the convexity that changes the duration of the liabilities. And that's not only true for the primary insurance liabilities, but also actually for reinsurance liabilities in particular, in the currencies of U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar, we have quite some convexity in the cash flow profile as well, which changes the duration number when interest rates go up and down. And that's what happens from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your last &#x2013; sorry, Vinit, your last question on these legal lawsuits. These are more or less a constant phenomenon here in Germany. A number of very similar cases, which are brought up by consumer protection organization, we had already set up reserve in the past and it's not so easy to distinguish all these cases from each other.</p>
          <p>And what they mostly have in common is that the question whether and how much we are negatively affected is dependent on the proportion of policyholders, who will take up their rights and therefore we do some assumptions and they change over time, and therefore, after these newest court ruling from the highest German civil court, we chopped up the reserves in the third quarter by some &#x20AC;10 million. Does this answer your question Vinit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just a very small clarification, if I can. Just when we add three numbers we get &#x20AC;3.2 billion on slide 25. And I was just confirming that the &#x20AC;200 million difference is actually a growth restructuring impact, is it? Or is that not &#x2013; it's a tradition not to be performed because it's slightly different <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:22:59) it is not a big thing, but just?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps there is a little bit conservatism bias in India. So this restructuring charge will not be that high. I can almost exclude that. Because if you take the $160 million savings, and you can apply normal factors perhaps in our case a bit more because the restructuring of sales organization is quite demanding. Therefore, we do not &#x2013; but we do not expect such a big charge for the net profit. But the reason why we can't talk about it is only that we are in negotiations with our staff representatives, and therefore we do not want to present a final number here on the table. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I've just got two questions. The first one is a very simple one. Hurricane Sandy, sorry to come back to this, but what do you expect the loss to be between insurers and reinsurers. Second one is, kind of, looking at demand for next year in terms of solvency relief deals on what geographies do you think you'll get a bit of demand from in 2013? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kamran. Difficult question, the first one; since we do not know the amount of the loss, and the sharing between primary and reinsurance is highly dependent on this amount and also on the various specifics here what do they come from; how much comes from commercial, how much comes from private insured, with the private insured there's a national flood program involved. So it's very complex. And before speculating here or serving you with half truth we would rather like to refrain at the moment from more speculation here.</p>
          <p>With regard to the solvency relief deals, that is a difficult one. I hear more and more colleagues talking about negotiations. They typically go over months before you enter into a deal. And very often, the hit rate is very low, yes. But you get after a long, long time of common work with the client. In the end it is not feasible to find a common solution here. In general, I would say they have a higher importance over time because it's a very effective capital management tool. And since the regulatory requirements get more demanding, we are very much &#x2013; we are very optimistic of their size. But I can't quantify it at the moment because it's highly uncertain.</p>
