        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Doug, and welcome aboard. Good morning, everyone, and you can thank you for joining us. If you take a look at slide four, you'll see that this quarter was a break-out quarter for Dow. Our results clearly demonstrate our accelerating momentum and our disciplined, determined focus on execution. We are firmly on our performance trajectory, a fact you can see across multiple fronts and, most importantly, by our robust top and bottom-line growth.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share were up substantially, nearly double the year-ago period. We delivered EBITDA of $2.4 billion, representing the second highest result in our company's long history. And once again, we delivered significant margin expansion with Coatings &amp; Infrastructure and Performance Products, in particular, achieving significant margin gains. In fact, in Performance Products we achieved year-over-year margin expansion in every business. This segment expanded margins by more than 500 basis points and also drove margins higher sequentially.</p>
          <p>And also, our Chemicals &amp; Energy and our Plastics segments benefited from our positive U.S. Gulf Coast feedstock and energy fundamentals. These strong results were also fueled by record sales in EBITDA in Health &amp; Agricultural Sciences, another quarter of strong performance from Electronic &amp; Specialty Materials, as well as broad-based volume growth and rigorous price management across our portfolio. Our results illustrate that we did exactly what we said we would do, even in the face of headwinds, notably the high and volatile feedstock costs. We were focused and we executed. And speaking of execution, we also delivered against another key priority, namely continuing to enhance our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>We told you we would further strengthen our balance sheet and to that end, in the first quarter, we paid down $2.5 billion in high coupon debt, which is immediately accretive to earnings. We maintained our focus on delivering value to stockholders, demonstrated by our recent announcement to significantly raise our dividend.</p>
          <p>This is the power of Dow in action. These results reflect a company with a powerful and diverse portfolio, an expanding geographic presence and an increased capacity for investments in growth.</p>
          <p>We have the momentum to deliver and catalysts that will further propel our growth. And I'll provide an update on these in a few moments.</p>
          <p>But, before we get down to business, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the recent tragic events in Japan, which remind us of the fragility of life and extend our ongoing sympathies and support to the people of that nation. Our Dow team moved quickly to assess the situation and we are pleased to say that we fully accounted for the safety of all Dow employees in Japan. I'm extremely proud of the team's efforts in the aftermath and the continued focus as Japan and its people begin the rebuilding process.</p>
          <p>While the event brought relatively minimal impact to Dow's operations in the region, it is clear that the need for assistance is paramount. In response, Dow and its employees have donated $6 million in aid and we hope our contributions can help expedite the country's efforts to rebuild. Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Japan, our Dow family, communities and partners who are coping with the aftermath.</p>
          <p>And now, turning back to the quarter, let me hand it over to Bill to provide greater detail on our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andrew. Before I begin, I'd like to remind you that this information is on a year-over-year basis and that sales comparisons exclude divestitures and earnings comparisons exclude certain items, unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>Starting on slide five, our earnings were $0.82 per share, excluding certain items, which totaled $0.28 in the quarter. $0.26 of the certain items were related to our proactive retirement of high coupon debt in the quarter. On a reported basis, earnings were $0.54 per share. Now, let me turn to volume and price trends.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide six, we experienced demand growth in every operating segment in every geographic area. We saw particular strength in Electronic &amp; Specialty Materials and Health &amp; Ag, both of which were up double digits. Geographic growth was led by Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as Asia Pacific. From a emerging geography perspective, demand growth was led by Eastern Europe, up 13%, and the emerging regions in Asia Pacific, which were up 11%.</p>
          <p>Moving to price on slide seven. Andrew mentioned our disciplined focus on price volume management. Our discipline in this area more than offset a $700 million increase in purchase feedstock energy costs. This enabled us to drive solid margin expansion across most of our operating segments.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn and review each of our operating segments starting with Electronic &amp; Specialty Materials on slide eight. This segment experienced broad-based volume growth, driven by strong demand in both Displays technologies and Growth technologies.</p>
          <p>Specialty Materials reported demand growth in all geographies. Current quarter results were slightly impacted by the tsunami in Japan, which flooded our liquid separation facility. As a result, we wrote down $22 million of damaged property and inventory in the quarter, although we continue to monitor and assess the situation, working closely with both suppliers and customers in the region. Looking ahead, we expect any impact to our businesses will be modest, a similar &#x2013; sorry, similar to the impact that we saw in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Coatings &amp; Infrastructure. Price and volume gains enabled the business to deliver an EBITDA increase of more than 30% and margin expansion of 230 basis points. The most significant driver was Dow Coating Materials, where margin increased significantly. The business benefited from improved fundamentals in the epoxy value chain, coupled with strong margins in our architectural segment due to our focus on bringing innovations to the marketplace.</p>
          <p>Moving to Health &amp; Ag. Volume gains of 14% drove this segment to new sales and EBITDA records in the quarter. Most notably, Seeds, Traits and Oils demand was up more than 25%, with significant volume increases in corn seeds in both the U.S. and Brazil. Cottonseed sales were also up significantly, driven by an increase in planted U.S. acres. We expect to gain share in this area again this year.</p>
          <p>In Performance Systems, we achieved double-digit sales growth, with price increases in every geography. Margins were impacted by the significant increase in propylene cost, however, we expect margins to recover over the next several quarters. Our Performance Products segment demonstrated strong price and volume discipline, leading to significant margin expansion. In particular, we received -- we achieved accruement in our thermosets envelope, namely epoxy and polyurethanes.</p>
          <p>Turning to Plastics on slide ten, polyethylene supply demand fundamentals remain strong and customer inventories levels low, enabling the business to deliver significant EBITDA gains. The main growth in Asia continues to be robust and as a result, our enhanced footprint in Thailand.</p>
          <p>And finally, Chemical &amp; Energy sales were up 16% and EBITDA improved due to our strong focus on price and margin management.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close with a few additional comments. We have delivered another quarter of strong equity earnings, reaching nearly $300 million. We retired $2.5 billion of gross debt in the first quarter, which will reduce our annual interest costs by nearly $200 million. In addition, we plan to reduce gross debt another $1.2 billion in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, as we look ahead I'd like to close with a few comments on the second quarter of 2011. We expect revenue to continue to increase, driven by continued pricing momentum and a steady improvement in demand led by the emerging geographies. Interest costs will be lower, due to our recent debt reduction actions and equity earnings are expected to remain strong, supported by high crude oil and NAFTA prices.</p>
          <p>Based on current trends, our hydrocarbon and energy costs will increase sequentially by approximately $500 million. Planned turnarounds will be up sequentially as we enter the summer months. In Health &amp; Ag Sciences, we'll be down sequentially, in line with normal seasonality.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn it back over to Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill. If you'll turn to slide 12 as we power our way to our new earnings profile, let me describe for you some catalysts that we consider new found tailwinds that will drive our earnings trajectory further. This is, in essence, the power of a transformed Dow, one that continues to execute against its transformational agenda.</p>
          <p>We delivered a tremendous 2010, and are now -- and now follow that with a strong first quarter in 2011, that puts us well on our way toward our near-term goal of $10 billion in annual EBITDA. The following strategic catalysts will help drive our growth further, the direct result of our team's efforts to unlock additional value for our shareholders and strengthen our bottom line: a renewed stronger portfolio, integration strength and feedstock advantage that is second to none in the industry especially in the United States and Canada, strong growth in the emerging regions of the world, an accelerating innovation pipeline, further enhanced financial flexibility and an intense focus on productivity and efficiency drive that we will provide more details on in the near future.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 13, central to our transformation is our renewed portfolio and the improvements we had delivered over these last several years to power our growth moving forward. Clearly, our Advanced Materials and Agro Sciences divisions are large platforms for growth, with robust strategies and methods in place to drive this growth. But, also compelling are the actions we have taken in our Basics and Performance businesses, trimming non-core assets, combining certain businesses to capture synergies, looking for opportunities to partner and having strong leadership in place.</p>
          <p>As a result, we have fundamentally redesigned these divisions by significantly shifting their mix towards performance and downstream businesses. Take for example our chemicals footprint, where we -- which we have right-sized through joint ventures and other measures to align with growth in our downstream Performance businesses, enhanced our cost position and ultimately improved the profitability of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>But, we also took action with our Plastics businesses, the strongest franchise in the industry. We knew it could be stronger. Our strategy here has been consistent and straightforward, streamlining to move away from commodity Plastics and moving faster into high-margin specialty Plastics. And we've executed by shutting down and divesting various portions of this division. An example of this was the sale of Styron last year.</p>
          <p>Because of the actions we have taken, this division has been totally reconfigured and reformed into our Performance Plastics division, and is now better positioned to deliver higher and more sustainable margins. Note that we will continue to explore alternative options for the less-differentiated and non-strategic portions of this division. The key growth businesses in this division are our technology-differentiated plastics, including solution polyethylene and elastomers plus market-focused units such as Wire and Cable and Dow Packaging and Converting.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 14. You can see, by bringing these businesses together, we are creating a singular focus and a unique set of solutions for customers in industries such as Packaging, Health &amp; Hygiene, Electronics &amp; Telecommunications. Take Packaging, for example, where we bring the industry's broadest and most comprehensive toolbox of technologies to bear for this segment. From oxygen barriers to tie layers to adhesives, the combination of these products allows us to deliver unique packaging solutions and collaborate up and down the value chain with equipment manufacturers, converters, brand owners and leading global retailers.</p>
          <p>We've also taken similar actions in Health &amp; Hygiene and Electrical &amp; Telecommunications, and we're creating a new innovation S-curve with specialty polyolefins with our leading Elastomers franchise. Especially market segments like these demand and reward new technology innovation. In fact, close to 40% of the products sold into these market segments are less than 5 years old. We are bullish on this division, in part, because it is well positioned. We know our technology and brand leadership differentiates us in the marketplace, and equally compelling is the advantage from our significant economies of scale and strong back integration into feedstocks. That brings me to the next catalyst. Our integration strength and access in the shale gas dynamics in the United States to enhance our business performance due to increased supply and better back integration opportunities of NGLs.</p>
          <p>On slide 15 you can see that, as you know, integration is one of our greatest strengths. We have long said that we believe any specialty chemical company must have both technology differentiation downstream as well as active integration upstream for cost competitiveness. The specialty chemical company graveyard is littered with companies that didn't understand the strategic importance of integration. Dow, on the other hand, is the largest, most integrative and most feedstock flexible ethylene producer with the broadest, most well-developed infrastructure.</p>
          <p>Last week, we made a series of significant announcements that will enhance our production capabilities for feedstocks on the U.S. Gulf Coast and, equally as important, the secure access to ethane. This is core to our strategy, enabling us to increase our range of feedstock flexibility toward ethane while also preserving the capability to conserve the other feedstocks. These actions will help to ensure supply of cost-advantaged raw materials for our downstream businesses while protecting against volatile energy markets.</p>
          <p>The announcement stated that we will restart an existing ethylene cracker and increase ethane stock flexibility for several other crackers on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And taken together, these actions will increase our ethylene production capabilities by as much as 20% in the United States over the next two to three years and allow us to deliver as much as 90% of our North American ethylene from ethane.</p>
          <p>But we're not stopping there. As the clear industry leader, we're taking steps to connect the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Marcellus Shale Gas Basin for ethane supply to our U.S. Gulf Coast assets through our announced MOU with Range Resources. This will give us access to the liquids from the Marcellus region, in particular for our operations in Louisiana and complements the ethane and propane supply contracts that we already have in the Eagle Ford Basin and other shale gas regions.</p>
          <p>Finally, we announced plans to build a new world-scale ethane cracker which will start up in 2017. This cracker will be advantaged based on shale gas-derived natural gas liquids.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 16, you can see that integration in the propylene chain is equally important, which is why we also announced construction of a new, world-scale on-purpose propylene facility at our Freeport, Texas site, and pushing ahead with commercializing our new propriety technology in a second facility to be completed by the end of this decade.</p>
          <p>We are already fully integrated in the propylene chain in all areas of the world, with the exception of the U.S. Gulf Coast. These investments will reduce our net purchases of propylene to less than 10% of our total use in the United States. Collectively, these investments are on strategy and will strengthen the vast majority of our performance businesses in the America's as well as enhance their position to capture future growth. Our downstream performance businesses are at the heart of our transformation, so access to competitively priced raw materials is more than critical, it's essential to insuring these businesses can grow even faster and more profitably tomorrow.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, turning now to our investments for growth in emerging regions. Here again, we are  delivering, and our progess report as follows. As you know, last year, a new cracker polyethylene facility was started up through our joint venture in Thailand. We have now brought on-line our new world-scale Specialty Elastomers plant at the site as well, and we are on track to start up the HPPO plant later this year.</p>
          <p>Our proposed project with Saudi Aramco in Jubail is in the final stages of the feed study and we expect both partners to move to the final approval stage in July. In addition, we have many other investments which are on track in the emerging world, as shown on this slide.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to slide 18. Let me turn for an update on our innovation pipeline, which is another key catalyst for our growth. Our focus in this area is two-fold. We continue to build a rich and valuable pipeline, one of the strongest in the industry. And we are bringing these technologies to market at an accelerated pace. For example, Dow AgroSciences has been investing significantly in these technologies and now many are coming to market. Several of note: REFUGE ADVANCED powered by SmartStax. This gives growers in the corn belt an all-in-one option that saves both time and money. POWERCORE, is a corn insect control technology that will increase productively in Brazil. And we've introduced ENLIST, an advanced weed control system that will help growers advance modern farming by providing robust tolerance.</p>
          <p>Innovations are also accelerating in our Coatings &amp; Infrastructure segment. We launched EVOQUE, a revolutionary development for paint customers. This technology platform not only allows our customers to improve the efficiency of titanium dioxide, but more importantly, it produces a better can of paint, offering enhanced binder performance and improved hiding capabilities. This innovation directly addresses formulators' demands for better titanium dioxide efficiency and enhances our strong position in high-quality architectural coatings.</p>
          <p>Also, we announced the first licensing agreement with Chemtura, for a new flame retardant technology that will become the next industry standard. More sustainable than powder solutions and more effective, this new technology was developed by Dow and comes against the backdrop of an ongoing search for more sustainable products and pending regulatory restrictions on HBCD, the current industry solution, while still providing fire safety solutions for XPS and EPS insulation foam producers.</p>
          <p>Each of these innovations, and these are just a few examples of many, is a game changer. Not just just for Dow but for our customers, and not just for tomorrow but for today.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, the final catalyst that I will note today to enhance shareholder value continues to be our relentless focus on financial flexibility. We've consistently said that we will generate $35 billion in cash from operations through 2015 and that we have enough funds to pursue our three main objectives: deleveraging, remunerating shareholders and investing in the growth opportunities I've talked about today, with room as well for bolt-on M&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Let me also point out that this does not include any award from the arbitration proceedings against PIC for breaching the K-Dow joint venture formation agreement. On that note, the party's  recently submitted their evidence in the arbitration and we anticipate a decision later this year. We remain confident in our position and any positive result will improve our financial flexibility. Taking all of these catalysts together, they will provide continual tailwinds for our earnings power and are geared to deliver tremendous additional shareholder value.</p>
          <p>On slide 20, I'd like to now turn to our outlook. We are seeing improvements in business investment, consumer spending and early signs of job creation in the United States. Loosening credit conditions and firming exports are positive signs of a strengthening recovery as well, particularly for domestic manufacturing. Of course, we will continue to benefit from our flexible advantage feedstock cost position and our continuing actions that tilt our portfolio toward high-margin specialty businesses.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we see two somewhat divergent stories playing out. Northern Europe appears to be maintaining its growth path as business investment continues, particularly in countries where Dow has a prominent footprint. Southern Europe continues to lag as sovereign debt concerns, high unemployment and reduced domestic spending remain headwinds to growth. Conversely, growth in the emerging regions continues to be robust, driven by rapidly growing consumer demand and infrastructure investments. Demand remains strong for technologies that enable leading-edge consumer electronics, coating solutions with a lower environmental footprint and water filtration materials. These are all areas where Dow has a leadership position.</p>
          <p>Even so, we are monitoring rising concerns in inflation and how governments may manage these risks. Should any of these headwinds impact the overall pace of recovery, Dow has intervention-based strategies in place to manage the resulting uncertainty. But let me be clear, taken as a whole, growth continues on a positive path. We are not just satisfied with growing at the pace of global recovery; we continue to create the opportunities that will drive our earnings growth trajectory, which brings me to our priorities, my last topic this morning.</p>
          <p>You can turn to slide 21. You can see that nearly 18 months ago, at our Investor Day in New York, we laid out our strategic and transformational commitments. We said we would drive growth, accelerate earnings, invest in our businesses and reward shareholders. We set the bar high and we believe we could reach even higher. Today it is clear, we're delivering against each and every milestone we laid out and we are firmly committed to maintaining this trajectory.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter results clearly demonstrate that we have fundamentally renewed our portfolio and are making investments that will drive smart growth moving forward. We have a relentless focus on executing against our priorities. This means continuing to pursue strong price volume discipline to grow our bottom line. It means making the right investments, from our upcoming investment decision regarding Dow's proposed joint venture with Saudi Aramco to our focus on innovating more smartly, all of which will grow the top and bottom line.</p>
          <p>It means continuing to strengthen our balance sheet to achieve even greater financial flexibility. Now, we have made great progress on this point, faster than most expected and we will continue our pace. And it means maintaining the safety and reliability of our operations, a hallmark of Dow. We are a company with incredible momentum and we have priorities that will keep us firmly on the path to higher and more consistent earnings growth. It's the trajectory to which we have committed and our commitment knows no limits.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn the call back over to Doug.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Andrew. Now, we will move to your questions. First, however, I would like to remind you that my comments regarding forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures apply to both our prepared remarks and following Q&amp;A.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Question on the Performance &amp; Specialty businesses, because margins clearly saw some pretty big pick-ups year-over-year and even, in some cases, sequentially. I guess I'm wondering, with the recent kind of very recent spike in some of the raw materials, are these sustainable-type levels? Is this the right base to kind of think about going forward or do we take a step back before we step forward? And then as a follow up, on the Electronics margins, even backing out, I guess the onetime issue is tied to Japan. It seems like the margins were maybe a little bit softer than they've been over the last few quarters and I guess I'm wondering what's driving that and how to think about that going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let, John, Bill answer the second question. Let me get the first. You'll remember from our Investor Day in New York 18 months ago, we laid out our roadmap and you may remember that in Performance, the margin expansion in Performance price, Performance Systems businesses was clearly geared towards margin expansion of the growth kind. In other words, price volume management as the economy recovered.</p>
          <p>So, we're going back to where we were in key businesses like urethanes, epoxies. And of course, what also has happened is some resulting tightness in the chain which has come around through capacity rationalizations across the downturn and no new builds. What's going on is what we said would go on which is margin expansion, even though it's not linear, even though quarter to quarter you'll get variability because hydrocarbon and energy costs don't go up in a straight line. The trajectory of margin expansion is what we're firmly on in the Performance businesses.</p>
          <p>And you know, if you look at pre-recession volumes and you look at where Product, Performance Products, Performance Systems, Coatings &amp; Infrastructure, if you like, and even Specialty Materials are, with the exception of Electronics and Specialty Materials, the other three segments are still behind their pre-recession volumes. So, there's still room for growth. We still see room for margin expansion. And yes, there is cost push but we have demonstrated now several quarters in a row in those businesses that we can manage our margins against price volume around the regions of the word so we can get continual margin expansion. Bill, why don't you take on the Electronics, Specialty Materials question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John. A couple things. If you look year-over-year on the combined Electronics Specialty Materials, EBITDA is down $24 million, as you know. But there's really two key things impacting that. One is, as I highlighted in my comments, that Japan impact was approximately $20 million. In addition, if you look at the same quarter last year, we had a favorable tax adjustment on Dow Corning of $22 million. And so, year-over-year, that impacted Dow Corning comparison which is included in that segment.</p>
          <p>So actually, if you exclude those two kind of one-time items if you will, then actually our EBITDA is up. Also, if you adjust those, our actual EBITDA margins are close to 30%. So, those two items actually impact the comparison versus a year ago. As to Andrew's comment, I would tell you and also comments I made in my comments, we've got strong pricing momentum going into the second quarter, both in our Basic and our Performance businesses, so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John, this is Howard. The only other point on Electronic Materials is they expanded margins both sequentially and versus same quarter last year. And on an EBITDA basis versus the fourth quarter, which is typically, you know, one of the strongest quarters between Q3 and Q4. EBITDA and Electronic Material was also up. We don't see really weakness in Electronic Materials. It's all in Specialty Materials because of reasons, that, the one-time reasons that Bill outlined.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, can you help me on the investments you're making upstream now? It sounds like maybe it's not going to be as asset light as we might have perceived 18 or 24 months ago, if you're building ethylene plants and PDH units, maybe investing in Saudi. So, has there been a change of heart there or how to you calibrate those actions with an asset-light approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. It's always an interesting discussion. I had it in my remarks, how sometimes people get confused about what's asset light and what's not asset light.</p>
          <p>One thing that I said in my remarks is, especially chemical companies who have integration in the building blocks such as propylene oxide, acrylic acid, such as ethylene oxide, all of the key building blocks <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:26) really you need that integration to make money in the downstream.</p>
          <p>So, the way we've set up the current Dow is, Performance Products in particular has a lot of these building blocks, and a lot of them are propylene derivitaves, in fact, most of them. When we made the Rohm &amp; Haas acquisition it was very clear to us that back integration of propylene was key. We invested actually, I'm not sure if you followed this, over $500 million in feedstock flexibility in our U.S. Gulf Coast assets over these last five years already.</p>
          <p>We accelerated those increases with the petro-logistics deal, and now what we're doing is one more time accelerating our back integration so we do not have propylene buy. We currently buy 50% of our U.S. propylene, that's not sustainable. The propane advantage, the advantage is moving to propane, not propylene, and that's a whole dynamic I can get into if you wish on some other question.</p>
          <p>But, the propane dynamic is what we're now taking advantage of. The ethylene dynamic is also key. We have Specialty Elastomers, Wire &amp; Cable, we have our solution polyethylene Packing business, we have a lot of our Performance Plastics businesses, our EO derivatives that really need low-cost ethylene advantage versus if you like, market price ethylene. We can't continue to be a buyer of ethylene for those downstream businesses. So, these first tranches are just completing our back innovation.</p>
          <p>The second tranche, the big cracker on ethylene, the 2017 one, is for the growth. We believe the U.S. is entering a growth phase for Performance businesses and to support our Advance Materials business and our Performance businesses, we believe we need to back integrate. So now, do we do equity-light, asset-light on that cracker? We'd be open to conversations.</p>
          <p>If people want to come to us and say, we'd like a tranche for our commodity piece, just like we did with Shintech &#x2013; excuse me, with Mitsui on the chlor-alkali deal we did on chlorine. They have taken the commodity piece with EDC/VCM. We'd be quite happy to do that. But frankly, all of our expansion is all for our downstream Performance businesses here in North America, in U.S. On top of that, we have a large network of pipelines, a current capability on storage. We have very low-cost increments here in the United States and this will go straight to our bottom line.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then, you guys provide the heat map on slide 20 which is really helpful. I think you guys have an interesting and unique perspective globally. Maybe it's getting too fine-tuned here but I noticed you moved European construction to a positive attribution here, positive description. Can you give us a little more color on what might be going right in European construction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, fundamentally, we really have a tale of two Europes and for us, we're very strong and large footprint in Germany and France. The Rohm &amp; Haas acquisition also got us big in France. Frankly, Germany and France are doing great and the construction sector is showing a rebound. There is stimulus around the construction still. We see the right sort of programs there continuing. We see a little bit of spillover from our assets being able to also run at capacity by selling into Eastern Europe and Russia. Russia was very strong for us in the quarter. Russian growth is very, very strong in the building and construction area. And really, what we're seeing there is rigid insulation panels, a certain type of construction required in Russia on rigid insulation panels that our EU business can provide.</p>
          <p>So, that's really the way we see Europe in terms of building construction, why it moved.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we'll move on to our next question from Andy Cash with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. My question is about moving the ethane from Marcellus. We're hearing plans are being made to move it to the Philly area and then by ship to the Gulf Coast. So, if you assume that Congress will approve the reflagging of the NGL ships to transport the ethane, and looking at the cost we're hearing maybe in the mid teen cents per gallon. What sort of advantage do you think you guys would have over, given the volume you guys will be using, what sort of advantage might you have over some of the just generic buyers of ethane on the Gulf Coast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay. So, thank you, Andy. Firstly, as you saw in the announcement, we have the MOU with Range and Marcellus coming into play on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It's clearly the big announcement we made. I mean, in essence, what you should read in this announcement is after six, nine months of work, the Marcellus NGLs, our use of them, the market-making aspect of that in the U.S. Gulf Coast, we believe our infrastructure down on the U.S. Gulf Coast, of all of the capacity I told you about in the previous question is really why we want the Marcellus NGLs down that way.</p>
          <p>And our suppliers are working with us on the most cost-competitive way of getting down there. There's two choices, you talked about marine. That's clearly one, but there's also our pipeline choice. And clearly, both of those will be evaluated. Working with us as an <mark type="ph" /> op taker (38: 28) or even as a small participant, it depends. We're looking at any economic model that lowers the cost for Dow.</p>
          <p>Now clearly, the big question you asked is, is this all going to be advantage Dow on cost. I will say Y &#x2013; E &#x2013; S. We are doing this to be advantaged in our upstream, clearly. Now, we've got a lot of confidential agreements and negotiations going on. You can expect us to be very much a Dow Chemical in the way we get back integration like we've done in Argentina, like we've done in Canada and like we've done in the United States before.</p>
          <p>And that will mean that we will get the natural gas number linked to the ethane number and the propane number in some way. That will make it an advantage on the down side and make an advantage on the upside if the oil to gas arbitrage stays where it is, which we believe it will, for some years to come. Our guys are working on it and the only other piece of information I'll give you is these are all very high DCF projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that sounds very flexible. A question on the operating rate for the quarter. I think you guys said 83% was the average. I was just curious, what impact the unplanned outages may have had and was EQUATE in that 83% and, if not, how is EQUATE doing now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The reported operating rate was 83%. The planned and couple of unplanned outages we had had an impact about of three percentages points. So, if you adjust for those, our operating rate would have been closer to 86%. And no, to answer to your question on EQUATE, no, that is not factored into our operating rate because it's not consolidated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>And moving on, we'll take our next question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>

          <p>Hi, David.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, again, on the Performance Products, very strong results, congrats. Could you break out, though, the impact of phenol-polyurethanes and epoxies on the year-over-year numbers, your year-over-year growth on the EBITDA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In EBITDA, we don't tend to do that. I'm looking over at two IR Directors here on the phone call, which is really kind of doubling up on you, Dave, but we don't tend to break down to that level. But look, the price increases on the phenol chain, the epoxy LER chain, LER itself, the acrylic esters, was all double-digit. The Performance Products total was 530 basis points. And you can assume that between phenol, acrylics and also performance monomers in general, like Butanol, they all went up. What you've got on phenyl is the cumene supply issue, cumene has been short. We're a big producer, so we can capture all that and capture it as chain.</p>
          <p>What you're seeing also, by the way, I didn't answer this in the first question on Performance Products. This is the result of about a couple years of work. We're rightsizing the footprint in key parts of the world to get our tide operations up and running, to get us access to the market in Asia. But also, our epoxy operations in Asia, feeding the Electronics business over there. So, clearly, it's not just because of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:57) push, it's also repositioning the businesses. In particular, in the urethanes, acrylics and epoxy chain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And lastly just on the arbitration, has that been delayed from a mid-year resolution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, I'm the last to tell you how to predict court systems. I'm sure you have your own views. We say late in the year, because we're just basically are allowing the good tribunal and the good judges over there to take the time they need to take and we are just saying later this year because what we now know after the arbitration evidence was submitted, because we didn't know that until obviously this last month, that clearly the timeframe is the timeframe they set based when they do their readings, the hearings and then the ultimate final award. So, we are saying fourth quarter but it's very clear, I'll say it, I've said it many times, I'll say it again, it's very clear that we were wronged and the contracts are very clear.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I will say this, Doug has some very big shoes to fill so good luck there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>9 1/2 Medium? Okay, I'll remember that for my Nike shoes with polyurethane soles to help your Performance Products business. Hey, I'm trying to understand some math here, so your operating rates were 83%, you had 3% downtime, so we should think about that as 86% versus last year 83%. Volumes were up 8%, so did you guys add something like 5% to your capacity year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, okay, so the way this all works is that you've got new capacity coming on, that's the first point, Thailand. I mentioned in my remarks that the cracker polyethylene is now, polyethylene, in particular, is now got the full-year effect in the quarter. So, that's quarter-on-quarter &#x2013; year-on-year comparisons, a big add. We've also got the special elastomers that kicked in during the quarter. We've also got sales to Styron, we've also got capacity released from the cost synergies.</p>
          <p>So, when we put the two companies together, we've improved the productivity of the assets from Rohm &amp; Haas. That's particularly notable at the biggest asset, Deer Park. You may recall, last year we had an issue. We shut it down. That Deer Park is running very, very well and at higher rates. And so, if that all adds up to your math, Frank I'll accept your math but it's basically yes, we have more to sell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, Frank, let me just add a comment there. As I mentioned excluding turn around, we're at 86%. But you need to do the same thing versus the same period a year ago. So, the same period a year ago our reported operating rate was 81%. And adjusted for turnaround same quarter a year ago would have been 84%. So, to do an apples-to-apples you need to compare the 86% to 84%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. I thought I read it someplace that it was flat year-over-year. I might be been mistaken there. And just on the whole capacity, obviously, Dow had been running CapEx below D&amp;A. With these most recent announcements that you put forth, how should we think about your capital spending versus D&amp;A in the near and in the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Frank, to answer that question, as I think we kind of mentioned in the announcements, adding the flexibility we're talking about, starting up St. Charles operations, although we haven't given specific numbers, those are incremental capital projects for us. So you could expect our capital spending to go up, but we believe we'll be able to balance that with our existing capital plan.</p>
          <p>So, for this year our capital budget is $2.4 billion. These projects can be handled within that sort of number. If it gets toward the end of the year, we'll give you a number for 2012. But essentially, not a significant change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Terrific. And then, lastly, you previously announced the shutdowns of your VCM capacity to make room for others entering into that market. What are your thoughts on your Chlor-Alkali footprint, any changes that are going to go on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and Howard's looking at me saying you got a third question in there, Frank, so you're getting a special favor here. Look, we can take it off line, but we're not a VCM investor, we're a Chlor-Alkali investor, we're a Chlor-Alkali investor for our strategic downstream strategy. Therefore, that's why we do Chlor-Alkali. We clearly continue to look at partners who can take the chlorine for VCM, like we have with Shinteck, like we have with Matsui, and that will be continually our strategy, which makes Bob Koort's question around our equity-light. Right back at the commodity part of it we will be looking for partners continually, either through equity or synthetically.</p>

          <p>Hi, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about your European Italian business and what's your outlook there, given high NAFTA prices but also high co-product prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Obviously, you know, the crackers we have in Europe as you just said, liquid's exposed. Clearly, as a consequence of that the diversification of the cracker there doesn't speak to ethane but it does speak to condensate and some butane. So, that's how we manage, if you like, the footprint. Obviously, getting ethane there would be very difficult to do given the European gas situation.</p>
          <p>So, we are getting margins better than expected, mostly because the demand has been solid. Prices have moved up pretty well. You may have seen that in the breakdown of results. But, clearly NAFTA is creating a pinch and so there is a cost push based on good demand. The demand is really driven by what I said earlier, Germany and Eastern Europe, Russia, in particular, for our Dow central Germany cracker in BUNA <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:40).</p>
          <p>And over the years, what we're going to keep doing there is continue to find ways to bring lower cost feedstocks into play but it will be mainly of the LPG kind, P.J., If you look at Asia and NAFTA and you look at what's going on with NAFTA crackers, they have become, clearly, the lowest-margin, highest-cost jurisdiction with Europe being a close second. But, Asia and its pinch points right now, really the ethylene NAFTA trough is here for those producers. Which is why we're taking the steps we've taken in Saudi and we're taking the steps we're taking here in the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on your steps of the United States, the new cracker is for 2017. I mean, that's six years from now, that's a long time. I'm wondering if you're putting that announcement out there just to discourage others from investing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I said it earlier, look, we buy and we buy for our value-added derivatives. We're adding 200,000 tons a year of growth in our downstream value-added ethylene derivatives. We've got ways of doing that between now and 2017, start up of the new cracker. So, it's our calculation on the growth curve. The announcement at 1.5 million tons by 2017 speaks to growth of our ethylene use in differentiated products with our planned focus in the Americas, mostly the U.S. but also some exports through Latin America.</p>
          <p>But at this point, whatever anyone else does, they do. Obviously, as I said earlier, we'll talk to anyone about making things more economic for Dow. But right now, no, I wouldn't say it that way.</p>

Two part question on propylene, first off on the  input side, if I look at some of the U.S. Gulf Coast benchmark margins, the propane crack ethylene has improved really dramatically over the past month. Has it improved enough for you to shift into propane feed and perhaps alleviate some of the propylene imbalance that you've had in recent quarters? That's the first part.</p>
          <p>The second part, if I consider a basket of derivatives, acrylics, oxos, POPG, do you see any opportunities to rework those derivative contracts to lay off some of the propylene monomer risk?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your first question, yes, in fact, we're doing that as we speak. It's very much what you just said and with today's prices, moving from butane to propane makes a lot of sense.</p>
          <p>One of the most significant parts of the announcement for our downstream businesses speaks a little bit to your second question which is back integration all the way back to propane  based on shale gas liquids, is as big of an announcement as the ethylene announcement for us. When we are take our propylene back integration of propane, 90% of our propylene is going to come from our own production, that's a big statement about the future of our ability to make more money here in the United States with all of those derivatives you just mentioned.</p>
          <p>Obviously, the United States is solid, the GDP numbers today showed some weakness. It's weakness of the consumer kind, of the defense spending kind and also, you know, temporary issues around, you know, things like the lack of spend on the housing construction side because of weather.</p>
          <p>We see the U.S. recovery as solid to strong, and the demand for our propylene derivative is solid to strong. So, our price power that Bill talked about earlier on propylene derivatives has remained. We believe because of that, we cannot necessarily go and rework any particular contracts on the downstream kind and on the upstream kind it's frankly, it's our propane cracking that gives us the ability to leverage low-costs inputs.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood and a quick follow up, if I may. You're addressing the longer-term through PDH and the new cracker. Would it not make sense to also address the propylene imbalance by subtraction of propylene-intensive businesses such as polypropylene resin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In the script we talked about the continual move away from commodities. That's on strategy. Dow has a strategy that's very clear. We're going to expand our margins in the downstream and grow with the downstream by having value-added technologies and advance materials, downstream performance businesses and all those products that have a technology commercialization of innovation component, like in our coatings business. Our continued ability to achieve new margins will come from our technology and our ability to market value add and differentiate, for example, in that business our paint customers and give them new technologies.</p>
          <p>In addition, to be competitive on the input, we're going to need, obviously, over time frames to really make our inputs cost competitive here in the United States, in particular, and as a consequence of that, we will continually find ways to shed low-margin non-value add businesses that don't speak to a high-margin value add in the downstream. I don't want to make any firm announcement here, other than commodity plastics that have anything to do with propylene or ethylene in the longer term, will not be part of Dow's future.</p>

          <p>We'll now move to our next question from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew. Question around the equity affiliates. As I look at earnings for companies like <mark type="indiscernible" /> (54:38) and the like in Q1, sequentially, they were up a good 30% or so. So, my question is the relatively sort of flattish equity-affiliate income that we've seen at Dow, is that outage related and if it was, had that outage not happened what would have those earnings looked like in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hassan, Bill Weideman, they weren't impacted by outages. Really, I think from comparison, I don't know what companies you're comparing to, but our equity earnings bounce back very, very quickly, as you know, and so we've actually consistently delivered to the last three or four quarters right up around that $300 million range. And we view that, you know, similar sort of range going forward. But no, it really wasn't impacted by any significant turnarounds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think there is a little bit of softness in ethylene glycol. I think that's fair to say but no, we don't see any signal there that you're reading, Hassan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. And on a slightly sort of different topic. One of the things that seems to have popped up over the last month, month-and-a-half is the paranoia or however you want to characterize it around Chinese demand. And a lot of people are sort of raising question marks around relatively high levels of inventory in China as it pertains to a variety of petro chemicals. What are you guys seeing out in China as it pertains to inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We're not seeing what you just indicated. Look, there's some declining credit growth due to tightening because of inflation. But, the Chinese run it fairly directed. As you know, it's a directed economy, so it's really to avoid the speculative side of property. Household savings is still very high. The five year plan, I was just in China listening to the Premier talk about it, is to stimulate the domestic sector.</p>
          <p>So, any aberrations of the inventory kind are very short term. You'll see that in our results, I mean, China demand has stayed quite strong. I used the word robust, has remained quite robust, first in our numbers and what we see going forward. They're spending on infrastructure, on energy, environment, new materials for aerospace and automotive is very directed. In fact, if you take the number it will astonish you. The next five years they want to spend $1.7 trillion, okay, in these sectors. I don't think we have a lot to worry about there in short terms, aberration details that you mention.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Hassan, for the question. Gentlemen, we have time for one or two more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And we'll take our next question from Don Carson with Susquehanna.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Question on Ag, you mentioned that your corn seed volumes were up nicely in the U.S. Are you just growing with the market, which is going to be up above 4 million acres this year, or are you actually seeing a share increase? And just to continue on that, I know you've got this longer-term goal of 10% corn seed share. Given the strength of Monsanto, Pioneer and now a revitalized Syngenta, is 10% still a realistic goal for Dow's corn seed business in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer to that is, yes, it's still a realistic goal. It's too early in this planting season to talk to what the shares are right now but we're on track to have 70% of our corn portfolio, including SmartStax, in these next two to three years, which is 10% of corn hybrids in 2010, 25% in 2011 and 70% in 2012. That's pretty strong penetration, Don, and I would say to you that our goal of 10% overall organically with a little bit of occasional bolt-on M&amp;A, we expect that to stay very much the goal.</p>
          <p>We think it's been quite successful and of course we've got 2,4-D, DHT just around the corner. So, as far as I'm concerned, our Ag business is on track and they've proved themselves with this SmartStax launch. And now, in 2012 and 2013 around the new DHT launch, Enlist.</p>
