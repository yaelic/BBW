          <p>Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's Oracle Corp. Quarterly Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Bond, Vice President of Investor Relations for Oracle. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. On the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Larry Ellison; President and CFO, Safra Catz; and President, Mark Hurd.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today's discussion, we will attempt to present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. While these forward-looking statements represent our current judgment on what the future holds, these statements are also subject to the risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.</p>
          <p>As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our opinion only as of today, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And, finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or publicly release any revisions to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.</p>
          <p>Before taking questions from the audience, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q4 and for fiscal year 2011. Then I'll review the guidance for Q1 and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments.</p>
          <p>As you can see, we delivered yet another exceptionally strong quarter to complete a fantastic year for Oracle. We continued to have a lot of company-specific momentum, and we executed extremely well throughout the fiscal year, exceeding even our own optimistic expectations quarter after quarter. For the year, we achieved 25% new license growth in Q1, 21% in Q2, 29% in Q3, and including this quarter, we delivered 23% new license growth for the full fiscal year. Our software business is now even bigger than IBM's software business.</p>
          <p>For the year, we delivered 38% EPS growth in Q1, 33% in Q2, 40% in Q3, and including 25% this quarter, we delivered 33% EPS growth for the year, once again way ahead of the 20% growth we promised. Our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year were $2.22, well above the consensus estimate of $1.88 when we started the year. And unlike a few of our competitors, we're not delivering this EPS growth by aggressively reducing our share count.</p>
          <p>Obviously, we are thrilled with our Q4 results. This was Oracle's first $10 billion quarter. New software license revenue was up 19%, to $3.6 billion, accelerating from 14% in Q4 of last year. Currency effects for the quarter were largely as expected.</p>
          <p>We continue to see broad-based geographic and product momentum, as technology and new license revenues were up 18%, to $2.7 billion in Q4, and applications grew 22% this quarter, to $1 billion, with Asia-Pacific particularly strong, including Japan, which grew during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our North America applications business passed SAP a while ago, and now if you exclude Germany, we believe we have essentially caught up to them in Europe. Geographically, the quarter was strong and balanced, with new license growing 16% in the Americas, 24% in APAC, and 22% in EMEA, and the quarter wasn't dependent on any large deals.</p>
          <p>Software license update and product support revenues were up 15%, to $4 billion. Sun hardware system revenues was $1.2 billion for the quarter. We're running the Sun business on a more profit-aware model. Compared to Q4 a year ago, we have made a big move away from selling products at a loss or reselling other companies' products. Rather, we are focused on selling value-added systems, where Sun's differentiation is very clear to our customers.</p>
          <p>For example, non-Sun storage was down significantly. Sun storage and tape grew very well. And of course, Exadata and Exalogic continue to show fantastic growth. This strategy shows up in our hardware gross margins, which were 56% this quarter, significantly higher than the 46% last year. Later this year, I expect the growth of the Sun hardware products to become quite obvious.</p>
          <p>Total revenue for the quarter was $10.8 billion, up 12% from last year. In addition to our strong top-line performance, we're extremely pleased with our non-GAAP operating income of $5.2 billion, 19% higher than last year, as our operating margin extended to 48%. We could be back at pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly, as there remains ample leverage in our business model. For the year, our operating income grew 27%, and even with the Sun hardware business included in our results for the full year, we delivered non-GAAP operating margins only 2 points below our all-time high.</p>
          <p>The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23.3% due to several favorable nonrecurring items, including agreements with worldwide taxing authorities. EPS grew 25%, to $0.75, on a non-GAAP basis. The fact that we were able to put up these top-line and bottom-line results, given our size, once again demonstrates the strength of our diversified portfolio of enterprise products, and the breadth and loyalty of our huge customer base, and the strength of our operating model.</p>
          <p>We now have $29 billion in cash and marketable securities, and operating cash flow increased to a record $11.2 billion for the year, while free cash flow increased to $10.8 billion. As we've always said, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovations, strategic acquisitions, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend, and this quarter we repurchased 12.5 million shares, for a total of $422 million. For the full year, we repurchased 40.4 million shares, for a total of approximately $1.2 billion, and the board again declared a dividend of $0.06.</p>
          <p>Now, to guidance. As you remember, we had a spectacular Q1 last year, with new license up 25%, non-GAAP EPS up 38%, and GAAP EPS up 20%. So, assuming exchange rates remain at current levels, which is right now a positive 5% currency impact on license and revenue growth rates, our guidance for Q1 is as follows: New software license revenue growth is expected to range from 10% to 20%. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from negative 5% to positive 5%, and of course, that does not include the hardware support revenue.</p>
          <p>Total revenue on a non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 9% to 12%. On a GAAP basis, we expect total revenue growth from 10% to 13%. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.45 to $0.48. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.33 to $0.36. Now, this guidance assumes a GAAP tax rate of 29%, and non-GAAP tax rate of 28.5%, which is nearly 4 points higher than our tax rate in the previous year. Now, of course, this may end up being different.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn everything over to Larry for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Safra. Our database business grew 28% in Q4 and 26% for the year. That growth rate is twice as fast as any year this past decade. We're already more than twice as big as IBM, the former number-one and current number-two player in the database business, and we're consistently growing faster than IBM and taking market share away from them. Why is the Oracle Database business suddenly growing so fast? Because we have advanced our database technology to take full advantage of the latest trends in the database market &#x2013; cloud-computing databases, end memory databases, and now big data databases.</p>
          <p>This year, we did a number of cloud computing deals, including a very large one with Salesforce.com last quarter. And this quarter, we did one with the biggest and best name in mobile devices and cloud computing in the world. That deal included our database software, Exadata machines, our cloud computing billing system, and our cloud e-mail system that scales to millions of users. It's all based on our technology.</p>
          <p>Today, more than 1,000 Exadatas are installed, and we plan on tripling that number this year. We think that's possible because Oracle apps run unchanged on Exadata. That's very different from IBM Netezza, which does not run Oracle apps or IBM DB2 apps or anything else except applications that are custom-built for Netezza. The expansion of our Exadata business and our rapidly growing Exalogic business, plus a couple of new hardware and software appliances we plan to introduce this fall, should turbo-charge the overall growth of our hardware business, making the top line and bottom line better than ever. We're very excited.</p>
          <p>Over to you, Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Safra walked you through the numbers. I thought I'd just hit on a couple key points. First, we sold a lot of software. And I've looked at the history books. I'm not sure this isn't one of the best numbers I'm ever aware of in the industry.</p>
          <p>A couple things that have us excited. First, our industry-focused business units grew faster than Oracle again, with broad-based strength across industries. Second, our 19% new software license growth was broad-based, with technology and apps both growing at very strong rates. It's the first quarter we've ever sold more than $1 billion in apps. We had great performance in every region, and delivered license fee growth in the mid-teens or higher in every region.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we began to make material progress in hardware support attach rates. I'm not going to explain attach in detail today, but this is good news. The fundamentals of the business now is we are selling fewer units at higher prices, and we have higher margins, and they have higher attach rates. These are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business.</p>
          <p>Last, Exadata. Our sequential growth was more than 50%. That's big growth, and it was broad-based. We sold to more than 150 different customers, with close to half buying multiple systems. P&amp;G, JPMorgan Chase, Apple, Fidelity, Boeing have helped us now cross the 1,000 systems mark in installed Exadata systems. We have 300,000 database customers running Oracle database workloads. Every one of them is a prospect for Exadata. The exciting news is, in addition to this, the Exalogic ramp has been even better than Exadata, and every one of our 100,000-plus middleware customers is a prime prospect for Exalogic.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Ken, and we'll take your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready to take questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll take our first question from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. My question is about the hardware business. Actually, it's a two-part question. The first is on the actual product. How material was the headwind in the quarter relative to the shift in the model, and what gives you confidence that the product business starts to grow again? And then I guess on the support side, it looks like double-digit growth in hardware support, maybe a little bit more detail beyond just attach as to what's driving the strength there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start on attach, Adam. The reason attach is important &#x2013; I think you know this &#x2013; the eventual hardware support revenue is defined by the volume of hardware you sell times the attach rate, which is the service dollars that you charge for that support, and then how long the installed base stays there. And what we've done really is move to a model now where we've got the service lined up with the sales activity, that we attach the service to the actual sale. This may sound so elementary to you, but if you lose control of that in your process &#x2013; that had happened previously &#x2013; it's actually a difficult set of work to get that back, and we've done that, and that does start to lead over time to that incline in that hardware support revenue that you described. So, it is an absolute key element.</p>
          <p>The other point in the hardware business, Adam, just while we're on it, is that these fundamentals I described earlier are really important. Selling units that have no gross margin are easy to do. I could get &#x2013; I won't give you examples of what I could, but we have ways of selling lots of hardware without getting margin. We're focused on selling hardware systems. We're now selling fewer systems at a higher price, that are of more value to the customer, that stay installed longer. These are &#x2013; and also, we're doing that at higher margins. So, these are the fundamentals of a solid hardware business, and then of course, to the point we have to eventually grow that business on the top line, and you have a very, very attractive business model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Nice quarter. I guess one for you, Safra, and if I could, one for you, Mark or Larry. Safra, nice guidance, nice cash flow &#x2013; in fact, the guidance is a little bit better than what we were modeling. And we all read the same newspaper, so I'm just curious to get your perspective on how you might have incorporated what seems to be a questionable macro outlook in your forecast. And for you, Mark, if you could just comment anecdotally upon the attach rate of database licenses to Exadata, and also, the attach rate of middleware licenses to Exalogic, since you have obviously very ambitious goals for tripling the hardware business, that's got consequences for the software business, if indeed there's an attach rate trend there. That's it for me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just sneak in before Safra answers the state of the macro economy. The attach rate to Exalogic would be 100% with our middleware. The attach rate to Exadata would be 100%. One of the nice things is Exadata and Exalogic will become a larger percentage of our overall hardware business. Having grown off a fairly small base now up to 1,000 machines and hopefully 3,000 machines next year, as that gets to be a larger and larger percentage of our overall base, that improves our profitability. Exadata is growing faster than the traditional Sun line, so it improves our top-line growth rate. And because of the 100% attach rate, it improves our service growth rate and our service margins.</p>
          <p>So overall is we sell more and more engineered systems and fewer and fewer undifferentiated systems. We make more money on the hardware sale. We make more money on the associated service. And it actually is an enabler that allows us to increase our rate of sales of our middleware software because our middleware software runs better on Exalogic, and that's the best middleware combination you can buy &#x2013; Exalogic hardware and Exalogic software from Oracle. The best database combination you can buy is the Oracle database running on the Exadata machine. So, we actually sell more database software because of Exadata. We sell more middleware software because of Exalogic. It's a virtuous circle that we plan to fully exploit this current fiscal year. Safra, the macroeconomy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, Kash, I'll tell you nothing's really changed for us in the way we give our guidance. It really is from the ground up. And we've got guys around the world who roll in a forecast into us, and we take an additional review of it, but it's very much the same. The truth is that the economy is sort of as it is, and yet we continue to grow. This quarter, in case anyone missed it, was really basically an organic growth quarter for us. And the license number is pretty much very little help from any kind of acquisition, and obviously, significantly faster than any of the world's economies are really growing.</p>
          <p>So we've got a lot of very Oracle-specific momentum, and though we read the same newspapers you do, we also have to be sensitive to the fact that our sales force continues to grow. We've done a significant hiring and continue to be optimistic enough to continue to hire this next year. So, we're giving, I think, guidance that includes all those little pieces of information, but it's mostly based on the growth of our pipeline, and what we get from our fields around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I might add too that we added 800 people to the sales organization this quarter, so if that gives you an idea of our Oracle-specific confidence in where the market is, that might be a good measurement for you. I told you last quarter we'd start hiring. We did. And to add to Safra's points, again, this growth was broad-based. I used the region example, and the different parts of the business, but I'd add there were no individual deals of materiality either. This is just good old broad-based organic growth.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good quarter; just got two questions here, first one for Mark, and then Larry. Mark, there's been a lot of chatter just across Wall Street about some changes potentially going on with the sales force. Wondering if you could walk us through those tweaks that are being made, just sort of what the upside that you're going for is, and how you minimize disruption. And then, Larry, over the past month or so here, we've had a lot of big data announcements from competitors &#x2013; Hadoop boxes, Netezza this week, and then EMC talking about HP Violin versus Exadata. Wondering if you could just discuss sort of where you see the market going, where is Exadata versus these other guys. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me start by giving you some answers on the sales force. Part of that adding more people is really doing some division of territories. This means that we actually put more territories in the field by being able to get more density of coverage out of our sales force. We believe we're under-distributed, full stop. And when we get in front of more customers, we actually sell more software, and so that's why we're adding more representation. These are both salespeople and presale people, technical people, if you will. They're in GBUs, as well as in our regions, and they are across all regions.</p>
          <p>So, for us, it's a simple case of if a salesperson, to give you an example, had 20 customers, we think there's opportunities for that salesperson to sell just as much software calling on five customers, and therefore, for us to get higher productivity. And that's what we're doing, and that's probably the chatter you're hearing. But it's within &#x2013; and I want to emphasize &#x2013; continuity of customers, same territories, very minimal disruption, just adding more resource that would get more reach out in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're planning to add a couple of appliances and announcing them this fall. One appliance &#x2013; shouldn't surprise you, it's a large memory addition to Exadata for analytics and memory. So, we continue to invest. We've got &#x2013; by the way, we've been the leader of in-memory database technology ever since we bought Times Ten, both for transactions and for query processing. As memories become cheaper and larger scale, we've changed a bunch of our algorithms, and this in-memory analytics accelerator is going to be, again, coming out, and we'll be announcing it in the fall at Oracle OpenWorld.</p>
          <p>In addition, attaching to our Exalogic box, there's a lot of misunderstanding about what Hadoop is, and is it a replacement for a database. So, Hadoop is not a replacement for a database. It's an adjunct to the database, which we think is very, very important. It really is a tool for Java programmers, and we're the world leader in Java technology, and we are building a big data accelerator to attach to our Exalogic box, which comes out also this fall.</p>
          <p>The big data accelerator includes some of the standard open-source Hadoop software, HDFS, the Hadoop file system, a number of other pieces, but also some Oracle components that we think can dramatically speed up the entire MapReduce process, and will be particularly attractive to Java programmers, who are the ones who ask for Hadoop. There are some interesting applications for Hadoop. ETL is one. Log processing is another. We're going to have a lot of those features, functions, and pre-built applications in our big data accelerator.</p>
          <p>So Oracle has always followed database technology trends, whether it's object databases and memory databases, and kept up with this technology, and quite often, led on innovation. I'll point to our Exadata database machine, where we were the first to take a software product, like Oracle, and marry it to specialized hardware. Teradata came out with a combination before, but IBM has yet. IBM still hasn't come out with an appliance that runs their DB2 database very fast. Instead, they kind of ran out and did an acquisition, as opposed to innovation in this area.</p>
          <p>So we have long been an innovator around the database, keeping it current, watching all of the trends, exploiting the technology, and that's been showing up in our numbers. And that 28% in Q4 and 26% for the year is really a stunning number, considering the size of our Oracle database business, and how much faster we're growing than our rivals, DB2 and Microsoft's SQL Server.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I have a question on the hardware business, and I think it's probably one that people are thinking about, and just want to give you a chance to address it. Hardware margins were strong. They're a lot &#x2013; actually very strong. And as you noted, and it seems like, the higher-margin hardware business is doing better than the lower-margin business. But at the same time, it is the second quarter in a row where the number's a little lower than what you had anticipated or guided to. So, just kind of curious, why is that? It really hasn't affected your aggregate results, so it's &#x2013; well, at least from my perspective, it's not a big concern. But at the same time, just wondering, is it as simple as the commodity business is sort of drawing down more quickly than you anticipated, or is it something else happening in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, John. It's Mark. I'll start. I don't think it's any of that. I think we're just following the fundamentals of building a solid business, and that's what we're focused on. And I'll tell you one more time, I've been doing this a long time &#x2013; longer than I want to admit, and I'm telling you, these fundamentals of protecting your base &#x2013; and to be very blunt, as we go through the transition from Sun, we have to get more coverage out in the market. I think you know that. But we are putting more coverage out in the market to make sure we get that done, making sure we attach all the necessary peripherals, software, service to that attach. Those are the fundamentals we're working on. And if you followed what I told you earlier, there's no question we want to grow the top line. We want to grow the top line right. And so to grow the top line right, getting rid of these low-margin businesses is key, because we don't get the attach, there is no aftermarket, and I'd tell you from a shareholder perspective, that's valueless revenue.</p>
          <p>So, for us, we're focusing on that value revenue. You're going to see material growth in Exadata. You're now going to see growth from Exalogic that's going to participate as that becomes a more meaningful part of the portfolio. We'll be very focused on a couple of our competitors that we think have some vulnerabilities, and we will be going after them. And you'll see more alignment across the Oracle sales force as we go forward. So, focusing on those fundamentals, we'll be driving for growth, but very frankly, through Q3 and Q4, our number-one focus has been getting these fundamentals right. And as I'd tell you, numerically, I feel awful good about them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just also, John, add in &#x2013; I commented on it in my presentation a little bit. As you know, we used to resell Hitachi, but the other big storage that we sold was LSI's Engenio line, which, I don't know if you know, but during the quarter was actually sold to NetApp. And so these are two product lines that we sold a lot more of, and especially the NetApp Engenio move happened during this quarter, and so our storage selling those new products is significantly down, while what you don't see is that our own storage business is up. It just didn't overwhelm the reduction in that storage, in the third-party storage that we're reducing aggressively, intentionally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, John, one more time, you'd see the same fundamental in the server business, that the higher-end, high-margin stuff has the positive numbers, and you would see the x86 line with a declining number, where in that market, obviously, you get almost no attach either on the peripherals side or on the service side rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We basically make a conscious effort when deals come in here. Sometimes extremely large deals come in at profitability that's just not acceptable. We just don't want to win them. They're not worth winning. And so we just walk away from those. Maybe for all of you, the top line, it would be better, but for us, we'd rather just make money than make revenues. We're funny that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's all fair enough, and I don't want to repeat what you said, but just so I understand it, we actually are seeing what you're saying. We're seeing it in the margins in the hardware business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, we have Mark here. It's not like he doesn't know how to sell hardware. He could probably sell $100 million of hardware in an afternoon here, and maybe folks would be happier, but we just would make less money, and I just don't think that would really make anyone happy. We like to do it the better way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter] Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>We'll go next to Brent Thill with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A question for Safra, just back to the new license guidance that you gave, that was a lot stronger than most of us had forecasted, and I guess if you could just maybe help us out in terms of, is that just how you're seeing the natural deals lining up for Q1, or did you have some spillover from Q4 that's giving you better visibility? And I had a quick follow-up for Larry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Q4, we always have some spillover, and so that's always helpful. But it really is exactly like it always is, which is, we look at what the guys are forecasting. As Larry mentioned, these Exadata systems and Exalogic systems, they really help because you've got to buy software for those. And on the app side, we've been really on just a roll, and that's been very, very good. So, these are really the numbers as they roll up. I add my own little bit of conservatism. But, again, it's the summer, as it always is, and it's all about chasing those software contracts, often at the end of August when folks are on vacation. So, this is what we've come up with, and the same way we've always done it, and the guys are pretty optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And just for Larry on fusion apps, at OpenWorld last year, you mentioned that you thought there'd be 50 to 100 customers in the first half implementing that. I'm just curious if you could just give us a high-level update in terms of how Oracle Fusion is going, and what you think the next milestones we should be watching.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a number of Fusion customers now that are live, and Fusion is being completely rolled out for accounting, for human resources, for sales force automation. It's something we've been working on for six years. We're the only application vendor now that offers the same exact technology as a service. It's offered as a service on our cloud. Or you can buy the software and put it on your private cloud. And, by the way, if you put it on your private cloud, we'll run it for you, if you want us to, behind your firewall, attached to your local area network with all the security inherent in that.</p>
          <p>Our whole approach to kind of, if you will, Cloud 2.0 is, people say we're not building multi-tenancy software. Remember that when I started my little company, NetSuite, and six months later when Marc Benioff started his company, Salesforce.com, that was over a decade ago when virtualization wasn't so common for isolating different customers running on the same machine.</p>
          <p>So Cloud 2.0, we use virtualized elastic cloud technology, very different than, let's say, what Salesforce.com was using more than a decade &#x2013; almost 15-year-old multi-tenancy technology. We are offering much higher degree of security and much higher degree of isolation when you run on our public cloud, which looks a lot more like Amazon.com, let's say, than Salesforce.com. We think that modern technology has such a huge security advantage, that Salesforce.com will be facing very, very serious competition as Fusion is rolled out this year. And SAP has no answers at all. They've got nothing.</p>
          <p>So we've been competing very effectively against SAP over the last several years. We've passed them in North America. We've tied them in Europe, except in German-speaking Europe, and now they're faced with, what have you got for cloud? That would be nothing, while we have a completely rewritten suite of applications built entirely in Java, runs on Cloud 2.0, in an elastic cloud that's virtualized. We have technology advantages over Salesforce.com, but they've got nothing over at SAP. So, we think this is going to be a huge contributor to us this year, and the following year, and the year after that, and it's going to allow us to take a significant amount of share from SAP and some share from my friend at Salesforce, who, by the way &#x2013; the Salesforce guys are a big customer of ours, so when they <mark type="audio gap" /> (33:40) we make money. When we sell ours, we make money. We like that.</p>

          <p>We'll take our next question from Joel Fishbein with Lazard Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is a question for Mark, just a follow-up on your comments during your prepared remarks about Exalogic accelerating or being on a faster trajectory than Exadata. Can you just give us some color on what's driving that and maybe some specific customer wins that you may have had in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I think with Exalogic, you've got an opportunity now that you go to Java-based applications and get, in some cases, 2x, 3x, 4x better performance than what you had before. Now, most of these middle-tier suites are running on x86-like architectures. We get the opportunity to sweep up, if you will, that entire tier and integrate with Exalogic, and it's got a very similar set of characteristics to what you see in Exadata. You get a chance to get a superior TCO. So, when I show up with a 2x, 3x kind of number, you can take that in raw performance, or you can take it in lower cost, or you can dial in what piece of which that you would like. So, it's an extremely attractive value proposition.</p>
          <p>And to Larry's point, it's 100% attached to our middleware, 100% attached &#x2013; and I think Larry said this, but I'll emphasize again, 100% hardware and software attached that goes with it from a service perspective as well, so very attractive value prop. But I'll make sure that during the quarter we're very aggressive with customer wins in terms of our messaging out in the marketplace. But the ramp, if you look per quarter, that we've done with Exalogic, faster than the early days of Exadata.</p>

          <p>And we have time for one more question. That question will come from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right on, guys. I'm going to shift gears here a little bit. I'm curious with, I think you said $29 billion, you had a lot of cash on the balance sheet, and I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about the acquisition strategy. Valuations for a lot of private and small and mid-cap companies aren't necessarily at trough levels. There's also some folks out there who seem to think that Oracle has to buy to keep growing. Just what's your sort of philosophy right now? How would you sort of couch or guide us to think about the use of cash on the M&amp;A front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had 19% software new license growth without acquisitions. And I think we're able to grow through acquisitions when they're attractively priced, and they make sense, and they are by and large not attractively priced now and don't make sense, so we're not doing them. These assets are wildly overpriced. We can't make a good business case for buying them. Instead, we can focus our energies on organic growth, which means increasing the size of our sales force, introducing additional appliances, additional engineered systems over and on top of Exadata and Exalogic, a couple that I've already mentioned here. So, we think we've got a lot to sell already and that we can grow organically by expanding distribution. We can grow by acquisitions when the opportunity presents itself, and the economics make sense. As I say, anyone looks at the valuations today, and we don't think they make any sense.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, lucky for us, we are so broad-based that we're not just a software company. We're not just a hardware company, et cetera. We get to look in a lot of different areas, whether it's technology or vertical apps or whatever. And every once in a while we find a jewel, and as usual, we'll buy a little of this and a little of that, but we're not leaving the regular rigor pricing. Price does matter to us, and we just want to make sure it's a good business case when we do it. But, luckily, we've got a lot of opportunities. It's just prices have been quite ridiculous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if it's okay, maybe I can sneak one quick one in. Safra, you teased us a little bit by saying that you're going to be back to full-year pre-Sun operating margins quite quickly. I'm curious just how you're thinking about that operating margin profile, maybe not just this year, but sort of in the next couple years in terms of how fast that can ramp perhaps back to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll tell you, I'm really delighted at how fast we got already here. As it is, when you think about it, we ingested an entire hardware company, and we still have the highest &#x2013; that was losing money. It was losing an enormous amount of money, a shocking amount of money actually. And we ingested it, and we still have the highest operating margins in the software industry. So, we actually have still a lot of leverage in our model, and there's really no reason why this year couldn't be really spectacular. And it will build throughout the year.</p>
          <p>But as things start to really show up in the numbers, again, you don't really see the ins and outs, the puts inside the hardware number, so you don't see what's happening there, though you do, at least, have some idea of when you look at the margins. And then of course, with the software business doing as well, and the enormous installed base of customers who renew their agreements with us every year &#x2013; it's now like over 4 billion &#x2013; there's a lot of room still in our model, and we've got a lot of leverage still in it. So, we're very upbeat. I think we look at this past year, and we're very, very pleased that we've had a hardware company in our numbers and we're still the highest, by a lot, of all the -</p>
