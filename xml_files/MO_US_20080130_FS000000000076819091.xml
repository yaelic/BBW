          <p>Good day and welcome to Altria Group's Fourth Quarter year-end conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Altria management in the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> Media representatives on the call will also be able to ask questions following the conclusion of questions from the investment community. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications for Altria. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a news release, which contains detailed information on Altria's 2007 full-year and Fourth Quarter results and specifics about the spin-off of Phillip Morris International. Additional information about the spin-off including answers to and frequently asked questions is available in a special section of the Altria website at altria.com/pmispinoff. Today's call is limited to a discussion of our business results.</p>
          <p>Our remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the Safe Harbor statement at the end of our news release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.</p>
          <p>And, now it's my pleasure to introduce Louie Camilleri, Altria's Chairman and CEO. Louie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Nick and good afternoon everyone. I assume that by now you have familiarized yourselves with the contents of our rather copious release this morning. Accordingly, I intend to limit my opening remarks to the key strategic highlights of our 2007 performance, our outlook for this year, and of course the spin-off of PMI which will take effect on March 28th. As stated in this morning's announcement, we will be holding an investor presentation in New York on March 11th. You will appreciate that I have no intention of stealing Mike Szymanczyk's as or Andre Calantzopoulos' thunder. Thus I intend to defer certain questions that are likely to arise today so that they can be addressed on March 11th in a detailed and comprehensive manner within the context of our growth strategies going forward.</p>
          <p>2007 was by most measures an excellent year. Our consolidated financial results were strong. And a number of strategic actions were taken which will bear fruit in 2008 and beyond. Of particular note is that absent the unfavorable impact of trade inventory reductions that affected both Phillip Morris USA and Phillip Morris International, our fourth quarter performance was marked by a sustained improvement in our business fundamentals.</p>
          <p>In a year that was marked by a step-up in MSA payments and an above-trend erosion in cigarette consumption, Phillip Morris USA fared remarkably well. Its market share performance was strong, led by Marlboro and the successful launch of Marlboro Smooth and Marlboro Virginia blends. Phillip Morris USA took several actions to further its adjacency strategy with a December acquisition of John Middleton and the successful test market introductions of Marlboro Smoothes and Marlboro Moist Smokeless Tobacco.</p>
          <p>The latter introduction has spawned much debate in ink in the recent past. While it is still early days, let me just say that we are very encouraged by the result to date. Particularly in terms of the consumer response to the product and repurchase rates. Indeed, we remain steadfast in our view that Marlboro's exceedingly well positioned to capture growth in this exciting category.</p>
          <p>On the cost front, the Phillip Morris USA team is fast implementing the manufacturing reconfiguration announced last summer and is on track both in terms of timing and savings delivery. In addition, Phillip Morris USA delivered overhead savings of more than $300 million in 2007, which was the principal contributor to its unit margin gain of close to 6% versus 2006.</p>
          <p>While admittedly buoyed by currency, PMI generated income growth of 12.5% for the full year and 15.5% for the quarter. Absent currency and other items, its organic income growth rate was solid, with operating income up 6.8% for the year and up 7.3% for the quarter. Volume performance improved in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 17 or close to 70% of PMI's top 25 income markets registered improved trends in the fourth quarter. Of particular note is a PMI registered improving market share trends in numerous key markets as the quarter unfolded. Most notably in Russia, Germany, Turkey and France.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I will be the first to admit that our share performance in some markets, most notably Japan, cast a shadow on an otherwise very strong year. I am, however, confident that we have a number of exciting plans and products to enhance our market share fortunes in 2008 and beyond. These include Marlboro Filter Plus, Marlboro Intense, several Marlboro Menthol extensions and a wide array of innovations supporting Parliament, Virginia Slims, Chesterfield and Phillip Morris.</p>
          <p>These four premium brands recorded combined volume of 115 billion units in 2007, which grew at a combined rate of 9.1%. For perspective, this total volume is more than Reynolds' and approximately three times Lorillard's annual volumes. As I look into the rearview mirror, I believe we accomplished most of what we had set out to do in 2007. And importantly, looking forward we have set the stage for an exciting future.</p>
          <p>That brings me to the forthcoming spin-off of PMI and the 2008 outlook for both Altria and PMI. Our announcement this morning contains a number of significant details regarding the spin-off of PMI, as well as the anticipated actions that still need to be taken prior to the distribution.</p>
          <p>The principal ones in chronological order are the tender offer and consent solicitation for Altria's notes outstanding that we will launch shortly. The New York Stock Exchange application, the finalization of the Form 10, and our presentation to the investment community on March 11th.</p>
          <p>Our announcement also includes details regarding Altria's and PMI's anticipated dividend policies, each company's respective initial dividend rate and two-year share repurchase programs. In total, we anticipate a combined cash out flow to shareholders of more than $33 billion over the next two years in the form of dividends and share repurchases.</p>
          <p>That represents more than 20% of our current market capitalization. As I indicated in August, our two-year share repurchase programs are based on what we view as an optimal and prudent balance between the anticipated financial needs of each company to generate growth and retain adequate financial flexibility, our firm resolve to secure solid investment grade ratings, and to reward shareholders in a sustained and generous manner.</p>
          <p>Altria and its shareholders have historically always had the benefit of an outstanding Board of Directors. I am especially pleased that this tradition will continue as Altria and PMI between them will retain substantially all of the current board members and have attracted several immensely qualified new directors for their respective boards. The senior leadership teams of both Altria and PMI have been identified and will be announced by March 11th. I am confident that each company will be led by a team of talented individuals who have the skills, experience and determination to take both companies to the next level. While Mike, Andre and I will disclose our longer-term strategy and earnings ambitions for each company on March 11th, I do wish to address our earnings outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>This morning's release provides specific projections for each company. On a combined basis, they are projected to reach an underlying earnings per share level of between $4.74 to $4.84, reflecting growth of 8.2 to 10.5% versus Altria's 2007 underlying earnings per share of $4.38.</p>
          <p>While Altria excluding PMI is projecting solid operating performance for its domestic tobacco businesses, it will face some transitional and temporary headwinds that will affect its 2008 earnings growth rate. These include an anticipated higher tax rate of close to 1 percentage point, a temporary absorption of higher manufacturing overhead, as PM USA winds down its contract manufacturing for Phillip Morris International and prepares for the Richmond facility's absorption of Cabarrus' volume and further investments to support Phillip Morris USA's entry in the smokeless categories.</p>
          <p>PMI is projecting a robust earnings performance driven by pricing, cost reductions and continued currency favorability at prevailing rates. Volume, however, is anticipated to be essentially flat or slightly down reflecting continued total cigarette consumption erosion in several markets. Nevertheless, we anticipate the mix will continue to sequentially improve. The prevailing economic uncertainty and its ramifications on consumer confidence and disposable income are obviously a concern as we weigh the challenges and opportunities that we will confront in 2008. However, we believe that we are well positioned and certainly better than most to weather these uncertainties. Price gaps are within our established targets in most markets around the world. And the deep discount segment here in the United States is not exhibiting any untoward movement.</p>
          <p>Input costs remain relatively benign and the pricing environment is on the whole stable. As I mentioned in August, I am of the firm belief that the actions announced this morning will enhance our growth rates through sharper focus, speed to market and execution. And will greatly benefit our shareholders. That being said, let me assure you that we're all very much committed to and intend on delivering on this promise.</p>
          <p>Thank you and I'll now be glad to field your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question is coming from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Louie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Judy. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a few questions; first, I'll start with your outlook for share buyback and just kind of broadly speaking the capital structure issue. I'd imagine that even with today's buyback announcement, both entities still have ample flexibility to take on more leverage and still maintain an investment grade rating. So can you just help us understand some of the financial needs that you've talked about in thinking about the growth opportunities for each business and to the extent that those opportunities don't materialize, should we expect share buyback to be higher than what you've announced today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the Board announced two separate two-year programs, Judy. And I'm not willing to go beyond that. In terms of capital structure, I think it's very important, and history has taught us, that we should have flexibility and financial wherewithal to be able to respond to opportunities. As the years unfold, we will see what we do. And clearly that's something we will address in further detail on March 11th  but those are our plans. And I think they make eminent sense from a business growth perspective and shareholder return perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then in terms of share buyback, again in terms of what's included in your guidance, can you clarify, first, whether both share buybacks are included in Altria and PMI's guidance, and how should we think about kind of 2008 in terms of the timing and the amount of the buyback? I know you've talked about the two-year program but just specific to 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair question. I think our release mentioned when both Altria and PMI will be able to initiate their share repurchases. PMI will have to be later than Altria because as you know under the SEC regulations we can only start buying back once we have a four-week moving average of trading, actual trading. We anticipate, like we've done historically, that the share repurchases will be essentially constant over the two-year period, and that's what our earnings guidance provides you. Essentially, if I take the two combined, Judy, the benefit of share repurchases in '08 is slightly less than 1% in terms of growth and clearly it will impact 2009's growth rate a lot more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then in terms of the cost savings opportunity, I know you've talked about the corporate expense coming down over the next couple of years. You also have the savings coming from the manufacturing moving out of PM USA to International but beyond that and beyond sort of the 300 million of overhead savings that you've indicated for 2007, do you expect the cost structure for both entities to see more savings opportunities? I mean, if you look at PM USA's cost per unit it looks like it's still higher than some of its peers, what the opportunities could be and perhaps think about when we could get further announcement on cost restructuring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly that will be a major topic of our March 11th presentation, Judy, for both companies. And we will be able to take you through our productivity and cost reduction initiatives and ambitions at that time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my final question, in thinking about PMI's volume outlook, clearly this is an area where I think we had been hoping to see better number. It looks like 2008 is going to be another year where you wouldn't see volume growth in this business. Can you just kind of talk about maybe longer term whether it is something realistic to think that you could see 1 to 2% kind of volume growth going forward and in relation to this how we should think about balancing, trying to get better volume growth as opposed to more pricing or mix improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our ambition certainly is that over time we can get to that 1 to 2%, Judy. As you all know, and I think everybody is well aware of the issues we faced in the recent past, which was dislocation in some markets. Major competitive entries in various low priced segments in several markets as well. That clearly has hurt our volume performance, organic volume performance because when I add in acquisitions the volume has actually done pretty well. 2008 and 2007 for that matter, our market share performance was what I would characterize as being mixed. And 2008 I would hope that we can improve that. And as the years unfold I think we can get back to greater market share growth across more markets, which will translate into volume growth. So that clearly is an ambition that we have and it is something that we will address on March 11th.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Louie.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>You're welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from David Adelman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Louie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Good. Louie, a couple of things. First, let me revisit this issue on the buyback and the capital structure. And no one can dismiss the magnitude of cash that you're going to return to shareholders over the next several years. But it looks to me like both businesses under these current plans won't even get to one-times debt to EBITDA. And arguably it would be substantially less than that at the new Altria if you consider the SAB Miller stake. I'm just wondering, could you help us understand your thoughts about the capital structure long-term for both of these businesses that would allow them to maximize their value for shareholders?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm glad you recognize, David, a cash outflow of $33 billion over two years is adequate in your mind. I think it's huge. In terms of going forward, I think your calculations need to be revised, because debt to EBITDA would be slightly above 1, actually. So I'd check your numbers. My own sense is that as we have said in the past, we're in this for the long-term. I know some analysts out there had numbers of 30 billion or plus in terms of buybacks. And I think we need to retain financial flexibility because there are opportunities out there and we do see opportunities. And history has taught us that having financial flexibility is in the interests of the business and shareholders. I think we'll address more in terms of capital structure on March 11th, but at this point in time, David, we are very happy with the announcement. I think it's generous. And it leaves us adequate financial flexibility. I would also say that, you know, there is quite a lot of uncertainty in credit markets today. And that's not something that we should ignore. I mean read the newspapers every single day of each week. So --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I try to avoid that (Laughter).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In consideration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me ask you, secondly, Louie, about the performance expectations for organic OCI growth for both businesses. Over time, where do you think they should be relative to their respective peers? Do you think that they're middle of the pack? Do you think you can aspire, particularly outside the United States to be in the top quartile? Do you think that's a realistic expectation? I realize they haven't been there recently and that there have been reasons for that, but what about going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the reasons we're doing this whole restructuring, David, and I am very confident that both companies will be top tier performers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in Japan, Louie, what's really happened there? That used to be and has the potential to be such a gem. Marlboro has this fabulous demographic profile. You took back control of the business. That should have accelerated performance and, yet, the converse has occurred. So what's really happened? I think you've changed management there. What precisely can be done to improve the performance and how long do you think it's going to take to really inflect the trend line in what must be your second or third most profitable international market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great question, David. Clearly, our performance in Japan more recently has not met our expectations. I think the Marlboro take-back, which you referred to clearly was a huge focus of our attention. And I don't think there's necessarily an appreciation by investors as to what that entailed and the magnitude of the work that that entailed to ensure that it would not be derailed. As you know, it added significantly to the profitability of that market. In so doing, and I think we were very successful there, in so doing we may have slowed down in terms of innovation. We are catching up. And I'm confident that under the new management team that you just mentioned we put <mark type="inaudible" />, who is head of Japan now, is probably one of our best marketing executives in Phillip Morris International. I'm confident that over time, through innovation, we'll be able to restore our share growth that we had historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then last question, Louie. As it relates to the cost savings opportunity at PM USA, longer term I know Lorillard runs a very tight ship but you're five times their size in volume. Do you think it's realistic to think that you can approach their level of total per unit costs or is that unrealistically aspirational?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mike and Dave Boran will cover that in considerable detail at the investor presentation. Clearly, I don't want to defer every question. But that one is a key one. I think one of the things you have to bear in mind, David, particularly when you compare Phillip Morris USA to Lorillard, is that PM USA. has a national infrastructure in place. Lorillard, as you know, most of their business comes from the northeast and that really is a major affect, has a major affect on the cost base. Furthermore, PM USA is the industry leader. Takes on costs that the others don't necessarily do. Those two are sort of rather important factors. Having said that, Mike clearly will describe his productivity initiatives going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. I look forward to the 11th and good luck.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Your next question is coming from Christine Farkas with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Louie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Christine. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, thank you. I have two questions. Firstly looking at Altria or PM USA side in studying your '07 profit growth you've highlighted several challenging factors the unit should meet or see in 2008 and you put forward a target for EPS growth in the 9 to 11% range and also we have the impact of the buyback. Can you help us just reconcile what else is baked into that expectation or that forecast for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said in my remarks, we believe that the domestic tobacco businesses Phillip Morris USA and John Middleton will perform very strongly and there are some transitional issues which I mentioned in my opening remarks. But we feel pretty good about the business as I mentioned in terms of the price segments. Share is doing well. Our new products are performing extremely strongly. And generally in terms of consumption, I referred to this somewhat in my remarks. 2007 was sort of a higher erosion in the consumption trend than normal. And we saw a slight improvement in the fourth quarter as our release points out. And our sense is that consumption in '08 should come down two and a half to 3%, which is slightly more in line with the historical trends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and just before I get to my second question then. Just so I'm clear you don't have additional productivity savings that haven't yet been discussed here with the Street baked into the PM USA number for '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct.</p>

          <p>Great. That's helpful. Just on your second point with consumption trends down or expected to be down 2.5 to 3%, that's in light of potential pickup in state excise taxes in '08 and ongoing smoking bans. In light of all that, you still see a moderate improvement in consumption declines in '08?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Louie, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Filippe, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not too bad. Couple of housekeeping questions before I start with the real questions. March 28th, anything magic about March 28th? Because it's not the last business day of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a magic because it's a Friday.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And because I would have thought that it would have been on the last business day, which is Monday of the month.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, just coming back to Judy's and David's earlier question about the amount of moneys being returned to our shareholders over the next two years. The combination of the buybacks post the dividends just happens to be 20% of your market cap as you laid out. Should I in kind of read into that the size of the buyback was to some degree driven by not trying to exceed that 20% in order to run afoul of the IRS rules for the tax-free nature of the spin-off or just happens to be that these numbers kind of happen to line up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think those numbers are coincidental. The share repurchases are what we believe is the right share repurchase programs over the next two years for the two companies, Filippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I note typically you never speak about litigation on these calls, but given the spin-off let me just try to get a quick update on two items if you don't mind? First, when do you expect the Second Circuit to come back on the Schwab question? I'm sure that was fully taken into consideration when the Board affirmed the spin-off decision this morning. And secondly do you have a count on the Angle filings, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Schwab, I'm not sure, I think they could well come some time in the second quarter. It could be later. With regard to Angle, it's a moving number, frankly. The latest number we have is about 1,200 cases, representing some 7,200 plaintiffs. The difference in the cases and the plaintiffs is that some plaintiffs' lawyers are obviously trying to save the filing fee of $250 per plaintiff. So they're trying to save $1.5 million, roughly. As you know they have to be individual cases. It's a moving number because our sense is that total number already includes a number of duplicate plaintiffs. Furthermore, some of the dockets may be somewhat delayed in giving the information. So we're hoping over the next few weeks there will be clarification on the actual number of cases and plaintiffs. But that's essentially where we are now today, Filippe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Now to the real questions. I know you will address more of that and your colleagues will address more of those in March but let me take a stab at a few of them, if I may? First one relates to China. Obviously, a tremendous opportunity for Philip Morris International yet it is about I think now the third year since you signed the initial memorandum of understanding. When may we see some initial rollouts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second year, I think we signed -- surely before Christmas of December '05. We would hope that you will see movements this year and the first half of this year. Things clearly have been slow but there's been a lot of progress behind the scenes and we are confident that over time both the joint venture and the license agreement will progress significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we look, Louie, first basically towards Chinese-made products being sold outside of China or is it rather looking at the Phillip Morris organization selling Phillip Morris products within the Chinese market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a bit of both. It's predominantly the Chinese brands in various markets across the world as well as the Marlboro license agreement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then second question, Louie. A lot has been written recently about a number of products that you have in the pipeline. Some of which are innovative products. Can you just kind of quickly compare how the European regulatory environment and particularly the WHO framework agreement compares to the MSA and how that positions you in terms of your ability to deliver on these innovative products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the STC, the way it stands prohibits in any way the innovations that we have going or those that are planned. Clearly we take into account the regulatory environment and the future regulatory environment when we basically come up with those products. I'm not sure whether you're referring to cigarettes or here in America the smokeless products that we are working on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am actually referring to sort of the Heath bar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, we continue to develop that product. It certainly has a lot of benefits. Its potential downside is that it is a completely different ritual and therefore that will take time but it certainly has a number of benefits and we continue to improve the product and as you know we continue to test it in various markets. Most notably the last entry test was in Australia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay but in summary on this question, Louie, you do not see the WHO framework agreement or European current regulatory environment to be restrictive in terms of your ability to innovate, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not at all. In fact, I would think that it would encourage that kind of product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then moving on to the US, Louie, obviously 2007 consumption trends weakened whether it was the result of price increases or ongoing smoking restrictions, but looking more forward, two questions if I may? One, in your guidance for '08 EPS growth, have you baked in at all any potential increase in the Federal excise tax or do you believe that's more going to be an '09 issue depending on who wins the White House, and secondly perhaps more importantly if you can just talk a bit more about the algorithm that you're using in the US market, more specifically focus on market share versus profitably running the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We don't think that there is a great prospect for a Federal excise tax increase in 2008. Whether it will become an issue in '09 or not is still somewhat up in the air, as you said. That is something in terms of excise taxes, generally, including state excise taxes, that Mike and Dave will cover, in terms of the environment going forward. In terms of the algorithm, I'm not going to give you precise formula, Filippe. But as I mentioned earlier, I think we see consumption improving versus the trend line we saw in 2007. We continue to see increased market share. Marlboro Smooth and Virginia Blend in particular are doing extremely well. And clearly PMI USA will continue to balance its income and share growth appropriately.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just two final questions in terms of the decision parameters in terms of a potential national roll-out of the smokeless products, can you give us a little bit more color there, Louie? I know it's kind of tough perhaps to share that with you for competitive reasons but any guidance would be very useful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Mike will address the strategy in smokeless. So I'm not going to give you precise timing. And I'm not sure he will either for obvious reasons. The fact of the matter is, if I first talk about the Snus product, we're very encouraged by the consumer response in Dallas. As you know we've just expanded to Indianapolis and we're learning a lot from that test. But we are very, very encouraged by what we see. In terms of the Atlanta test, the share we're getting is great. And despite a pretty vigorous response from competitors, we feel that we're learning a lot from that test and the product is absolutely superb and consumers continue to be very attracted by the product, its packaging, the taste characteristics of the product and obviously its pricing. And we're confident that Marlboro can be successful both with the Snus product and the moist smoking tobacco product in the smokeless category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and then the final question, Louie, with regard to Germany, obviously it has been a tough year because of the tax law changes there. What's your outlook for '08? Do you feel more comfortable that with new product innovation on your side you will be able to start seeing growth in that market again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We certainly would hope so, Filippe. I think we have some pretty good plans. Marlboro's share clearly has stabilized more recently. L&amp;M is doing fabulously well. It's probably one of the, if not the fastest growing brand in Germany today. The tobacco Block product in the fine cut segment appears to be growing very solidly and is clearly a huge innovation. I think it's captured close to 2% of the fine cut segment since its launch sometime in September. So Germany is always a tough market. Has been for a very long time. But I think the team we have in Germany, the plans we have, we should see some better performance in terms of share going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Louie. Look forward to seeing you in March.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Louie.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eric, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine, thank you. Yourself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the volume outlook for the PMI business in 2008. You're talking about volumes roughly flat. Could you give us some more details on the markets where you expect volumes to be difficult and also then the offsetting markets where we should expect some good organic volume growth out of the PMI business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this stage I'm not sure I want to share all that with you, Eric. It's early days, I think the main culprits remain the same and the main markets that will do well remain the same. I think we will give you a much better detailed sense of that on March 11th. And I'd rather defer that question to then if that's okay with you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, that's fine. Secondly, then, in terms of the Chinese joint venture, is it fair then given the news flow out of that, to assume that the negotiations are concluded and that now all that's left is implementation of an agreed action whether in China or outside China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The negotiations were actually concluded a long time ago. The focus has been on implementation and building up the mutual trust and the mutual plans that we all agreed to. And that's took a considerable amount of time. I think we're there now. We are very committed and our partners, the China National Tobacco Company are very committed to making this a big success and clearly it's taken time. But I think now everything is in place for it to be implemented and executed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, in terms of that implementation, is it correct to believe that this is some kind of reciprocal agreement and it's not just that for, in order to sell the PMI product to Marlboro in China you need to sell a certain amount of Chinese product outside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say that it's a mathematical reciprocal agreement, I think it's really a strategic partnership between Phillip Morris International and the China National Tobacco Company. If you think about it, Phillip Morris International can offer CNTC its infrastructure and know how in the rest of the world and China National Tobacco Company can offer PMI its infrastructure and know how in China. And I think it's a strategic partnership that we hope we will be able to build over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and am I correct in assuming that to get more details in terms of volume expectations particularly for PMI brands in China that we'll need to wait until March?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure we will disclose our precise volume expectations, Eric, in terms of China. But what I can tell you is as I've said earlier, we believe that Marlboro will be manufactured and sold in China within the first six months of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. One last question, then, in terms of the buyback. I would agree with your assessment, it's generous. It's in line with our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just curious about what we should use when estimating the cost of the incremental debt used to fund the buyback. Do you have any guidance for us on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I can give you precise numbers on that. As you know interest rates have come down and the spreads have increased. We will go to the markets. We have financing in place through the banks, bridge financing as well as credit facilities. But at this point I'm not willing to provide you with interest rates.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Hi Ann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh hi. Excuse me. I have a couple of questions, Louie. First, regarding your statement about the expanded test of the Marlboro moist smokeless product in Atlanta. Is it fair to assume that expanded tests will also include revisions on maybe how you work with distributors to get the products on the shelves or how it's displayed or pricing or maybe the rack in which the products sold. Is it fair to assume there's changes getting made there as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ann, that's why it's a test market. We're looking at various parts of the actual mix as it were of the product offering and we are testing various ways of marketing that product to the consumer. As I said earlier, I think the early indications are very solid and we will continue to test various aspects of the product and continue our consumer research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we're hearing enrichment at your manufacturing facility here that capacity is tight given the move from Cabarrus. And I'm just wondering if the timing is still on track to move the production up to Richmond and with this tight capacity are there opportunities to maybe outsource some of the production or are there ways to get around that tight capacity to help manage your costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's tight. But we are, as I said in my remarks, smack on time in terms of timing as well as in terms of delivery of the savings. We had said that we would move some 57 billion units offshore as of the end of January 30 billion will have already been moved out. So we feel very good that we are smack on our plan in terms of the transfer to PMI as well as the absorption from Cabarrus. But as I mentioned earlier, it will create some duplication in 2008 in terms of costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And then with regard to the FDA, potential regulation of tobacco, do you think this is still an active issue and do you think that PM USA is changing their view on this issue when they become a stand-alone company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think PM USA will change its views on FDA. PM USA as well as Altria have always supported FDA. Whether FDA will see the light of day this year is a question mark. Clearly it's an election year and as the months unfold there will be less and less focus on FDA. It will clearly very much depend on the bills and the contents of the bills themselves. PM USA clearly has a voice today to ensure that there are no adverse ramifications, and I think that is an important position to be in. So I wouldn't anticipate major changes there. So I think there you'll see basically a continuation of the strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one more thing. Can you comment on whether each Board will review any potential changes to the dividend in the August timeframe when Altria used to review the dividend policy? Do you think August will be the timing when this situation is reviewed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't tell you that, Ann. The Board will decide that. But historically the parent was in August. So my guess is Altria will certainly be in August. And PMI, the Board hasn't really been formed yet so that will be their call so we'll see when we get there.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the topic of snuff, a couple of analysts have raised the question so I thought I'd ask, why did not PM USA move quicker on smokeless as it saw the growth of the market and saw the drop off in cigarette consumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a legitimate question. The reason is very simple. We wanted to ensure that we had a fabulous product both in fine cut and long cut form in regular and in Menthol. We have achieved that. We have fabulous packaging as well in terms of the freshness of the product. So I think people were rather skeptical up front that we could actually produce a product that could match competitive offerings. We've achieved that organically. And consumer response to the product has been terrific. So we prefer to take our time and get the right product on the market than try to rush something and potentially get a product there that doesn't meet consumer aspirations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as you were planning this launch, did you discuss or do you now have a market share that PM USA would like to achieve in smokeless over a period of three years or five years that you could share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We clearly have our internal ambitions but we're not about to share with you. But all I can tell you is that the share momentum we're seeing in the test market is very encouraging and very satisfactory.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Louie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Chris, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm doing well. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a few follow-ups, my first one is I was just curious if there's any limitations to share repurchase really from a PM USA standpoint around whether it's considerations for book value or that sort of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the only limitation is retaining adequate financial flexibility and financial wherewithal for the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I wondered also if you could speak to strategically how we should look at the SAB Miller stake. Obviously, there's financial consequences to an outright sale of that if that would even be considered. But is that something you'd like to speak to in terms of what the company will do with that stake once PM USA has it in its business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, other than reiterating what I've said in the past. You know, investment in SAB Miller that arose through the merger with Miller has been an economic home run. And I think that SAB Miller is extremely well positioned to continue to grow strongly. It has arguably probably the best geographic footprint amongst all brewers. I would anticipate as you've seen that there will continue to be consolidation in the brewing industry and we have ridden that wave very successfully and we will continue to ride that wave. I think that investment as well helps in terms of Altria's debt ratings, its cost of borrowing and hence cost of capital. So it's strategic investment and it is something that we will continue to ride for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then I was just curious about you had mentioned some very strong cost savings from PM USA Can we get the same number for PMI for 2007 and related to that are there any additional restructuring actions you didn't state for PMI in say in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were considerable cost savings of PMI in '07 as well particularly in G and A as their programs are starting to kick in. I'm not sure if I'll give you a precise figure. Andre has mentioned 100 million productivity in the past. I think we did better than that in 2007. And we will lay out our ambitions going forward in terms of productivity and cost reduction initiatives. But I do want to stress both for PMI and for Altria that it's the top line that is the key to growth in earnings and less so in terms of cost. That doesn't mean we're not focused on cost. We are. But the focus is really on the top line. That's where we will get the growth and the earnings growth.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, not to be confused with Chris Growe, just an odd one-two punch. Anyway, quick question from me is what kind of litigation risk exists for PMI as a separate entity ahead? It's clearly going to be different, but it doesn't seem like it would be non-existent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's certainly nonexistent. There has been litigation internationally as you are aware and our disclosures show, however, the industry has been very successful and I think we will continue to be successful. That's not to say that there won't be claims and litigation internationally but it's not something that I'm unduly concerned about.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Louie, you mentioned China, and this may be suitable for March 11th. But would it be fair to assume that whatever brands PMI brands are produced in China will be to Chinese tastes as opposed to western blends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, let's be clear. The product will be Marlboro. And it will be Marlboro's traditional worldwide tasting cigarette. And that's something that CNTC is adamant about. And so are we.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, there's obviously been question marks about Marlboro's ability to perform in a predominantly Virginia market. But over time Marlboro has done well in Virginia markets, particularly Marlboro Lights. The UK is one example where Marlboro is probably the only growing premium brand. And the Middle East, not long ago, was a complete Virginia market. It's now predominantly an American blend market. I don't think China's going to switch that quickly but there is certainly scope for American blend segment to develop in China and that's what the CNTC wants in terms of our expertise as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Uh-huh. And the manufacturing process, you will have your own people there for the blending and flavoring of the product?</p>

          <p>Hi Adam. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm fine, thank you. Can I first of all just confirm something about the two buyback programs? I assume that the Boards in future, if they decide, could accelerate those buyback programs but equally if they decided for whatever reason they could stop them if they saw another opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. The Board is all powerful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. You mentioned -- not related to PMI. You said in your statement you're expecting 12 to 14% EPS growth in 2008. And I think very helpfully you said that about one percentage point of that would be from buybacks. Can you also say what percent, how many percentage points come from currency gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 1% actually just to be clear referred to the combined impact of the share repurchases on the combined EPS. In fact, it's got a slightly higher impact on Altria than it does PMI. The impact on PMI is very marginal in terms of the 12 to 14% projection. We think that of that 12 to 14 organic growth excluding everything is around 9%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. That's very helpful. And, finally, if I can turn to the joint venture with the Chinese that's going to be producing Chinese heritage brands, if I remember correctly, that's based in Switzerland.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I infer from that initially at least the main emphasis will be in the European Union, possibly Eastern Europe, or will it be equal emphasis right around the globe?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Hi, Jonathan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe this is another question for March as well. But I was wondering if you could say anything about how you are now looking at the structure of long-term incentive plans, bonus schemes for top management at PMI and at Altria? Are these being structured in a way that's driven by share prices, almost total share to return? Is it EPS? Or are there operating metrics more important?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shareholder return, EPS and other operating measures are always clearly very focused targets. I think you will see in our Form 10 that PMI will somewhat change the mix of its compensation versus what has been traditionally the case at Altria. Let's not forget that Altria was a parent company with various operating divisions. And as we said, one of the reasons or one of the rationales for the separation was to align compensation of executives more closely with that of shareholders. So total shareholder return is going to be a critical element. And PMI going forward will probably have a bit more stock in the mix than has traditionally been the case with Altria. If that addresses your question?</p>

          <p>And in Paris, brilliant. Secondly, can you talk about any kind of noncompete agreement between PM USA and PMI in general and then also perhaps in terms of duration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think I mentioned this back in August. The key probably, agreement that will define the relationship, if any, between PM USA and PMI going forward, relates to intellectual property. And I think that the agreement essentially ensures that both companies are very well protected in terms of their intellectual property and have rights for their respective territories going forward for a considerable amount of time, including rights of first refusal on new technology that could potentially come about from their now separate R&amp;D facilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. So in other words if PMI's R&amp;D facility in Switzerland has a breakthrough in a reduced risk cigarette that could be licensed, that PM USA would have the first right to license that product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then does that also apply to a product like the Marlboro Filter Plus that PMI has launched in Eastern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, PM USA already owns that intellectual property because they shared R&amp;D. So whatever has been essentially developed up to now is already shared for their respective territories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then my last question was, again, just in terms of the general environment in which Phillip Morris is operating in 2008. Is it fair to say that in emerging markets uptrading continues generally and that we are seeing that continue in places like Russia and Turkey?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that as a general statement that's a fair one. It can vary by market. But generally we are seeing uptrading and we're seeing clearly a significant improvement in our own mix in most of these markets. Particularly the two you just mentioned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And but in terms of the improvement in a market like Poland, that would be more attributed to industry consolidation and being able to move pricing up in the industry profit pool; is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. But we're also seeing improvement in mix there as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Lovely. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <p>Can you hear me?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. I had a question about the production of Marlboro in China. I know that there are some imported Marlboros for sale there now that are subject to strict quotas. But when the production of Marlboro begins there, won't that also be subject to quotas? Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on why it is beneficial to actually make the Marlboro brand there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The CNTC clearly will decide in terms of the production volume. There are no specific quotas on domestic production. And the commitment is that the production will meet consumer demand. And it won't be restrained if the consumer demand is there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hmm. And it's just two factories, right, still currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Initially two factories, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, just going back to what you mentioned on Japan, in innovation in Japan, can you elaborate a little bit on that? Are there certain types of products that from your perspective might be good fast growers in the future there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly I can't discuss plans, products that aren't in the market and that we intend to launch. But I can certainly give you two examples. We launched Marlboro Menthol product called Crisp. It's doing extremely well. We launched it in the latter half of 2007. It's gained .3 share points and contributed to Marlboro's slight market share gain in the fourth quarter. Another great product is the Virginia Slims Noire, which is a one milligram product, which has done extremely well as well. So there are existing innovations and clearly a number of planned ones which clearly I'm not at liberty to discuss for obvious reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And finally I just wanted to ask about cost cutting internationally. Can you give us some sense of what the, where you might look to cut costs internationally, or how?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're always looking at being more cost-effective and efficient. At this point I don't want to specifically target any area. We have centralized procurement. We have centralized a lot of back office activities with centers both in Krakow in Poland and as well as Madrid in Spain. And you will continue to see a lot of that. So, we'll address most of that on March 11th. But as I said, whilst we continue to focus on costs, the key certainly in our industry is top line growth and ultimately volume and revenue growth.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question is a follow-up question coming from Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Hi Louie again, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just had two quick ones. First one is can you give us the tax rate assumptions then I guess for the combined company, if not perhaps the pieces for 2008, that is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think back in August I gave indications of an Altria tax rate of between 37 and 38%. And for PMI between 29 and 30%. And those still remain pretty pertinent and accurate estimates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the tax rate for Altria being about a percentage point higher in '08, though. That's still within that range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Versus 2007, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Gotcha. Then just the last question was relative to this very robust new product pipeline you have for Marlboro, should we expect PMI's premium volume to grow in 2008? I guess specifically Marlboro, but also the whole kind of premium brands that you operate there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said in my remarks that we anticipated a continued improvement in our mix and clearly that means premium is growing faster than the others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
