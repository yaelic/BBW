          <p>Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Second Quarter Results Announcement. This morning, we are joined by our CEO, Mr. Piyush Gupta; and Ms. Chng Sok Hui, our CFO. Today will be the last media briefing that we will be holding in this premises, yeah. We have started to move to our new headquarters in Marina Bay, and so I think some of you who have been sort of frequently covering us, I think it would be kind of &#x2013; I just wanted to tell you like thank you for your support and do come and visit us in our new home when we move.</p>
          <p>But on that note, I'd like to invite Sok Hui, to tell us a little bit more about our second quarter results. Sok Hui, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We achieved record results for the first half as business momentum was sustained. Net profit rose 13% from a year ago to SGD $1.74 billion. Half year total income crossed SGD 4 billion for the first time. Net interest income reached a new high of SGD 2.66 billion, up 15% from a year ago as loans expanded 22% while deposits grew 10%. We were also able to raise wholesale funding at competitive rates to supplement our funding needs.</p>
          <p>Non-interest income was little changed at SGD 1.44 billion. There were increases in income from trade and remittances, wealth management, cards and treasury customer flows. They were offset by lower stockbroking commissions and investment banking fees given weaker capital market activities.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 13%, moderately faster than income as we invested for growth. The cost to income ratio was kept at 43% similar to full year 2011. Asset quality continued to be healthy. Specific allowances remain low while we took SGD 149 million of general allowances in line with loan growth and a prudent provisioning policy. ROE rose to 11.9% from 11.4% a year ago.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we achieved earnings of SGD 810 million, up 10% from a year ago as higher net interest income was partially offset by weaker capital markets activities. Total income rose 6% to SGD 1.95 billion. Loan and deposit volume growth resulted in a 10% increase in net interest income to SGD 1.32 billion. Non-interest income fell 3% to SGD 621 million.</p>
          <p>Investment banking fees, stockbroking commissions and trading gains were lower due to financial market dislocations during the quarter. These declines were offset by continued growth in income from trade and remittances, cards and treasury customer flows. Expenses rose 9% to SGD 872 million while allowances fell 24% to SGD 104 million. Compared to the previous quarter, second quarter earnings was 13% lower. Net interest income was little changed as the impact of a 4% increase in loans was offset by lower net interest margin.</p>
          <p>The underlying margin excluding treasury and market interest income was stable. Non-interest income fell 24% due to the strong trading income <mark type="ph" /> base (3:48) in the first quarter as well as financial market dislocations in the second quarter. Fee income from trade and remittances and its lending activities as well as income from treasury customer flows, were comparable to the previous quarter. Total income fell 10% while expenses declined 3%. Allowances were 28% lower as both general and specific allowances fell.</p>
          <p>Net interest income of SGD 1.32 billion was up 10% from a year ago, a little change from the previous quarter. While loans rose 4% during the quarter, net interest margin declined five basis points to 1.72%. The underlying margin excluding treasury and markets income was stable. Underlying margin this quarter benefited from a higher proportion of loans in our assets mix as well as higher margin in Hong Kong, but they were offset by a decline in China margins. We expect net interest margin to face slight downward pressure in the coming quarter with China margin likely to decline as China quickens the pace of interest rate liberalization.</p>
          <p>Loans rose 4% during the quarter to SGD 205 billion. This brings growth over the past 12 months to 22% or SGD 36 billion. Deposits declined 1% during the quarter. Over the 12 months, they rose 10% or SGD 20 billion to SGD 231 billion. While deposits will remain our primary source of liquidity, we also have access to other sources of funding. During the past year, we raised SGD 16 billion of additional foreign currency funding from institutional funding, commercial papers, medium-term notes, certificates of deposits, and other debt securities in issue bringing the total from these sources to SGD 29 billion. This has enabled us to diversify our sources of liquidity and raise funds in the most cost effective way. We'll continue to maintain ample liquidity in Singapore dollars, U.S. dollars, and other currencies to support business growth and meet contingencies arising from prevailing market uncertainties.</p>
          <p>Total non-interest income fell by 3% from a year ago to SGD 621 million. Continued income growth in trade and remittances, cards, wealth management product sales and treasury customer flows offset declines in income from stockbroking and investment banking. Compared to the previous quarter, total non-interest income was 24% lower. Fee income fell 7% to SGD 379 million as contributions from stockbroking, investment banking and wealth management product sales were affected by financial market dislocations during the quarter. Other non-interest income fell 42% to SGD 242 million due to strong trading gains in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Customer income from treasury products for the half year rose to SGD 500 million, up 29% from the previous half year and 15% from a year ago as we continued to make progress in cross-selling treasury products to corporate and retail customers. Customer income as a percentage of total treasury income remained stable at 45% compared to a year ago. Expenses fell 3% from the previous quarter to SGD 872 million in line with lower income. We were 9% above a year ago due to head count increases over the past year to support higher business volumes. The cost to income ratio of 45% was in line with the recent quarterly range.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong recorded first half earnings of SGD 367 million, up 10% from a year ago as net interest income increased and allowances fell. Net interest income rose 12% to SGD 437 million from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, loans expanded by 7% mainly from trade bills. Our deposit also rose 7% from growth in U.S. dollars and Hong Kong dollar deposits.</p>
          <p>Interest margin fell 7 basis points to 1.43% as higher deposits and borrowing costs were partially offset by higher customer loan rates. Non-interest income declined 13% to SGD 327 million as stockbroking commissions were affected by weaker capital market activities. Trading income and property disposal gains were also lower.</p>
          <p>Expenses rose 5% to SGD 323 million as higher staff costs were partially offset by lower computerization cost. Allowances fell 90% to SGD 6 million with both specific allowances and general allowances declining. Asset quality was healthy with the NPL rate unchanged at 0.8% for the past four quarters. Asset quality continued to be healthy. Non-performing assets were little changed from the previous quarter at SGD 3 billion and the NPL rate remained at 1.3%. Specific allowances for loans remained low at 8 basis points of loan, similar to recent quarters. Allowance coverage was stable at 129% and at 171% if collateral was included.</p>
          <p>Our available-for-sale investment portfolio was little changed from the previous quarter at SGD 35 billion. The total ASF portfolio had unrealized gains of SGD 590 million at end June compared to SGD 447 million at end March 2012 and SGD 411 million at end December 2011.</p>
          <p>Our capital position remains strong. Both the core Tier 1 ratio with phased-in deductions and Tier 2 ratio were little changed from the previous quarter at 12.8%. The total capital adequacy ratio fell to 15.4% from 16.4% in the previous quarter due to the redemption of SGD 2.5 billion of Tier 2 sub debt in May 2012. We have raised SGD 1.9 billion of sub debt in the first quarter in anticipation of the redemption.</p>
          <p>We are paying an interim dividend of SGD 0.28 per share for the half year, unchanged from the previous half year. Based on yesterday's closing price, the annualized dividend yield is 3.8%. The scrip dividend scheme will apply to this dividend. For shareholders electing to receive their dividend in scrip, new shares will be issued at the average of the closing share prices on 15th, 16th and 17th of August.</p>
          <p>For the macro-economic headwinds, Asia's fundamentals are sound. Our record first half performance reflects the progress we have need in strengthening our customer franchise across the region. We have demonstrated consistent execution, improved our product and distribution capabilities and maintained a strong balance sheet. We are in a strong position to capture the growth opportunities that Asia offers.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and I'll now pass <mark type="ph" /> queue (11:20) to Piyush Gupta.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Sok Hui. So as usual, I'll just maybe elaborate on a couple of points that Sok Hui has probably made. If we can go to the first slide, please. All right so, we're clearly continuing to have good income trajectory, $4 billion in the first half of the year is decent number. If you look at the bars, those are interesting. In 1945, this is what we did for the quarter, it is our third highest quarter ever. So <mark type="ph" /> I mean (11:58) the first quarter this year was a slam dunk, it's a big one. But 1945 is about the third highest quarter we've had, but really driven by the interest income line. So our loan growth and margins, the annuity income coming from interest income has been pretty steady, and that's what's propelling that.</p>
          <p>If you look at the non-interest income thing though, this has been the weakest quarter we've had in two years. It's at 620 odd million bucks. Now, it's not too far off either at this thing. We had $626 million in the fourth quarter last year, $639 million in the second quarter of last year, $620 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. So this is sort of not totally off the chart, but it is in the $620 million range, which are the weaker quarters for our non-interest income.</p>
          <p>So I guess the key thing to figure, this was a challenging quarter in that regard. And it's challenging because of a too broad &#x2013; respectively to the markets environment. Trading was off. Trading first quarter was on, so I think first quarter everybody in the world made a lot of money in fixed income, so did we. I'd say first quarter we were some 78 million bucks ahead of average. Second quarter, I'd reckon we had some 30 million bucks, 40 million bucks under average in terms of the trading number for the quarter.</p>
          <p>But the other thing was not just the trading number, capital markets was off for the quarter, and that obviously is quite material to us. Investment banking was slow and we were on the Man U deal, we were on the F1 deal, we were on the Reliance deal, none of these deals happened, right. So they all sort of disappeared, and that obviously is a little bit of a challenge from our capital markets investment banking standpoint for us. It also impacts our broking earnings because the stockbroking &#x2013; because business is steady contributor to us most times, but second quarter flow has disappeared.</p>
          <p>So the non-interest income was challenged, very driven by markets conditions and markets activity and of course, we all know the reason for that April, May, June, Europe really caused the whole risk off situation, which sort of flows through that part of our activities. So in that context to have the third best quarter we ever had, to continuing to record 11.9% ROE for the first half of the year, I'm actually very pleased. It just demonstrates a degree of resiliency in our business and our business mix today that we can take some of these headwinds and still come out with a fairly decent set of numbers. Slide please.</p>
          <p>I'll spend a couple of minutes talking about the underlying business momentum around our key business drivers, which I generally share with you, so I think it'd be worth looking at that again. So our GTS business just continued to do strong. Frankly in this quarter, this is the only business which grew quarter-on-quarter, and this tells you how robust the GTS momentum is today, both cash and trade continued to grow quite nicely. In fact, both lines of business are double of what they were a couple of years ago, so very pleased with the performance. I can see they're continuing to juggle on quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Slide, if you look at treasury, customer flows from treasury, they were off a little bit from the first quarter and that reflected the amount of activity from clients. Remember, customer flows from treasury come from both the institutional and the consumer side. In consumer, a lot of clients, the wealth management clients were less active in the quarter, so that impacts the customer FX flows we make from them as well. But if you look at the broader trajectory of those bars and go back to the beginning of the chart at SGD 125 million, so we're off a little bit, but the trajectory of those things is very good. And for the first half of the year, our total customer part of our treasury income was 45%, actually second quarter was 49%, but that's a little misleading because trading came down. So obviously the customer portion went up, but roughly 45% of all our treasury business is customer-related. I feel quite good about that and that's continuing to improve from a trajectory business.</p>
          <p>Slide please. If you look at the wealth business, again, marginally down from the third quarter SGD 195 million, SGD 203 million, but again if you look at the underlying trajectory, holding up really nicely. In fact, I am quite pleased with how well the business held up through the April, May, June period. I was a little concerned that this might wind up having a <mark type="ph" /> big this thing (16:16) it didn't. It was quite steady. And if you look at our earnings asset base, it's actually continuing to touch up. So we have about a SGD 110 billion of earning asset base now, 15% up year-on-year.</p>
          <p>The other couple of interesting things about that business, one is the productivity of our sales force in that business is continuing to go up very nicely. And I might measure productivity by the revenues per relationship manager, sales personnel, right. So our productivity is up 35% year-on-year. So which means the model of actually taking people, training them and getting them to move up the chain and sell, that's working quite nicely, so I'm quite pleased with that. Incidentally, both Euromoney as well as Asiamoney, named us the best private bank in Singapore, best local private bank in Singapore. I always feel good about that.</p>
          <p>Slide, as we look at the SME business, same story. Marginally behind first quarter, but again if you look at it on a trend trajectory basis, continuing to do extremely well, we're up 22% year-on-year, loans, deposits and frankly across the region. So the regional platform we established for SME is kicking in quite nicely. So it feels good and <mark type="ph" /> I can't (17:35) talk about our asset quality, but not seeing any stress or strain on asset quality in that business at this point in time either.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the box at the bottom, I just want to make the point. If we look at from a product line standpoint, we said we wanted to build out transaction banking and treasury customer flows as key parts of our business mix. That is today 29% of our total revenue base when you look down our product line. First half of last year, it was 23%. So we've continued to move that along and we're really becoming to be more of a uniform &#x2013; a universal diversified bank that we're trying to get to be.</p>
          <p>If you think about it from customer segments, we said that we wanted to build out the SME segment and we want to build out the wealth segment. So those two segments today contribute 25% of the bank, right, the SME and wealth segment. A year ago, that was 22% of the bank. So again, it's up 3% in the year, which is again a good thing. So for both product and customer segment, we can see directionally, we continue quarter-by-quarter to head to the kind of bank that we're trying to create. And finally, our regional operations, the 21% of our business is outside the core markets and they were 18% this time last year, so same story. We want to continue to build out the region, China, and <mark type="ph" /> Asia (18:54), and that's also continuing to kick in quite nicely.</p>
          <p>Slide please. On liquidity, on liquidity, obviously deposits continuing to be a bigger source of liquidity. We, as I mentioned before, have started going to the wholesale funding markets to supplement our deposit base, but it's still SGD 29 billion, SGD 30 billion, that's about 10% of our total funding is from wholesale. In this quarter, we actually effectively relied a lot on wholesale funding relative to deposits.</p>
          <p>So if you look at our performance summary, you'll see our fixed deposits have come off for the quarter, and the reason for that is that the commercial paper market, particularly the U.S. commercial paper market, was extremely attractive to funding. So we were able to fund substantially under LIBOR. LIBOR minus 20 basis points in the commercial paper market and whether the share to go on these fixed deposits from the customer base, you'd be paying 50 basis points higher at least across the board. And so effectively, we just felt it was a smarter thing to fund in the CPU market in this quarter as opposed to compete in the FD market.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, we see our deposits are flattish and we supplemented that with wholesale funding. That was the planned part. There's an unplanned drag of &#x2013; our savings and costs actually stayed flat for the quarter. That wasn't planned, right. That was unexpected and the reason that happened is the Singapore dollar deposits in the system stayed flat for the quarter. You know SGD 460 billion odd, so deposits in Singapore didn't grow this quarter. And we really think about it, a lot of the Singapore normal savings money should have grown by a couple of billion. That, I think, leaked out into all of the financial instruments. So the fixed income <mark type="ph" /> of issuances (20:36) sucked up a lot of the money which should normally have come into the banking system. So it was unusual quarter in the sense, but frankly from our standpoint it's not a big deal. It's a one quarter aberration.</p>
          <p>Overall, our liquidity situation is very comfortable. We continue to have a SGD 10 billion liquidity cash cushion. I talked about it the last time. I was just concerned about the European situation and I said we just go along cash, and so that's costing us some money, it's a drag on our NIM and our P&amp;L, but just we're sitting tight on that SGF 9 billion or SGD 10 billion, and we're sitting tight on that because I'm just not certain what might come out of the Europe, U.S. kind of environment.</p>
          <p>We also have a lot more wholesale funding capacity. DBS is a very well regarded name in the international funding markets. There's tremendous demand for our paper, so we could quite easily issue a lot more commercial paper, issue a lot more of this thing and we potentially can fund another SGD 10 billion, SGD 15 billion in the wholesale markets if we need to. So our liquidity position is still quite comfortable, not overly concerned about that.</p>
          <p>Slide. Asset quality, same thing. Non-performing assets, as Sok Hui pointed out, they've not changed from the previous quarter. Our NPL rate hasn't changed. We are not seeing any stress in any of our portfolios. By country, we're not seeing it in China, we're not seeing it in India, we're not seeing it in any product line. The consumer delinquencies are not going up, SME is not going up, property is not going up. We obviously, as I mentioned, we've been stress testing our portfolio regularly for now the last 12, 18 months. So we've stress tested commodities, oil, shipping, India, twin deficit, et cetera. And our portfolio quality is pretty good, I mean, what ever we thought were issues, we've provided for them, as you know, we've been really aggressive about our provisions. And over the last year or so our, general provision, SP, it was just ahead of the curve and took as much provision as we thought we could frankly, definitely more than prudent. So I'm quite comfortable with our overall asset quality as well.</p>
          <p>Slide. I feel good about 10 quarters, now consistently strong performance. This is the 10th quarter where I think we've been ahead of expectations and I feel pretty good about that. Our underlying fundamentals of our business are shaping up well and if you actually do a stock comparison of the profile of DBS today compared to a couple of years ago, it's materially different. It's shorter tenure in the asset book, it's more diversified, we have more GTS, we have more treasury flows, we are more broad-based, so it is a materially different picture. There is market uncertainty. So second quarter was uncertain, it has not changed so far. So if you look at July continuously uncertain and as best as I can tell I think the rest of this year is going to be very, very uncertain.</p>
          <p>I mean, Europe, I don't see a quick resolution. The U.S., I think there are clearly headwinds. GDP in the U.S. slowed down from roughly 3 to 2 to 1.5, three successive quarters and I don't see any prospects for that turning around in a hurry, so there's some disdain over there. The China slowdown has been real, so the second quarter in China, apart from external demand, domestic consumption demand and domestic demand in China, has come off a little bit and we saw, I mean, you guys reported yesterday, the PMI Manufacturing listing all our Asia has been down and that's really a function of, and consumption demand being down.</p>
          <p>So my own sense is that growth in Asia is fairly slowing somewhat. Even though, the good news is Asian fundamentals still remain very strong. I told you when you do a stress test, we don't see stress or tension in the portfolio, that really speaks to the resiliency of the corporate base in Asia. Leverage is low. Corporate balance sheets are very unlevered and therefore there's a high resiliency in the customer environment in Asia. So while Asia has slowed down, I don't expect the portfolio issue. The fundamentals are pretty strong.</p>
          <p>Our loan pipeline interestingly is still very healthy, continues to be quite solid looking though I do expect some headwinds. So our first half of the year, we grew annualized 12% in our loan book, well <mark type="ph" /> in senses (24:47) that will taper off a tad and we'll probably see more like 10% loan growth instead of the 12%, 13% loan growth that I was really expecting, so a couple of percentage points of slowdown you'd probably see.</p>
          <p>Margins, as Sok Hui referred to it, we were diligent in managing our margins in this quarter even though the headline number looks off, but that's really, I've mentioned this before, sometimes we get benefited, sometimes hit by what I call technical margins. In this quarter, we raised a lot of Aussie dollar deposit, so you pay higher interest rates on Aussie dollar, but you earn it back on the swap. Unfortunately, the swap doesn't show up in the interest line, it shows up on the non-interest line, so &#x2013; and basically in discounted NOIs. So if you discount the NOIs, we &#x2013; but our NIMs went down in China this quarter, so we lost two basis points in NIMs at a group level on account of the China. At the China level, NIMs were down by 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So it impacted the group by about 2 basis points. We made up for that by improving our NIMs in Hong Kong, right.</p>
          <p>So as you look into third quarter, it is important to say in China, NIMs will continue come off, and for two reasons, one PBOC is obviously clearly loosening monetary policy. There were two interest rate cards. Our call is probably that with one more interest card they'll probably reduce RRR some more. So our downward cycle on interest rate actually puts a little bit of pressure on our margins. Perhaps more pertinent, they started liberalizing the interest rate regime. So they now let you price loans down to 70% of the benchmark rate and they let you pay for deposits at 10% higher than the benchmark rate. This is actually very profound.</p>
          <p>If you sort of think about China, the whole China banking industry has been architectured on fixed margins and that's what allowed the Chinese banks to make SGD 170 billion in profits last year. So this is actually a very, very significant shift that they're liberalizing the interest rate regime slowly and gradually.</p>
          <p>To me when people ask me about capital account liberalization in China, I always maintain that it will be slow in coming because of the fixed interest rate schedule. But as soon as they started creating flexibility around that, I'm of the view that we might actually see some movement on overall convertibility quicker than most people think, and I'm still staying three, five years, I'm not saying overnight, but it's interesting.</p>
          <p>Anyway, so I think we have seen a little margin pressure on that account, but net net I don't believe the loan slowed down a little bit, margin pressure a little bit, it's going to be material to our earnings and our business. It will be some, but I think we have the capacity to be able to make up for that through a whole bunch of the other business lines that we have. So fundamentally, our business momentum is on track. And based on that underlying business momentum, I'm reasonably comfortable that we should be able to have a fairly solid rest of the year as well.</p>
          <p>Okay. I'll stop there. I'll be happy to take questions.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Piyush. So the reported net profit in excess of SGD 3 billion at the end of last year and this time our around, our first half net profit, it is also a record at SGD 1.7 billion. So it's been a <mark type="ph" /> few set (27:54) 10 quarters of really strong performance. Questions please? <mark type="ph" /> Conrad (28:01)?</p>

          <p>Interestingly for the second quarter, our trade finance grew by about 6%. 6.5%, and the loan growth was &#x2013; as reported was for currency adjusted was 3% for the quarter, so annualized 12%. Trade finance was double, it was at 6%, 6.5%, right, currency adjusted. So we were able to replenish all of the trade rollovers and then grow on top of that for this thing. So it was reasonably decent. However, when I talked about headwinds and loans slowing down from 12%, 13%, to maybe 10%, part of that will be trade finance. So the trade financing is slowing down and as you'd look out the next six months, I think our capacity to replenish and continue to grow is going to be somewhat constrained. I think we can replenish, we might not get the same growth as we had on a year-on-year basis.</p>

Your net profit for Greater China was up 22%, net profit for South and Southeast Asia down 39%, but your loan book in China was up 30% year-on-year and you're also up quite considerably in Southeast Asia. What was going on there that produced the fall in that profit in Southeast Asia and the rise in China, and I hope I'm reading that correctly?</p>

          <p>Slide 14 for customer loans, this is a classification of customer loans despite the borrower risk, borrower incorporation. This is what they actually we booked for China loans could be booked in China, Hong Kong or Singapore. So if you're trying to correlate the numbers, that's probably not the best correlation.

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's come back to it later actually, because it's probably taking a bit too much time. The other question was on the trade finance side, are you seeing any stress at all when you're talking about corporate balance sheets in the region being quite strong. Are you seeing any stress perhaps at the lower end in terms of working capital and extension of credit lines because there's been some reporting out of some countries about that and especially at the SME end?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms about the net interest margin because they look like &#x2013; are they going to continue to decline and what's the outlook for the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say what is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Your net interest margin has fallen quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It hasn't happened that much, actually. If you look at first half last year to first half this year, they've fallen from 1.8% to 1.75%, right. So the five business fall over at 12-month period and like I said, some of that just tends to be noise. If you look at it quarter-by-quarter, as reported we are off by five, but if we really look at this thing, most of that is just what I call the &#x2013; and some, some, we're actually considering. Some banks call it treasury NIM as opposed to customer NIM because of the difference in this thing. So it's not really material.</p>
          <p>However, like I said, I think they will come off because China's coming off. China margins are coming off a bit. The rest of it is profit of course. The mortgage book in Singapore continues to be a little bit under pressure, but that, in fact, actually is improving. The way I explained this before, in our mortgages booked five years ago, the average life for mortgage is five years, right, five years ago, you booked them at a higher rate. The <mark type="ph" /> real gloves (34:07) come off, so 20% of your book rolls off which is a higher-rate book, the 20% of the book that comes in is a lower-rate book. So you have a couple of basis points compression from the mortgage this thing, but that curve is also beginning to level off. Right, because the curve was falling steeply, it's now almost leveling off. So in other quarter or two, you won't be in and have too much downward impact of the mortgage situation. So I think we will see maybe a couple of basis points of real impact.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Other than China, we were &#x2013; now, in fact Hong Kong, we were able to raise margins. So through this quarter, Hong Kong reported NIM, if we look at the Hong Kong number is actually quite huge, but some of it due to pricing adjustment. But we got a net increase in NIMs in Hong Kong of about eight basis points and the eight basis points for Hong Kong essentially translated to a couple of basis points at the group level and they've covered up the reductions in China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're holding up quite nicely. So they came off end of last year but second quarter was quite strong for mortgages, home loans. We were also been able to hold market share, in fact, actually we increased market share a tad in this quarter by a couple of &#x2013; 0.2% or 0.3%. So that helped our own book, but overall, the market is holding up quite reasonably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so this is compared to the first quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Compared to the first quarter, even compared to the average of last year.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the number of new home loan applications that's holding up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact second quarter was meaningfully higher than first quarter. First quarter was low because of the December actions and the tightening that was taken, so second quarter has bounced back to 2011.</p>

      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, can you give us an indication of how much DBS can take its stake up to in Bank Danamon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe other question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you mentioned that your GTS has been performing well, right, and is up 60% year-on-year. So how much of that would you attribute &#x2013; it's DBS filling the deleveraging gap of the European banks? Then second question is, I mean, what's your loan-to-deposit ratio in USD as of 30 of June? And I mean, I know of 31, March was it was 150%. So how far do you think DBS will be able to continue to fill this deleveraging gap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first for the deleveraging gap, it was helpful and I explained that through 2011 when the first euro shock happened, clearly, the French and European banks pulled out. I mean, the Chinese came overseas, so that created this big market opportunity. We filled that opportunity. But it's becoming less and less relevant partly because the trade finance demand is reducing, I talked about that, so a lot of the money financing is going back onshore and a lot of the financing is basically falling off as &#x2013; GDP is falling off, as growth rates are falling off.</p>
          <p>Also, for the last &#x2013; this year after the LTROs happened, the European banks have had the liquidity. So they've been able to support the large customers, right, and so they came back into the market. So while it was important for us to get our propulsion last year, it's not been a very material factor this year.</p>
          <p>In terms of our LDR, as you know, we really think in terms of fungible currency LDR. For me, whether it's U.S. or Aussie or euro, it's all &#x2013; and they can swap it anytime you want. Our overall fungible currency LDR is roughly <mark type="ph" /> very positive (38:24), it's about 116% and 117% and just sort of bounced around quarter to quarter, it came down to 113% or 114% last quarter, it was 116% the previous quarter, so it's in the range. Our U.S. dollar, if you really want to know the things about 150% still, its high was about 170% in the third quarter of last year and slowly brought it down to 140%, but it's not meaningful because it is swapping from currency to currency rate. So it's really a practical thing depending on what currency makes sense, like this quarter, we've gone along Aussie that's why we got the drag on NIM, but these are treasury decisions and they vary from quarter to quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>LDR went up to like 89% in this quarter. Have you lost out like in the deposit war against some of the <mark type="ph" /> secure FDs (39:14) which have offered very high quarter three?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you track back, for the last three years now, frankly ever since I come on this thing, we made a conscious choice not to compete in the high price fixed deposit game in Singapore, because we never we needed to and we still don't need to. So we've been quite consciously letting our fixed deposit market share erode. We used to be 10%, 11% of the market, we're now 8% of the market and that's because we just don't want to go and pay uneconomic rates for fixed deposits and so that's been the case. Our overall market share has always stayed steady in growth because we get the savings accounts and so we're quite happy getting the savings accounts and not competing for the fixed deposit account. So the same thing happened this quarter. Our fixed deposit share continues to come because we don't compete in that space except the normal growth in our savings account that we normally get, didn't this quarter. Well, that's the only thing that happened.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to check on the loan growth of 10% is that for the full year and what changed &#x2013; because in the first quarter it was in the lower teen, so what changed in the period from then until now that forced you to revise it down by few basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just mentioned in the outlook for the economy, right? I think Asia is going down. So the headwinds on Europe and the pending slowdown in Asia, the slowdown in manufacturing and the slowdown in trade for Asia, that's been lower in the loan demand for us. So the general slowdown, Europe, U.S. and now China, Asia that's what winds up in a little bit &#x2013; tad bit slower loan growth.</p>
