          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome to the Roche Full year Results 2008. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dr. Erich Hunziker, CFO and Deputy Head of the Corporate Executive Committee. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Stephanie. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Together with Bill Burns, CEO of Roche Pharma, J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer, CEO of Roche Diagnostics, Karl Mahler, Head of Investor Relations and key members of our team, we welcome you to our 2008 annual results conference call.</p>
          <p>This morning you were able to actually look down all the relevant data from the internet and we will base our presentation here on the investors presentation and refer to the charts with the numbers.</p>
          <p>This afternoon, Severin Schwan, our CEO, will address the general picture, so I take some of his charts. If we go to chart number five, you're having an overview that 2008 was a good year for Roche, and that we actually have achieved what we wanted at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>You have this in chart six in clear figures. We had guided for high single-digit, and I think there is more higher single-digit than 10% for Pharmaceuticals, excluding Tamiflu and Diagnostics and for the Group. And the picture in chart seven, you're already in the meantime absolutely familiar. You have in green; you have the underlying growth of 10% of our two core businesses. You then have, and I think also there Bill and his team did great a job in guiding us exactly through where we thought we would develop. You have the impact of Tamiflu and then you have the domestic ForEx impact, which we will address also later, to the Group result in Swiss francs.</p>
          <p>If you go to chart nine, I think this shows an excellent development of our operating free cash flow, which almost has doubled over the three years. And this leads me to the chart number 10. I'm very well aware that you're all interested in the 2008 interpretation of the results, but also into the outlook of -- for 2009.</p>
          <p>We are convinced that positioning of the Roche Group with medically differentiated products will give us a tough year ahead, but we have a very realistic chance again to gain market share in both divisions.</p>
          <p>We have many advantages at the moment. One of them is that we have, amongst others, the lowest generic exposure to all our peers. We consider the difficult financial markets to continue and I will address this in my part.</p>
          <p>And I think that's extremely important and it may not be on the forefront of many of your minds, but this Group continues to be fully dedicated to innovation. And to give a you little bit more flavor and of course Bill will address this, if you turn to chart 11 you see that even in difficult times, we fully invest into the future and there is an amazing number of new projects which have moved in the right direction in our pipeline and which, of course, the closer they come to market and the more they get into the late phases of development, the costlier they become. But I think this is a clear sign that we do not actually sacrifice our long-term future by making too many cuts in the actual situation.</p>
          <p>Chart 13 gives you an overview how we think that the year could develop. We are fully committed to grow our portfolio. We see further favorable trends from our product mix and we have a lot of efficiency programs running now already for several years, which will all add up in the positive direction.</p>
          <p>But you will also learn that our R&amp;D commitments are extremely heavy and they will leave their marks in the results. And as I said, we consider that the difficult conditions of the financial markets, which actually happened in the second half of 2008, will continue through 2009 and therefore we see a more difficult situation in this field.</p>
          <p>So maybe that's for a start. We will, of course, wrap up our checklist by the end of the presentation prior to Q&amp;A. And with this I hand over to Bill Burns, CEO of Roche Pharmaceuticals.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. A pleasure to take you into the Pharma highlights for the year 2008. Starting on chart number 16, as you've heard already and seen the growth of the division, we put the underlying growth of 10%, that's on a like-for-like basis, that's twice the world market. And then if you include the washout of Tamiflu coming at a 5% growth, that is in line with the world market. So, however you look at it, strong year and indeed that represents now the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth in sales in the Pharma division.</p>
          <p>We were also able to tickle ahead our already impressive operating margin by 0.6%. And also during the course of the year, just in summary -- we've walked you through this as the year went on -- a number of major approvals, important filings and significant clinical data, including this week, the ATLAS study, also confirming the SATURN study in first line maintenance, this time with Tarceva on top of Avastin, whereas SATURN was Tarceva on its own. And actually 12 significant Phase III projects were initiated during the course of the year, including three new molecular entities.</p>
          <p>On chart 17, you see our scorecard which we shared with you at the beginning of the year and the score as we've finished the year. If we take it from the filings, AVADO for Avastin, filed Avastin and Tarceva, in BETA lung we did not file, CLL first line just as the year started we achieved the approval for that in Europe. And of course we submitted the REACH data, which will also be building on the indications this year.</p>
          <p>We have the DMARD IR for MabThera, where the imaging data's given us a very strong dossier that will now be a submission in this first half of the year. And by the close of 2008, Avastin had been filed for glioblastoma, both in the United States and in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turning to chart 18. This is just <mark type="inaudible" /> gives you the various component parts of the division and how we get to this 10%, on a local basis, of organic growth. The growth through the year in each quarter, summarized on chart 19, also shows that there was a good sustained level of growth across the whole year. All of this led to that improvement in margin on page 20 at 36.1% as an operating margin for the division, and you can see the component parts through Roche Pharma, Genentech and Chugai. And of course when you look at it in these component parts, you do have  fund flow, the strong growth in products like Avastin do result in royalties going into Genentech and so forth.</p>
          <p>When we look at the P&amp;L in summary form on chart 21, here again the absolute sales at the 5% growth including Tamiflu. Royalties and other operating income, a modest increase of 91 million. Here we had some tail-end products that we've been selling. We've done this housekeeping for last few years and I think what is impressive in the structural relation of the business is that our cost of goods and period costs, in other words the cost of any idle plant and equipment, came down by 8% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Our marketing and distribution driving of the brands that drove that 10% growth superbly contained at a 2% growth. R&amp;D, clearly with all the invest in these Phase III programs that we're investing in, saw 11% growth. No growth in G&amp;A. And this meant that we could grow our operating profit by 8%. So I think in shape, another very strong year for all component parts of the Group.</p>
          <p>To try and build on the efficiency side, chart 22 may be a new way of trying to share some data with you here. The green line shows the growth and the head count &#x2013; and this is just of Roche Pharma. We had 3% CAGR from 2004 to 2008, so we now have 36,500 colleagues, full time colleagues today.</p>
          <p>The sales across those five years have a CAGR of 13%, which means that in sales per head the operational productivity has gone up by 9%. So a very strong performance and it shows the operating efficiency, the product mix, the relative focus on a certain number of customers; but also outside of the sales organization that by divesting, streamlining factories, moving resources, that we are getting more and more efficient on our sales per head.</p>
          <p>Let's turn then to look at the key franchises on page 24, summarizes oncology. 15% growth and just a small amount under 20 billion of revenues in oncology. You see the regional growth here. Japan, a very strong performance of 20 -- sorry -- it's 27%. And this was driven by the rollout of the new products of Avastin, Tarceva and indeed during 2008 the adjuvant Herceptin indication coming through.</p>
          <p>We had 9% growth in the United States, a combination of Genentech's oncology portfolio and Roche, and outside of the United States 20% growth. So I think a strong performance around the world and further enhancing our leadership position in oncology.</p>
          <p>When you look at the key brands that drive this on page 25, you now see that we have three key brands here with more than CHF5 billion revenues per product and all exhibiting strong growth. 16% growth for MabThera Rituxan, 37% growth for Avastin. And when you look at the regional performance, you'll see very strong growth in Europe/Rest of World.</p>
          <p>And Herceptin with 12% growth, we're now getting more of our, or a disproportionate amount of our growth, from emerging markets because we have reached about 75% penetration of ladies with early breast cancer in the top five European markets. And it's a slightly higher penetration that Genentech announced in their conference call.</p>
          <p>So we're seeing good growth across these three brands. Tarceva also growing strongly at 23% and Xeloda 13% with the increased use at adjuvant colon cancer, the rollout of the Xeloda data in Europe. And we are on track, we believe, for first quarter 2009 for Xeloda being approved in the United States. So again, very strong across all the key brands.</p>
          <p>And when you look at the uptake in the top five European Union markets, I share with you on page 26, one of the external &#x2013; it's Synovate patient monitorings. And what you can see here is that in first line, an impressive growth announced at about just over 30% share of first line utility and more than 25% in second line. So an impressive penetration is the first thing to say. You can see also that it starting to kick up and that comes from the approvals last year of the broadening of the label in colorectal cancer. And also the third point to make is even with those penetrations, there's plenty of growth to go.</p>
          <p>When we look at the late stage pipeline on page 27, what you can see here is that for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia I mentioned that we just had first line approved, the REACH data has also now been submitted for approval in Europe. That was filed in January.</p>
          <p>We also have the RIBBON-1 data, the third significant study in breast cancer to show the demonstrable proof of the role of Avastin. That will be a filing this year. I mentioned earlier the results from SATURN and ATLAS, and certainly the Roche territories that will be the basis of a filing to authorities.</p>
          <p>I know that our colleagues Genentech and OSI announcement went out talked about now looking at the fileability of the data. So, I think we've very strong data between SATURN and ATLAS and that will further strengthen the profile of Tarceva.</p>
          <p>The one that may be news to you, we did not make any announcements when the interim analysis occurred of HERA. This was looked at, they closed the box again and just told us to continue. So we are absolutely continuing as planned. That now means that really we expect the final analysis in 2011. And this may be frustrating for us that we haven't got the data as yet. I think it's excellent news for ladies with early breast cancer, but it still continues. So, strong data there.</p>
          <p>Turning to 28 and inflammation/autoimmune, I'm really encouraged by the uptake for MabThera Rituxan in rheumatoid arthritis of people who cannot or are not responding to the anti-TNFs. This growth has gone through approximately 450 million in 2007 to CHF800 million in 2008. Strong performance here as it's certainly the stage is set, but with the dossier submitted in the United States by Genentech for Rituxan and the dossier that will be submitted in Europe, that there is further growth going to come from this product in rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
          <p>This key asset was also joined during the year by Actemra, the launch in Japan. As you know, in Japan was a monoclonal antibody, there is an observational phase, a pharmacovigilance approach that's taken. We have, I think, 4,000 patients now recruited. We're tracking them and we really have to satisfy the MHLW [Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare] on both efficacy and safety before that can be released for broader promotion.</p>
          <p>Sales very much on track. People really encouraged by the feedback from the physicians on the patients. And now the stage is set in Europe with the approval that happened at the tail-end of the year. And I've just been attending the German Launch meeting. So we will be up and running and we've got our first prescriptions both in Switzerland and Germany and the rollout across Europe will move strongly forward now.</p>
          <p>CellCept also had a good year in this particular franchise, 2.1 billion, 13% growth. And the only point really to observe here is that in the United States, May 2009 sees the patent expiring and this, in the key European Union countries not until the end of 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to virology. With Tamiflu, yes we washed out. I think I had guided at this time last year to 1.7 billion. It came in at1.6 billion washout. That was closer than I could even have anticipated. I think it was a very strong signal that we were able to share with you that that was going to washout. Maybe, all the talk about with and without Tamiflu, we've now reached a point where -- to world governments, we've sold approximately 220 million treatment courses.</p>
          <p>This is still relatively modest to protect the planet, but it's where we are. And given the economic crisis, it's proving rather difficult to see some governments move forward in this. We do have within our guidance for the coming year some additional revenue from the United Kingdom and some additional revenue from the Japanese government. And that's already factored in.</p>
          <p>For Pegasys, this has been unashamedly in the developed world a market share gain. The market itself relatively flat, but we're sitting with more than 70% market share in the United States and growing. Comparable in Europe. And some of that volume growth that led to the 6% growth we're seeing coming from the emerging markets, from China, from Egypt, from Latin America.</p>
          <p>So if we then turn to the outlook, pro memoria on page 31, just if you see one of the external IMS audits of the generic and patent exposure, a number of companies and the Roche figure of 14% is certainly at the lowest end. So, we go into the years ahead in a strong position and as I mentioned, really the only key exposure coming out is CellCept in the United States.</p>
          <p>What we do have for growth up, to ensure that we are feeding the organization is on chart 32, a number of key approved indications that are still in rollout across world markets. The potential approvals that are coming up, first line and relapsed CLL, glioblastoma, first line metastatic renal cell in the United States and first line metastatic breast cancer in Europe with docetaxel. So a lot of work for my colleagues around the world to get the value unlocked here, not only for the patients but also for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>You can see in chart 33 that initiating 12 Phase III programs in 2008 has been a significant undertaking. And of course, these costs don't just come in the year of initiation. The majority of it comes the year later. Typically, for example, with dalcetrapib, we've embarked up on a 15,000 patient program. This is going through the mortality and morbidity outcomes. And so this will be a strong driver of the financial investment we make in 2009 behind development.</p>
          <p>We also have potentially up to 10 Phase III starts where depending upon the data presented to us, we will make a decision as to whether we go forward into Phase III. The two that are very clear at the moment for my mind would be T-DM1, where our colleagues in Genentech and Roche partner --- and we have announced that this will go into Phase III, and also with Avastin and glioblastoma first line.</p>
          <p>Some of the rest are still work in progress, either consulting with regulatory authorities or indeed looking at the protocol designs. We will come during the course of the year and let you know where we get to on this.</p>
          <p>Page 34 then will summarize for the year ahead. The significant clinical data that we believe will be coming through, the key filings for the year and our guidance that the divisional sales growth will be above market, mid single-digit in local currencies.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd now like to hand over to J&#xFC;rgen Schwiezer to take you through the Diagnostic division results. J&#xFC;rgen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bill. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The Diagnostics division continued its strong sales momentum, growing 10% in local currencies. Once again, this was faster than the IVD market growth, which is estimated at around 5%. Operating profit margin decreased 5.3%, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions and lower Diabetes Dare sales. I'll go into this a little bit later.</p>
          <p>The three main drivers of our growth: there is a strong increase in the number of instruments placed, a number of important product launches of both new tests and new ultimate systems, along with the strategic acquisitions made in 2007 and 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 37 shows that the Diagnostics division recorded sales of CHF9.7 billion, an increase of 10% in local currencies. Professional Diagnostics, Applied Science and Tissue Diagnostics continued to be the main drivers, with Tissue Diagnostics contributing around 4% of the overall growth.</p>
          <p>Diabetes Care declined 1% for the year due to continued strong competition and price pressure, particularly in the US market, while Molecular Diagnostics had a good 5% growth, also in a strongly competitive market.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 38, all regions contributed to the growth with a particularly strong contribution from Japan and the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>However, despite a strong double-digit increase in sales, our operating profit margin declined 5.3% to 12.3% of sales. Our cost of sales increased primarily due to amortization of product intangibles along with some one-time charges due to our acquisitions over the last two years.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had a strong increase in instruments and meter placements to expand market share. Both M&amp;D and R&amp;D increased due to investments made to develop the acquired businesses as well as increased investments to strengthen Diabetes Care. On the other side, G&amp;A increased by 4% as a result of a number of programs aimed at rationalizing the business.</p>
          <p>On slide 40, you can see that just over half of the decline is due to the impact of recent acquisitions. The rest of the decline is due to increased investments to further drive the ongoing businesses along with the portfolio mix effects and the lower contribution from Diabetes Care. To offset this, we have implemented a number of actions aimed at cutting costs and improving the profitability of the business, such as a zero based budget process and <mark type="inaudible" /> as of September we have in place head count decrease.</p>
          <p>With these and other measures, we plan to improve our profitability while still ensuring that we continue to invest in the business for continued strong growth.</p>
          <p>Now looking to details of the business areas. The main growth driver behind Professional Diagnostics continues to be immunoassays with 19% growth for the eighth consecutive year. This is due to strong placements of the cobas 6000 and 4000 systems along with continued uptake of our new assays, a number of which are first to market.</p>
          <p>On slide 43 you see a list of some of new assays that we launched in 2008 as well as those we plan to launch in 2009. These launches not only close gaps in our menu, but also allows us to enter in new market segments. This will continue to drive both system placements and reagent sales and strengthen our leadership in the largest IVD market.</p>
          <p>The Diabetes Care business declined due to continued competition and pricing pressure, particularly in the US market. New products such as the Accu-Chek Aviva and Performa had a double-digit growth and helped to offset the decline in the sales of the other products which now represent less than 30% of sales.</p>
          <p>We also have taken strong actions to return this business area to growth. We have strengthened our sales force to increase our commercial presence. We have initiated programs aimed at reducing our costs and over the coming month, we will launch series of new competitive products aimed at market segments where we currently have a low presence or there is an unmet need.</p>
          <p>From slide 46, you can see that Molecular Diagnostics is returning to growth with virology growing due to the automated real time PCR platforms. In 2008 the FDA approved our automated HCV and HBV tests in virology and our multiplex HIV, HCV and HPV tests for blood screening.</p>
          <p>Applied Science continued to outgrow the Life Science market with 19% growth. This was due to strong growth in our DNA sequencing and microarray system. And finally, the new business area Tissue Diagnostics, formerly Ventana, provided a strong double-digit growth. Integration is complete and commercial initiatives are well underway to expand the business in new markets in Europe and Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>In summary, slide 50 shows that 2008 was a busy year for us with important launches in each of the business areas. 2009 is no less busy with a number of new platforms and tests that will further strengthen our offering and will continue to drive our business. Due to this, the outlook for the Diagnostics division for 2009 is to continue to grow above the market in local currency.</p>
          <p>With that, I want to thank you and hand over to Erich.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, J&#xFC;rgen. So let's go into the financials. On chart 53, I built, to bridge build to the operational performance, because I think it's important that you also get some more background information on this result. I think this chart, which Bill explained in detail about productivity gains, reflects actually the mental model and the ambition of his management team to continuously, as we have shown you, to continuously optimize our structures and processes and to prevent that we would be forced into these layoffs of 10,000 of people in more difficult times, as we just have heard from many of our peers. Of course, we can never give guarantees, but at least the ambition is definitely there.</p>
          <p>If we go into the financials, just the bullet points. I think a key element -- and I'm sorry to have disappointed all those of you who've just taken the financial results of the first half of 2008 and doubled it for the whole year. Things were a little bit more complex and of course, and I will address this in detail.</p>
          <p>You have the bullet points here. We had a bond maturity, actually reduced our debt level by another 2.3 billion and we have invested more than five billion in acquisitions. And this have led on the average in 2008 to more than four billion less means to be invested than the year before. And there were all together, and I will address them, there were of course also some effects of the financial crisis, but also the currencies played a strong role. And this maybe on chart 54, is as we respect your analysis of our results, and all your prognosis didn't really explain some of the gaps, which we have identified.</p>
          <p>If you go into the blue bar of the local area growth, you see in the first half of the year, we had actually 2% growth. In the second half of the year we had 7 percentage growth, which is much better.</p>
          <p>But if you then look at the currency impact to come to the Swiss franc, you see that in the first half year, the impact was 8%. In the second half year it was actually 9%. And whereas, I think, most of you had the US dollar and the euro quite right and spot on, there were many other currencies, which all of them deteriorated against the Swiss francs, not the least for our friends from the UK. If you hopefully spend winter holiday in Switzerland, you may have realized that your strong British pound wasn't worth so much as it was in the past. And these are some of the effects you find here, which has driven operating profit down.</p>
          <p>Another important element, and I respect again this comes out of the complexity of our structure of Group. Our partners of Genentech have shown a very strong result. And if they deliver certain products into Roche in their independent results, of course this shows up as profit. But this only can be booked as profit on a group level if these products really reach the end customer. As long as these products are actually disappearing -- sorry for using this term, Bill -- but if they are still in the pipeline and the inventory levels of the Roche Group and do not reach the end customer, they actually cannot be booked as profit at a group level.</p>
          <p>And you will see if you take these two aspects into your excellent models, you will identify that you have almost closed the gap. So if we go page or chart 55, you see that this operating performance was exactly within our budget, it was in our perspective. Excellent, excellent results on the royalties and other operating income level. Cost of sales, again the production cost really under control. But of course, if we have very successful co-promotions like in the case of Bonviva, we have a profit sharing and the success of this at a sustained level also shows of course here with results that the profit sharing goes up.</p>
          <p>Marketing and distribution, it is just one figure here. But I think there is much, much more behind this figure. We have in a very, very consequent manner actually reduced our customer supporting structures in the more mature markets and have shifted resources into the still growing markets: Eastern Europe as an example, Asia, China. So, just one figure, but a lot of activities behind.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, as you can see, a tremendous increase, reflecting our belief in a very strong late stage pipeline and portfolio. And just looking at this figure of CHF8.8 billion in absolute terms, we went into -- not that we are lead payable dependent or so. But just to give you a flavor, this is the second largest R&amp;D or innovation spend of any companies in Europe. There is just Nokia ahead of us according to their figures. And on a global scale, we now think with these figures we are number five on a global scale in our investing into the future.</p>
          <p>Now coming to the net financial income, so I built you the bridge on chart 56 between the 834 last year in 2007, sorry, the year before and the 236 in 2008. The 609 I will address in the next chart. So if you go into the minus 180 as the equity income, of course it's a negative effect here in this year, but I would defend a little bit my team in a positive manner. The fact that we went out of equities in 2007 with profits showed actually that we assessed the situation quite reasonably and of course this one-time effects we had in 2007 could not be repeated.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you see the 67 plus, which is of course reflecting that we consequently have repaid our debt. And you also see that the ForEx losses in comparison to 2007 was actually were lower. And this again if some of you know that hedging costs have tremendously increased, sometimes four-fold, five-fold, I think this is also not too bad a result.</p>
          <p>If we now go to the big items, 609, let's turn to chart 57. And you will now see that out of this 609, 374 million came just by the fact that on the average, as I indicated, we have more than CHF4 billion less to be invested over the whole year of 2008.</p>
          <p>And, of course, in the second half of 2008, you hardly did get anything for investing your money  safe. And I have to admit in the second half of 2008, the question was not how much do we get, but the question was do we get our money back from the guys we entrust the money? So this is the 374.</p>
          <p>Of course you still see the 164 which we had to -- and the 86 where we really incurred losses. You have the details in the financial review you were able to download this morning.</p>
          <p>But just one last element there. I mean if you look at the currencies in which we hold our liquid funds now by the end of this year and compare it to the end of last year, you will realize that a much higher percentage point of our liquid assets are actually now in US dollars.</p>
          <p>So what this meant is that in July-August, we very consequently actually sold bonds in euro and in Swiss francs and turned the revenues into US dollars. Of course the losses we incurred by liquidating these bonds ahead of their maturity. They show up here as losses. On the other hand, the advantage that we changed -- exchanged euro and Swiss francs, actually at the moment it looks as a very good time window into US dollars, actually it doesn't show up here.</p>
          <p>We have on the chart of Severin when we built up the next year, we have given you a warning that we do not see the situation improving in 2009. So what are the three main factors which will impact the financial income in 2009? There is definitely a lower income from debt investment due to lower interest range. There is a lower income from equity investment due to poor market conditions and small remaining portfolio.</p>
          <p>And for the first time, I would like to draw your attention for those who really go into the details also to our pension plan. You know that since several years, we showed the delta of the results of pension plan in the financial results. And up to now it was more or less a non-issue because it netted out reasonably over the last years. But if you go into the details for 2009, we see higher expenses from pensions plan, mainly due to lower expected returns on plan assets again due to poor market conditions.</p>
          <p>So I hope with this, for those who want to dig into the details, you've got some more details and information then to step back and look at the results and to form your opinion. And as you know this afternoon, if the weather conditions actually let us in, we will be in London and we will be trying to answer as many questions as we can.</p>
          <p>If we turn to chart 58, on the Group tax rate. I think nothing surprising. The excellent development of Genentech in a high tax rate environment driving the overall Group tax rate up by 1.6%. On the other hand, you see a nice development at the Roche core tax rate. Small warning here &#x2013; there were some one-time effects in this improvement which were positive in 2008, but which will not as to this extent be sustainable for 2009.</p>
          <p>So if we come to chart 59, this just gives you the overview of the Group result. So yes, we could not compensate with the excellent operating performance and its development in the tax field. Everything which was impacted actually by Tamiflu pandemic and the ForEx, the very strong ForEx is impact, but still we think that the performance of our 80,000 employees which is reflected here was an excellent one in 2008.</p>
          <p>If we go to chart 60, on the free cash flow, you see that the operating free cash flow was actually 12.4 billion. Again, to repeat it, almost double in the last three years. And you see where we used the cash. So taxes and dividends together, 7.6 billion. And despite a billion of free cash flow, a little bit more we have spent on the acquisitions of Ventana, Piramed and others. And of course not to be forgotten, we also increased our stake in Chugai by 9.9%. The rest are netting -- almost netting out the effect, so that we ended the year in chart 61 almost at the same level of net cash as we started, but please have a look at where the debt situation is of the overall Group. We have consequentially actually reduced the debt situation of the group by 2.8 billion and we have almost, Roche core have almost no debt outstanding. There is just, two bonds left and one of them will run out in July this year and will be paid down and then the only bond outstanding is a very long-term British sterling bond.</p>
          <p>If we come to the equity movement, I think also nothing surprising. We started with a strong equity, the dividends paid out, very strong net income, and then there are the effects which are all illustrated in the financial review. The situations, the delta of the pensions plan, a very complex figure which you will not just find easily in the charts, but we will be able to explain it in the workshop.</p>
          <p>And then, not to be forgotten, this &#x2013; and that's an important element that any movements where Roche is increasing it shareholdings in both the companies which it already controls by a majority goes directly into equity, which means the 9.9% of Chugai we bought during this year goes against equity, this is part. And you may also realize that Ventana also it was closed in the same half year bought down in two steps. And the second step was exactly such a step-up acquisition because we already majority controlled Ventana after the first closing. So the second part is included in this figure. And it will not surprise you with the 2.8 billion, that means all major currencies have actually lost value against the Swiss franc. Just mirroring these assets in Swiss francs shows them a little bit lighter on the Swiss francs balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Balance sheet still very solid and coming to chart 64, we have committed last year that for three years we want to increase the payout ratio. So you see we have done this this year. The Board of Directors is actually submitting to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of Roche to pay out a dividend of CHF5, which is an increase in the payout ratio.</p>
          <p>And this leads me to our objectives of 2009. We want gain market shares in both divisions and for the Group. And we want to keep our core earnings per share at the same high level of 2008 in spite of increased investments in research and development and expected lower net financial income.</p>
          <p>So please, if the dividends payout doesn't show up here, this does not mean that we are skipping this or forgetting it. For the next two years, we are still committed to increase the payout ratio. So this is 2008 and before opening now the Q&amp;A session on these 2008 results, a very, very short comment from my side.</p>
          <p>You know that we have announced that within the next two weeks we will launch a tender offer in our process to take Genentech private. And I respect that many of you will have many questions in this connect. But I also invite you to respect that until this official tender offer documentation will be available, and this spring we'll bring you loads of information in this document which will be accessible to you, that you please respect that until this is out, we cannot answer any specific questions about why, process and so on.</p>
          <p>And the same to a large extent applies to the funding of this transaction. Yes, I can say just here we are confident that we can put together the funding and we have also communicated to you and I think you now see the 2008 end year figures in the balance sheet, you can form your own opinion how strong this balance sheet is.</p>
          <p>As we have announced that this transaction will be funded by own funds, by bonds, by commercial papers, and by bank loans, but I also here respect that we will not be able to go into any kind of details of the mix of this financing nor of the cost of this financing. So you have the beauty of being able to develop your models not being bothered by any facts. So you can make the assessment of actually how you judge the overall situation.</p>
          <p>And maybe with this, my colleagues and myself look very much forward to your questions on the 2008 financial results. Can we have the first question, please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few, I just kick off with guidance and on the Pharma R&amp;D, you grew 11% CR this year. Given you've got a similar number of projects starting Phase III, can we look at a similar growth rate in constant currency terms for next year? And related to that, just very broadly talking about return on investment, shareholder returns, obviously there was a significant investment last year and in '09 in R&amp;D. Can we just discuss when you expect that to pay dividends and see Roche return a double-digit EPS growth? And then finally, just one question for Bill on pipeline. Taspo [Taspoglutide], within the press release you talk about that program being reviewed. Would you just clarify additional patient numbers, change in patient risk groups and any change in filing timelines? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sachin, so you know us well. We don't give guidance on each line of the P&amp;L account. What we are signaling is there will be another strong year of investments in R&amp;D, but I'm not going to give a number. For the -- for taspo, yes, as you know there is the new guidance from the FDA. This is a sort of strict element about looking at the cardiovascular risk of any new product for diabetes care. You will have seen that in the GLP-1 area, there is some activity and there is a review by the FDA's advisory committee coming up on another GLP-1. We'll learn something out of that. We're also looking at the database that we have, So we haven't yet finalized exactly what the patient numbers would be or if indeed if we do need to add more patient numbers. So this is still a work in progress, but we did want to have a full disclosure that we are looking at this, we are not just ignoring it. And as soon as I'm clear, I have the presentation on the results we'll share with you if there is any impact on the timings.</p>
          <p>But for now it's, I think the interesting thing about the GLP-1s, maybe two points additional. Cardiovascular risk is something that when you've got a product for diabetes and you get weight gain and you've got some control in your HdA1C, it is difficult to know what the outcome is going to be in cardiovascular risk. When you have weight loss, it's a significant contributor to reducing cardiovascular exposure. So I do think there is a debate here to be had on the appropriateness of <mark type="inaudible" /> 1.3 and so forth. So I think that's one part and we just need to see how this plays out. The second part is that we have already picked up quite some considerable pushback on these guidance notes from the FDA by the diabetologists who believe that too strict an implementation of these rules will bring to a stop progress in the treatment of diabetes. So it's not yet as clear a field as we would like. Hope that helps.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Fabian Venner from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. You have -- you showed a reassuring topline guidance, sort of very cautious EPS target. I just wanted to come back to that. Can you name any other currency, sorry, other margin contraction sources apart from currency headwinds you're seeing. I'm asking because obviously you have Rituxan royalties expiring over the course of the year. You're insourcing Herceptin, Avastin production from Genentech, so that should be multiple sources of margin benefits. I'm just wondering what else you see there. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Fabian if I can try and help. I think probably what we've -- you're into a level of granularity on individual small line items. The main themes are really summarized on chart 13, which is talking about yes, we've got positive benefits out of the portfolio growth, out of product mix, out of the operational efficiency gains that we're pushing for, offset by this profound invest in the Phase III programs that we're doing and the general R&amp;D invest in both divisions. And then given the financial uncertainties which you folks are much closer to than us, it's very difficult to, at this point forecast what the assumed lower net financial results might be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Fabian, it was extremely difficult to understand your question and just true, actually. But if you go back to chart 54, I think I also understood an element of currency question. I have to admit it's very untypical that the situation we had in the second half year that, except for the Japanese yen, all currencies went into the same direction. Usually we have, especially in the others field, a lot of netting out effects that some currencies actually went up against the Swiss francs, others went down. So that's why in the past you never really realized these effects on the operating profit. And it was also for us, it was kind of a first that except for the Japanese yen, everything went weak against the Swiss franc, and especially also as I said the British pound.</p>
          <p>So I can, of course, not tell you in any dimension how these effects are balancing out. You know that we are very much working on so-called natural hedges, and that's so, which means that we have this income structures and the cost structures in the same currencies. And this is already working very nicely for the US dollar, for the yen actually and the euro, of course, we have a big profit surplus because we have much bigger sales than we have cost structures in the euro. And therefore, a weakening euro has always a high impact on our operational profitability.</p>
          <p>And you can also imagine we always talk about the success at the sales end in all these smaller but high-growth countries, Eastern Europe but also important countries in Asia. So there, of course, we have a positive situation in the sense that we have higher sales than cost. So if all these profits achieved in these countries depreciate against the Swiss franc, we feel it. So, it's up to you to guess will the actual netting out come back as it was in the last years, or whether -- in which direction the trend is. We remain committed that on the half year basis we will give you the details in how the situation is developing. I hope this was your question. So if we did not answer everything, please give it another try and maybe a little bit closer to the mike, because it was really difficult for us to understand your question.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. Can we have the next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Alexandra Hauber, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Can I first come back to the -- get -- ask about the net financials again, because I was wondering whether we should just use -- will it be a good assumption to assume, this is not a low-yielding environment but a zero-yielding environment? And therefore you're just saying -- this line, this item is actually -- the net item is actually going to be negative, because all you have is your cost of debt and your pension plan expenses? And then the other two questions are for Bill, back on the R&amp;D. You spent 20 to 22% on R&amp;D in Pharma in '08 and that's clearly sort of uncharted territory for us pharma analysts. And I am sort of -- could you just -- I know you don't want to give guidance on line items, but I just think philosophically, is that now heading towards 25 or is that a long-term trend that it keeps going up or is that 2009 sort of the last increase of the ratio? And to give us a bit more color on how that is composed, I think in the press release, you're talking about 40,000 patients in Avastin trials, but now I think we should get to a place where -- to a point where there is probably no longer an increase in the Avastin patients in development because some of those trials are wrapping up. Is that correct? And therefore, is really the bulk of that increase no longer in oncology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want me to take the R&amp;D first, Erich? Morning, Alexandra, nice to hear you. So, yes philosophically, what we have are a significant number of extremely large studies. As you know, the Avastin adjuvant program is very comprehensive: the two that are running in colorectal cancer, the three that are running in breast cancer, the one that's running in lung cancer. And those are going to have to run for a number of years. Similarly, with the CETP inhibitor, that's running for a number of years. It's a mortality/morbidity outcome study as you know. So there are a number of those now. If I think back in Roche's history about 10-12 years ago, we were at 22-23% of sales in R&amp;D for a few years, as we had similar heavy invest. And then there was some compensation again as some of those trials came to a conclusion.</p>
          <p>And the mid-term perspective has to be driven more by what's the quality of the products that people are bringing to the table for the Phase III work. What do we need to do and there's no doubt that over the years that I've been doing this and have been working with financial community, you folks have been the first to encourage us that of course we've got to drive the business for the long-term. So, yes, there will be some time of this heavy invest, how long that continues absolutely is dependent upon the quality of the upcoming decisions out of the research pipeline and what we need to do there. I don't know for example, will pertuzumab take us into an adjuvant setting ultimately. We're looking at a new adjuvant at the moment. Some of the other oncology products, will they take us into a similar remit? So I could probably talk, talk on and on about it, but that sort of gives the spirit of it. I don't think it's something that we're fixated on as a percentage of sales. We're fixated on doing the right studies to drive the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just to come back, I understand that this is a high level of investment, but I'm trying to understand the high level of growth of that investment you've already got in place. So just the studies you mentioned in Avastin, they have been ongoing for some time and obviously they're probably not quite fully recruited. But as a percentage increase, I can't imagine that this is still a big amount. And looking beyond 2009 when most of these major studies in diabetes and for the CETP have recruited, apart from the pertuzumab adjuvant, is there anything other large new Phase III investments which we should keep in mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You tell me. I don't know what the team will bring to me this year on, for example, IGF-1R. No idea at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Aleglitazar and how is -- what's the best thing to do for aleglitazar? What is the size, the scope of the study? The other interesting thing to reflect on. When data comes through and I think the investment community thinks that that's it. For example, the 4,000 patients on Actemra are still on Actemra and are still being monitored. Because we've got the study readout, we still have to go into a monitoring until the product is launched and approved in key markets. We have an ethical obligation. So the studies don't just abruptly finish. And some of those costs go on for quite some considerable time afterwards. So there is a rhythm to this. I don't think it's going to go on ad infinitum. Anymore so than when people were trying to model the operating profit and almost got us saving ourselves to death by looking at it as a straight line trajectory. I think there is a natural rhythm that will come in here that will not be just a continuing straight line growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the financial income side, I mean, we are not changing our risk profile. So, which means we will -- we have now CHF20 billion to be invested as a whole group. And this means are invested, will be invested on relatively short-term perspective with an extremely low risk profile. So your interpretation that these funds will not generate big returns in 2009, I think they are at the right side with the interest rates at the lowest point in the last 20 or 25 years.

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On your guidance, how do you embed restructuring costs? I understand that 240 million restructuring costs were charged in H2 to Roche ForEx EBIT. Please correct it if I am wrong. And what to expect for 2009, then, including of course your guidance?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just with bear with me, Marcel, I'm just trying to find the number. Bear in mind that the target we give, it excludes exceptional items. So to the extent that there are restructuring costs associated with the reorganization of the Pharma business in the US, those are excluded from the guidance and they're excluded from the core EPS this year as well. So that you can take away. Any other restructuring costs as a part of regular restructuring activities that happen throughout the group and these happen year-after-year, those have always been included as part of the core results and they will continue to be so.</p>

          <p>Okay, Marcel, I think I understand where you are coming from. Even this figure is -- has several components. It has a Roche component and it has another component, but now I think Ian has found it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That is excluded from the core EPS and to the extent that that process carries on during 2009, those costs were also excluded from the core EPS, so you can ignore them in terms of where we end up on the guidance, right? Being taken out.</p>

          <p>But its important Marcel, as Ian just has confirmed, we are very strict there. So all these programs which Bill has shown on the improving operational performance, any restructuring cost, with closing factories there, Marcel all go against the regular result. So we are not taking this kind of efforts out. We are working on this, but together with our auditors we really look, this is a huge transaction, a one-time transaction now, which will affect our US situation and we will give you full transparency on this one. And as I said, although the 243 has many components, but you can add them all together, you'll find them all in the various pieces of the results. But we will help you this afternoon, if you need help there. Can we have the next question, please?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Why is your sales growth rate cut in half in '09 from '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; where do I start. First of all, you have to take into account that CellCept goes off patent during the latter part of the first half year, May, so there is an erosion in the United States that comes in from that. Some of the growth -- the rapid growth on products like Herceptin, when I show a 75% penetration of the early breast cancer market in Western Europe and a slightly higher figure than that in the United States, means that the growth that we do get comes from broadening the base into other territories. So it tends to be at a more modest growth rate than what we saw coming out of 2005, '06, '07, '08 in penetrating into world markets. So there are a number you need to go through line item by line item. So that's pretty much where, given our forecasting, that's where we come to. And we still believe that this will be market outperform.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you want to dig a little bit deeper, chart 70, where you have the quarterly developed in the major territories of each single product, could help you to understand trends Bill just has illustrated. In general. I mean we have to see that some of the key products have reached a certain maturity still at very attractive levels. I mean if you look at this growth rate chart, all of them are high or most of the product high above market growth. But of course, coming from now last year from a double-digit environment and having to absorb an impact like CellCept, a very important product, going generic, I think to -- the ambition to grow above market and to still gain market share is still a very strong ambition.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, gentlemen. Two quick questions, please. First, could you give us what is your best guess on the currency impact at your core EPS level provided that currency exchange rates are not moving any more this year, since you are giving your core EPS guidance in local currency terms? And secondly on the tax rate, what would be your guidance for 2009? Would that be 25% back to the previous level given the one-time event you mentioned or will you be able to stay around 23, 24%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the second one, there are definitely one-time effects in the range of 1 to 1.5% last year. This also had to do that there were certain jurisdictions where there were changes in the tax rate, but we also had a profit mix where actually the profits in the high tax countries were a little bit down against the year before. The currency impact, I, really, on the core EPS, I cannot help you there, I mean. Ian will try.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to explain how we do constant exchange rates, obviously in our own internal reporting systems, we have everything in local currencies and we can run simulations at whichever exchange rates we choose. So in the actual results obviously we're using the actual exchange rates. How we do the, in the forecast to get, for example, to 2009 we will actually run that at the 2008 exchange rate and then it compared to 2008 at 2008 exchange rates and then we're comparing apples with apples on the ForEx rates. So that's how we get number, we're not making a prediction anywhere about where any particular foreign exchange rate is going to be. What we're saying is if the exchange rates are at the same in 2009 as they were in 2008, then that's where we expect core EPS to end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the question is, if exchange rates stay where they are today without making any predictions, what would be the impact at the reported core EPS level, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure we've got that at the core EPS. We do have some information on exchange rates sensitivities. And just bear with me and I'll just dig it out for you. You can have a look at page 19 in the financial review. So there we've got it on sales and we've got it on operating profit before  exceptional items.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the call. So, three quick questions. Firstly, could you just talk about the effects of the economy and demand patterns for both Pharma and Diagnostics. Diagnostics you clearly admitted you're seeing that within the diabetes segment. But within Pharma in emerging markets, particularly I'd be interested there. Secondly, I mean you are investing CHF10 billion per annum, which is, as you've alluded to, a very significant number. Given some of the recent commentary in the New England by Peter Back about the costs of oncology drugs going forward in the US, how are you modeling the continuous investments in R&amp;D given what looks like declining returns through limiting of utilization or pricing in that market? And then my last question is your press release talks with some certainty about completing the Genentech transaction. My question is what's Plan B if you're unable to achieve that for whatever reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think Andrew the position at the moment for Pharma is we have really not seen a true impact from the world financial crisis at all in Pharma yet. I know it's an old statement, but I think that's where we are. The churn that you see in our industry is much more to do with end of patent life and where different companies come from and how they read what they have to do moving forward. Maybe you're seeing greater aggression on restructuring because of the two things coming together rather than it purely being driven by the economy. If you take it from a conceptual point of view, demand for healthcare is still infinite. What I think we should expect to see is that as, if we take state funded medicine first of all as an example, but as governments have failed on the banking system or poured money into the system of the banking system. Then we may come to a conclusion, it's more difficult for their annual budgets to repair the roads, to build new schools, maybe also containing healthcare costs.</p>
          <p>Within healthcare costs. I think the early pressure is likely to be on more asymptomatic diseases or the more trivial end of the spectrum, the OTCs or minor interventions. And this is where you come to the core of what Roche has been about for a number of years now, the stronger the data that we have, the stronger the medical differentiation. And the fact that we are now dealing with life-threatening diseases, whether it's oncology, whether it in transplantation, hepatitis, you see it's at an end of the healthcare spectrum that I think it's less under focus than many other areas. That's in the United States.</p>
          <p>Again, I think what we'll see are two pressures. One is from the public themselves, but again in asymptomatic diseases will we see the same level of compliance to their medication. If there is a high co-pay, will people get their prescription filled. So I think we'll see some of that play out and indeed that may also play out in some of the emerging markets, where people primarily are having to pay for the medicine themselves. You may see some people in the emerging markets decide are they going to treat that cancer or put rice on the table for the children. Alternatively, you may say -- well, frankly there is no point of putting the money or keeping the money in the banking system, because it's just ruined. You might as well use it to save the person who's got cancer.</p>
          <p>So I do think that there's a mixture of emotions that will play out here. Having said that -- and to your point about oncology, it's interesting to note that of, this pressure is being talked about now for two to three years. One point I can share with you is that the net effect of pricing actions around the world has been virtually zero on Roche Pharmaceutical Division this year. Some countries with increase, some countries with minor decreases, but the net result has been zero, virtually zero. So I do think that again, it comes back to how strong is the clinical differentiation. And the better that differentiation, the more able we are to look the customer in the eye and ask the business. J&#xFC;rgen do you want to comment on Diagnostics?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So far and I think there is nearly nothing to add to what you have said. So far we have not given anything in Diagnostics. Of course, there might be some countries and we don't know what governments will do in the future and what they have to do, so we might be impacted <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[ph[ Yeah, speaking as head of Roche Diabetes Care , as diabetes is a chronic disease and there is of course a need, particularly for those patients who are on insulin to measure their blood sugar levels daily. We basically see a stable situation in markets where we have full reimbursement. And as Bill indicated, those markets where co-pay or out-of-pocket expenses are, we would expect a small impact given the economic downturn and the pressure is put on the individual's economic situation.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And taking up your question on the Genentech transaction, it's not only our press release which is confident, it's actually the management team which is confident that we will achieve what we want with this transaction. And sorry for answering with a counter question. Over the last seven, eight years, did you ever see that this management team did not achieve a major task which we have announced to you. So maybe with this we go to the next question.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One question for Erich, please. I -- just going back to your comments about the gross margin, they seem to imply that that's quite distorted for the full year. Do you have a clean gross margin estimate for the Group, particularly in Pharma? And then maybe tying that into the guidance for 2009, if those are distortions in 2008, how do you see that going forward? And I'm referring to page 54 of your presentation where you've seem to suggest that cost of goods adjusted have grown far less than they have on a reported basis. And then a question on diagnostics. In terms of the one-offs integration charges and the like in the second half, is there anything in there that we haven't seen in the first half yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, just to take up your point about gross margin, Pharma, I do think we've been chipping away. You see as the actual cost of goods comes down as a percentage. Part of this is a mix effect, part of this is the operational efficiencies and the way we've addressed some of the cost structure. The only element that comes to mind on a year-on-year comparison that you need to adjust for potentially was the write-off of Viracept in the year 2007, about CHF135 million, which was a write-off against the cost of goods, or an increase in our cost of goods, as it were. 2007 that's not recurring into 2008. Net of that everything else is business as usual. J&#xFC;rgen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No as I indicated, yes there are more than half of the decrease comes from the recent acquisitions, but that's all done. So in the second half of this year nothing is added.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, one of my colleagues is just saying well -- maybe the question was about the unrealized profits. Was that -- was that linked to your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there on chart 20, where I show the operating margin, there is a small box, the UPI, which says second half of '07 plus 135 million and second half of '08 minus 224 million. So those are the two figures that are relevant to the unrealized profit inventory that we held within the Group. And as we mentioned earlier, this is, for example, all product shift by Genentech to Roche would be declared within the Genentech figures because it's a sale and a profit. And we understand that, but if that is sitting in inventory in Roche Pharma, then that is unrealized profit that does not fall to the bottom-line of the consolidated Pharma division. Clear?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes good morning. Two financial questions and apologies if you have maybe already addressed some of them. First question, just on the core EPS guidance, I assume that any cost for the hostile DNA bid would have been stripped out of that, so if you could just confirm that. The second question on Tamiflu, there has been talk that most strains are now resistant. So I was just wondering could we potentially see the entire Tamiflu sales disappearing over, let's say, one to two years. Third question on the diagnostics margin recovery. I was just wondering how we should model that going forward. Is that going to happen maybe in 20bp increments like we've seen in the second half or is there actually a point where a lot of the excess investment will come to an end and the margins will rebound?</p>
          <p>And then finally, I'd just like to have another go at the long-term growth question. Basically, beyond the ongoing programs and assuming that you have done everything you can in terms of managing the lifecycle of your cancer franchise testing additional drugs in the adjuvant settings and so forth, have you actually already identified any additional spaces like, for example, central nervous system, where there would be so big an opportunity that you could imagine actually reinvesting, let's say, the entire incremental profit from Avastin in the adjuvant settings, Avastin in brain cancer. Basically just trying to get a feel for like where there might be potentially an end to the very high reinvestment or if this is almost like a bottomless pit and you have enough ideas to reinvest however much profits you generate out of Avastin, which really seems to be still having very, very good momentum. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of the four, very quick answer. Any Genentech transaction effects are excluded from this guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marietta, on Tamiflu briefly, the strain that has shown itself to be somehow uniquely resistant is H1N1. And this has been prevalent in some parts of Europe last winter and we're seeing some of it in Asia and other places this winter. This does not rule out the role of Tamiflu against other strains and so it would be wrong to say that most strains are resistant. We have a rogue strain, and it's clear from where this pops up, it has nothing to do would being exposed to Tamiflu. The virology community is still somewhat intrigued and is trying to study what's at work here. Uniquely for H5N1, the avian, so called avian flu and mutant forms that we've seen are still sensitive to this and we do still see the WHO and World Governments arguing that this is the drug to help protect against a potential pandemic. Also, in terms there are other prevailing strains, for example, in Japan this winter, I think about 30-odd percent is H1N1 and for the rest of it, we have strains that are sensitive to Tamiflu. So I don't think we'll see Tamiflu just fall out of clinical utility like that.</p>
          <p>And maybe just to then take the fourth question before passing over to J&#xFC;rgen on R&amp;D. What I see are areas -- and we've with you &#x2013; we're moving from strong oncology, we are building rheumatoid arthritis and some of the autoimmune diseases. For example, even in there, some of the work in areas like multiple sclerosis which -- is if you like coming out of autoimmune, but it's also relevant in CNS [Central Nervous System]. Our complex studies, high cost studies, we have then CNS program that we're building where, if it's successful in projects for Alzheimer's, again those could be relatively long-term studies. Contrary to that, some of the program would have been developed for Pegasys and HCP with the oral products, are relatively short, sharp and focused studies. So there is a combination of it coming through. I'm certainly not fixated on a percentage of sales or of trying to absorb all the profits from project X, Y, or Z into the life cycle management, but more intelligently making sure that we build the business and that we also address the mid-teens, when some of the key assets today are going to be off patent. And therefore we need a strong Phase III portfolio to continue to build the business for the mid-term. So what we're currently doing, and I hope you'd agree, we've come from a position where we had very modest operating profit in Pharma. We've now got to top decile performance in terms of operating profit. We're intelligently holding back in many of the cost buckets and we're investing for the mid-term in our R&amp;D and I think that's what we have to do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what I was basically trying to get at is, if you have several billion or let's say over a billion in incremental profits from Avastin, are you relatively sure that you would find attractive opportunities to invest that? Or is there a point where you would say, if Avastin gets to that level, then we just have to let it fall through to the bottom line because internally we don't even have the resources...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not a matter of trying to absorb one with the other. What we will be trying to do to make sure that we are continuing on a group trajectory. And therefore there will be a requirement for some investments, but its not, of course, we're not planning to continuously build the R&amp;D percentage of sales ad infinitum. That's not what we're trying to do. But there is a certain level that will be required. Don't ask me what it is in a percentage term because I can't give it to you. It's absolutely driven by the quality of the projects that we have and indeed what we want to do in terms of licensing modest acquisitions to enrich the pool going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we indicated, over the half of the decline was due to the impact of the acquisitions and the rest of the decline was due to increased investments to further drive the ongoing businesses and of course, other factors. We have implemented a number of actions aimed at cutting costs and improving the profitability. We have had a zero base budgeting process in on main areas of the organization and as of December &#x2013; as of September we have in place head count freeze and we have initiated several efficiency programs all over the world and we are convinced that with these and other measures, we plan to improve our profitability.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I think that's fair. We got Phase III started last summer. We should have the first results of some of this work by the end of this year. And what is totally unclear at the moment would be whether the cardiovascular risk has to be addressed as a post-approval commitment, or indeed is there further patient numbers that would be required for some form of meta-analysis to get to a hazard ratio which allows the FDA to say that's fine, it can be post-approval commitment.</p>

          <p>But that's sort of where we are at the moment in terms of working it through.</p>

          <p>Okay. I thought of one more, sorry about this. Looking at your comments on the tax rate for 2009 and interest income possibly turning into a loss, would it be fair to say that those two effects might remove maybe 8 or 9% from your EPS growth. So, there are still lots of room for operating improvements within the business and that's not inconsistent with your guidance.</p>

          <p>This brings me to the end of this call. I apologize for those in the question waiting queue. Take your understanding that we have to go into the media conference now, but you all know we show up this afternoon in London and on Friday we will be available in New York. And we thank you at this moment very much for your continuous interest in Roche and we are looking very much forward to meeting most of you in person either in London or in New York. Thank you very much. Goodbye.</p>
