        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it brings me great pleasure to see so many of you here despite the midst of Nordic vacation. You're most welcome to Nordea's Second Quarter 2012 Result Presentation and the Half Year &#x2013; the First Half Year 2012.</p>
          <p>And as we will basically follow the same procedure as last year; that means that the CEO and Group President, Christian Clausen will kick off with the presentation of the result. After that, you will have a chance to ask a few questions. And since this whole show will be webcasted, it would be great if you could state your name and who you represent when asking the questions. After that, we will split the group up, so journalists are invited to follow Christian over around the corner to ask him questions. And the CFO, Fredrik Rystedt, and the CRO, Ari Kaperi will continue to answer questions from analysts from the stage here.</p>
          <p>So, with that little instruction, I hand the floor to the CEO and Group President, Christian Clausen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and welcome to this presentation of our Q2 and half year result. I'm happy to see so many in a cold summer but for hot reports, so we will kick off directly. And the key messages, of course, that you have already seen, strong income and solid cost control. We have revenues up 6%, costs are unchanged in local currencies, solid credit quality, improving ROE to 12.5% in Q2. Cost income ratio below 50% and we improved our Core Tier 1.</p>
          <p>I will also spend some time on explaining our progress, our development towards the future bank. We are continuing the execution of our New Normal plan, which started more than a year ago and the main headline still is to improve efficiency on capital, funding liquidity and costs. And I will give some comments to each of the business areas as we go by.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the financial highlights. The first half year had record income and a record net profit of nearly &#x20AC;1.6 billion. Also, the quarter was new record, nearly &#x20AC;1.1 billion in operating profit. You've already seen the numbers. Net interest income continue going up, very healthy development. We do more business with more customers. The margin is more or less unchanged. Our gross margin is up two-hundredths of a percent but, of course, it's based on increased lending margins and lower deposit margins.</p>
          <p>Lending is growing. It's growing at an annualized rate around 6% in local currencies and that's actually quite a good number in this economic environment. Demand is, of course, somewhat subdued, so this 6% growth is reflecting a quite high activity. and at both on the corporates and the household sector, we see a growth which is fairly good.</p>
          <p>Deposits also up, more or less the same numbers. We get quite a lot of deposits also internationally; there's a clear flight to quality. And Nordea having &#x2013; it's kept its AA rating &#x2013; one of the few AA-rated banks in the world, of course, has some attraction.</p>
          <p>Net fee and commission income is also up somewhat, reflecting that we do have high activity with our customers. Customers are active on their financial side, so we see increased lending, cards and custody fees, stable asset management fees, and we also see a record level of assets under management right now and a strong inflow.</p>
          <p>Net result from items at fair value is also slightly up and it's still at a very high level and it's reflecting a very strong demand for customers. Especially in this environment, it is clear that that's one of the most important services we can give. especially to our corporate customers. They all need to hedge and to manage their risks, the interest rate risk, FX risk, raw material prices, energy prices and whatever. And we help them doing that and this is a very high activity level reflected in this income line. And this is very important because it makes it possible in this difficult environment for many customers, actually, to carry through projects because they can minimize the risk levels inherent in them.</p>
          <p>Expenses are unchanged in local currencies. As we said one year ago, we will keep flat cost for a prolonged period of time. And we are doing that and this is an important part of the New Normal.</p>
          <p>Net loan losses, unchanged. We see continued loan losses in Norway, Sweden and Finland. And we see still elevated levels in Denmark and shipping. Shipping is, of course, facing a difficult environment with new tonnage coming in, low demand. But we are managing it quite well together with our customers. So we see very little new problem cases, but we have to manage very carefully the development which is, of course, difficult and will stay difficult for a while. We're still profitable in our shipping business even after these reservations.</p>
          <p>And in Denmark, it's very much about managing the tail after the big housing problem we had in Denmark. It's still a tail, meaning that we have identified the customers. Some of them will come out fine and will take <mark type="ph" /> back the (0:05:41) provisions. Other will fall into default and there we have to &#x2013; may take further reservations like we have done this quarter.</p>
          <p>The ROE goes up to 12.5%, in line with our target, so be among the strongest banks in Europe.</p>
          <p>Core Tier 1 capital is up significantly. We have more or less doubled the capital in which we run the bank on since 2006-2007. And we continue to generate approximately 9%, 10% more capital per year, which is of course very important in this environment with new regulation but it is possible to generate this capital even after we pay dividends.</p>
          <p>And the risk-weighted assets are more or less unchanged. Risk-weighted assets improve because of improved credit quality and decrease in market risk. The FX takes off risk-weighted assets, and the derivative book also takes up risk-weighted assets. Derivative book reflects, as I said, hedges from companies and interest rates and FX, and since we're seeing interest rates going down and dollar go up, which is a typical transaction that corporates do, then we see some upward pressure from our &#x2013; on RWAs from the derivatives as expected.</p>
          <p>This means that we're improving our Core Tier 1 ratio to 11.8% and that development has gone on for a long period of time. As you can see, we improved 1.8 percentage points since 2010. And it's not because we are deleveraging. We are supporting our customers as you can see. We have in that period a lending growth of 16%. We've managed to keep our RWA more or less unchanged. And this is very much due to all the activities we are carrying out in the New Normal to ensure that we'll make capital-efficient solutions for customers and this is a big transition which will continue.</p>
          <p>We have very strong access to funding. As I said, we have maintained our AA rating, so we have raised &#x20AC;17 billion of long-term funding, which is more than our redemptions all of the year. We also opened a number of new funding markets for ourselves, not least the Samurai bond market, which have been very successful as you may have noted during the quarter.</p>
          <p>And then on LCR, we are clearly LCR-compliant, both totally and each currency. And this is, of course, very important in this environment. To have this big liquidity buffer, have a very strong long-term funding is, of course, key right now, and a lot of banks in Europe are struggling in this area but we are fine here. Of course, it has a cost to hold all these liquidity buffers but all in all it's positive development.</p>
          <p>And just to underline the thing about our business model, we do have a business model that is customer-based. We do not use our resources for risk taking in any major way and we only have the risk inherent in the customer transactions we do in our trading operation.</p>
          <p>Let me talk a bit about the future bank. We have already come a long way and this is my favorite slide; it shows Nordea market cap compared to our European peer group since 2006-2007, where we were sort of in the lower part of the peer group, now we're actually number three, which just shows that we have come a long way and the market gives some recognition for that, ahead of banks like BBVA, Lloyd's, Barclays, Deutsche and so on is, of course, an achievement which we are happy about showing that we are moving in the right direction.</p>
          <p>And of course, whatever we do, we do it based on the relationship model. Relationship banking is key. That is our business model. We are building close relationships with our customers so we can get close to them, we can advise them, we can help them, we can give real value to the customers. We can also help them when things are difficult by working things out together with them. We can do all their business, so in reality relationship banking is a win-win. I've said this on all meetings. I will keep repeating it because we are using our resources only on this. We are not doing all sort of other things. Core business, core relationship banking is what we are doing in Nordea and we are concentrating all resources on that.</p>
          <p>And that gives a very well-diversified business model and a very well-balanced business model. We have assets and liabilities and transaction from the customers, which gives a good balance, and we are diversified because all these segments are different in character and that is very clear. If you look at our results, the diversification effect is very significant.</p>
          <p>We run a fully-integrated business model. So all processes, all value chains are integrated across countries. So we only have one way of doing things and that is also a key thing. And we are very risk-focused. We only take risks we understand and we can manage. And the Nordics is, of course, our home base as you know.</p>
          <p>Just a few highlights from the quarter, showing activity level has indeed been high. On household customers, we have provided a very substantial financing of the Nordic households of &#x20AC;157 billion of lending. We acquired 23,000 new household customers including private banking. We had more than 400,000 advisory meetings with customers, real advisory meetings, scheduled meetings where we sit down and go through the whole customer financial situation.</p>
          <p>We have increased the number of active mobile bank users to 600,000, which is up 30% in the quarter, 78,000 new mortgages, 170,000 (sic) [190,000] (0:11:25) new credit cards and 320 million card transactions.</p>
          <p>And similarly, on the corporate side, &#x20AC;193 billion of total lending, very significant financing on the real economy in the Nordic area. We have now leading bank relations with 60% of the large Nordic corporates.</p>
          <p>We have had 78,000 advisory meetings with the SMEs, which have been very important part of this whole relationship concept. We're deepening the relationship. And, as I said, with strong dialogue with the customer, solving problems but also getting the business increasing our asset productivity. We are participating in raising substantial amount of capital to our customers, &#x20AC;5 billion in the bond markets, &#x20AC;1.4 billion in syndicated loans and we have handled more than &#x20AC;100 million outgoing payments. All in all, strong activity, just following our strategy.</p>
          <p>And the New Normal plan which I've been talking about now for four or five quarters is, of course, continuing. And we are well underway, as I said, we are running more than 100 projects. And they are all scheduled towards meeting these three objectives to be more capital efficient, more efficient in the way we deploy funding, loan funding and the way we set up liquidity and cost efficiency.</p>
          <p>And on the capital efficiency, you can see that over the last two years, we have indeed kept the RWAs more or less unchanged. Of course, we have been helped by improved credit quality, which is, of course, a very good thing. We have had growth, which increased RWAs, FX effects. We implemented Basel 2.5 last year, which increased RWAs but we've also done a lot of things to take down RWA. So they are actually down on that period.</p>
          <p>And on cost efficiency, it's all types of cost and in all areas but of course, it's very visible on the FTEs which are down significantly with 2,300 &#x2013; nearly 2,300 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:13:30). And we are continuing the plan, we're a bit ahead of plan and we continue to reduce, so expenses are unchanged.</p>
          <p>Liquidity is maybe the most important thing. That's probably the biggest change in banking. Yes, we have more capital, but that's not new to have capital, we just have more of it. But to have to set up liquidity purpose for most banking business we do, whenever we do a commitment to a customer, we have to post a liquidity buffer. We have to have liquidity buffers for possible draw on our lines and other things. That is very important and to price this right for customer and for transaction is key, so we get fair pricing. So if the customer draws a lot of liquidity and hand over liquidity risk to the bank, it will imply a higher margin. But if we can find a solution where that does not happen, then we can keep the margins lower.</p>
          <p>So this is key in banking and therefore we put so much emphasis on what we call liquidity premia. So we have a project which is now implemented, a model, where we actually can price liquidity costs to each transaction and each customer exactly where he is on the curve, exactly what type of liquidity it is in order to give what we call fair pricing. And this is key because that's a new thing that we have to allocate liquidity so precisely.</p>
          <p>It's similar to the way we allocate capital, of course, per transaction and per customer but it's, of course, a pretty complicated thing and one which entails a lot of behavioral changes. All our staff needs to change behavior and our customers need to react as well, in good dialogue, we have to find the solution where we can solve the customer problem with less liquidity and of course, less capital in order to have reasonable pricing.</p>
          <p>And this is coming out in all sorts of efficiency measures. I just took four of them but I can continue. Actually, I have three slides with measures like this. Total income per FTE is up; business volume per FTE is up; number of customers per FTE is up; and cost of service down. So, obviously, we are increasing the efficiency of the bank.</p>
          <p>A few comments on each business area on a high level. We are all doing the same in the New Normal plan but of course it's slightly different coming out. And in retail banking, it's very much about having the focus on the relationship banking and the most profitable segments. So we will be sharp on business selection, what business is not profitable, what business is one we can take up on our balance sheet in the New Normal and what we cannot. We are much more disciplined on the RWAs and the capital deployment.</p>
          <p>And of course, the most important thing is developing the future branch structure. We have been working on that now for more than one year. And now, 80% of our branches have been rebuilt to advisory branches or service branches. So if you have an advisory need, you will make an appointment and go to an advisory branch. And if you have a simple service need, you will go to a service branch or you will service yourself on the net or the mobile, or you will call the call center.</p>
          <p>It's a very structured process. And I can tell you the customers love it. They love to meet an employee, which is well trained to do exactly what they need either advisory meeting or complicated piece of advice, taking the whole financial need into account or just a service need where the card doesn't work or getting some cash or whatever it is.</p>
          <p>This is creating a lot of efficiency and a lot of staff reductions is actually also coming out of this. And then of course, firm cost control. As you can see, the cost income ratio is down in retail and RaRoCaR is coming up nicely. And risk weighted assets are clearly under control even though we still lend to our customers and service them and the result is very strong.</p>
          <p>On wholesale banking, it's even more important, the thing about being relevant. Relevant means to be there at the right time for the customer and be in dialogue of finding these solutions which are efficient on capital and liquidity. So it's also very much about realigning the whole value chain so we can produce the products and services and get them out there exactly when the customer needs it. So much more tailor made, much more direct with much larger impact. And as I said, we have now more than 60% of all large Nordic corporates are posting Nordea as a lead bank.</p>
          <p>Of course, the new regulatory framework is particularly complicated for the large customers where we have a lot of derivatives and complicated products on hand, and therefore, here the strong dialogue with the customer is important. Well, slightly increasing cost income ratio based on variable salaries but the RaRoCaR is up and risk weighted assets is down. And this process will continue and I think it would be a journey in the coming years to become more and more efficient in this area.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management is slightly different there. It's very much about efficiency and ensuring we have the right offering. On private banking, we are working very clearly on the front office part to make sure that our customer &#x2013; that our FTEs can have more customers in a better way so it has a lot to do with, again, having the value chain straightened out and delivering the right services and being lean in the way we work with the customers.</p>
          <p>On Asset Management, we're reengineering a lot of funds right now. We have closed some funds and reengineered others to have the right and the best offering out and our performance looking good in that area. And on Life &amp; Pension, we still migrate customers to capital light products and, as you can see from this slide, that more than 75% of the gross written premium now is in capital light products compared to 59% only one year ago. So a very rapid development towards capital light products, which is, of course, needed in this area. Also strong results, flat cost income ratios, RWAs down and as I've said, assets under management at new record levels.</p>
          <p>So conclusion, strong income, solid cost control, revenues up, solid credit quality, we improved ROE. We keep building capital and we keep our RWAs under strong control. And we will continue implementing our New Normal plan. We are building the future banking business model. We are well underway. We know exactly how it will look based on the relationship banking but we have still much more to do because this is very much about changing behavior for more than 30,000 employees and for more than 11 million customers. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Then we have time for a few questions. We have...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. It's Magnus Andersson at ABG. I just have one question on your risk-weighted assets if you could give us an update on where you are in terms of the FSA approvals for the year, RWA <mark type="ph" /> optimization (0:20:38) measures you were expecting in the second half of this year in connection with Q1, if anything has changed there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Nothing has changed. We are strong, in close dialogue. We are approaching the finishing line and we are running ahead full steam. Whether it will be Q3, Q4, Q1, it is impossible to say. It's a lot of details. The overall framework, I'm sure, will be approved. So it's more the question of parameter setting and details and quantification numbers, numbers, numbers and how to do things so we get it right. So we are confident on that process and it will come home. But the question is when the final decision is taken by the FSA, so we have to pose that question to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you're still looking at really for potentially &#x20AC;13 billion to &#x20AC;17 billion in risk-weighted assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are looking combined with other areas of that magnitude. But I think afterwards, you can ask questions directly to Ari and Fredrik around this and get some more detail exactly what it looks, because also the CVA process comes in here. So it's pluses and minuses put around that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Andreas H&#xE5;kansson from Exane. A question on costs. Q1 costs were up year-on-year and Q2 costs up year-on-year and to &#x2013; compared to the previous quarter. Of course, FX has an impact on that but when we look at cost for the full year, the flat cost target, is that on the same FX or should we now expect cost to be above last year's level given the unfortunate move in FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's all the time been flat cost and local currencies because of course, we run the bank in Swedish kroner, Norwegian kroner, Danish kroner's and Euros and we keep flat costs. Then when we translate the stronger Swedish currency into euro, it looks like a bit higher. If Swedish kroner goes down, the cost will be lower, of course. So we cannot control the FX movements unless you know we're not hedging this because we are a blended company like that.</p>
          <p>So I think we have flat cost underlying in each country, in each operation but the FX will give some little volatility and then a little on variable salaries as well. But when we talk about flat costs for a prolonged period of time, of course it's not on the first decimal, it is, of course, plus/minus 1% or something because you cannot run the bank that way, we have to invest in something for many reasons in one quarter and another and another. But the underlying cost in local currencies is actually down as we demonstrated year-on-year by 0.4%, so we are keeping to the target and will continue to do that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Any other questions? <mark type="ph" /> Two (0:23:22) over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rickard Henze from ABG. I have two Norwegian questions, if we start off with the NII, the growth in the NII in retail Norway has been extremely good the last couple of quarters. This quarter it grew by 7% quarter-on-quarter and 40% year-on-year. Can you explain a bit what's going on in Norway regarding the net interest income?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There we are very active in implementing the New Normal plan. As you probably know, Norway came a few years ago from a lower profitability level than, for example, Sweden and Finland, and they are moving up now. So it's very much about the way we handle our customers and the way we price again the capital products. But I think you will get more details from Fredrik and Ari afterwards.</p>
          <p>I'm happy you didn't ask the other Norwegian question from yesterday which, I think, of course we are very sorry for what happened. It's human <mark type="ph" /> error. (0:24:23) It shouldn't have happened. We're very sorry for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second Norwegian question, not being the release of the report yesterday, it's regarding shipping. If you can give us any indication how &#x2013; for how long time you think the shipping losses will be at this magnitude of 150 to 200 basis points quarterly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will probably be there sort of medium term, I would say. I cannot put a number on it. I can say that we still have a very strong and firm grip of our shipping portfolio together with our customers and we are not worried about the development. Some companies come out a bit worse, some come out a bit better. Some scrap values are lower than expected, some a bit higher. But of course, the environment is difficult. But we are confident that the customers are actually reacting right on this. They've also been in the business for a long time. They have seen this before. This is not the first time; this happen every three to five years in shipping. And you can say that we are still profitable in Q2 in shipping, even with this reservation level.</p>
          <p>So shipping is cyclical. We are in the part where we make reservations, things will improve again one day and then we're out of it. But as long as we make profits during these downturn periods, we are quite happy. And there's no worrying signs like a trend that things are moving the wrong duration. So shipping is &#x2013; it is hard work and we need to stay very close to the customers to work our way through.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe, Handelsbanken. I have a question about Danish asset quality. The figure in &#x2013; the loan loss figure in the quarter is a bit lowered by a few impacts, I mean individual provisions are up, collective provision releases are offsetting that, and then you have the new FSA guidelines that are affecting negatively. I wonder if you can give us some sort of a flavor on what you see in terms of asset quality development in Denmark in the coming quarters and also on loan losses in the coming quarters in Denmark.</p>

          <p>Asset quality is stabilizing/improving and it'll &#x2013; but it's not going as fast as you could have expected in this part of the cycle where you would have expected. So I think the tail will be fatter and longer than probably many people would have expected. But you can say the underlying level of loan losses is in this quarter slightly down, and we do not expect it to increase. But then what happens is, as you well know, the Danish FSA have put in new requirements of how to handle this &#x2013; very tough requirements by the way -- on how to handle individual provisions. Those risks reflected in that, we have already seen a long time ago and made general provisions, so that is the same provision we are moving to an individual level now.</p>
          <p>So the quarter as such is not changing anything from the story which we told one or two quarters ago. But there is a tail in Denmark, the housing bubble, and the bubble in general was very big. We're taking out that bubble but the tail is somewhat fatter than &#x2013; probably than expected. But we don't see any risk of increasing loan losses in Denmark as we speak.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, very quick follow-up on Denmark. In a way, compared to previously, interest rates, of course, much, much lower in Denmark than I think we expected just a couple of quarters ago as well. So isn't it surprising to you that given this very low cost of servicing the debt that we actually are at this high level and are we not really just pushing the problem ahead of us when interest rates eventually go up and then we're going to get into the loan losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not &#x2013; really. That is, we have only very few customers. The number of customers being late on their mortgage payment in Denmark is down this quarter compared to last quarter. Now it's down to 614 or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>667.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>667, number of people being late out of hundreds of thousands of mortgage customers. So it's not a big issue like that. It's more the SME side, but again I would say that it is again -- customers have been identified. We are working with them. Some come out on the right side of the equation and recover. Others come out on the wrong side of the equation and default. And the question is exactly what reservations are needed.</p>
          <p>We still believe that everything is identified. So I don't think we are pushing anything. Of course, they are helped by the low interest rates but they are not helped by the low growth because a lot of these SMEs need some growth in their business in order to prosper much more than interest rate level. And the low growth in Europe is, of course, not easy for an SME that typically do not export to China or wherever but are more local in its business. So some growth in Europe will be helpful. And since that is not coming and that's probably also is the reason why the tail is dragging out a little is that it takes longer time for these companies to recover even though they are doing a lot of things, restructuring, taking down costs and stuff, then it takes a bit more time because their sales are not growing to any extent which will make them come out. But I don't think we're pushing anything ahead of us. It's just a long tail.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, SEB Enskilda. I was just wondering if you would be able to provide us with an update of something you said on your Capital Markets Day &#x2013; at the most Capital Markets Day you hosted. If I remember correctly, you hinted then in your material that you thought that group lending margins could potentially expand by 15 basis points. So that wasn't some kind of a vision, it was part of your growth target. And I was just wondering if you would be able to update us on that, if you still stick to that view or if you see any reason to revise that? Is &#x2013; could it be more, have you raised it already? Yeah, that's my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have reached quite a bit but it still goes on. But there are two sides of that equation because one is to raise margin. Another one is to lower capital. So finding the right capital solution for typically corporate is very, very important. And that seems to be possible in many more cases than we thought. So, of course, we get to the same equation if we lower the capital deployment and that is our <mark type="ph" /> RWA (0:30:55) projects which I've been talking about that have that target. But we have raised margins. It will probably continue for a while to ensure the right pricing based on the liquidity and capital deployed but you can get more numbers. I do not have them here off-hand how many of much of this we have actually issued.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then another unrelated question. I mean obviously you would like Denmark to become better in terms of macro, not least for the people who live there but perhaps a bit cynically, if for Nordea, is it necessarily good if Denmark becomes much better tomorrow? Isn't this kind of a struggling macroenvironment pretty much what you benefit from because you have such an advantage over your local competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean we would like things to improve in Denmark. Our customers are struggling and we're doing everything we can to help them through. So, of course, we like the economy to prosper or at least grow 2% which would be very fine right now. So, of course, we are looking for that. We're looking at for normalization with some economic growth, and with some positive interest rates. The present environment is unhealthy and not sustainable and that's the reason why we're all worried how the future is going to look. We have very low growth right now in Europe and in Denmark. We like to see more growth in order for things to normalize and we can start to work our way through all these issues.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. Two questions, first if you could elaborate a little bit about how you see the margin outlook especially in Sweden and Norway going forward. A couple of your peers have talked about maybe the Swedish margin outlook is less bullish than previously. How do you see it? And if there is still any meaningful re-pricing that we could see in Nordea's corporate and retail box? So that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I've said, we have re-priced quite a bit on the new capital requirements. I think there are more to be done especially on liquidity. I don't think we have full fair pricing yet in a number of areas but in some areas we do. But then again, for a large part of our book had some maturity on it and that is being rolled now in coming years. So there's still some re-pricing being done on old commitments which then are being renewed to a new higher level.</p>
          <p>But it's a very mixed picture, we have &#x2013; the re-pricing process is slow in some segments in some countries and higher in others. So I wouldn't say we have reached the end. And we have certainly not reached the end on implement in New Normal. It is clear wherever we look that general financial transaction is not fully priced, are based on all the liquidity, as I said previously, is mainly one of the issues which is not priced but all &#x2013; and also loan funding, but also capital.</p>
          <p>Now, the equation can very easily end out in less capital because a lot of the solutions we have for customers was invented in a period of time where we had to post much less capital. So that was probably the right equation then. Now, we have to post much more capital and then we have to find a new solution. And we actually find those solutions.</p>
          <p>I myself participate in a number of meetings. It's quite amazing how proactive the customers actually are in understanding this and then taking actions here, okay. But then, we can do it another way, post different collateral, do it in different centers or whatever it is and structure the cash flows in another way. So I would say that was a long answer. But anyway, we have not come through the pricing fully and certainly not the full effects of changing behavior.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. The second question there, could you give a ballpark figure where Nordea is on the net stable funding ratio? If you haven't done so, I haven't been able to find it. Under the current, of course, definition, we don't know if it's going to hold or not, but still.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are continuously improving our ratio there. We don't know exactly what the target is. It's a moving target and we know it's being reviewed and revised. And it was now stated very clearly before summer that it will be for 2018 on a European level not before that. So it's something we monitor closely but we are of course &#x2013; in everything we do in redesigning our business model, we are taking into account in the way we construct products and solutions. So we're gradually improving the ratio and we haven't publicized it because we think it has really no meaning as long as the parameters have not been set <mark type="ph" /> and are ready.

        <plist>
          <p>Then I think we have time for one more concluding question on this part of the Q&amp;A session, if anybody would like to take that opportunity. Back to where we started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> Okay (0:35:52) . Thank you. One concluding question and just on your cost. You seem to be well underway with your cost-cutting measures. You announced on the Capital Markets Day. And in terms of profitability, you look very good from a European perspective while you do not stand out from a Nordic perspective. So I was just wondering, should we look at &#x2013; still look at your profitability target as primarily absolute or would you consider taking further measures if in a couple of years from now, you would still rank number three of the Swedish &#x2013; four Swedish Nordic banks? Or doesn't it matter where your Swedish competitors are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does matter, but it matters more where our European competitors are because this is a global competition. And you all know that the way our capital and funding is priced is a European metric, it's not a Swedish or Nordic for that matter. So it matters more whether we, among global investors, are perceived strong having enough capital, high enough ROE and a business model that is sustainable and which is probably the most important thing.</p>
          <p>And I think we are straight on track towards all these targets. We think we have the right business model. It is a sustainable business model. That's probably the most important thing. We are building capital which is an important issue and proving that we continue that development so we can decide ourselves what capital levels we need depending on wherever CRD IV actually ends out.</p>
          <p>And finally on ROE, we said top-league ROE among European banks. It's probably 15% in normalized conditions. We do not have normalized conditions right now, so 12.5% is actually very well aligned with that target, remembering that interest rates today are very close to zero. So we actually do deliver at least a double digit risk premia in the return which we find satisfying. But we think we can improve it further. And then when we do risk adjusted ROE comparisons, we come out very well also in the Nordic comparison but you can do that calculation yourself. Thank you.</p>

          <p>While we're waiting, just Andreas, on your question on currencies. To give you the full thread, obviously currencies are affecting our cost. But it's also affecting our revenues. So from a bottom line, we are more or less unaffected by movements in the different currencies. But obviously the target is set in fixed currencies. But if you will see a further weakening of the euro, you will also see a benefit on the revenue, so it's neutral from that perspective.</p>

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodney. Thank you, Rodney. I will just give a few comments on the change in net interest income and I'll actually comment also on the implementation of Basel III a little later. Before I do that, just one question that I would like to add some more flavor to, the question was raised here about are you happy being number three in terms of the profitability or having two Swedish banks performing better? I think the answer provided was very accurate. But you can also say that it is very much a matter of where you are in the mix.</p>
          <p>So if you actually look at Nordea's performance by country, you will identify that we are definitely in the top league here also in the Swedish market, Danish, Norwegian and Finnish, et cetera. So you have to actually look at the country mix. And of course, country prerequisites or characteristics will vary over time. So for the time being, of course, loan losses for instance are higher in Denmark. That may not be the situation a few years away. So I just wanted to make that additional comment.</p>
          <p>Looking at in the net interest income, a story quite similar to what it was also in Q1. We continue to generate additional net interest income by actual growth. And you've seen the growth numbers, they are not excessive but moderate growth, but we do see growth on the corporate side in particular, and we can see that among the large corporates in almost all countries and particularly so in Denmark and Norway and that has, in the quarter, contributed with some &#x20AC;11 million.</p>
          <p>Then the margins are continuing to increase on most markets. As previously, Norway is the market where margins on the corporate side increased the most, followed by Sweden and Denmark and Finland, as usual, quite a little bit behind due to more slow market behavior. And as expected, because of low interest rates or lowering interest rates during the quarter, we have lost &#x20AC;27 million, so the net impact therefore is approximately, as you can see, is actually positive.</p>
          <p>Spread costs are up, but this is not a reflection of high funding cost. It is actually, if you just look at the spread volume, it's pretty much a constant leveling comparison to what it was in Q1. This is much more a reflection of volume. So this is &#x2013; it gives you some additional flavor on the net interest income. Before I go to the Basel III implication, we will do some comments on loan losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, asset quality, you already asked some questions from Christian and then you touched the most relevant points. But I guess that you recognize that this pattern, this has been more or less the profile of our credit risk and asset quality now for two quarters, and this is very much in line with our own expectation, so that the underlying credit risk situation in Q2 was more or less unchanged compared to Q1. Meaning that the &#x2013; if you talk about the Nordic countries, you'll see that still, Denmark is sticking out. I would not say that this is a relevant decrease.</p>
          <p>We were a little bit down from Q4, Q1 levels in Q2 but &#x2013; because the changes are very small ones. And then again in other Nordic countries, it's kind of volatile between quarters. The underlying risks, they are low; but then again in each quarter, there is one or two individual, mostly corporate customer impairments, which are then seen in these figures.</p>
          <p>Outside Nordic countries, if we talk about the Baltic situation, it's very stable and solid. It has improved. In Russia, we don't have any issues. In Poland, actually, the asset quality is very good. Now it was the first quarter, we had one, it's kind of medium-sized corporate customer loss in Poland but otherwise the Polish asset quality is very stable and a good one, so no changes in this kind of overall picture.</p>
          <p>Denmark has been in special focus. This is what we have been showing in the previous quarter so that how this high loss is split between corporate and household in Denmark. As you can see, it's still quite evenly split. So the household has been sticking up from Q2 levels now &#x2013; Q2 2011 levels from the previous quarters but it has been stabilizing. And the corporate segment is still the source of these losses are coming from SMEs. There is no single, individual larger corporate customer who is seen in this kind of loan loss situation in Denmark.</p>
          <p>Shipping market is continuing to be weak. And as &#x2013; also Christian said that perhaps this is one market where our outlook has become a little bit more negative compared, for example, how we see that the shipping market half year ago. We expected that this should recover a little bit faster. Now it seems that it will take perhaps longer time before we see this kind of market recovery. So that it means that we are at least expecting this kind of elevated level of loan losses over the coming quarters, and it's still coming from this tanker and then dry cargo market. Also from containers but our exposure to containers is very small.</p>
          <p>And still &#x2013; then if we move to impaired loans, you see that in shipping in this quarter there was increase in impaired loans. This is also the pattern we have seen in the previous quarters. There is always one or two or three new impaired shipping customers per quarter, just reflecting this weaker market situation. But the loan loss level has been now stabilizing with this elevated level, at least it has not gone up so much.</p>
          <p>But then coming to impaired loans, and here I also touch this Danish specific situation which was also asked a little bit more in terms of figures, on what was the impact in our figures. So, yes, we can see, all we can see that the impaired loans, they were up in this quarter &#x20AC;700 million in total. Out of this &#x20AC;700 million increase, &#x20AC;120 million came from shipping, we saw that in the previous slide, roughly &#x20AC;450 million came from Denmark. So the majority of this increase came from Denmark and the rest is evenly split with various businesses.</p>
          <p>Out of this Danish increase, this impaired loan increase, &#x20AC;450 million, roughly two-thirds is the result of this new Danish rules, new rules introduced by Danish FSA, how to identify impaired customers. So that had an impact to our individual impairment. And that also had an impact to our loan losses so that then we increase provisions for individually assessed loan losses quite much this quarter. And the impact coming from this Danish regulation, new Danish regulation for our new loan loss, these individual loan losses was roughly &#x20AC;80 million.</p>
          <p>So that was because of the change of rules, it didn't &#x2013; because our underlying risk situation didn't change, the actual defaulted customers, they were more or less stable or a little bit even down as you heard from Christian. Then actually what we did was that because we had this kind of additional buffers in our collective provisions in Denmark, which we have built in the previous quarters because we saw that there was an increase, the risk situation in Denmark, then we offset this &#x20AC;80 million loan loss increase because of this new regulation by releasing part of this collective provision.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; in that way we neutralize this impact on new policies and regulations. So then it meant that, of course, in our collected provisions, they were a little bit down or roughly &#x20AC;110 million down, &#x20AC;80 million of that came from this Danish situation but our individual provisions are up.</p>
          <p>So now you can &#x2013; what does it mean in terms of risks in Denmark, what was now done? In a way, earlier, as I said that because our underlying risk situation in Denmark is stable, it does not increase. We had earlier booked this kind of collective provisions, additionally even collective provisions on top of our discount collective provision models in Denmark because we saw that there will be, it's a likelihood &#x2013; likelihood is high that there will be more and more individual customers in problems and perhaps collateral values are down.</p>
          <p>Now when we were forced to identify those individual customers and also use specific values for our collaterals, then actually we thought that it's prudent and think that it's prudent now to move this collective provision cushion to these individual customers.</p>
          <p>It doesn't, of course, you should not read it in this way that this will mean that we will not have elevated level of loan losses in Denmark in the coming quarters. Still we think that, yes, there will be new customers in Denmark going into default, some SMEs, some household customers. As far as this macro situation is the way it is in Denmark and the housing market is weak. But, of course, also this decreases the likelihood that we will see this kind of increased level of loan losses in Denmark at least increased level of individually assessed loan losses because now we have forced to, let's say, impair lots of these type of household customers, which in reality, in our terms, would not have been impaired.</p>
          <p>To give you an example of this new rule is that if they are most related to that type of lending which is based on asset values, i.e. real estate, household, agriculture, so that if there is a customer who has negative net value so that loan is higher than the value of the asset. Then even if the customer is fully servicing their debt, even if the customer has a good cash flow, you have to impair that loan. You can't calculate for the cash flow and then provision for this difference between loan and asset value. That's a little bit summarizing the new rules.</p>
          <p>So this is more or less the overall pattern and on this, here you see then this increase of impaired loans in the Nordic countries. As I said, majority of it comes from Denmark and none of them <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:51:35) whereas in other countries, it has been stable and most of this increase in Denmark is because of these new rules. That ends my comments related to credit risks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Just a few comments as I said initially, I'll give you some flavor on or as to the impact of Basel III and also relating to model implications, et cetera. And you can see from this slide a very similar picture as we have previously portrayed. So it's really not a big change to the message we provided already in October of last year. So the expected impact on Core Tier 1 ratio from Basel III and this is predominantly CVA risk in the markets business is approximately 1%.</p>
          <p>Then IAS 19 is &#x2013; most of the changes related to IAS 19 is, of course, the pension fund and how that gets deducted from CT-1. That has a further impact of 0.2%. And then rollouts and risk weighted assets efficiency as we have previously communicated and of course here, the advanced IRB, as we have talked about many times, is a very crucial part. It represents approximately 1.1%. So as you can see, the CT-1 all in all when approvals are there and efficiency gains reached and Basel III implemented, we expect roughly the same level as or very little impact. So it is consistent with the previous story.</p>
          <p>Once again, it is not actually very easy to calculate this because the regulation on, for instance, CVA is still not finalized and there are presently two different texts out there in the market. One is eliminating on financial exposures and then, of course, this number 1% would be significantly lower. So this is the &#x2013; as we understand, regulation as it now stands, but it may be a different one and maybe a little less impact, so we don't know that yet.</p>
          <p>Then, of course, we are still unfamiliar as to the final result of the advanced IRB approval. We have come further in that discussion as the CEO alluded to before, we've had multiple meetings and letters, assessment letters from the FSA, so we can at least feel a little bit more comfortable now as to the level of approximate capital relief and that is what is behind these numbers. But of course, I just would like to pinpoint the fact that all of these numbers are still uncertain, of course.</p>
          <p>Yes, that were my comments.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Andreas from Exane. Two questions, first one back on Denmark, given that you now have to provide in line with the LTV movements, could you tell us what's the average LTV at the moment on household side? And does it mean that every time you have house prices going down, there's going to be an increased provisioning need because more houses are moving above 100? It's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second one is on the interest rate impact, we saw 25 bps cut by ECB and I think we're now at 15 in Denmark over the couple of months. What should be the impact in the next couple of quarters from these changes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take the Danish question. Our average LTV in Denmark in the household side or mortgage side is roughly 75%. So that, of course, is still the average values are very good ones. So that the &#x2013; this is then when we are talking about this over leveraged customers.</p>
          <p>But you're right in a way so that, of course, still now that the way we have now valued or are forced to value that the value of collateral, it's very prudent so that it has some kind of a cushion towards a drop in &#x2013; further drop in the values. But in essence, if there is a drop in the asset values in Denmark, then, yes, it means that then we have to increase corresponding late to the provision. But that's the case in every area also in other books. So that if you have impaired customer and then that their collateral values down, then of course we are increasing the loan loss provisions, so that in a way, that's &#x2013; it's anything -- or nothing strange, meaning that type of practice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it means that if someone is at 98% today, they're not classified as impaired but they move above 100% and becomes impaired, so it should be a larger volume in Denmark, I guess. But when you say 75%, that's in your mortgage book, I assume that in the peak years, you did housing related lending outside the mortgage book to get around 80% limit. So what's the average LTV in the group for households?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; if you take &#x2013; still the average is more or less this 75%. And then, of course, you are right that being in these peak years, of course we have also granted loans so that there is this kind of tail with this, let's say, very high LTVs. And now that tail is impaired more or less with these new rules. And we have now made these provisions so that that's the way we have now enforced to cover that part even if the customers are servicing those debts.</p>
          <p>It's not &#x2013; just to be precise that in the household side, this new impairment rules, they are not so strict as if you are, let's say, below your value then you have to make a loan loss provision. It takes also account partly this kind of customer, let's say, disposable income but that disposable income is calculated in a very cautious way. And it assumes that with that disposable income, you have to be able to pay back your debt with certain repayment schedule with higher interest rate. So that in the household side, there is still some value with the cash flow so on the household customers, I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The interest rate, so we've had some interest rate cuts as you alluded to. They were actually early in the third quarter, early in July. And they will impact of course in deposit income going forward. So the interest &#x2013; you can question how far the interest rates can actually go down but we have for deposits now negative actually in Denmark. So we are looking at a lower environment and we will be negatively impacted in the third quarter, of course.</p>
          <p>The interest rate sensitivity is very similar to what it has been previously, a little bit over &#x20AC;500 million per basis or per 100 basis points. So the impact is likely to be in line with that interest rate sensitivity. So there would be an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But most of the &#x20AC;500 million <mark type="ph" /> is ECB in (0:58:52) Danish rate so rather than...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, above 60% is related &#x2013; 64%, 63% is related to Denmark and Finland, <mark type="ph" /> ECB or (0:59:01) Danish. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to give you the &#x2013; I mean the &#x20AC;550 million we're talking about, on that we estimate that &#x20AC;300 million are coming from deposits. So that's the 65% of the &#x20AC;300 million and the &#x20AC;250 million is due to lower return on our capital and equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And liquidity buffers...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...of course included there, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's of course very positive that you can improve your capitalization and you're guiding for RWA improvement. But you must look with envy on your Swedish peers that managed to move this Core Tier 1 ratios in a dramatic fashion. I mean, if you move back a few years, you were &#x2013; had similar kind of ratios as your peers and the difference is just widening. I mean, can you &#x2013; how can we understand this? What's going on? What's the difference and why don't you have a similar kind of development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but I think we &#x2013; I mean, again, I think there are two explanations to why that is the case. And first of all, if you actually compare the mix and how that is actually working, this explains quite a lot of it. So if you take the risk-weighted assets by total lending for instance and you compare, you can see that the average risk rates are clearly lower for at least some of our competition. And this is a mix issue. So, of course, the more you actually grow in areas with very low risk weights, so typically mortgages in Sweden is a very good example.</p>
          <p>So this is one of the reasons. The others is that we have continuously, which is very, very important, we've continuously supported the customers with continued growth. So if you look at the development on actual lending or balance sheet development, we have continued to follow a slightly different path.</p>
          <p>So I think the &#x2013; if you make the analysis on a more granular level, you will see that it's actually not a strange thing. In recent &#x2013; last year, if you put it that way, since we really communicated the New Normal plan, risk-weighted assets have been developing in a flat way for us. So it's been a flattish development, but we have also continued to have lending growth. And of course, this is partly a risk-weighted assets efficiency, this is partly customer selection and partly, of course, also risk-weight issues.</p>
          <p>So there are multiple explanations, but in terms of general efficiency, I think we are definitely at par. We have much more to do but I think we are at par. And I think it is about, lot about mix and how it's composed. And, of course, risk-weights, especially for the Swedish banks, with the risk-weights for mortgages are very, very low, this has a significant impact, that's not the case for us as a total. It's a much smaller proportion of our business than it is for the Swedish peers.</p>

          <p>Rickard, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rickard, ABG again. Can we come back to the Norwegian NII? Because your patterns there and your growth are deviating a lot from the local banks and the NII growth in those with contracting NII kind of two quarters in a row. It's a function of you kind of expanding your margins differently or do you just use a different transfer price so that you kind of do not allocate all the increase in terms of funding costs in Norway or can you explain a bit regarding this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I &#x2013; let me give you a couple of answers. First on the transfer pricing, what you see for the Norwegian business now here is without full liquidity premia. If you look at the business area, it includes a full liquidity premia but if you look at the numbers also with full funding costs, the Norwegian margins have continued to improve for us in both the recent couple of quarters. So it is a margin improvement and it has to do with a couple of different things.</p>
          <p>First of all I think we have been sub-optimal in how we have run the business. We've had an improvement potential, the profitability in Norway has not been sufficient and we have worked quite extensively with things that you know so well -- risk-weighted assets, efficiency, but of course also customer selection, ensuring that we have a good profitability, and margin is a very, very core part of that. So I think it's very much a matter of what we have done and how we have focused on the Norwegian market. So the transfer pricing is not the response to it. It's much more deliberate choice to improve the profitability through customer selection and efficiency issues on the Norwegian market.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Masih Yazdi, Credit Suisse. On the CRD IV effect, you're still guiding for 100 basis points on that. But if I look at your balance sheet, your derivatives exposure has increased quite a lot in the last year or so, both in gross numbers and net. How do you explain the effect there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How do I explain that it's 100 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Still, and even though there is <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:19).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is &#x2013; you can say it is actually higher. It is actually underlying higher. The net impact is roughly the same but you have to remember that we've also passed now Basel 2.5 and included of course also market risk. So if you look at the actual CVA risk component within the impact here, it has actually increased. And that is partly a reflection of, of course, lower interest rates because that <mark type="ph" /> gross (1:04:49) up the exposures on both side of the balance sheet and of course it's also bringing higher CVA risk. So it is slightly higher <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:04:55)</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is the actual CVA risk or effects now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But it's &#x2013; it's most of this &#x2013; it's the majority of this is, of course, the 1% that you saw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please, <mark type="ph" /> Jan (1:05:18)</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:05:21), I have one question. A lot of the result, the improvements of the result from the first and second quarter are coming from group functions, could you please comment this &#x20AC;117 million in group functions, both in net interest income and net gains or losses, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can do that. And it's &#x2013; this has to do with eliminations and transactions between markets and treasuries, so internal transactions, and we eliminate those typically, so between &#x2013; this is a just a change between quarters and transactions. It relates to typically structured bonds and how we value those internally so when we issue the structured bond in the markets, we value them at fair market value but that's also funding so when we take it to treasury, that will create &#x2013; we will record it at amortized costs, so this becomes very technical explanation but that creates fluctuations in between the quarters. So this time it's positive, in Q1, it was negative. So it has to do mainly with the structured bonds and transactions between markets and treasury.</p>

          <p>Hampus?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, SEB Enskilda. I was just wondering about this that Christian talked about earlier about the liquidity premia, you said that you have granular liquidity premia on business area level so far and that you've run a few pilots on product area level? And I was just wondering if you could share any of your sort of thoughts or experiences when you do that on product level? Have you seen any changes in behavior in terms of pricing et cetera from the product managers in those pilots?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the short answer is probably yes. I think it doesn't necessarily take the whole discussion and implementation processes as such brings a lot of attention and understanding to us how funding costs impact the business. So it has just &#x2013; the whole process has a very significant impact.</p>
          <p>It also triggers a lot of actually very good discussions on how you actually conduct business. So for instance, if you do a frame agreement with the corporate customers, that's a very typical way of doing business. You, with a corporate customer, you do a frame agreement and underneath that frame agreement you are able to sort of draw on working capital or it may be a longer, loan or something like that and the cost is very similar. Of course, these kind of agreements are maybe not that efficient always for the corporate customer or for the bank.</p>
          <p>So by actually putting granular cost, for example, for these kind of agreements, then you find different and other ways in doing business, which is much more productive for both the customers and of course also for the banks. So we haven't implemented it fully yet. We are in the process and I think the pilots are bringing some really good insights both into the actual pricing and margins and profitability but also to some extent, maybe I'm exaggerating there, but I think to some extent also how we do business and what kind of business and what kind of products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you think it's achievable to take it down to basically the granular level on all products or is it administratively too burdensome to do it all the way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have room for one more question. Jan, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:09:09) So if we look at the Europe sort of funding strategy going forward, of course, you can't comment on exactly what you're going to do. But so far, you refinanced all of 2012 maturities and do you foresee a need to continue to issue a lot of senior debt this year? And if yes, why? Would it be a regulatory reason or a rebound in corporate growth or for what reason would you see that you need to issue a lot of senior here in the manner of this year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and you're right. Of course, we don't really comment on the funding plans but we are likely to continue to do some. We've done a lot of senior unsecured, typically that's the first half year thing. It was actually the same last year and the year before that. So we're likely to continue. And, of course, part of it comes from just growth. We are still growing the bank although it's not with huge numbers. We are still growing the bank.</p>
          <p>So part of this growth has to do with the fact that just lending has increased. Then we were asked the question before about just NSFR and are we compliant there. And we're still below 100%. We're still below 100% and we probably will be that for some time as we go forward. The important thing is that we're going in the right direction and we'll still see what kind of rules eventually if NSFR or something else will be there.</p>
          <p>But I think just keeping a very prudent stance on long-term funding is a very good thing to do. I think it has served us well in many different ways to increase, have long maturities and be very active on the market. So I don't expect really a change of funding strategy from the past. I don't think we should change the composition of covered bond versus senior unsecured that much. We probably &#x2013; we have lots of room on covered bonds but I don't really think we should in any &#x2013; at least any dramatic way change that composition. So I'm quite pleased it has served us well now for a couple years to operate in this way. I think we should continue.</p>
