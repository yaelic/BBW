        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hennes &amp; Mauritz Full Year Report Presentation. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to hand over to your host for today, Mr. Leif Persson, the CFO, and Mr. Nils Vinge, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. This is Nils Vinge speaking and with me is also Leif Persson. Thank you for calling in and welcome to this telephone conference. You'll find the slides we'll use during the presentation on our website h&amp;m.com. We are happy to answer your questions after the presentation. Please turn to the slide, "Fourth Quarter 2007."</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, sales excluding VAT amounted to 22.8 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the same quarter last year. In local currencies, the increase was 18%, while the increase in comparables stores was 5%.</p>
          <p>Profitability remained high, with a gross margin of 62.1% compared to the 61.8% in the same period last year. The operating profit was nearly 6 billion, corresponding to an operating margin of 26.3%. Profit after financial items increased by 14% to 6.2 billion, and the net profit was 4.7 billion. In the quarter, we opened 94 stores and closed 4.</p>
          <p>The autumn collections were very well received, and sales in the quarter were strong. The gross margin was the highest ever, in spite of a continued increase in quality, a greater number of strategic price offerings, and a marginally higher level of markdowns, and a nonrecurring charge of 95 million due to a changed valuation method of the stock-in-trade.</p>
          <p>The lower US dollar and more efficient buying impacted the margin positively. Together, they more than compensated for the other effects. The operating margin was slightly lower than last year. This should be seen in the light of the unusually high activity level within the Group. We have refurbished a record high number of stores to make it even more attractive and to further strengthen H&amp;M's competitiveness.</p>
          <p>We have developed new customer offerings and entered new markets, and we have further strengthened the organization and developed the supply chain. All these measures form an even more solid base for future growth and make us well positioned for the coming years.</p>
          <p>The full year 2007 was yet another record year for H&amp;M. Sales excluding VAT were 78.3 billion, or 15% above last year's level. In local currencies, increase was 70% and comparable stores sales rose 5%. Gross profit was 47.8 billion, and the gross margin increased 1.6 percentage points to 61.1%. Operating profit after deduction of selling and administrative expenses was 18.4 billion. This corresponds to an operating margin of 23.5%, an increase of 1.1 percentage points.</p>
          <p>An intense activity level, and new regions, new markets and new customer offerings have resulted in a slight increase of selling and administrative expenses to 37.6% of sales, which is 0.5 percentage points higher than last year. However, in the historic perspective, we can see that level has been quite stable for times.</p>
          <p>Profit after financial items increased by 21% to 19.2 billion, and the net profit increased by 26% to 13.6 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK16.42. The estimated effective tax rate for the year 2007 was 29.1%, down from 31.7. For the group, the estimated effective tax rate is expected to decline further to 27.5% in 2008, as the change in transfer pricing will get full effect and falling lower corporate taxes in some of our sales countries such as Germany, UK and Spain.</p>
          <p>The net addition of stores during the year was 177, resulting in 1,522 stores in 28 countries. For H&amp;M, appreciated collections are the single-most important success factor. We strive to become increasingly attractive for our customers. New offerings, which give the customers value for money, are constantly developed, and stores are renewed to create an inspiring environment -- factors which also have contributed to this success.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the supply chain has been developed and streamlined to support rapid and efficient future growth. A large logistic center in Poznan, Poland, which serves a number of countries in Eastern Europe as well as online and catalog sales outside the Nordic countries, was open. And in Hamburg, a similar plant is under construction to serve the stores in Germany, The Netherlands and Austria.</p>
          <p>The biggest step, by far, in 2007 was the successful entry into Shanghai and Hong Kong. The response has been fantastic. The launch in these countries proves that our business concept is truly global. The launch of online sales in Germany and Austria follows the successful development of online and catalog sales in The Netherlands, which by far has exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales per market. All our markets have developed nicely. Especially satisfying is the strong sales development in Germany. The level of activity has been intense with a large number of initiatives, involving not only the opening of the new stores but also renewals and refurbishments. The net addition of stores was 16 in Germany, 6 of which were COS stores. Online sales in Germany and Austria, which started in August, also got off to a good start.</p>
          <p>Following 60 years' presence in the Nordic region, it is very satisfying that H&amp;M continues to grow and gain market share. In 2007, there was a net addition of 12 stores, while at the same time sales in comparable stores showed a nice increase.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M had a very good year in the Netherlands, the Group's fifth largest market. Sales were boosted by the successful launch of online shopping, which began in August 2006. In the spring of 2007, the first catalog was sent out. Sales in comparable stores also developed positively.</p>
          <p>Business has developed well in Southern Europe, where H&amp;M has had a presence for less than 10 years and where we now have a firm foothold and a good base for further growth. In Spain, with 79 stores, the sales increase was strong. And in Italy, we opened 30 new stores, of which 3 in Rome. Sales have developed very well also in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M is continuing its substantial expansion in both the US and Canada. In the US, this included strengthening the company's presence on the West Coast by opening a number of stores in LA and also stores on the Canadian West Coast.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's Fashion is also appreciated in the Middle East, and the stores have sold well. In March, the first H&amp;M store in Qatar was opened. In total, there are 10 franchise stores in Dubai, Kuwait and Qatar. The response in Shanghai and Hong Kong has been fantastic, and sales have, by far, exceeded expectations. We have sold for almost 0.5 billion in roughly six months.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at some key figures. The stock-in-trade was almost 8 billion, an increase of 10%. Of the increase, roughly 2 percentage points or due to foreign exchange effects. Consequently, the stock in comparable stores decreased around 2 to 3% compared to last year. The current stock-in-trade is very well composed with a high proportion of new arrivals. In relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10.2%, down from 10.6% last year.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations increased to almost 15.4 billion. Investments increased to 3.6 billion, following a record high number of new stores and refurbishments and upgrades. We also have invested in the new distribution center in Poland and in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>Liquid funds or short-term investments increased to almost 21 billion from 18.6 billion a year ago. The Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of SEK14, an increase of 22%. The return on equity increased to 45.4%.</p>
          <p>We are happy to announce that H&amp;M is now to take a step into Russia. As you all know, Russia is a huge market with strong purchasing power. Expansion in Russia will start in Moscow and its surroundings. Our first stores are planned to open in Moscow in 2009.</p>
          <p>Just like last year, 2008 will be a year characterized by very high activity. We will expand our corporation with Alshaya, starting franchise sales in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Oman. This autumn, we will open our first two stores in Japan, where we now have signed an additional contract for a store that is to open in 2009.</p>
          <p>In total, we expect a net addition of 190 new stores in 2008. Expansion will mainly be focused on the US, Spain, the UK, France, Germany, and Italy. It is satisfying to see that markets where H&amp;M has been present for a long period of time, like Germany and UK, still grows the way they do and are among the countries where we open most stores.</p>
          <p>We also believe that we can increase sales in our existing stores. This year, the proportion of refurbishments will be roughly on the same level as in 2007. Investments and expanses per unit are expected to be on the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>In January, we started catalogue sales in Germany and Austria. And the reception so far is very promising. The launch of H&amp;M Home, a home textiles range, is estimated to take place around the turn of the year. We continued to increase our use of organic cotton. During the spring of 2008, we expected more organic cotton than we did all in all into -- of 2007.</p>
          <p>The launch of an extended shoe range has also been very good, a good way to strengthen H&amp;M's offering to customers, and step by step, we introduced the shoe range in more stores. A basic range of women's shoes are now available in all H&amp;M stores that sell women's clothes.</p>
          <p>The expansion of COS continues. We plan to open three more stores this year. Customers' reception of COS has been very promising. And after slightly more than one season, we are starting to build up experience and history enough to make an even better offering to our customers.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M's aim is to increase sales with maintained profitability. In 2008, we plan to increase the store count by 190. And as always, we strive to continue developing our customer offerings with new collections, new concepts, and new products. We are really looking forward to the rest of this year. We can see that January sales have been very satisfying so far along with December sales. They add up to a good start of another exciting H&amp;M year.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And we're now happy to take you questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" />. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is <mark type="inaudible" /> at Lincoln Mail in London.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. So first question is, in a normal year is it correct that December is a bigger sales month than January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You normally sell more in December than you do in January. That is correct, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that in mind, it's fair to conclude that January sales growth was even better than the fantastic 22% just implied by equal month -- equal weighting between the two months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, sorry. The selling in December was 10%, and the selling in January from the 1st of January to the 29th is 16%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's not for the whole period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not a whole period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's just January. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And given that the inventory levels was very low at the end of November, is -- can we therefore also conclude that the January sales is not strongly driven by markdown sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so, really shouldn't be talking very much about January. We really shouldn't do that because that will come later. But as you're saying, we are very pleased with the stock in trade going out of November. And you have to draw your own conclusions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I will. And on -- just my -- final question for me, on the cost side, the costs have increased and -- about this percentage of sales. And also if you look at the normal uplift in costs from Q3 to Q4, is these additional costs in Q4 this year, are they mainly related to investments so to speak in sales activity going forward? Or is this a new level we should be expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at Q4 alone and you look at some years back, you will find that the level in -- as a percentage of sales is not dramatically higher. Rather, last year's Q4 was quite low. But in addition to that, we should also say that we -- there has been a lot of activities going into the fourth quarter, rebuildings, new stores, new formats, etcetera, which of course we have to prepare for. We don't really see any dramatic effect on the cost level compared to the years before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Claire Kent. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello Leif and hello Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question I had is, could you give us any indication, the new stores you've opened in the US and the UK, how does the size of the new stores you've opened compare to the size of the existing stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's no dramatic change in the store sizes compared to last year so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question I wanted to ask is how do you expect CapEx per store to develop going forward? What is your CapEx guidance anyway for the full year, and how do you expect CapEx per store to vary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't -- so the CapEx per store will be more or less the same as 2007. Maybe with inflation, you have to count it up. But of course, there will be more store openings and there will also be more rebuildings in 2008 compared to 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what sort of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Per unit -- the cost per unit or investment per unit will be more or less the same, a couple of percent up maybe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the total CapEx guidance is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That would then imply something like maybe a bit above 4 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. In terms of the -- going back to the last question, in terms of the OpEx trend, I mean, one of the reasons for the sort of relatively high CapEx in 4Q was the high level of activity, and obviously in '08, you also sort of have a rather high level of activity as well. So I mean, is it possible that we will see OpEx go up as a percentage of sales because of this high level of activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As -- when we look historically, we are not out of line with what has been normal. Of course, the very high activity can lead to slightly higher. But that is not our aim. Our aim is to keep a level which we have now in 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Everything, of course, depends on the reception of the collections. We can never know beforehand how they will be received.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. In terms of the different countries in which you operate in, obviously, you've published a good January number with the 16%. But on a relative basis, which of the markets are you seeing sort of less good trade in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In January, I assume, we really and should be -- shouldn't be talking very much about January, as I said before. This is more just really to give you a feeling about what has happened for us in January. But if I understand your question right, then UK is a slow market, if that was your real question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when -- I mean, as you give all the information on the different countries and the sales in the different countries and the local currency growth, etcetera, etcetera. If you look at your sales per store on a local currency basis in the US and in the UK, there's quite a big slowdown in the fourth quarter. And I just wanted to confirm that that is the actual trend you're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the fourth quarter as of the selling in comparable units in the UK, for instance, has been quite okay. There's been no big increases, but there has been some increase and the same also goes for the US.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So your like-for-like in the UK and the US in 4Q was positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are positive. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the last question is just, obviously, I know you can't talk about the tax rate in the distant future. But just for modeling purposes, which should we assume that the 27.5% is sustainable going forward or would you expect the tax rate to change in the longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. With the current tax rate in all countries, 27.5% should be sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome, bye.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Luca Cipiccia. Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Luca Cipiccia from Goldman Sachs. Just a couple of follow-up questions -- So if actually, if you could maybe articulate on the like-for-like performance in December that you've given, if you could specify there any major discrepancies by region or by country? And secondly, just on the new market that you mentioned you're entering, in particular when it comes to Japan and Russia, even there if you could quantify more specifically the number of stores that you aim to have in the next few years there if you have any indication of that kind that you could give us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>If you start with the last question about Japan and Russia. It's just as when we entered China or any new market. We start with a couple of stores. And we learn from there. That is the strategy we'll apply in Russia and Japan as well. And your first question regarding like-for-like in December and January, we prefer not to be so precise, of course. But I understand there is a concern for some markets. And I can say that Germany has been good, and even the US was good. The UK was tough, just like the whole market and there was a lot of sales in the market in December.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good. We are satisfied. And if you look at the total figure of December, of course, it wasn't as strong. But also the comparable last year was high figures to beat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And maybe one follow-up question just on the profitability -- you spent a big of time on the SG&amp;A front. Just if you could give us your outlook or your view on the gross margin in terms of as things stand today with the type of visibility you have. What type of development is it realistic to, to expect in 2008 if you can give us any indication they're the same -- the same way you've talked about SG&amp;A and operating margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gross margin is a bit more tricky for us to answer. We have said on a number of occasions that the gross margin in itself is not a goal to have at a certain level. It's more the effect of with how we cope with our situation in the different countries. How we react with prices compared to the competition, etcetera. But the one thing, which in the short-term is positive, is of course, that's the dollar has from our perspective gone the right way. But how we will act with the prices, it's very hard for us to say at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. But so far, as it's the beginning of the year, I guess it's very short time. But you haven't seen any major change in trend or any major change in pressure from that perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've given you the 10% for December, and we've given you the 16% for January so far. I don't think we really should say very much more than that. You have to wait until March to get the new gross margin. I'm sorry about that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Yeah. The company name is Redburn Partners. Can I ask about the supply chain as well? What are you seeing in terms of inflation in dollar prices coming out of Asia at the moment before the benefit of the currency swing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is, of course, a pressure. And the suppliers in China are trying to increase cost, and especially now since the kronas are taken away, as you know. But I think we are in a very good position with our big volumes and buying power and the knowledge we have of the markets. And we can also very easily shift to different regions and sourcing markets in Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when it comes to your sort of aggregated dollar purchases in -- out of Asia for your summer product, for example, are you experiencing some increase in sort of like-for-like product areas, or not?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can I ask about capacity then because you've reiterated your guidance on your store growth of 10 to 15%? How much do you think that could be increased by the growth of the new capacity online and through mail order over the next few years?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, because you're effectively adding new capacity with the mail order offer and the online offer. I was just wondering whether -- because you take that, I think, in your first year as effectively new capacity in these markets, don't you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Of course, looking at the moment and looking some years ahead, the online and the catalogue selling will of course add value to our selling. That's for sure.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I realize. But, Nils, maybe we'll pick this up afterwards. Can I just then ask a final question about your Asian expansion because I noticed from your guidance on where the key stores -- key growth is coming from in the next -- in this new financial year doesn't include any of the Asian markets? How many stores are you going to be opening in China, for example, this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give out any numbers per country. But it's natural that China doesn't occur among the greatest yet because the base is so small. So we will take it step by step, of course.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good afternoon, gents. Well, company name's JPMorgan. Three questions -- just going back to the CapEx, I just wondered really whether we've seen a sort of step change in upwards in the CapEx going forward or whether this is just some sort of accelerated refurbishments to keep up with the rest of the market. So are we going to see CapEx probably trend down next year as a percentage of sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no you won't. So the CapEx for this year -- shows for 2007, shows a step up. That's definitely like that. We have increased the number of refurbishments offshore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But is that a step change that's going to be permanent going forward? Is H&amp;M now a business that needs 5% CapEx as a percentage of sales rather than 3% to trend down in future?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Sorry. Yes, I was just asking about the inventory write down. I think it was 95 million. And I just wondered how that occurred, if you can give a bit more detail on that, on your change of policy and whether we might expect similar write downs in future or whether that was strictly a one off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It has to do with the restructuring we've done of the group and how we -- the method we use to -- for the valuation of stock in trade, whereas in the past we've used the retail method for the whole company, when you start up from the sales price and go backwards to find that -- to arrive at the net cost so to speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now in the new structure, we have the central buying office, global buying office, who buys garments and keeps them in stock and then sell it to the countries. But it's impossible to know exactly the selling price because you don't know exactly where it's going to sell. So we have to apply another method. That's why the difference has occurred in SEK95 million. So it's a one off.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's UBS. I just wonder if I can press you a bit more on the issue of cost ratios. I mean, they're off 100 basis points in the third quarter. And I think you refer that point to a sort of low single figure like-for-like sales giving makeshift levers. That obviously wasn't the case in Q4. And I'm aware that there's a number of things going on inside the business. You talked the cost ratios in a historic context. Is it fair to assume that next year you will see -- we will see another sort of 100 basis points or so increase if I continue down as far as that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as we are not expecting that, we're not expecting any big changes on the cost side really. We have taken -- we have done lots of things this year, and we've taken lots of steps to make a better foundation. And these steps are taken now. So I don't really see any increase here. It's the aim anyway to keep it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I know you aim to keep it steady over the year, but presume you may be up in the first half before you annualize against the higher costs level you achieved sustained in the second?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't really like to give any comments on different quarters. But looking at the full year, we have been on something like between 37 and 38% for the last; I don't know six, seven, eight years. So, that's where we like to end this coming year as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>We had 11 stores this year. And I mean, still of course, they're not profitable. So they contributed more to the costs than the revenues, of course. But going forward, we've said that we plan to open three new stores this year. Is that the answer to your question?</p>

          <p>All right. And a question about the collection that you're planning to launch with Merimekko.  Is that going to be as important and as large as M by Madonna.

        <plist>
          <p>From your first question as you compared to Madonna, obviously, Madonna was a much greater collection, much greater campaign. And this is compared to that much smaller. Then regarding your other question, if there's going to be in some other initiatives, you will have to wait. I mean, we have to surprise the customers, that's more important. And of course, today we have launched a new campaign, Fashion Against AIDS, which we're very excited about.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of questions from me. First of all, I'm interested in your comments on the gross margin in the year under review, particularly fourth quarter, that's you saw some slight markdown activity and some sort of selective pricing activity on your part. The things that I wondered about having seen that were first of all where your ASPs were in the autumn/winter collection in terms of year-on-year changes. Secondly, whether you felt that the impact on the gross margin in anyway reflected a non-sort of acceptance by the market of your pricing or if you could tell us why you had to take that pricing activity, as an alternative answer. And then moving forward, looking forward, if you tell us where the ASP's are likely to move or where you've budgeted them to move on the full price part of the collections in the spring/summer. That's the first area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I understand you right the first question is regarding ASP, and I can say it's the same as it has been throughout the whole year. On comparable items, it's been flat, remained the same. But the ASP in total has increased maybe 1 to 2% due to mixed effects. And that has been the same in Q4 as the rest of the quarters. Regarding the strategic price offerings and markdowns, I think we were very good salesmen in the quarter and early, we saw that sales were a bit weaker in the end of November. So we took their markdowns and, but this was very marginal. So I think we were very happy with what we've done. It's not a matter of that we had to -- that the customers didn't accept our collections whatsoever. And then going forward ASP, we don't give any forecasts as you know. But again, my answer is we don't see any dramatic changes.</p>

          <p>Okay. As a sort of follow-up -- not a follow-up question. Another question, looking at the Canadian business, I know it's only a small business at the moment. It doesn't appear to be getting the sales performance relative to the capacity increase that one might expect. It looks like you've doubled your average stores and your sales have gone up by about 50%. Is there an issue developing in Canada?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't -- no, there's absolutely no issue developing there. It's simply a matter of opening up new stores relatively close to existing ones, and you get this effect. You strengthen overall in the city but of course, you water out the selling in the older stores in that city. And as you have heard, maybe have heard now, we went over to the West Coast of Canada as well, and there we also see fantastic developments in these stores. So we're very pleased with the development in Canada.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to -- hi, there. Going back to costs, if you take the additional cost you had last year, so basically, the launch of online in Germany and Austria, the development of Collection of Style, development of H&amp;M Home, and the launch in new markets and preparation for Japan, if you take all of those costs, how would additional costs, those types of costs, compare in 2008 to what we saw in 2007?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really haven't -- we don't have the figure at hand at the moment. I'm sorry. So for us, this is normal business. So if we took out a lot of things and said this does not apply to the business, then I think we would -- I think that would be wrong of us. We know that these things must be allowed to cost money because it's simply essential for the future for H&amp;M, so ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, I'm not disputing that at all. I'm just wondering if those types of costs are going to be higher or lower in 2008, because it was quite a chunk of extra costs in '07 that we didn't have in '06. So to help us model the costs in 2008, it would be helpful to know if those types of costs are going to be higher or lower next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I say it like this, I think we would be very pleased if this cost lands between 37 and 38%, then we would be happy. I don't know if that helps you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that rather depends on the like-for-like sales growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, because that's a variable, it would be more useful in a way to know how the extra costs are going to trend perhaps next year.</p>

          <p>Hi. You've said a couple times that the online and catalogue sales have been better than you expected. Is it possible to give us some kind of indication of the magnitude of this in Germany and Holland?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on what -- because in Holland, where we've now been up and running for more than a year, it's included in the like-for-like, but it wasn't last year, whereas the expansion in Austria and Germany is not in the like-for-like this year, but it will be next year, if you see what I mean.</p>

          <p>I don't know how much we should give today because we do not really want to go too much into details here. But the step up in cost per store is not very high between these two years. It's simply a much higher program. And there's also different type of activities being undertaken. So I'm sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'm under the impression -- I was under the impression from your comments in the releases that you've stepped up your, for example, refurbishment expenditure quite significantly. Is that now not what you're saying?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And can I go back to the 95 million of sort of exceptional stock write-down? I may need to ask you to explain it again. But am I right in thinking that it's become more of a timing issue than it used to be under the old system? So Q4 is more of a residual number in that regard?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What does residual mean? I'm sorry. I don't understand that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it implies to me that actually it's a number that you could only isolate at the end of the season, whereas in the past actually you may have been able to run it week-by-week.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way. We've always had end-of-the-year effects when we -- because we used the retail method and the FIFO method.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>On the ongoing debate about slowdown, downturn, recessionary environment, I'm just curious to hear what you think about that, or in other words how are you preparing regardless of your growth outlook. But how are you preparing for 2008? What are the intended expectations in that perspective just to really understand from your side how things are turning, if not for H&amp;M, for the environment you're working in, if you, I'd be interested to hear your view on this, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing you can sort of prepare is simply to try your best to have the right prices and you have the right collections and be very competitive. So, this is actually nothing new for us. We've been working on the German market for a number of years. And I think for the last 15 years, I think in German markets has been a very slow market. Everybody has been talking about that. And I mean, we've built on 200 stores, so 250 stores during that period in Germany. And we also managed to get very good turnover and very good sales in Germany. So what scares me most about bad times is really more that people are talking about it. We have to help with the situation. If it gets tougher, okay, then we have to be better, of course, than the rest of the competition.</p>

          <p>It may be -- I wouldn't say that we are concerned. So we are going into 2008 the way we go into any other year or any other season. So it's a tough market every year. It should be every month, every year.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Stefan Lycke at Deutsche. Could you just confirm that you include both online and mail order from the Netherlands now in your like for like? Or do you only sort of include online as mail order hasn't been really for a full fiscal year?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. This is Mark Josefson at Kepler in Frankfurt. I'd like a bit more clarity on the dividend policy. You've highlighted again this year a 50% payout as a longer-term goal, but again proposed a dividend which is noticeably above 50% of post-tax profit. Now I'm sure shareholders welcome the SEK14 that is recommended. But are you also prepared to indicate the Board is not normally expecting to cut the dividend to get down to the 50% payout ratio, but rather be perhaps a less aggressive way of doing the expansion and comparison to earnings growth going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's also said in the policy that the Board can take the decision to distribute surplus cash, which they have done now for some years. It's simply a matter of the Board judging the money situation in the company. And if the Board decides that there is surplus cash, it's also then distributed, which they have done this year. Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's entirely fair. It's just that it's becoming clear that the cash machine that is Hennes &amp; Mauritz is always going to develop what's been perceived to the outside world at least as surplus cash and why you stick to a 50% -- or why you still continue to claim that a 50% payout is the longer-term goal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe it's that the Board is on the ridiculously safe side.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I actually had exactly the same question as the previous speaker. But I had one more. And that goes -- and forgive me if it has been asked before. But it goes to Russia. And I was wondering to what extent, for example, one could look at Ikea's expansion in Russia as a proxy for what you think is achievable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I'm not all that familiar with Ikea's expansion, but I'm sure we will be working with a number of different landlords in Russia, it could very well be Ikea is one of them.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Anna-Karin Envall from Handelsbanken. Just one really nasty question -- it's typical that you have moved to a new headquarters is always a worrying sign and a sign that you should definitely sell a share in the company...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rent is lower here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that was actually my question. You should have a lower rent in the new headquarters than you had in your old one. Is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And another question, more serious one. Can you help us with kind of a hypothetical question? If we look at '08 and, let's say, assume that you will have a top line growth of 14%. If in that figure you will have a, let's say, flat or a negative like-for-like growth in your store base, but perhaps higher contribution from online, will that compensate the lower profitability you should have in the stores if you have lower like-for-like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that was very hypothetical. Could we take that maybe in a meeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In a personal meeting? No. Can you help -- do you understand what I'm meaning, what I'm saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you understand the question, what I mean with it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think so. But I think we have to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm saying is that normally if you have a good like for like in the store network, of course, that could boost profitability in the stores at the same time that you actually increase number of hours with the staff in the stores and so on. How quickly do you change that if you have lower like-for-like? How quick do reduce number of hours in the stores? So what I'm saying is,is it possible to have the same operating margin in the store if you have a 0% like for like compared to a 4% like for like? Is that possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not expected to have a 4% increase. We have &#x2013; of course, there are some flexibility in the hours in the stores. But a lot of it is, of course, more or less fixed. You have to move the garments. And you have to do this. And you have to do that. A certain flexibility, but not 100% flexibility.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. So if you have a contribution from online is that for like for like, should that be negative for profitability then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if this -- it's not expected to have a higher real increase in the like-for-like stores as well.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just a couple of more questions, please. The first question is when you look back on 4Q and you compare it to your budget were you actually -- did the gross margin leave up to what you expected in 4Q? As you probably know, it was slightly lower than the consensus expectations. And did any particular countries disappoint you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's no countries disappointing us. More or less in line with the expectation, maybe a slightly below expectation, not very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, would you attribute that to the slightly higher level of markdowns if there was any --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, more or less there is 95 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the transfer. I see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had more reduction than the year before, but that's &#x2013; it's not generally. I think its 0.1 or something like that. So it's not very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, I mean, going back to what you said about the UK and the US being -- a little bit tough, has there been an actually -- if you go through the quarters of last year, have those markets become tougher? Or have they been tough over the whole period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we're looking at the fourth quarter, these two markets weren't that tough. I think it's more December was in the UK a tougher most. But it is very, very hard to judge on single month. So we are very pleased for the development for the last year for both US and the UK. And as I said before, we are on markets which have been tough for a number of years like I mentioned Germany, and we should be able to perform well there anyway.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then the last question is -- so -- in terms of the guidance of what you are aiming for the 37 to 38% OpEx as a percentage of sales. I mean, is that predicated on positive like for like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
