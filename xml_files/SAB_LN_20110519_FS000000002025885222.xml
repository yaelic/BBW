        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Apologizes for our delay today. We had some webcast technical difficulties. I'm Gary Leibowitz, Senior Vice President for Investor Relations of SABMiller Plc in London. Welcome to SABMiller's results presentation for our financial year ended 31st of March, 2011. With me today, regrettably for the last time in this conference call series, is Malcom Wyman, our CFO.</p>
          <p>First some formalities. Our presentation will contain forward-looking statements. Those statements reflect the current best judgment of our management team but include risks and uncertainties. And as usual, we disclaim any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>So now to get started. With our sustained focus on our strategic priorities right across the business, we delivered excellent organic constant currency EBITA growth of 12% in the year, a 120 basis point margin increase. Adjusted EPS was up 19%, and our free cash flow increased 23% to $2.5 billion.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with the competitive performance of our businesses in an environment of mixed trading conditions, in which we generated resumed volume growth and selective price increases. We've continued to implement significant fixed cost savings. This enabled increased marketplace investment in Africa and South Africa, margin pressure protection in Europe, and larger margin growth in Latin America and North America.</p>
          <p>Our volume results improved in the second half of the year. Growth for the year was led by the frontier markets in Africa and Asia, which have proven to be fairly buoyant through the economic cycle. This was complemented by a return to modest growth in Europe in the second half and some slow, incremental improvement in the U.S. volume trend.</p>
          <p>Our mature markets continued to be held back by unemployment and constrained consumer confidence among key beer drinkers, with higher gas prices an added headwind in North America. In this environment, modest price increases across many markets were enabled by the strength of our brands. Our revenue was further complemented by the active drive towards positive brand impact mix in the U.S., Lat Am, South Africa, and China.</p>
          <p>Turning briefly to a review of highlights from each of our divisions now. Our Latin American business has performed well despite the fiscal and regulatory headwinds and exceptional rainfall and flooding, particularly in Colombia. We grew EBITA despite flat volumes and raised our operating margin by over 2 percentage points to almost 26%. Our sustained focus on cost efficiency has contributed to a more than 5 full percentage point increase in margin over the last three years, as you can see in the graph on the right.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on beer category development. We're expanding our international premium segment, having launched Miller Genuine Draft throughout the region and Miller Lite recently in Panama. We're rapidly developing an upper mainstream segment, delivering higher margins. And we've launched additional variants of our local premium brands, which are shown on the next slide.</p>
          <p>You can see them here &#x2013; extensions of our local premium brands, for example, Cusque&#xF1;a Red, Cusque&#xF1;a Malta in Peru, and Club Colombia Roja, launched over the Christmas period in Colombia. And our upper mainstream brand variants, Aguila Light in Colombia, Pilsener Light in Ecuador, and Pilsen Callao in Peru, which have helped to drive the 30% volume growth in this upper mainstream segment this year across the region. Together, our premium and upper mainstream segments now represent 26% of our volume in Latin America, up over 4 percentage points on last year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we delivered good financial performance, with profit growth of 4% EBITA on a constant currency basis and an 80 basis point margin improvement, notwithstanding negative operating leverage from a 3% decline in volumes, a strong achievement. While we're beginning to see sporadic economic recovery, consumer confidence is still weak, and the going-out occasion is still noticeably lagging, although in the second half of the financial year, we saw some stabilization of the trend. We're undergoing wide-ranging restructuring programs and significant fixed cost reductions, particularly in Romania, Russia, the Canary Islands, Italy, and the Netherlands, and are benefiting from the regionalization of manufacturing, all of which drove the margin expansion.</p>
          <p>In our larger markets, we've seen an environment characterized by widespread competitor price reductions and discounting. In the face of that, SABMiller pricing has been more steady. But to protect category value and to grow our own position, we're deploying better price ladders to preserve the leading equity and consumer perceptions of our iconic local brands, we're introducing new products and packages to open up new segments, and we're investing in deeper value-creating relationships with retailers built on a shared vision of value growth. All these steps taken collectively will continue to build our leadership positions in these markets and ultimately serve to lead and protect category profitability in the face of competitor actions.</p>
          <p>Moving to the U.S. and MillerCoors, notwithstanding the subdued economy there for key beer drinkers, pricing in the U.S. beer industry has remained firm, and we've continued to reduce the price gap between the mainstream and economy segments, driving up-trading and improved sales mix, albeit with some resulting volume elasticity effect. MillerCoors has improved its segment share in premium lights, as you can see in the graph on the upper right led by Coors Light's consistently strong performance and complemented by much improved &#x2013; indeed, transformed performance by Miller Lite. Better sales execution by MillerCoors and its wholesalers is driving distribution and outlet velocity, especially in channels where MillerCoors has traditionally under-indexed, such as C-stores.</p>
          <p>Specific activities, such as cross-merchandising in supermarkets and single-serve packages in C-stores, are aimed at specific beer occasions. And intensified through-the-line marketing with a focus on African Americans and Hispanics is having a positive impact. MillerCoors has further plans to up its efforts in this space, with new lead sponsorship of the Primera Divisi&#xF3;n of the Mexican Football League in the U.S.</p>
          <p>MillerCoors' craft and imports business, Tenth and Blake, continues to drive growth ahead of the category. Blue Moon has now exceeded 1.5 million hectoliters per year, and Leinenkugel's has become a significant contributor. Peroni Nastro Azzurro also delivered good growth of 7% in the year, as MillerCoors carefully expands its distribution platform.</p>
          <p>Turning to Africa, we delivered a strong full-year performance, with lager volume growth of 13%. We have now seen steady, accelerated growth for six straight quarters. In Uganda, for example, lager volumes grew by 20% with a significant market share gain against our regional competitor, supported by higher capacity and broader distribution, improved retail execution, and a leading brand portfolio. Similarly in Zambia, for example, lager volume growth for the year was 28%.</p>
          <p>We continue to extend our route to market in Africa and our brand and pack portfolios with longer price ladders. Our regional premium brand portfolio of Castle Lager, Castle Lite, and other brands experienced strong growth, adding to the margin expansion in the second half of the year, which was also driven by improving capacity utilization.</p>
          <p>Our start-up operations in Ethiopia, Southern Sudan, and Nigeria are now performing to expectations. We see more opportunity in Nigeria and recently announced a further $100 million investment to build a brewery and bottling facility in Onitsha. And as we stated at the interim, we continue to see promising signs of recovery and future growth potential in Zimbabwe, and in the year saw a return to lager volumes in line with previous levels.</p>
          <p>Lager volumes in South Africa grew 2%, a strong performance given that the financial year did not benefit from an Easter peak trading period. Excellent operational performance across brand marketing, through-the-line activations, and sales execution has resulted in our market share's stabilization now. This is quite an achievement given that we underindexed in the faster-growing premium segment, driven by the strong performance of Castle Lite, as you can see in the graph on the upper left, gaining premium share as now the segment leader in the premium segment in South Africa. There is also evidence that the beer category is now gaining share of alcohol as well. In key aspects of in-trade execution, SAB's lead versus the competition is widening, including both distribution and sales service.</p>
          <p>And in Asia, lager volumes grew 10% on an organic basis, with strong growth in China, supported by India and Vietnam. And EBITA increased strongly as a result. CR Snow lager volumes grew 10% organically, and it increased its national market share to 21%, with the Snow brand alone now commanding a 19% share of the market. Revenue per hectoliter increased 4%. CR Snow's success in building high market shares and stronger profitability is now resulting in double-digit margins in some provinces.</p>
          <p>In India, we delivered good growth in volume and a substantial improvement in EBITA, with a shift in strategic focus towards provinces which have fewer regulatory restrictions in the development of the beer category. Brand extensions and packaging innovations, including the expansion of proprietary bottles in key states, drove increased margin and favorable mix.</p>
          <p>I'll now give you a brief update on the group's four strategic priorities. These have remained constant and relevant for almost five years now. Over the past decade, we've created a balanced portfolio of businesses with leading growth characteristics. In the financial year, we entered Argentina with the acquisition of CASA Isenbeck, which provides us with an interesting initial entry point into the country and the Mercosur region. We also acquired a water manufacture in Kenya aligned with our African full beverage strategy. And our associate in China extended its footprint with acquisitions of three breweries in Heilongjiang, Jiangsu, and Henan. Our M&amp;A approach is disciplined, with a firm economic value approach and a focus on a wide range of businesses and markets in which we can add value through the application of our skills and experience.</p>
          <p>Looking at the other strategic priorities, as regards developing strong, relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market, we focus our attention in five key areas. First, the expansion of the category across new consumer segments and occasions. There are a few examples shown here. In Lat Am, we're working to bring consumers into the beer category from local spirits and develop more occasions where beer is the preferred choice rather than cheaper traditional local products that generally have a higher alcohol content. Examples include smaller bottles to encourage picking up a beer on the go or promoting beer consumption with meals, as well as special occasions when a beer may not have been available or prominently marketed. An example is public events, and in Ecuador alone, we've increased our focus on events, servicing over 35,000 of them in the past year versus 7,500 in the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our second focus has been initiatives to develop differentiated, leading, premium brand portfolios. As mentioned earlier, MillerCoors has accelerated the growth in its craft segment with recent extensions into more seasonals, such as Harvest Pumpkin Ale from Blue Moon and Big Eddy Imperial Stout from Leinie's. With our import business in the UK, we're building on the success of Peroni Nastro Azzurro with our other, quote-unquote, "beers of the world," such as Pilsner Urquell from the Czech Republic, MGD from the U.S., Tyskie and Lech from Poland. And as an example, in Mozambique, Laurentina Preta, a dark lager selling at a 15% price premium to mainstream, has delivered three consecutive years of exceptional growth and now commands over a 30% market share.</p>
          <p>We continue to strengthen our powerful mainstream brands at the heart of our local portfolios. In the past year, we've seen a major trend improvement in Miller Lite on the back of the packaging innovation and focused marketing of the taste credentials of the brand that resonates. And this has similarly been the case with our other leading power brands at the national level around the world, like Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Peroni in Italy, and Castle in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Our fourth and fifth focus areas are advancing our in-trade commercial capabilities. In Europe, we have significantly stepped up our approach to revenue management and maintain our lead in building category value. A focus on mix management within our brand-packed channel architecture is creating value, both in premium and, for example, in convenience packaging with cans. And in the rapidly expanding, off-premise key accounts channel, our commercial approach has been upgraded to forge retail relationships that build long-term value. Simple transactional give-and-take relationships and bartering is giving way to more strategic category management, aligning our interests with retailers in terms of financial incentives within the portfolio's overall category margins for the retailer and joint business planning.</p>
          <p>And as regards sales execution, MillerCoors, for example, is investing heavily in strengthening its relationship with customers, as you've heard. A consequence has been increased category captainships in key accounts in the U.S. chains, from 24% in 2008, up to 30% last year.</p>
          <p>And now moving on to our third strategic priority, constantly raising the profitability of our businesses sustainably. We continue to manage costs to increase our marketing investment into our brands and raise our already-strong profitability. For example, in Colombia, we've expanded our margins very significantly in spite of the volume decline with optimized service models, route to market, and fixed cost reductions, including the closure recently of the Bogot&#xE1; brewery. And you can see the very significant EBITA margin growth in Colombia delivered over the last couple of years in the graph on the right.</p>
          <p>In Europe, in April 2010, we regionalized our manufacturing model, with a central team now managing our production platform and supply chains with resulting COGS and fixed-cost reductions. In Africa, we're developing local supply chains, which improves raw material reliability and delivers cost benefits. Historically, over 80% of our brewing materials in Africa needed to be imported, and we're aiming to reduce this to around 50% over the next three years. Collaborating with the local farming communities is also enhancing local stakeholder and government support for our initiatives, with excise benefits being one positive consequence for our more affordable brands such as Eagle.</p>
          <p>And now to our fourth and final strategic priority, to leverage our skills and global scale. We're progressing well with our wide-ranging business capability programme, the BCP. Our global procurement operation is now established in Switzerland. We transitioned most brewing materials in the first half of the year, and in the last quarter the major packaging materials. Having placed approximately $2 billion of expenditure under the centralized management there so far, we're seeing the benefits. More packaging and indirect spend categories are planned to follow during the coming year. We've reached significant milestones in other aspects of the BCP, too, which I'll have Malcolm describe in a moment.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll now turn you over to Malcolm for a review of the financials. Malcolm?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day to everyone. As in the past, I'm going to focus my presentation on results on an organic constant currency basis, which remove the impact of currency movements on our underlying performance and profitability.</p>
          <p>The group has again delivered another year of excellent results, with strong adjusted earnings per share growth in all our major currencies. Adjusted earnings per share in our reported currency of United States dollars grew 19% whilst increasing by 23% in pound sterling. The final dividend is US$0.615 per share, which brings the annual dividend to $0.81 per share, an increase of 19% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>We delivered a very strong financial performance this year, enhanced by improved second half volume growth across all divisions other than North America. Lager volumes increased 2% on an organic basis, underpinned by good growth across a number of our emerging markets, including China, Peru, South Africa, Uganda, and Zambia. Our continued focus on strengthening our local brand portfolios through increased marketing investment and improved availability, supported by a general improvement in economic conditions, drove our emerging market volume growth. Momentum was higher, but partially offset by tough trading conditions in North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Soft drinks volumes across our Africa and Central America markets were up by 3% on an organic basis. Organic constant currency revenue grew 5.2%, driven by volume growth, as well as prior-year and current price increases taken selectively across most markets. Top line revenue growth, together with reduced costs, contributed to the 12.4% increase in organic constant currency EBITA.</p>
          <p>Full-year EBITA margin increased by 110 basis points on an organic constant currency basis, somewhat higher than the 90 basis point improvement we achieved at the half-year. Lower finance costs, following a reduction in net debt by more than $1.3 billion, together with a marginally lower effective tax rate, resulted in our very strong 19% growth in adjusted earnings per share. Group revenue grew 5.2% on an organic constant currency basis, with all regions delivering revenue-per-hectoliter growth. Good volume growth and firm pricing, taken both last year and in the second half of this year, together with continued premiumization within our brand portfolios, particularly in our emerging market operations, contributed equally to overall revenue growth.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, revenue per hectoliter grew by 2% on a constant currency basis, principally as a result of prior-year price increases, positive mix from strong growth of local premium brands across the region, and through the introduction of Miller Genuine Draft in an a number of countries in the region. Volumes continued to be impacted by downtrading and difficult economic conditions for consumers in Europe. However, revenue per hectoliter on a constant currency basis grew 3%, largely as a result of pricing to recover the significant excise increases levied last year in Russia and the Czech Republic.</p>
          <p>In North America, MillerCoors grew revenue per hectoliter by 2% as a result of price increases taken over the third quarter, together with some improvements in brand mix following the strong growth of the Tenth and Blake crafts and imports division.</p>
          <p>In our subsidiary businesses in Africa, revenue per hectoliter grew 11% on a constant currency basis following price increases taken generally in line with inflation and the good growth of our local and regional premium brands. Revenue per hectoliter grew 4% in Asia due to price increases taken both in India as well as across a number of regions in China in the latter part of the financial year. And South Africa delivered good revenue-per-hectoliter growth of 5% on a constant currency basis due to price increases taken in both beer and soft drinks businesses.</p>
          <p>We delivered excellent organic constant currency EBITA growth of 12.4%, almost double the growth rate of 6.3% achieved last year. Volume and pricing benefits, lower input costs, and tight overall fixed cost control all contributed to the significant increase in EBITA growth. All regions other than Europe achieved a double-digit increase in EBITA, with the trend improving in the second half of the year, largely driven by a better volume performance over this period. Top line revenue growth, significant synergy and cost savings in North America, lower raw material costs, and particularly good fixed cost savings in Latin America and Europe drove the full-year EBITA performance.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, EBITA grew 15%, benefiting from the relative strength of the South African rand and Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar throughout the year. This more than offset the adverse impact of weaker key operating currencies in Africa and in Central and Eastern European countries. Full-year raw material costs benefited from the strengthening of a number of key operating currencies relative to the U.S. dollar &#x2013; in particular, the South African rand and the Colombian peso. Total costs of goods sold were also down approximately 1% in the year on a constant currency U.S. dollar per hectoliter basis, following a 3% increase last year. As referred to earlier, our business capability programme continues to make progress across a wide range of activities.</p>
          <p>The development of Trinity, the global procurement organization, has been particularly important with brewing raw materials transitioning to global management in the first half, most packaging, buying transitioning during the second half, and related initiatives in non-production spend beginning to deliver results. As we've said, the regionalization of the European manufacturing organization has started to produce meaningful financial benefit.</p>
          <p>In the systems area, the rollout of sales and distribution systems in Latin America is proceeding well. The back office platform was implemented in the first half in South Africa. Extension of these models into a global platform is progressing well. Costs continue to be driven by the design, build, and implementation of the systems platforms and are broadly in line with the expectations communicated at midyear, including the exceptional charge of $296 million. Net operating benefits in the year exceeded $60 million, ahead of our expectation at the time of the interims. Global procurement and efficiencies from the regional manufacturing organization in Europe are making the major contribution.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with the progress on working capital in general, and specifically from the contribution of process and systems changes initiated through the business capability programme. On an accumulated basis, working capital benefits amounted to over $450 million, comfortably exceeding our original objective for cash inflows from working capital of $350 million by the end of 2012. Adjusted EBITDA, comprising EBITDA before cash flows on exceptional items, together with dividends received from MillerCoors, was up 12% on the prior year as a result of increased operating profit and a higher dividend from MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>Following the significant working capital cash inflow of $563 million in the prior year, the level of cash generated from working capital reduced as expected to $66 million this year. Capital expenditure of $1.315 billion was $213 million lower than last year following the completion of a number of capacity-related projects in Europe and Africa the prior year.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow continues to improve, up some $460 million this year, principally as a result of reduced capital expenditure, increased dividends from MillerCoors, and lower investments in associates and joint ventures. The group's effective tax rate of 28.2% was 30 basis points lower than that of the previous year as a result of a more beneficial geographic mix of earnings, changes in legislation within our Europe division, and the resolution of various uncertain tax situations.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position has improved from the prior financial year-end due to our strong cash flow, but this has been offset to some extent by the appreciation of certain currencies, including the rand and euro, in which a material proportion of our debt is held. Our financial structure has improved significantly, with gearing falling to 31.2% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 1.3 times. Adjusted net finance costs have been reduced, primarily as a result of our lower net debt. The weighted average interest rate on gross debt at the 31st of March was 5.9%, marginally up from 5.7% at 31 March, 2010, but this was primarily driven by increases in interest rates in Africa and Colombia, as well as the repayment of some low-coupon short-term debt. Majority of our debt continues to be held in floating rates, benefiting from low market interest rates.</p>
          <p>We continue to maintain an appropriate and balanced net debt currency profile given the spread of our businesses. As we report in U.S. dollars, we also keep a reasonable proportion of debt in that currency. Our maturity profile after offsetting cash against short-term debt maturities indicates that the majority of our debt matures after two years. We currently have substantial headroom available to refinance more than the amount of debt falling due over the next two years, in terms of cash resources and undrawn committed facilities. Our access to committed liquidity remains strong, with committed headroom available to the group in excess of $3 billion as of the 31 March, 2011. Subsequent to the year-end, we signed a new five-year, $2.5 billion syndicated revolving credit facility with two one-year extension options to replace facilities of a similar amount which were maturing over the next two years and which were canceled at that time. We have also renewed existing in-country facilities as and when required.</p>
          <p>The growth in consumer demand experienced in most of our emerging markets over the past year is expected to continue into the current financial year. However, consumer demand in Europe and the U.S. remains uncertain. Raw material input costs are expected to be up low single digits in the current financial year due to rising commodity prices, which have adversely impacted the cost of brewing raw materials in particular. As of the end of March 2011, well over half of the group's volume requirements for the upcoming financial year were, however, covered through supplier contracts but at somewhat higher prices than last year, following the poor wheat and barley harvest in Russia and Northern Europe last summer.</p>
          <p>In addition, some packaging commodities, as well as distribution costs, are expected to be affected by the increase in crude oil prices. However, we expect that firmer local operating currencies relative to the U.S. dollar will partially mitigate these higher underlying commodity prices in the current financial year. We will maintain our focus on cash generation. As you would expect, following the significant improvement in working capital cash inflows of over $629 million generated in the past two years, future working capital benefits will moderate. Capital expenditure in the current financial year will increase to approximately $1.5 billion, driven up by capacity expansion projects in markets experiencing substantial growth, such as Nigeria, Southern Sudan, and Peru. We anticipate that finance costs will be lower in the current financial year given the lower net debt levels we expect.</p>
          <p>Finally, our effective tax rate should remain between approximately 28% and 29% this year, reflecting a level which we believe is sustainable in the medium term given the current composition of the group.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Malcolm.</p>
          <p>And so just to conclude briefly, <mark type="ph" /> while consumer (30:02) demand is likely to continue growing in most developing markets, there are uncertainties in the pace of recovery in developed economies. Price increases will be taken selectively, taking into account the competitive context and our drive to extend beer's affordability in some markets. More broadly, our organic growth strategies remain consistent: developing the beer category and our leading local positions. And we will continue to leverage scale across our unique global beer footprint. And our medium-term outlook for growth in volume, revenue, and profitability remains strong.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, Malcolm and I &#x2013; and we're joined by Jamie Wilson, our new CFO-designate &#x2013; will be happy to take questions now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from Lauren Torres from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, everyone. My question's related to your plans for increased investment spend. I believe on the marketing side, you said that investments, or marketing investments, will increase year over year. So just curious where that spend will be directed. And also too now, as you work down your debt levels pretty nicely, just curious, as we think about other uses of cash, how are you thinking about expanding the business? Is it still just primarily bolt-on acquisitions at this point? And then if nothing really seems close on the radar screen, how else do you think about uses of cash? Is it just a cash return to shareholders? Or other ways of paying back these cash levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thanks, Lauren. Just on the marketing investment side, we believe that going year over year, we will be investing more behind our brands in market. We have done that during the course of this year, and we're planning to do that again next year. But bear in mind that as we do so, we expect to increase our volume and our revenues, so by and large we would expect that the percentage of marketing to turnover would remain roughly the same.</p>
          <p>Now, that's a group perspective and very much an overview. If you take it market by market, you can see, for example, in a country like South Africa where we have a competitive situation against one of our major competitors. And we have been upgrading the business and particularly putting a large amount of marketing spend behind our core brands, as well as brands such as Castle Lite, which have been growing very fast in the local premium segment. Now there, we would expect that marketing spend will probably be up by at least 20%. In some of our African territories where we're expanding our business, and also going into new countries, year-over-year marketing spend will be up by the same if not higher amounts.</p>
          <p>And that's balanced then by other territories where we have already spent significant sums and probably gone up to a higher level as a percentage of revenue than we believe is sustainable and needed over the &#x2013; into the future. For example, in some of our Latin America territories. So it's a balance. Country by country, we are investing heavily where we believe that is appropriate, and in other markets where we have already put in a lot of marketing spend &#x2013; for example, in Colombia we introduced new brands and we introduced new packaging, and as a result of that we put a lot of marketing spend behind that brand portfolio during the course of the last two years. So as a percentage of revenue, we would pull it back. So generally over the whole group, we see marketing growing roughly in line with revenue, but it is very much a country-by-country situation determined and dictated by competitive and growth environments.</p>
          <p>As far as the debt and our balance is concerned, you've quite rightly pointed out that we do have a significant cash flow, and debt has been coming down, and our net debt to EBITDA sits around about 1.3 times at the moment. Now, our first use of the cash is in fact to expand our business. We see ourselves as a top line growth company. We're positioned in emerging markets where growth exists, and therefore from an organic growth point of view, we will be driving growth through marketing spend and also through expanding capacity in markets wherever we see that supply requires us to put down &#x2013; sorry, where demand requires that we put down further capacity increases.</p>
          <p>We also look at where we can expand our business in market or in region, and a good example of that is the new brewery that we are putting into Nigeria, where the existing brewery, which was very much an entry point, we are now finding that demand has well exceeded supply. And we're spending $100 million in building a new brewery in Onitsha. In places like South America, we have expanded into Argentina, where we believe there is certainly opportunity for premium brands, and so it's a good entry point into that market and into some of the surrounding countries. So there are many examples I can give you where we would look to use our cash.</p>
          <p>Now, that may not use up all of the significant cash flow that we would get over the next couple of years. And should that be the case, no doubt that the board will have a look at the level of debt in our business, and I think that if over the course of the next 12 to 24 months we were to see that the debt level would go below, for example &#x2013; and I use this just as an illustration &#x2013; perhaps 1 debt to EBITDA times, then it is certainly something that the board would look at and would consider methodologies for optimizing the balance sheet and considering whether such items as returns of capital through dividend or buybacks would be appropriate. But let me emphasize that at the moment, that is not a use of cash that is being considered by the board, and we're still busy very much looking at organic growth and also regional and bolt-on in-country acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And if I could also ask, I know you addressed this on your earlier call today, but for I guess us U.S. people, curious about pricing and your strategy here. We know that ABI has made some inroads with respect to narrowing that price gap. Just curious how you're approaching that. I guess you have taken steps to do the same, but I guess there's been some criticism that you haven't really done it as much. So just curious as we think about this year, how do you think about pricing? Are there opportunities also to narrow that gap? And what are your future plans?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, obviously we've seen what they're doing in market. But let me just say that if you go back to when we first entered the market and acquired Miller Brewing Company, one of the curious matters was the fact that the below-premium brands were in fact priced so low compared to the premium brands. And from an economic point of view, that seemed to us at the time that didn't make much sense. And we had been, in fact, trying to move the price of those below-premium brands up, and certainly, over the last year or two, we probably had started to move our prices up before our competitor had done so.</p>
          <p>So I think this seems to be something now where they're also closing the gap, and as the larger player in the marketplace, they &#x2013; I think they're taking the lead in doing so. They have significantly more volume than we do in that market, but economically, we see this as a rational thing to do. Certainly if we compare this market in the United States with other markets around the world, the gap that exists between the premium and below-premium brands has been a lot wider than we would have expected. So this seems to be a rational situation, and we certainly would be doing that. But as I say, I think our below-premium brands were probably at a higher level anyway, so at this stage, it may not look as though we're being as aggressive as they are because we're coming off a slightly higher base.</p>

          <p>So at this point, you are comfortable where you're priced at that category?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This is obviously an ongoing situation where we would have a look at the competitive context as well as what is happening economically in the marketplace. But at this point in time, we're comfortable where the pricing is at the moment.</p>
