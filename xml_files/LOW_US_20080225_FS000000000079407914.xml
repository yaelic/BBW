      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's.  Following my remarks, Larry Stone will provide additional details on our performance and describe his objectives for 2008, including what we're doing to manage the business in today's challenging environment.  Then Bob Hull will review our fourth quarter and year-end financial results.</p>
          <p>2007 presented a challenging sales environment.  Many external pressures affected our industry and weighed on consumers throughout the year.  Total sales decreased 0.3% for the quarter but increased 2.9% for the year, with comp sales declining 7.6% for the quarter and 5.1% for the year. While our top line results were disappointing, we did have solid market share gains, indicating that we're continuing to provide a compelling offering to customers despite the pressures on the overall industry.</p>
          <p>Earrings per share of $0.28 for the quarter and $1.86 for the year were within our guidance, but down 30% and 6.5% respectively from last year.  In a year when the housing market softened at an unprecedented rate, mortgage markets tightened considerably, especially in the back half of the year, deflationary price pressures from lumber and plywood impacted our sales and adverse weather, including the exceptional drought in certain areas of the country, pressured our industry, our relative performance reflects the strength of our team and suggests that we're providing customer-valued solutions in a challenging environment.</p>
          <p>Sales trends continued to get worse in the second half of 2007.  We're obviously working to further understand the variables impacting our industry.  Over the last several quarters, we've used third parties' home price information to define three broad market groupings, based on home price dynamics within those markets.  We described our performance in overpriced markets with a correction expected or occurring, overpriced markets with no pricing correction expected, and not overpriced markets. One thing that has remained consistent since we began this analysis is the logical tiers within our sales performance.  Basically, the worst markets from a home-price perspective have generated the worst relative results and markets with less impact on the housing front, have generated better relative comp sales.</p>
          <p>But as we've monitored these markets, we've seen an erosion in comp performance across all three market buckets.  Both troubled and relatively stable housing markets have seen an erosion in comp sales: that was true from Q2 to Q3, and from Q3 to Q4.  Obviously, this erosion is concerning, and while this analysis is not intended to be predictive, continued erosion in comp sales across all three market types has led to increased caution in our outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>The good news is that based on this analysis and supported by customer sentiment surveys, we're seeing an indication that once a market reaches a trough, essentially a point where home prices are no longer declining, consumers begin thinking about and acting on home improvement purchases very similar to consumers in markets where home prices weren't expected to decline.  We've only seen a few markets progress completely through this cycle.  We've only recently seen shifting consumer sentiment in those markets.  So it's too early to put too much confidence in these numbers but there are encouraging signs that demand patterns should improve as markets move through the cycle.</p>
          <p>In addition as I mentioned earlier, we continue to capture market share despite the pressures on the home improvement industry.  In the fourth quarter, we gained 80 basis points of total store unit market share.  Later in the call, Larry will provide more details about specific category performance.</p>
          <p>Our original plan for 2007 proved to be too optimistic.  In this challenging sales environment, we'll continue pursue our disciplines of providing excellent customer service and gaining profitable market share.  My goal is to ensure we maintain an inspired and energetic workforce.  Given the external pressures we faced in 2007, I'm grateful and appreciative of the hard work and dedication displayed by the entire Lowe's team.</p>
          <p>As we progress through 2008, we'll closely monitor the structural drivers of demand, including housing turnover, employment, and personal disposable income, as well as consumer sentiment related to home improvement.  As 2008 unfolds, we anticipate at least some of the headwinds will lessen.  The effects of the recent economic stimulus package and the Fed rate cuts should aid in stabilizing many of the factors that pressured sales in 2007.  Additionally, normalized weather, following last year's unusual pattern, should lead to better relative results.</p>
          <p>Even with these lessening headwinds, fiscal 2008 will be another challenging year, as many pressures on the home improvement consumer remain. Considering these pressures, we've built what we feel is an appropriately conservative plan.  We are managing the business for the long term and we'll continue to focus on providing customer-valued solutions and capitalizing on opportunities to gain market share and strengthen our business.  Our stores will remain best-in-class and the strength and experience of the Lowe's team positions us to drive profitable growth over the long term.</p>
          <p>Now, here is Larry to describe in greater detail the results of the quarter and provide insights on how we're managing the business today.  Larry?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Robert, and good morning.  As Robert mentioned, the sales environment remains challenging and the external pressures facing our industry will continue into 2008.  I will start this morning by reviewing some details for our fourth quarter and fiscal '07 results then I will share how our outlook for 2008 will impact our line organizations. Finally, I will update you on how we're thinking about the business longer-term.</p>
          <p>For both the fourth quarter and fiscal year only two of our product categories had positive comps, rough plumbing and lawn and landscape products.  In rough plumbing, we had success with our clean air and water filtration programs.  Our new operationally efficient sets in the rough fitting categories drove strong year-over-year increases. Finally, we experienced some inflation in raw materials for the pipe category that contributed to the comp growth.  In lawn and landscape, the positive comps for the quarter were driven by snow related products such as ice melt, snow shovels, and winter gloves.  For the year, we experienced strong sales in pest-control products, mulch, and watering products which was one of the few product areas aided by the extreme drought conditions we faced in various parts of the country.</p>
          <p>We also had relative success in other categories that outperformed the company average. For example, our Hardware category performed above the company average comp for the fourth quarter, driven by weather-related products, such as weatherstripping.  In addition, outdoor power equipment posted numbers above the company average, driven by the sales in snow blowers.  Our appliance sales also had relatively better results in the quarter, driven by cooking and refrigeration products.  While market share data on Appliances has been mixed through 2007, in the calendar fourth quarter we gained unit and dollar share and improved both our draw rate and close rate.</p>
          <p>Not resting on these gains, we are in process of rolling out the Electrolux brand in all stores by mid-March.  We're excited about adding this premium brand to our Appliance department.  Electrolux has been the leading brand in Europe for over 70 years.  They have many new features, including a new curved-front design and LED controls.  We are confident that these styles and features will appeal to customers to be another way to make Lowe's the destination store for major appliance purchases. Electrolux is just one example of how we continue to enhance our offering across all categories, and provide a better selection for products customers want to purchase.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, we're continuing to see dramatic differences in performance.  We had six regions with double-digit negative comps in the quarter and four with double-digit negative comps for the year. For the quarter and the year, our four worst-performing regions were in California, Florida, and the Gulf Coast.  Also on a slightly positive note, we did see an improvement in the fourth quarter comp performance of our Florida and our Gulf Coast regions.  While comps are still double-digit negative in both, the run rate in the fourth quarter was better than the year-to-date numbers. Those four worst-performing regions reduced total company comps by over 2% for the fourth quarter and 2.5% for the year.</p>
          <p>Contrasting those markets, we saw relatively better comp performance in our North Central and South Central divisions.  For the quarter, we had positive comps in two of our 22 regions, which included areas of Texas and Oklahoma, and those same two regions had positive comps for the year.  In addition, one region in the North Central division had flat comps for fiscal 2007.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the fourth quarter, we had 314 positive comping stores and 25 stores that posted double-digit positive comps.  But in the end as, Robert mentioned, while some regions are performing much worse than others, we did see erosion in comps across many areas of the country in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>The results of our installed sales and special order sales initiatives continued to be pressured by the weakness in bigger ticket and more complex projects, as we have described in the past.  That weakness is more pronounced in the most pressured housing markets.  In fiscal 2007, both programs had growth in total sales but comp sales fell slightly below the company average.  For the year, installed sales remained approximately 6% of our total sales and special order sales were approximately 8% from your 9% last year.  Contrasting that weakness has been the relative strength in our commercial sales business.  For the quarter and the year, both comps and total sales growth outpaced the company average.</p>
          <p>Our efforts to build relationships and serve the needs of repair and remodelers, property maintenance professionals, and professional tradespeople continued to drive results. In the past year, we posted CBC comp increases in 11 out of 20 merchandising categories.  Our comp transactions per CBC were positive for the year but average ticket was down, driven by the decline in sales of lumber and building materials.  We feel that our continued focus on the segments that have the greatest opportunity and we'll produce growth in 2008.</p>
          <p>Measuring relative performance is always important and in a difficult sales environment it becomes even more so.  Encouragingly, we gained market share in the quarter and in fiscal 2007, evidenced by third-party share of market statistics.  Continued strong market share gains shows that we're providing great service and value to customers and we also feel this is evidenced by the industry consolidation as the pressure of the cycle causes competitors to exit.</p>
          <p>While our fourth quarter comps fell short of our expectations, we did achieve some milestone in the quarter.  We opened our first stores outside the US in December and we now have seven stores operating in the greater Toronto market.  Customers in Canada have given us a warm welcome even in the cold months of winter, and while its obviously very early we are extremely pleased with the sales trends in our stores. I would like to thank the team that's worked for over two years to ensure a successful launch in Canada, and I'd also like to thank the employees in our Canadian office and stores who have shown incredible enthusiasm and excitement in providing a great store to this new customer base. In addition, we also opened our first store in the state of Vermont in January.  We now have stores in all 50 states, and we still see many opportunities to continue to grow market share in the markets we serve.</p>
          <p>Later this week, we'll be kicking off our annual sales meet with all of our store managers and merchandising teams.  At that meeting, we will highlight some of our successes of the past year and highlight the opportunities in the coming year.  And yes, there are plenty of opportunities.</p>
          <p>As we look out to 2008 and consider how the best address the difficult sales environment we expect to face, we are doing several things to maximize sales, capture share and grow profitable.  First, we built what we believe to be a relatively conservative plan.  Frankly, the way 2007 unfolded, perhaps the best way to describe it is we chased sales down and probably remained a little heavy on expenses through the first half of the year.  We know it's harder to cut from an expense plan than it is to add, so we are planning a more conservative build into the spring season this year versus how we staffed in the past years.  Now some might think the staffing plan could affect service levels should sales outpace our plan, but I'm confident we have the ability to add the hours we need to provide great service if sales ramp quicker than we expect.</p>
          <p>In addition, Lowe's has always been a centrally managed company.  We value the discipline and consistency that comes with that structure and we've built a regional and district support structure to ensure that happens.  As we further penetrate the US market, shortening the average distance between our stores, we've decided to increase the number of stores in a district from eight to an average of nine.  We are also increasing the number of stores on average in a region from 69 to 75.  I'm confident we will continue to have the oversight we need from district managers and regional vice presidents to ensure consistent application of our policies and procedures under this evolving model.  Plus, by expanding the size of the average district and region in 2008, we estimate that we'll save approximately $10 million through a combination of cost avoidance and true expense reductions.</p>
          <p>On the merchandising side, we continue to enhance our offering to customers, but with awareness that in many markets customers are more focused on maintenance versus enhancement and they are looking for great value regardless of the price point.  We are calling this "innovation at a value," and we are working closely with our vendors to deliver this strategy.  We are also going to continue to diligently manage our seasonal inventory to ensure we maximize sales, but minimize markdowns.  Our goal is to be out when the season is over.</p>
          <p>A similar awareness to market differences will cover our advertising plan this year.  We are focused on highlighting key maintenance projects and inexpensive enhancements in markets suffering through the biggest slowdown in housing while continuing to highlight larger projects in less impacted markets.</p>
          <p>Expense management is very important in times like this.  Bob will provide a few specifics in a minute, but we have and will cut expenses where we can without sacrificing customer service.  Opportunities present themselves all over the store, from renegotiated purchases of register tape and plastic shopping bags to a reduction in unneeded or redundant signage.  We continue to identify ways to cut costs that will not be noticed by customers.</p>
          <p>Finally, we looked critically at our capital plan for 2008.  We reexamined every store in our pipeline and made the decision to reduce our 2008 new store openings by approximately 20 stores.  Most of these 20 stores were planned for high growth markets like California and Florida, where current conditions suggest sales may fall short of our original forecasts.  We know these markets will recover and we'll be ready to add stores when the time is right, but are going to delay some of them until conditions improve.</p>
          <p>Also, our commitment to reinvest in our existing store base remains strong, but we have decided to pull back of what we call major re-merchandising projects in 2008.  Routine maintenance will continue at the same pace, and we will continue to make sure that we deliver a bright, clean, easy-to-shop store with great merchandise.  This is part of what differentiates Lowe's and that will not change, but we are working to ensure we are putting capital to use in ways that drive the best return, both short-term and long-term.  I want to make sure it's clear that nothing we've seen in the current environment has materially changed our long-term view of the industry, and in fact over the next three to five years we are likely to be able to just finish stores as we planned a year or so ago.  These openings will just be delayed in certain markets until conditions improve.</p>
          <p>I said it earlier, but I think it's worth repeating:  Our plan for 2008 acknowledges the challenges we face this year and we are making decisions based on that reality, and as a company I feel we have been proactive versus reactive.</p>
          <p>I want to conclude by making sure it's clear that we are also working to ensure we position the company for the opportunities to come, those that will be available to us when the cycle passes.  The past 18 months has been extremely tough in the home improvement industry.  In fact, in my 38 years in this industry, I can only recall one other time, in the mid 70s, that we have experienced so many headwinds.  While I am not suggesting my experience and experience of the rest of the Lowe's management team, which averages 17 years at the Senior Vice President level and above, ensures we won't make the mistakes, it certainly gives us some perspective.</p>
          <p>Clearly Lowe's has made more correct decisions through the past cycles than bad ones evidenced by our success.  But I can remember a few instances where we reacted to the near-term cycle and we are not in the best position when the cycle ended.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a couple of examples.  In past slowdowns, we added many different products that did not fit into the home improvement channel.  It sounds crazy today, but we added everything from bicycles and sporting goods to toys.  While we generated some sales, at the end of the day we never made any money and just created confusion for customers.  We have avoided that pitfall in this cycle.</p>
          <p>In the past, I have watched us make real estate decisions and store size decisions that were not best for long-term growth, and decisions that we later regretted.  While we are reducing our expansion plans for 2008, we have matured as a company and we are making sure that we are positioned for longer term growth.  The same can be said for our remerchandising efforts.  While we are committed to having the best stores in the industry, we feel the prudent business decision is to decrease number of major re-merchandising projects from 116 in '07 to approximately 80 projects in 2008.  As I stated earlier, our minor reset program will continue with basically the same number of projects we had in 2007.</p>
          <p>We are fighting on two fronts: maximizing results in the environment we face for the next several quarters, and positioning the company for longer term opportunity ahead.  Eventually, the housing market will turn around, and I'm confident that the decisions we are making are the right decisions for our customers and our shareholders.  While no one enjoys a slowdown, I can say that it's been an educational process for many, a chance to critically analyze everything we do and it will make Lowe's a stronger company in the future.  Our centralized structure, paired with knowledgeable and hard working people at all levels of the organization, capped off with the best stores in the industry, ensure we'll maximize every opportunity.</p>
          <p>Thanks for your attention and I'll now turn the call over to Bob Hull to review the financials.  Bob?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Larry and good morning everyone.  Sales for the fourth quarter were $10.4 billion, representing a slight decrease over last year's fourth quarter.  For the year, sales increased 2.9% to $48.3 billion.  Comp sales were negative 7.6% for the quarter, which is below our guidance of negative 3 to 5%.  Building materials deflation in the quarter was offset slightly by lumber inflation.  Net impact to comps on the fourth quarter was negative 25 basis points.  Looking at the monthly trends, comps were negative 4% in November, negative 9% in December, and down 11% for January.  For the year, comp store sales were negative 5.1%.</p>
          <p>In Q4, total customer count increased 3.8%, but average ticket decreased 3.9% to $64.06.  For the quarter, comp transactions declined 3.3% and comp average ticket decreased 4.2%.  For the year, total customer count increased 5.9%, but average ticket decreased 2.8% to $67.05.  For 2007, comp transactions declined 1.8% while comp average ticket decreased 3.3%.</p>
          <p>With regard to product categories, the categories that performed above average in the fourth quarter include rough plumbing, hardware, paint, lighting, seasonal living, outdoor power equipment, lawn and landscape products, and appliances.  In addition, rough electrical and home environment performed at approximately the overall corporate average.</p>
          <p>For the year, the categories that performed above average include rough plumbing, hardware, paint, lighting, nursery, lawn and landscape, fashion plumbing and appliances.  In addition, outdoor power equipment performed at approximately the overall corporate average.</p>
          <p>Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 34.9%, which was a 56 basis points decrease comparing with Q4 2006.  The decrease in gross margin was attributable to a number of factors, including seasonal clearance, markdowns related to reset activity, and to a lesser degree commodity pricing pressures.  The commodity pricing issue is a function of the timing of cost increasing for products relative to the timing of changes in retail prices.  These items were slightly offset by sales mix and lower inventory shrink.  For the year, gross margin of 34.6% represents an increase of 12 basis points over 2006.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A for Q4 was 24% of sales and deleveraged 153 basis points driven by store payroll and fixed costs.  As sales per store decline, additional stores are hitting the minimum hours threshold, which increases the proportion of fixed to total payroll.  For the quarter, store payroll expense deleveraged 71 basis points.  Also, lower sales volumes in the quarter caused deleverage in expense lines containing fixed costs.  Specifically, utilities deleveraged 21 basis points, rent 15 basis points, property taxes 11 basis points in the quarter.  Lastly, bonus expense deleveraged slightly in Q4.</p>
          <p>In an environment where rising delinquencies and losses are much discussed, I would like to give you an update on our proprietary credit program.  Our partner, GE Money, manages the account and owns the receivables.  Our agreement has us paying some of the expenses directly like promotional financing and interest, gives us some limited exposure to losses and allows us to participate in the portfolio profits.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we planned for higher money costs and losses and these items came in close to plan for both Q4 and the year.  Offsetting these increased costs, cardholder income was higher than planned allowing us to realize higher portfolio profits.  For the year, SG&amp;A was 21.8% of sales and deleveraged 103 basis points to 2006 driven primarily by store payroll and fixed expenses.</p>
          <p>Depreciation at 3.6% of sales totaled $370 million and deleveraged 60 basis points for the quarter.  This deleverage was driven by 15% growth in fixed assets and negative comp sales.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, defined as gross margin less SG&amp;A and depreciation, decreased 269 basis points in the fourth quarter to 7.3% of sales.  For fiscal 2007, operating margin decreased 126 basis points from last year to 10%.  For the quarter, store opening costs of 61 million deleveraged 12 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  In the fourth quarter, we opened 72 new stores including the first six stores in Canada.  This compares to 58 new stores in Q4 last year.</p>
          <p>Interest expense at $47 million deleveraged 3 basis points as a percent of sales.  Interest expense was lower than forecasted due to capitalized interest.  We reviewed our accounting policy related to the capitalized interest.  As a result, we capitalized more interest than expected, reducing interest expense for the quarter by approximately $23 million or $0.01 a share.  For the quarter, total expenses were 28.6% of sales and deleveraged 228 basis points.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax earnings were 6.3% of sales for the quarter and 9.3% for 2007.  The effective tax rate was 37.5% for the quarter and 37.7% for the year.  Earnings per share for the quarter of $0.28 was within our guided range of 25 to $0.29, but decreased 30% versus last year's $0.40.  For 2007, earnings per share of $1.86 decreased 6.5% from 2006's $1.99.</p>
          <p>Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 1.48 billion for the quarter.  The computation of diluted shares takes into account the effect of convertible debentures, which increased fourth quarter weighted average shares by 21 million.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 14.1 million shares at an average price of $23.02 for a total repurchase amount of $325 million.  For the year, we repurchased 76.4 million shares at an average price of $29.79 for a total repurchase amount of almost $2.3 billion.  We have $2.2 billion remaining share repurchase authorization.</p>
          <p>Now, to a few items on the balance sheet.  Our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the quarter was $281 million.  Inventory turnover, calculated by taking a trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for the last five quarters, was 4.06, a decrease of 21 basis points from Q4 2006.  Our fourth quarter inventory balance increased $467 million or 6.5% versus Q4 last year.  The majority of this increase was from new stores.  Distribution inventory was also off slightly.  Comp store inventory was down 3.2% from last year.  At the end of the fourth quarter, we owned 87% of our stores versus 86% at the end of fourth quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Our debt-to-total capital was 29.3% compared with 22% for Q4 last year.  This increase was due to the $1.3 billion of senior unsecured bonds issued in the third quarter, and almost 1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding at year-end.  Return on invested capital, measured using our trailing four quarters' earnings plus tax adjusted interest divided by average debt and equity for the past five quarters decreased 319 basis points for the quarter to 13.9%.  Return on assets, determined using our trailing four quarters' earnings divided by the average assets for the last five quarters, decreased 226 basis points to 9.4%.  At the end of the quarter, lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR was 1.46 times.</p>
          <p>Looking at the statement of cash flows, for the year cash flow from operations was $4.3 billion, a 3% decrease from 2006, driven by the 10% decline in net earnings.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in Lowe's business outlook.  In constructing our 2008 plan, we've attempted to take into account the external factors influencing the consumer and our business, the competitive landscape, and the internal initiatives that Larry described.  We have built what we feel is a prudent plan given this environment.</p>
          <p>We expect a first quarter sales increase of approximately 2%, which will incorporate the comp sales decline of 5 to 7%.  The comp outlook of down 5 to 7 is an improvement from Q4's trends, but we feel this is achievable based on what we've seen to start the quarter and, using April 2007 comparisons, where the first two weeks had negative 19% comps due to severe weather.  We plan to open 21 new stores in the quarter, 4 stores in February, 4 stores in March, and 13 stores in April.</p>
          <p>Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, for the first quarter are expected to decrease by approximately 170 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.  The biggest driver of the decline in EBIT is deleverage in store payroll as we maintain customer service levels in a negative comp sales environment.  In addition, we expect deleverage in depreciation, bonus, utilities, property taxes and rent expenses in Q1.  For the quarter, interest expense is expected to be approximately $81 million.</p>
          <p>The income tax rate is forecasted to be 38% for the year.  We expect earnings per share of 38 to $0.42, which represents a decline of 12 to 21% over last year's $0.48.  For 2008, we expect to open approximately 120 stores, resulting in an increase in square footage of approximately 8%.  Our 2008 store expansion plan is more evenly balanced across the year relative to the 2007 opening schedule.  As a result, the average new store will be open one month sooner in 2008 compared to 2007 new store openings.</p>
          <p>We are estimating 2008 comp sales to be negative 5 to 6% and the total sales increase to be approximately 3%.  For the fiscal year, we are anticipating an EBIT decline of approximately 180 basis points.  The decrease is higher for the year relative to the first quarter due to cycling last year's self-insurance adjustment in Q3 2007.  For 2008, interest expense is expected to be approximately $273 million.  The sum of these inputs could yield earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.58, which represents a decrease of 15 to 19% from 2007.</p>
          <p>For the year, we are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $4.5 million or about 4% higher than 2007.  Our capital plan for 2008 is approximately $4.2 billion with roughly 350 million funded by operating leases, resulting in cash capital expenditures of approximately $3.8 billion.  Our guidance for 2008 does not assume any share repurchases.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Your first question comes from Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  I guess my question goes to the guidance and I know you've talked about it being appropriately conservative, but I'm trying to reconcile the guidance with the comments still that you expect to see some headwinds abate as the year unfolds and obviously the tougher, the easier comparisons happen is you get against the end of 2007 and even against the end of 2006.  So, Robert or Bob, could you give us some feeling on that and as to the comps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, I'll start, and then I'll let Bob get into the details.  Certainly, the fourth quarter, the actual comp was weaker than we anticipated.  If you look at the comp guidance for the first quarter and for the fiscal year '08, we are expecting better comps than we had coming out of the fourth quarter.  If you look at the unknowns that are out there, certainly there is the stimulus package, how impactful is that going to be, when we look at the credit markets and what's taking place out there in the credit markets, how much more deterioration potentially do we have from there. And we do have obviously easier comparisons in the back half of the year, but certainly we've got some things we are cycling up against like Bob mentioned in his comments with the self insurance reserve adjustment that we had out there.</p>
          <p>So, we've tried to take all that into account and build the guidance, but yet be somewhat conservative we believe because we've been a little bit surprised both in Q3 and Q4 in the weakness that we've had out there and as Larry said in his comments by building a more conservative plan hopefully we continue to make sure that we have our payroll and our other costs right in the store so that if the environment is better than we anticipate because of either the Fed rate cuts, stimulus package, cycling easier comparisons, moving further through the housing cycle, getting closer to the trough, any of those things, then we can try and feed into that demand versus trying to be in more of a reactive mode where we are reacting and trying to pull back and chase those volumes down.</p>
          <p>So, Bob, I will let you add anything on top of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Budd, when you look at the comp guidance of negative 5 to 6%, the midpoint is negative 5.5.  So, we are implying that the comps for 2008 will actually be worse than 2007's reported negative 5.1%.  We do feel like we got an opportunity in the spring based on the tough April of last year where we had negative 10% comps, really driven by the poor performance in the first two weeks.  Now, some of that came to us in the second quarter last year so we have tough comparisons and the second quarter of last year was only negative 2.6% comps.  We -- our plan does contemplate slightly improving performance in the back half of the year, really because of easy comparisons, some of the markets improving, as well as some potential benefit from the stimulus package and the lower interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, just as a follow-up, can you maybe parse your comp so far based on, and I know you haven't done this, but maybe you can give us a feel, project business versus kind of everyday kind of purchases.  I know projects are where you are really feeling most of the impact -- or I think you would suggest you are feeling most of the impact, and maybe if you could quantify that differential for us, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I won't be able to quantify the differential at this point.  I can tell you that we've seen relative strength in the smaller ticket purchases, some of the traffic-driving items that we've done in the fourth quarter, the innovation at a value that Larry described. We are seeing pretty good performance from a relative standpoint.  As you might expect, our worst-performing categories are in the biggest ticket categories &#x2013; cabinets, millwork, and flooring to a lesser degree.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.  It's Dan Binder.  Couple of questions for you.  One, can you give us an idea of how many of the stores you are building this year are in California and Florida?  And, then, two, given the increased defaults in the credit card portfolio, what are you seeing in terms of availability of credit to your customers and where is that penetration today and what are you building in for your expectations in the coming year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, this is Bob.  I'll start with the second part of the question.  One of the things when we think about our credit portfolio is, we are not aggressively chasing the business for the past couple of years.  We had a very prudent growth strategy that allowed us to gradually increase the mix of proprietary credit to total sales. As it relates to extending credit to consumers, we've not had any change in our approach and our approval levels are relatively constant, '07 from prior years.  We do have good transparency into GE's delinquency trends, collection effectiveness and losses. Hopefully, this allows us to have very good visibility and be out front of any potential impacts.  We have planned for some additional losses in 2008; that is contemplated in our 2008 plan.  But, we don't see any dramatic changes in our credit portfolio going forward.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Dan, it's Robert Niblock.  For California and Florida, you are looking at about, approximately 20 stores is in the plan currently for 2008.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I had a longer term question.  It sounds like you are prudently taking a pretty hard look at capital and expenses, districts, regions, re-merchandising plans and whatnot for '08. How does -- how are you thinking about the duration of this cycle at this point and what's some of the work you've done looking at home prices in past cycles? What are you thinking about beyond 2008, and do you care to revisit your 2010 outlook that you went over I guess it was last September -- it was 8 to 11% top-line growth and 12 to 15% EPS growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the last question, Colin.  At this point in time, we are not going to revisit our 2009-2010 assumptions.  I think longer term, as Larry described, there probably is an opportunity to build just as many stores in the next three to five years as we thought about last year.  But, we are trying to think about and get through 2008 at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, it's Robert Niblock. I think when you look at all of the data that's out there as far as when the trough will occur and those type things, I think there is a kind of -- it looks like it's moved out some.  Obviously, there is a chance it can still move further.  Right now, when you look at some of the projections that are out there, it puts you at a trough somewhere maybe around the third quarter of '08 is when the biggest part of the markets have entered the, troughed out, and you start to see some recovery, but then you still have other markets that are still toughing.  So, overall, we wouldn't be looking to even probably begin a recovery till -- at least the first part of '09 based on what we are seeing today.  So, we would certainly expect '09 to be better than what we are seeing -- what we are projecting in '08.  But, as Bob said, until we get a little further out, we really aren't prepared to update that long-term guidance we've given for '09 or for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And, just as a quick follow-up on that, you did mention that you had seen some kind of bottoming in some places.  It sounded like maybe Florida, California.  What did you see in those particular small markets -- those individual markets when you did see the bottoming?  Did you see comps go flat or did you actually see just a slower decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, this is Larry Stone, I will answer that one.  The comps were still double-digit negative for the year.  The comment in the fourth quarter, we did see an improvement over the previous three quarters for the year.  And, if you look at it, if you try to dissect the business, there was really no one particular product category or categories that drove it.  It's just kind of a general improvement across basically all categories, but nothing really significant. But there again you are always looking for rays of hope and certainly looking at that, we did think that was significant to mention about the fourth quarter.  But, the Florida stores and the California stores and certainly the Gulf Coast stores are still stores that we have been having struggles with.  But, hopefully, those will start to turn around as we get later in the year and hopefully by '09 those markets will start to trend back to where they were in the past years.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Colin, I think Larry's comment was specifically with regard to what we are seeing in the Florida and California markets, that had some of the worst or some of the toughest housing price declines and some of the toughest comps that we have seen over the past several quarters.  So...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just have a longer term -- relatively longer term question as well.  The home improvement sector from a price perspective has been a little more rational than (44;40) retail.  As you've seen sales weaken relatively significantly since the earlier part of this year, has price competition become any more of an issue within your space, and I guess also related to that you've laid out some of the expense leverage opportunities you have.  Could you -- are there levers you could pull on your own advertising whether it be pricing or even non-pricing advertising as you look into 2008?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, this is Larry Stone, I will start on the answer.  Certainly, we monitor the competitive landscape on basically a daily, weekly basis.  We haven't noticed anything that gave us any concern in the fourth quarter.  Certainly, we looked at our advertising versus the competition we compete with in this sector and we didn't see anything that gave us any real concerns about a pricing battle shaping up.  We think there is still business out there; we think that everybody is taking a more rational approach to capturing that business and our advertising plans are solid for 2008. We know what we are going to do and when we want to do it and certainly we think there is a lot of opportunity to still gain market share, the way we go to market with our plans.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Thanks guys.  Two questions.  One, just on the commodity pricing, you said you are seeing little bit of a lag on when that gets passed through right now.  And, so, is that normal, is that what you've seen in the past or are you seeing that lag because consumers are being a little bit more hesitant to be able to pass through the prices?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, it's Larry Stone, I will start.  On the commodity pricing, a lot of times, when you are in a, especially when you get into lumber and some another categories like pipe and copper cable and so forth, a lot of -- the way that we are so up-to-date on our costs and so forth, sometimes the market will not allow you go up if people have not got their current cost into their systems.  In some cases, you've got to kind of wait for a week or 10 days or even a couple of days in some cases to take those prices up to the current replacement cost.  That's always been a norm in our business.  Years ago, when we were selling a lot of lumber and building materials, it was always a norm to compete with the smaller folks in that business.  So, that's been something that's has been ongoing forever in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, it's not any different in this kind of environment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, then, one more question if I could?  Bob, you said that the guidance assumes no share buybacks.  Does that mean you are not planning on doing any more buybacks or you just haven't put that in the plan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are no share repurchases in the plan.  We've talked in the past about maintaining a strong capital structure.  In today's environment, maintaining an A1/P1 commercial rating is extremely important, making sure there's good access to capital.  We are continuing to evaluate our capital structure.  We've talked to you about maintaining a guardrail of 1.4 times lease-adjusted debt-to-EBITDAR, we were slightly above that in the fourth quarter at 1.46 times.  So, we will continue to monitor the environment. We'll continue to evaluate our strategy regarding capital structure.  But, at this point in time, we are focusing on investing in the business, 120 new stores, and then whatever excess capital we have will be returned to shareholders.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I guess to follow-up on that, Bob, the CapEx number that I think you gave is 3.8 billion, looks relatively unchanged from the October or September meeting, but there is 20 less stores.  Can you just describe why that is or the timing of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a few items causing that.  First, we had some items slip from 2007 into 2008, about $80 million or so.  Second, as you would expect, building costs are going up related to cement and steel, as well as increased fuel prices, which means increased costs of getting the goods to our sites.  In addition, we expect to have even a more balanced opening schedule in 2009, ideally 50% in the first half, 50% in the second half and to be able to accomplish that we need to procure that land in 2008 to make that come together.  So, really those three factors are driving relatively same the CapEx outlook now versus September on a lower store base.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, this is Robert Niblock.  When you think about it, when we reduced the number of stores that we're opening this year, a number of those were originally slated for the fourth quarter.  They may have moved out to the first quarter of '09, so you'll still expend part of that capital, as Bob said, this year, but we do save some of the grand opening and the other costs associated with opening that store by pushing that out to the first quarter.  So, we shift those costs from '08 to '09, but a good part of the capital still gets spent in '08.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then a second question. I noticed the commercial paper you did in the fourth quarter, Bob, what's the strategy of now having commercial paper as part of the capital structure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is really, Greg, about managing the capital structure.  We're managing to the 1.4 times lease-adjusted debt to EBITDAR guardrail and that's just part of the strategy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, and good morning.  As you took down your square footage growth by about 20 stores this year and you've emphasized that that's something that you want to come back to later when the market gets better.  Could you take us through the -- your thought process there?  Is it that the new store productivity is getting hit right now and you expect that to return back to a higher level and perhaps what that level -- what that expectation is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you all think about it, Chris, this is Robert Niblock, I mean, in a lot of these markets where we're going into, they were very higher growth markets and we were trying to store and stay ahead of that growth.  And with what's taking place in the housing environment, you've seen that growth in that market slow dramatically.  I mean we were going in and obviously having a significant hit on cannibalizing existing stores, trying to stay ahead of that growth.  The market has now slowed so the comps in those existing stores have now slowed so you'd be going in and cannibalizing those stores running at a much lower volume than you had originally anticipated when you were bringing in that additional store.</p>
          <p>So, we're going in, taking a hard look at those markets that have been hardest hit and we're saying let those -- let the market recover and let the volumes in the store recover before we're ready to come in and cannibalize, and that's going to be a pushed out probably a couple of years.  So, that's why we, in many cases, shifted these stores out either a few quarters or possibly even a couple of years depending on how hard the market was hit and how heavily we have the markets, those particular market stored previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, are you -- with these stores that you, you present it this way because you want to have the option later of coming back to those 20 stores in investors' minds, but is it truly definite that we will come back to and bring those stores in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a few of the stores where we've canceled at this point in time, we'll come back at look at the market later.  There is others where we've just delayed the closing on the site out a few quarters because we think it just takes more quarters for that market to respond.  So, it is not one factor that we use, we do on a market by market basis, and also look at how tough is it to get sites in those markets, how well we're stored in those markets, there is a whole number of factors that went into each and every decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you.  And then as a follow-up, on the gross margin, Bob, could you possibly talk about what the outlook is in gross margin for the -- this upcoming year and if there is any particular factors that we should be thinking about in any particular quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  If you look at 2007, gross margin was up for the year but it's pretty lumpy quarter by quarter.  We had a 56 basis point decline in Q4 against tough Q4 '06 comparisons where margin was up 41 basis points.  So, we do expect gross margin to be up in 2008 but again it will be lumpy quarter by quarter and we expect gross margin to be down slightly in the first quarter of 2008.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris this is Robert.  Just to reiterate one of the points from Larry's comments earlier, that we still have the same long-term outlook for the market.  We're still looking at longer term for the North American market, 24- to 2,500 stores, that has not changed.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the gross margin comment that was just made in regards to growth in 2008, can you give a little bit of insight into what might drive that gross margin expansion?  And then, I guess I would especially be interested within that what you're seeing in terms of sourcing costs within your direct import side of the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, this is Larry Stone.  Certainly, we will continue to use Lowe's global sourcing to help us on our gross margin expansion.  We think that's still got a lot of potential to grow and to source products from overseas and bring better value to customers at a lower price.  So, that certainly figures in all the decisions we make in terms of how we look at markets.</p>
          <p>We think, longer-term, there is still potential for margin to go up, albeit not as much as we had in the past, and there is lot of different things we're doing from retail markdown optimization the way that we'd really go in and optimize or markdowns as we cycle through products, to doing a much better job with our productivity in the stores with the way that we take products to market.  So, there is a lot of different leverage that we're looking at and ways that we can continue to work on our gross margin and certainly at our sales meeting this week we'll be discussing that with our store management teams.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, specifically two items we think are going to help drive gross margin for the year, as Larry said, we think there are still import opportunities, one.  And two, as I described in our fourth quarter performance we took a bit of hit because of seasonal merchandise.  We think we'll do a better job in 2008 with seasonal merchandise which should aid our margins for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess secondly, related to that in terms of inventories, and I know you commented that the growth is all new store related, but is there a material opportunity with inventories with structurally some of the things that you've done and also considering the environment in 2008 to make some changes there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We think long term, there is opportunities to be more productive with inventory.  It's very hard to be productive when you are forecasting comps of negative 5 to 6%. Long term, we feel, yeah we can be more productive with inventory, but coming off six quarters negative comps forecasting a year of negative comps it's tough to be too aggressive from the inventory standpoint.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Luanne, I think we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Sir, your final question comes from Steve Chick with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi thanks.  I guess first off Bob, and it relates to the store productivity question.  It looks like for this year you've been below your 80% target and in your '08 guidance, if I have my math right to get to 3% sales growth, it looks like it -- I know you are opening up less net new stores but it looks like you are assuming productivity will be back up to 80% for this year, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing that drives the improved store productivity is the acceleration in the store opening schedule.  So, if you think about the average of 120 stores opening a month sooner, that's quite a bit of sales weeks and months gained, which helps contribute to the improved new store productivity relative to the 72% or so we had for 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right.  And I am sorry if I missed this, but with your comp guidance for the first quarter and being down 11% for the month of January, the last month of this past quarter, I had that that month was actually a very easy year-over-year comparison.  Did you say, have you seen an improvement so far at the beginning of the quarter we're in, what are you seeing that gives you comfort that the sales rebound like from where they ended the quarter at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, in my comments I noted two factors; one was what we've seen so far to start the quarter, so we hadn't seen improved performance at the start of February relative to January performance.  In addition, we had negative 10% comps in April 2007 with the first two weeks negative 19% due to severe weather.  So, really those two factors contribute to our outlook of negative 5 to 7% comps in Q1 relative to negative 7.6% in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, I am sorry, so you have seen a pretty improvement from the January trend so far in February?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then last Bob, the interest expense guidance for the year, if I took these down right, you are expecting 81 million for the first quarter, and then is it 273 million for the whole year, that's a pretty big increase in the first quarter.  I guess you're going to -- the idea is, your excess free cash flow will pay down debt as the year goes on?  I mean can you just walk through that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we do expect to pay down the level of commercial paper outstanding throughout the year.  In addition, we've got some modest debt maturities $60 million or so that's a little bit higher interest rate.  Those are a couple factors that could contribute to having a little bit heavier interest expense in Q1 relative to the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.</p>
