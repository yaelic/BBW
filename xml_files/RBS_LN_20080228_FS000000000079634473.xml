          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our Annual Results presentation. 2007 was quite a year in banking, but it's been a very good year for RBS. Our businesses are performing very well and delivered a record group operating profit of &#x20A4;10.3 billion, up 9%. Adjusted earnings per share were up 18% to 78.7 and the board increased the dividend by 10% to &#x20A4;33.2 for the full year. So, very good operating performance. In addition to that, we acquired ABN AMRO together with our friends in Fortis and Santander. Now you'll hear a good deal more about that and what it means for the group going forward from Fred and Johnny Cameron.</p>
          <p>But first I would like to hand over to Guy to take you through the results in more detail. Guy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much Tom, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. 2007 was a very strong year for the Group. Operating profit at &#xA3;10.282 billion is up 9%. The profit attributable to shareholders rose by 18% to just over &#xA3;7.3 billion. Adjusted earnings per share rose by a similar amount. Our return on equity increased to 19.9% and our Tier 1 capital ratio at the end of the year was 7.3%. These results incorporate many strong performances across many of our businesses.</p>
          <p>They also incorporate the 76 days that we acquired ABN and they incorporate a number of moving parts and what I would like to do is run through the results on RBS excluding ABN on a business as usual basis, look at some of the unusual items, which occurred throughout 2007, talk a little bit about the ABN business that we acquired and then hand over to Fred, who will talk about the enlarged Group, the revised organizational structure and the outlook.</p>
          <p>Group income grew by 3% in 2007, principally driven by a 7% rise in net interest income as margins across the group stabilized or in some cases even widened. Our costs were brought down by one percentage point and our cost income ratio fell, for I think, a record low of 40.7% down 1.4 points.</p>
          <p>We saw a stable corporate credit environment. We saw declining UK impairments. We saw a slight up tick in impairments in the United States, but overall our risk elements in lending fell from 1.57 to 1.49% and credit costs declined 1% to &#xA3;1.86 billion. As a result, our profits rose by &#xA3;884 million or 9% to just under &#xA3;10.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Once again, I think, these results demonstrated the strength, the flexibility and diversity of the business model that we operate. There were good performances within all of our divisions and there were some particularly strong collective performances in UK corporate banking in the retail division and wealth management and in Ulster.</p>
          <p>And I'll now walk through each of those divisions. Many areas of our Global Banking &amp; Markets division had a very good year indeed. We saw a 33% up lift in fees on origination and distribution of loans and bonds. We saw a 67% growth in our combined rates and currencies business. We saw almost doubling of income and profits in Asia, a 39% year-over-year improvement in Europe, building on a long succession of a growth in these markets.</p>
          <p>We also took advantage of very favorable market conditions to realize a number of gains and disposed a variety of assets throughout the year. However, as you can see from the headline numbers these results were held back by the second-half write-downs in the credit markets, absent the extraordinary effect of the gains and the write-downs, the underlying business in global banking grew 10%.</p>
          <p>As we highlighted at the trading statement, we took of number of marks related to credit markets principally in the second half of the year. We remain comfortable with the markets -- marks that we took at the trading statement and we remain so. However, in the light and of the weaker credit profile of some of the monoline financial guarantors that we had exposure to we announced this morning an additional &#xA3;450 million write-down to &#x2013; our exposures to these counter parties.</p>
          <p>So if you take the &#xA3;950 million number that we talked about at the trading statement and add about &#xA3;150 million or so for the first half write-downs that were incorporated in the results that we shared with you back in August and the &#xA3;456 million as of today, you see total write-downs to the credit markets netted out at &#xA3;1.6 billion. If you take the costs associated with these deals out of the profit line, it impacted our profits by about &#xA3;1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>On the positive side the gain on Southern Water, the sale on leaseback, and the sale of our small equity holdings in both London Stock Exchange and MasterCard realized gains of around 1.4 billion and again stripping out the costs and also allowing for some goodwill payments that we've made out of the group centre over the course of the year have added about &#xA3;1.1 billion to our profit. The net effect of these gains and these write-downs impacted the Group operating profit by a positive &#xA3;24 million.</p>
          <p>The slide behind illustrates now the combined exposure that we had as of the end of the year to these instruments and say they were marked at the time of the trading statement and we remain comfortable with the RBS marks that were applied to that portfolio.</p>
          <p>In the year-end review, we looked at the ABN high grade super senior CDO and we took an additional 10 percentage points write-down to that marking down from 90 to 80 and that's incorporated in the weighted average price that you see in the top right hand corner of this page.</p>
          <p>Let's just say the aggregate ABN combined year exposure to both our CDO exposures, all sub-prime inventory, any residual securitization activity, and our leveraged finance book.</p>
          <p>Just heading back into the divisions, UK Corporate Banking had a great year. Profits grew 11% to almost &#xA3;2 billion. It is the leading corporate and commercial bank in the UK. It is relationship driven, top rated for customer service by its clients and gaining market share. We grew income by 8% or just over &#xA3;3.75 billion. We are continuing to invest in the future. You can see from the impairment cost declined very careful management of the risk profile and a business, which once again has delivered the results.</p>
          <p>We saw a very good performance in our UK Retail Banking division, again leading customer satisfaction scores, almost 1 million new accounts added in 2007, the leading position in UK current accounts. The cautious approach to lending, which Gordon has talked to you about over the last year or two, has led to a 9% decline in impairments on a year-over-year basis. On the other hand, we've seen a very strong growth in savings and investments with income there up 14%. Our bank assurance, annualized premium equivalents grew 28%. Our deposit base grew by 11%, again exceeding growth in loans in this particular area. We kept a tight reign on costs and saw improving margins coming through in the second half. Momentum in this business feels strong into 2008.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management saw income rise by 16% to just over &#xA3;1 billion and profits rise by 30% to just over &#xA3;400 million led by growth in our UK private banking and in Asia. Very good mix of business here around 70% of our income derived from banking activities and about 30% comes from investment activities. Assets under management grew 24% over the year. We continue to invest in physical distribution here in the UK and abroad and we continue to be recruiting private bankers with a growth rate of 12% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>It's a similar and quite familiar story now of growth in investment in Ulster Bank, income up 15% to &#xA3;1.3 billion. Profits up 22% to over &#xA3;500 million; good growth on both sides of the balance sheet. Deposits up 17%, mortgage lending up 17% and we're starting to see real momentum coming through on the corporate side of the business there with good growth in capital markets in conjunction with GBM colleagues in Europe and around the world. And good growth in business lending, we saw 29% year-over-year increase in volume. Credit metrics, as evidenced by flat credit costs, remained very strong.</p>
          <p>The Citizens group, I think you would describe it as a resilient performance against a weaker economic backdrop. After a number of years of declines, net interest margins started to widen in 2007, that has led to net interest income growing by about 3 percentage points on fairly modest balance sheet growth. We saw a good progress in our corporate and commercial expansion with lending up 13%. We kept a very tight reign on costs. And profits before impairment lines were up over 5 percentage points. However, I think it's the standout number on the page from historic lows of around 30 basis points. We started to see some rise in impairment costs in 2007 and partly it was due to planned growth in the corporate lending book and in part, of course, related to the weaker housing market and also in the fourth quarter in some considerable part to build our reserves in that business. Overall, the portfolio remains very high quality. Retail customer FICO scores on average are above 700.</p>
          <p>In Insurance, it really was actually a very good result overshadowed by the floods. A very good underlying improvements to the business performance really built around three areas; firstly, much tighter control on costs and improving productivity; secondly, a sharp differentiation between our own brand distribution channels being managed for growth and our partnership distribution channels being managed for profitability and over the course of the year we have exited some of these partner distribution channels.</p>
          <p>And the third element is built around improved risk selection moving away from volumes at any price in what is a very competitive market to looking at segments of the market, which offer more attractive risk and return characteristics. This will be evidenced, although distorted by the flood numbers, our net claims, excluding the floods actually fell by 7 percentage points and I think -- I dare make the pun, weather permitting the outlook for 2008 seems somewhat brighter for this business.</p>
          <p>And Manufacturing, I think is testament to our operating model and almost flat costs, certainly support cost were flat on a year-over-year basis. We continue to invest in technology and in property that led to a 1% overall rise, and I think very much underpinned the growth that we saw right across the Group and a major factor contributing to the 1.4% decline in our cost income ratio that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>At the Group Center, net of goodwill payments, we were the beneficiary of roughly &#xA3;500 million worth of the previously announced gains, the sale and leaseback of some properties, the London Stock Exchange and Master Card and the fair value adjustments to the carrying value of our own debt. The Group Center also benefited from the receipt of about a &#xA3;60 million dividend from the Bank of China and some slightly reduced pension funding costs as our pension fund moved into surplus.</p>
          <p>For the ABN AMRO businesses that we acquired, an operating profit of around &#x20AC;640 million for the year off income of just under &#x20AC;7 billion. It's kind of in line with where we thought they were been, probably slightly ahead of the equivalent number last year. We saw some year-on-year improvements in equities, in rates, in currencies, in some of the local markets activities, we saw a 7% rise in transaction banking. Our international retail customer base grew by about 12 percentage points, but as you have seen from the very earlier slides, an 86% cost-income ratio is something with which we are not familiar at RBS and not surprisingly in the time of ownership we have identified some additional synergies, which Fred will talk about later.</p>
          <p>We ended the year with a balance sheet of &#xA3;609 billion worth of risk-weighted assets, a core Tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, the Tier 1 as I mentioned earlier is 7.3 and total capital of 11.2% consistent with previous guidance that we had given. Our return on equity rose to 19.9%.</p>
          <p>And in summary, before handing over, I think 2007 now categorizes a year of strong organic growth for the Group, improved operating leverage, declining credit costs, increased returns and enhanced opportunity and to talk to you about some of those opportunities, I'll hand over to Fred. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Guy. Good morning, everyone. A lot of moving parts, a lot to absorb and please see something of an accounting fest and in my section this morning I am trying to strike a balance between bringing some context to those and to what's been going on in the group and to give a sense of how we see the future, but also to leave plenty of time for questions at the end because I know that you all have a lot of things that you want to ask. So I am erroring in favor of the latter, so I am going to try and move through the gears here pretty quickly, I am happy to go back over any of this and will pick up any questions at the end. But a few things I think would be helpful, one, starting off with a housekeeping point about the Group structure.</p>
          <p>I know that many of you don't like it when change the Group structure, it doesn't make life easier for your models and your ability to predict what we are doing. To be honest, it doesn't make our life very much easier either and which is why we've stuck pretty much with a Group structure for the last 7 or 8 years now. It served us well, but we have along the way made one or two minor amendments to it, but we've tried to stick pretty much with this. And the world's moved on though and our business is very different now from where it was then and obviously the acquisition of ABN AMRO does make a big difference so with a little reluctance we have moved from historic model to a new model, which of course causes the numbers to change.</p>
          <p>The new model &#x2013; I am going to go through it in any great detail, simply reflecting the fact that we have some genuinely global businesses now. We recognized that a couple of years ago we set out GBM, Global Banking &amp; Markets simplistically as the business that deals with OSEAN growing companies regardless of financial institutions, regardless of where geographically they are based.</p>
          <p>We now have our very significant Global Transactions Services business, which Johnny will talk a little bit about in a minute. Regional markets are all of our other businesses, where the focus on managing them will continue to be regional. RBS Insurance comes through this unscathed and we continue with the very successful manufacturing model, which will cover our global operations.</p>
          <p>I'm not going to go through this slide at all, this is a wiring diagram on net impact on which you will need to begin to make sense of the numbers that we published at the back of the company announcement today. It's restating all of our comparatives along the new lines for 2006 and 2007. We will be working with Richard O'Connor and this team will be happy to work with you to help walk you -- to talk you through this and we will be doing some investor days later in the piece to walk you through, I think all together more importantly the actual businesses, which sit beneath these divisions.</p>
          <p>So, that's all I was going to say on that for now. I want just to give you a quick sense of all these sorts of metrics and dynamics in these business units. They are very big business units moving at some pace as you will see from the slide. Most of the Global Transaction Services, our payments business, our merchant acquiring business will be one of the top three, four in the world and that business punched in just over 1.6 billion profit during 2007. I think a business we have always been in but it's been kind of hidden and obscured and the numbers the ABN were one of the top global participants in that particular activity.</p>
          <p>Acquisition of ABN AMRO, again in the interest of time I am not going to go through all of the clocks and dials about how very single thing is going. I am very happy to answer questions and as I know Mark would be and others. But, I think the main news is that our view of all of the businesses is positive view. The view we had of the ABN businesses has been confirmed. We have a very good engagement with the regulator in the Netherlands and indeed elsewhere and with the staff councils, the works council, they're very good, important relationships in both cases.</p>
          <p>And as we've gone around -- and you'll see bits of this over time that as we've looked at the mechanics of separating out some of parts of business, some of them just the practicalities and the economics of separating some of businesses in some of the countries just don't make sense. You would have seen &#x2013; it was just before the year-end we sold global client Brazil to Santander and transferred it to them for about &#x20AC;750 million, there will be one or two other little things as we go forward, but nothing drastic. And of course, one of the key activities has been validating our business plans, our transition plans and of course the synergies.</p>
          <p>Looking at ABN AMRO, it's probably worth just reminding ourselves as everyone is in a 71, &#x20AC;72 billion figure has been much syndicated and socialized, but it's worth coming back to how we see this from the RBS perspective because we &#x2013; although we bought 38% of the business actually we got &#x2013; the part of what we bought was cash, the sale proceeds of the net of the net assets. So our share consideration is just over &#x20AC;16 billion.</p>
          <p>Our share price came down from the point at which the offer was struck. When the deal was completed, we made the sale of Brazil. So, it brings us around to an acquisition price of about &#xA3;10 billion, which was made of about 25% equity, the rest in cash. Probably just worth having those numbers in your minds, I think that stopping someone in the street would probably have guessed a rather higher number there for what our acquisition cost of ABN AMRO actually was.</p>
          <p>The synergies &#x2013; the cost synergies probably the most &#x2013; the easiest piece to imagine and get your mind around. We've gone in and we've validated the estimates. And remember these estimates were prepared from outside the business, they would prepare them and then we published them and they're actually lower than the equivalent numbers that were mentioned by Barclays. And there is no &#x2013; there haven't been any eureka moments here -- there haven't been gosh we discovered a whole new thing. I think that's probably quite good news, in fact what we've seen are developments of the themes, which were identified initially and an ability to put much more precise figures on them.</p>
          <p>But part of the joy from our point of view is they're all moving rather mundane. Even in the purchasing arena, I can't think of any more mundane purchasing synergy than stationery where we were able to procure stationery at 20% less than ABN AMRO and so it reads across IT, not all 20% in every case, but in hardware, software and a variety of other areas. So nothing in here that's a silver bullet eureka type additional synergy, just routine mundane run of the mill synergies, which I think &#x2013; as I find deeply reassuring. Also I think deeply reassuring and in sharp contrast to the equivalent situation in NatWest there isn't a single huge solution in here.</p>
          <p>You'll remember the many happy hours we spent debating the IT issues around NatWest and so much hung on our ability to make the IT integration work. And here you can pretty much take the synergies and divide them into the total and come away with a sense that there are lots and lots of small things. And so they don't all have to go well and it's unlikely that they would all go well. So, we're confident enough in that number to increase the target today, based on all the work that we've performed.</p>
          <p>The revenue synergy side, always a slightly more nebulous concept I grant you. For the big -- the most obvious piece here is that at the time of the takeover you'll remember we said we didn't make any assumptions about synergies in the retail businesses. We couldn't get our mind very well around the international retail businesses -- the big retail businesses, which there were in Asia. We can do that now and you'll see a big part of the synergy comes simply from that including a synergy where there wasn't one before. Again, considerable confidence around our ability to deliver these synergies and again no big sliver individuals, sliver bullet items, no eureka moments since the bid.</p>
          <p>And somewhat abstracted and theoretical nevertheless, but just had we known no synergies at the time those are how the model matrix would have looked taking what were already very attractive and I think making them even more attractive. Somewhere abstract I grant you.</p>
          <p>Commonsense check in all of this, so supposing we did achieve those synergies, did it take us to a ridiculous place? Well, actually no -- you could argue it'd take us to a not all that impressive of place by achieving all of those synergies and sticking them on top of the 2007 numbers, the underlying 2007 numbers. We only get a 61% cost-income ratio, which doesn't feel to be something that we would be bragging about, but at least from a point of view of validating the synergies, I think, it's a good as test -- as good a crosscheck as any.</p>
          <p>Much wish we could talk about ABN AMRO and as I said I'm very happy to take questions, but in the interest of time we'll just move through it. The outlook and predicting the future is a topic, you know, I always try and avoid and in fact do avoid, but it is quite reasonable and rational that we should all be thinking about the future arguably more so then ever at this particular juncture. What do you want to look at? Well, historically I've looked at these numbers, I'm not going to spend a lot of time looking at these this morning other than to point out the obvious perhaps that you know things do tend to turn out better than you think and this time last year the view in economic growth &#x2013; actually the consensuses view in economic growth turned out to be understated everywhere except in United States.</p>
          <p>So it is the forecast of 2008, as we've progressed through 2007 have moved &#x2013; it's difficult to argue with the fact that we haven't moved in one direction and pulled the blankets over our head and go away and say things are slowing down next year, there's no business to be done. I think there's growth happening and in that respect I think we have moved forward quite a lot in the last year.</p>
          <p>We now have presence in nine of the ten top contributors to GDP growth -- is moved on quite a way. We now have the ABN businesses in China, with 1200 people on our payroll in China, in addition to the relationship in joint venture, we're adding on business units in North America there obviously, but we had clearly a critical mass in the organic growth over the last 7, 8 years, ditto France.</p>
          <p>We have in India has split those numbers maybe 50/50 between the back office ECS function, which ABN AMRO had and our front facing profit generating, profit making customer facing franchise in India, which we're very excited about. And so GDP growth can slowdown and for the rate of growth that we had, but there is still lots of growth are there to go after and we're well represented in the economies, where A)  there is growth and B) there are significantly sized economies.</p>
          <p>Another thought is that all the GDP growth that took place last year, we're active in 91% of -- we have 91% of that available to ourselves by being in the countries where it took place.</p>
          <p>Again, all pretty abstract stuff, you can have your own views about economic forecasts for GDP growth and I haven't attached too much significance to them other than the fact that they're there and they still forecast growth in the coming year. And much better lens though I think is to start to look at our individual businesses. I'm not going to go through all of these. I think in many respects the prospects for next year are sort of linear for lots of these businesses. But an area where I don't think for a moment that it could be described as linear is in a new global markets division. Those are numbers on the -- as we stated to follow the organization structure I introduced a moment or so ago. Anyway I'll just invite Johnny to come forward and talk -- give you just a little bit of sense of the outlook viewed through the global markets lines.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everyone. Like Fred, I will also try to move at a reasonable pace. People often say in markets like this there are lots of opportunities and the thing we have is that we have our opportunity already, which is ABN. Also very well &#x2013; it's good in times like this to have a project and I think I can say with confidence that my colleagues in GBM are a great deal busier than some of our colleagues in other banks at the moment. We have a lot to do and we're getting on with it.</p>
          <p>It's an important opportunity integrating ABN. We've told you before what we're trying to do here. We're trying to exploit the larger customer franchise, the greater geographic reach and a much broader product range. This is a progression of what we were doing in RBS before, but there is no doubt that the ABN acquisition accelerates that very, very significantly. And in particular and something perhaps we haven't highlighted enough yet, is our position now as a real leader in global transaction services. I'll talk about that a little bit more.</p>
          <p>The point I want to leave you with is that we've got much greater diversification at -- in 2008 than we had in 2007 and that leaves us better placed to face the future.</p>
          <p>Let me just run through these points in very briefly. This is the slide of Fred and others used in the acquisition. You've all seen it hundreds of times, I think, it just makes the points that ABN and RBS are coming together in the global banking and markets arena. We are much stronger by product. We are much stronger in geographic terms and we're much stronger in client terms, in terms of the enlarged customer franchise. You've seen it a lot before I'm just putting it up because I want to remind you that is the anchor for what we are trying to do in GBM.</p>
          <p>Global Transaction Services is worth dwelling on a little bit more. This is a slide you haven't seen before. What we are doing in Global Transaction Services is we are bringing together what RBS had, in particular a leading position in merchant acquiring in the UK and in Continental Europe and to a lesser extent through RBS Lynk in America. Taking those merchant acquiring businesses we are taking the domestic money transmission businesses for corporates in Britain and in America. And we are adding that to ABN's very strong position international cash management and trade finance around the world and this is trading a global leader in a business, which has got a very high barriers to entry. It is something that people don't go out and build today. You just can't build a network in 53 countries. You can't put in the IT infrastructure. So we are in a position where we are the top three or four in the world, as Fred says, in this business and a business that others can't easily get into.</p>
          <p>It's a stable business. It's largely deposit income and fee income. It's also very useful as an entry point for GBM products. So it's part of the enlarged customer franchise that we have to work with. We believe that there is far more opportunity that has yet been grasped to sell GBM products into transaction banking class, transaction services clients across the world.</p>
          <p>So this is an important new development. It is a new thing for RBS to have a business like this and I've got high hopes of its synergistic benefits within global transaction services. The synergies are bringing together the RBS bits of it with the ABN bits of it. And there are also important synergies as I said a moment ago with global banking and markets.</p>
          <p>Just an update on market position, as you bring the two bits of GBM together, in 2007 the figures I showed you first were the original slides so they were 2006 numbers. In 2007 in the old debt lead table &#x2013; the lead table I think everyone agrees is the best global table that is all bonds, all loans, all currencies, all countries, where do we rank as an underwriter?</p>
          <p>Putting ABN and RBS together in 2007, we were number three. That's a fantastic position, a fantastic position demonstrating the power of the franchise. And, of course, it's not just the income you earn off of underwriting bonds and loans that is the driver for so much of our other income in derivatives and foreign exchange and so on.</p>
          <p>The other three tables on this chart just remind you where we are in terms of customers again updated for 2007. And the point is that we are in the top five in all the three main regions, I haven't put UK up because obviously, we're number one by distance in the UK. But in continental Europe, we're number one. We're number five in America, number five in Asia, excluding Japan. So this is why we can claim to be the one of the top -- maybe the top one or two banks, corporate banks in the world today, again a demonstration of the power of the franchise that we now have to work with.</p>
          <p>Just turning to the performance of the business in 2007 and looking at &#x2013; just to emphasize this -underlying income as we've defined it and since 2007. You can see here &#x2013; there are two key points to bring out immediately. Diversity, that we have a diverse range of products and diversity of growth. So you can see as we mentioned already that rates and currencies had a very strong year in 2007 in both banks, particularly in RBS perhaps.</p>
          <p>You not surprisingly can see that the securitization asset-backed and CDO's quite significantly down in terms of income. And then the bottom two that rose worth highlighting are underlying asset portfolio management and global transaction services, which are basically stable businesses that's where all the net interest income lies in asset portfolio management and global transaction services as I have emphasized as deposit income and fee income.</p>
          <p>They are very large stable, but growing businesses in the case of global transactions services. So I hope you find that a helpful description of the business we have going into 2008. And of course, in 2008, there is the same slide but you can see at the bottom there, commodities. We still expect to close on acquiring our share of Sempra Commodities on 1st of April. We expect to get the final approvals very shortly indeed. That will add another very significant string to our bow in terms of product diversity, we will then have I think, everything you can possibly you think of and need to be the best corporate bank in the world.</p>
          <p>I look at the outlook like Fred, I'm extremely nervous of forecasting precisely how we will do and I would emphasize really rather than focus on, which is the one tick, which is two ticks so to speak. I'm sure I've got one or two of those wrong, but I'm sure there will be a mixture and that's what gives me confidence. That because of the diversity, we're going to have as good a 2008 as you could expect and indeed better than anyone else.</p>
          <p>Thank you. Back to you Fred.</p>

          <p>Thanks Johnny. If I pick up the theme &#x2013; and say I'm not going to explain you every single line. I'm not going to go through UK retail and commercial banking divisions. You can see very substantially the biggest part of the business, but I think if I leave you with a thought this is a linear progression there in UK corporate bank and in the retail division, linear and good and in the right -- very much in the right direction.</p>
          <p>Touch on the US momentarily, now again I will do the same as Johnny and break out product-by-product, give you sense of what's been going on within the retail and commercial franchise. And just the underlying through the years at Citizens has continued to diversify away from just being a retail deposit taker who lent all money on to the US government. We made a considerable progress now over the last few years and that's reflected in actually some of the income growth that was achieved during 2007 where our commercial lending and deposits business, which is something we have been building up strongly moved ahead in double digits. In terms of income growth, our credit and debit card business moved ahead and sales of investment products rather along the lines that we do it in our UK branch network has moved ahead again in double digit terms.</p>
          <p>Deposit margins have stabilized and indeed margins in Citizens have gone up from, I think, about 2.72 to 2.8. And if we take out one of last year the actual income growth in Citizens was about 4% this year, so quite a good point positive metric and a change of direction from where we've been heading in the last couple of years. Similar to Johnny's chart, there we are spread across 2006, 2007 -- spread across a range of products. In the interest of time I'm not going to go through all of them, &#x2013; not very many of them, but just to echo the points I made a moment ago about commercial lending, commercial deposit taking down at that bottom there seeing good strong progress, continue to move forward in credit and debit cards, but obviously in personal lending coming back as we've reframed our risk appetite.</p>
          <p>Outlook for next year, a bit like Johnny we could argue about an individual tick or two, a cross or two, but there are ticks under our crosses, I think it will remain a mixed picture in the United States going forward. There is no point in chasing risky business or unprofitable business and we've got no intention of doing so. There was enough there in the chart, we feel for us to be going on with particularly in the commercial lending arena. Whereas a result of the acquisition of business unit North America, we take a significant notching up in terms of numbers of customers in that segment. Something we do a lot of in the UK and as a segment, we feel very comfortable in it comprises as you can see from the chart, lending and deposit taking, not to mention the opportunity to sell money transmission and to sell the other products in Johnny's business. One of the big outstanding successes in Citizens has been the growth in selling quite labeled, simple derivative products to do interest rate protection, foreign currency protection to US mid-corporate and commercial customers and even down into the SME customer base.</p>
          <p>Asia, a few moments on Asia. Quite interesting in Asia just to remind ourselves about the business we are talking about here is the retail and commercial piece but within Johnny's businesses is another chunk, which takes us to a place where you know, if we -- if our growth rates in Asia slow down by 50% next year, we will still pass through the billion pounds and profits generated in Asia, which is quite a move forward from where RBS was a little while ago and I wouldn't encourage you to think that we think our growth rates are going to slowdown in Asia next year, I think the reverse.</p>
          <p>What's in that business? Quite an assortment, I think to be kind to it, a variety of branches and a variety of countries, but you'll see and remind yourselves of the slide about &#x2013; earlier about GDP growth around the world. There is no shortage of GDP growth in the countries we are looking at. One of the challenges for us in this business though is that ABN have a vast and complex and rich infrastructure. On the one hand it's nice to be able to provide all of these products and have all of these capabilities in all of these in all these countries and in truth, I think it's a little unrealistic to think that we can achieve scale in all of these countries and all of these products.</p>
          <p>So I think as we go forward, not withstanding our commitment and desire to grow in Asia, we'll be pruning back some of the product capabilities because it is very expensive to maintain and deploy under ground and I doubt whether it's the best use of our time and effort, trying get critical mass in all of these markets and all of these products. But the take away I would encourage you towards is that we have got the delivery mechanisms we need in the economies where we need it to deliver substantial growth in retail and commercial banking in Asia.</p>
          <p>Still on the subject of outlook, well, how would I draw all that together? What would I ask you to hold in different views about the prospects for individual of these business lines. I am sure you'll have different views about individual countries and so on, but in thinking about -- or I think there is a high level take away from all of this. There are number of ingredients to the RBS outlook for 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The first ingredient, I think and I think by far and away that most important, we have existing organic momentum in our businesses and we don't have to start growing organically. We are growing organically and I think as you look at our divisional results you'll see that very clearly. We have a lot of new customers this year. "New" that is to say a lot of ABN AMRO customers are not new to the enlarge entity, but they are new to the RBS product range, they are new to the RBS business model. And it feels very new to us and it contributes a lot to some of the excitement that Johnny was talking about and some of the ambitions we have for the business. And there is lot of people out there that we're very confident about selling to because we have existing relationships with them. And also a lot of new products with -- not just the RBS products to be sold to ABN AMRO customers, but the money transmission business, the global transaction services businesses are new to the RBS customer base and open up a number of opportunities for us to develop deeper and more productive relationships. And we are clearly operating a number of markets, which are new to the Group.</p>
          <p>Leaving aside the generalities of all of the above, we've got some very specific and substantial synergy plans, specific synergy plans, things that we're going to be doing to deliver that growth next year. It's not worth thinking about the growth, we're actually actively engaged and delivering it. It should take me to a place therefore, unequivocally and clearly a theme next year for RBS will be revenue growth. We have a very clear and very RBS specific revenue opportunities next year, regardless of what you may think may happen to various parts of the market.</p>
          <p>On the other side of the house, we have a global manufacturing model. It's existed in RBS for some time; ABN AMRO also had the manufacturing philosophy. They perhaps haven't deployed the model with quite the same rigor as it has been deployed within RBS. So moving to the global manufacturing model is a real opportunity for us. It's helped by the fact that I think the prospects for the business going forward are helped by the fact that our platforms largely overlap, there's significant platform overlap, which is very conducive to cost reduction and very conducive to the manufacturing model.</p>
          <p>Of course, again it's not just a theory of all of this; we have distilled it down to specific action plans, which are being implemented and acted on as we speak, which brings me at least to the place of saying what our theme for us for next year 2008 and beyond is improving efficiency.</p>
          <p>So, in terms of the outlook for the Group, we can argue the toss about growth rates, GDP, growth this, GDP, growth that, whether it should be one tick this, two ticks that, a cross the other. If you come back to this, I think it gives you a much better picture of the outlook for the Group, which will be about revenue growth and improving efficiency.</p>
          <p>Finally, finally the take away from it all, our businesses are strong and we have good organic momentum. We have secured a very attractive range of additional options for ourselves. They will serve us very well in 2008 and beyond. And it feels as though we are very well positioned indeed to face a broad range of market scenarios going forward.</p>
          <p>So, thank you very much for listening. I think I'd invite my colleagues to come up and join me at the talk table and we'll try to answer any questions that you might have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Ian Gordon from Exane. In the lead up to today's results, obviously there has been a lot of focus on capital and you've delivered numbers which clearly you are confident with and within your anticipated ranges. Can I ask two questions on this issue? Firstly, many people in the markets have been trying trying to take us back to ratios such as equity to assets. Is your view that equity to assets has anything to contribute to a bold to sophisticated method of capital allocation, or do regard it as a relic from the past and something which should be consigned to the dark ages? And the second question, can you provide any color on the modern day attitude being taken by the regulator and the rating agencies with regard to these issues? Do you believe they are still going to be as focused on the diversity of income and other forms of profit and loss protection or again do you since there is a risk of them following route down towards these arcane balance sheet measures? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll come to Fred and then maybe Guy will want to comment as well. Just to say though obviously in the market conditions we have at the moment everyone is very conscious of the need to ensure we've good capital position. The Board is fully engaged in that and we'll continue to be so. But, Fred do you want to pick that up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, you -- before inviting the answering you are about to get on the equity to assets, but I think your ratios are helpful and also all ratios are helpful, but no ratio is perfect. And I think looking at capital adequacy a lot of time and energy has gone into Basel II. And I think, Basel II is not perfect, actually Ian I am not completely sold on all aspects of Basel II. I think it does move the game forward and is a better fit for the sort of sophistication we now see in financial markets generally, so and forget whether I like it or you like it or we like it, it is the prevailing capital adequacy regimen and so we should probably be well versed to get on with it.</p>
          <p>And there are other ratios that people might want to use. I don't think equity to assets is particularly meaningful or useful in the context of our business. So you'd find me of similar mind to yourself in that. But for &#x2013; I don't want to fall out with anyone over it, a lot of people like that ratio, it's up to them, but I do think we need to move on a bit. And you said the adequacy ratios are there and hanging your hat on any single ratio anyway never strikes me as terribly smart. So what the regulators and the rating agencies are going to do I guess is up to the regulators and the ratings agencies are clearly each well focused on the stresses and strains facing the industry at the moment. But they have always to my mind shown a good understanding of the realities of where businesses operate, the different business models that are extant amongst the different banks and different financial institutions that they both regulate and rate and so their relationship has always been one that I felt that the regulators and the ratings agencies understand the business, and we have a good dialogue about it. So, I think that attitude has -- if anything developed over the years rather than diminished and I would be surprised to see it change. At this point there would be no basis for thinking it is about to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pick up some of those things. I think there are a number of different metrics, which are relevant to assess suitability of a bank balance sheet and certainly some of the nominal measures, which regulators in the US are very keen on have served at a banking level quite well. It sort of depends on the nature and structure of the balance sheet as to exactly which of those ought to be the bounding measure. I think we look at a variety of metrics, not just the nominal metrics, nor so the risk sensitivity of those assets, not just under a regulatory regime but also under our own risk assessments. And as you know under Basel II, we've moved to sort of internal assessments of these things, as well as prescribed external assessments. And I think, all of those metrics would say that we are comfortable with the capital ratios that we have. And I would also say these are where we expected them to be. When we went back to the July offer document and the sort of gearing we anticipated around the ABN transaction, we are sort of where we thought would be. There is a planned program to get the elements of the capital base back to our medium term operating levels. And more attractive financial returns that Fred put up, I think will help accelerate that process.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's James Eden from Exane. I've always believed that your acquisition of ABN would destroy less value than Charter One. And I guess today you're inviting us to dream that it might not destroy any value at all, it might even create value. And your foray into Bank of China looks like genius; you've quadrupled your money. Now shareholders opposed both investments in Bank of China and the acquisition of ABN. Do you think this proves that shareholders often don't know what's good for them and validates your decision to sometimes do some very unpopular things?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you are trying to be helpful James as if -- I don't know but I just feel it sounds a bit like a hospital pass. I think we are happy with &#x2013; that we have our shareholders' support in the ABN AMRO transaction, as they supported us in the Charter One transaction and we're happy with that and we are determined to deliver value to them through these transactions. Bank of China, we've delivered the value Bank of China. I don't -- there are no -- you infer some sort of difficultly or angst between us and shareholders. It's not felt from this perspective. I think it's right to have a dialogue with shareholders and to be challenged and these decisions. These are big important decisions for the organization and I think that's -- it would be pretty poor show if shareholders didn't have a dialogue or express news about this. We have a very broad base of shareholders and views of reasonable men can differ about quite a wide range of subjects. So, I want to thank you for being helpful, but I am not taking hospital pass.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One comment I would add to that. I mean a Board has a fiduciary duty to and under modern -- the new Company's Act has a broader duty than previously. But a Board has to think on a time scale that may not be exactly the same time scale as all shareholders. Shareholders have the option to buy and sell. Actually, it's absolutely their choice. A Board of Directors really has to do what it believes is right for the long-term enduring health of the company. And there is a very different element of thinking that you have to keep in mind when you look at that. Yes. Yes. Please here.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. It's Tom Rayner from Citigroup. Just at risk of keeping the arcane debate on capital going, could I just focus on the consolidated balance sheet on page 40? So I wanted to ask you about all your ratios, your regulatory Tier 1, your core Tier 1 and your tangible equity to assets. On a statutory basis, you don't appear to have any tangible equity. So clearly, this is not perhaps, the most useful breakdown. I'm quite interested on the proportional consolidation what your ratios would look like on all three measures and also if you give us a feel for what they would look like under Basel II, as well as Basel I methodology? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the -- let me answer the following way. The separation plans for ABN will leave this consolidated balance sheet in place for a period of one, two, three years depending on the time of the separation. The calibration of our capital ratios and the planning that we have done through that separation timeline will leave us with capital ratios at a core Tier 1 and a Tier 1 level that are sort of at around or slightly higher than today's levels throughout that transition period and by the time we do come to the eventual separation of ourselves and the Santander parts and the Fortis parts, we'll be at or above the levels that we have published today.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>We've &#x2013; as we said, we expect to sort of transition from Basel I to Basel II. Obviously, this is a balance sheet we've had 76 days to try to incorporate the whole of ABN in but we think, the best way to get it and certainly the way we are doing it at the moment is it will be about a Basel I sort of lying ball, then switch to Basel II.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot. And the second question quite deep in the release as well on page 59, just talk a little bit about the sort of 33 billion of assets and there is an offsetting liability as well, which is smaller, of assets where there is no observable inputs I guess, for valuation and there has been no losses taken against those to date if I'm right and what your thoughts are about potential losses where we can't actually see a market valuation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that one. There's some narrative underneath, which tries to describe them and I would say actually there have been some losses taken against it because included in those are the high grade and mezzanine CDO exposures that I had outlined earlier and as well as some of the other inventory that is in there. You can see there are certain structured debt securities, certain over-the-counter derivatives, certain syndicated loans that have been part of that group and I'd say in total terms it represents around 3%, slightly less than 3% of assets. And you can imagine these are subject to scrutiny and review from all interested parties.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I take on board what you say about capital -- spot capital ratio as sort of being inappropriate, but on your own sort of measure you're looking for a target Tier 1 of 7%, 30% non-equity gearing so basically, a 5% equity Tier 1, and at the moment you're at 4.5%, so ex- the minority interest for the businesses of ABN businesses that you don't intend to hold, I suspect you would be at about 4%. So there is a 1 percentage point gap on 500 billion of risk-weighted assets or 5 billion capital shortfall, I wonder if you could tell us how we should think about that in terms of the businesses future development in terms of WRA growth or disposals of assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, we'd unable to split ourselves up today even if we wanted to. So we are supported by the entirety &#x2013; the balance sheet is supported by the entirety of the capital base and refer back to my earlier comments around the separation plans and the timetable it'll take to do that and the capital generation that will occur in that intervening period. And just in terms of metrics we have talked about operating within a 7-8% range. We've typically been in the middle to the upper half of that. I think we would all sit here saying we would be quite happy to see ourselves recover to that sort of basis. That would in fact imply a slightly higher core Tier 1 target than the one that you referred to. I think we've talked about 5.25 in earlier results announcements and I say I would encourage you to think more towards that end of the spectrum than the numbers that you put out.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Robert Law at Lehman. Could I follow on that with some questions on the balance sheet, please? In your commentary about at the end of the period when you split off you would expect to be roughly at these kind of levels. Can you say whether that statement includes any capital raisings or disposals other than the announced split offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I can't say anything of that nature. There are no unusual disposals, capital raisings or one-timers in that, the plans are principally built around the business performance and the capital generation that we typically demonstrate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I am aware -- what I am checking there is how we read into that is whether that's an aspiration or whether you've actually got plans as you currently stand with the Group as it is without making additional disposals or raisings other than you've already announced to get to that target? That's why I am asking the question.</p>

          <p>I mean the short answer is we do although we don't intend to throw numbers out unless we've got some idea how we're going to do them, but anything relating to the future ultimately is an aspiration. But you'll see from the results we're delivering today for the incremental synergies we expect from ABN AMRO and from our historic track record in generating profit and driving these ratios up. The basis for the comments we gave have very accurately described what we're planning to do.  There are no plans for any inorganic capital raisings or anything of the sort.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Secondly, can I ask what the attributable goodwill is on the balance sheet to the businesses that you are retaining, so that we can actually work out what the tangible book value per share is for your stock?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to say it's about eight, but why don't I just confirm the exact number to you outside. Eight, I believe is a pretty good number although I'll confirm that to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that is an important number for us to have. Finally, could I ask in addition on the capital markets assets, which you take in P&amp;L markdowns for -- have there been any movements through the balance sheet on those assets as well, I don't think there have, it looks like it's basically Bank of China?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Let's take this question here then to Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Simon Samuels, Citigroup. I'm afraid I just wanted to carry on really both Tom and Peter and Rob's questions on balance sheet. Just first of all, I don't think we got an answer to Peter's question. Can you tell us Guy what is the core equity Tier 1 ratio on kind of a look through basis, so excluding the pieces of ABN that you don't own -- are you saying it's a number that you know and you don't want to share with us or it's not knowable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a number that you can work out. It's not a number that we can ever realize because we will never get to the point where we can split it up to do that. And it does begin with a four and it does begin with a seven, I think would be as much as we would like to say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we can work out or you can work out? I'm just confused. Well can you just tell us what the number is then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You make some assumptions, but it's not a meaningful number in terms of how we operate right now, because of the Group is the Group, until you have the separation take place and that will perhaps take place in different phases and so on. So it's a pretty theoretical kind of number, but you can calculate it. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we have our capital ratios Simon and we talked about the capital ratios as calculated in accordance with Basel and all the rest of it. If you want to calculate other ratios as people have historically done, then you can feel free, but it's not a ratio that we stand behind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thank you. And then second question if I can just operationally actually is the just on the credit trends in the United States. So I guess for Ellen, but I'm not sure. Second half of the year, it looks like Citizens credit costs went from about $160 million in the first half of the year to over $500 million charge in the second half. So clearly a huge increase, half-on-half, including some reserve build in Q4. The question really is, really what should we be expecting for '08 and does the second half of '07 form a good run-rate in terms of the likely shape of the credit charges for '08, does the environment deteriorate from here, or does the reserve build in Q4 just mean we should ignore the second half of '07 as an aberration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In the second half of last year, we did increase the impairment at Citizens, but you have to realize it was coming from a very, very low base. Part of that impairment was actual charge-offs in commercial, commercial real estate and in home equity. The other large part of it was we increased our reserves against the portfolio. All said though, our impairment is only about 60 basis points on the entire portfolio, which is very low. It reflects the conservative credit policies that Citizens has had in the past and as I believe Guy and Fred mentioned earlier, over 70 -- our FICO scores average over the 700 on the portfolio, 97% of our facilities are secured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would your expectations be for the year ahead?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would just be -- there is going to be continued pressure in the housing market, but we feel we're comfortable with our reserve levels at Citizens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just besides you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. It's Jonathan Pierce at Credit Suisse. I've got first block of questions back on capital I am afraid. You're the only bank I think so far that has not given us a detailed Basel II breakdown of the numbers, I appreciate you've been pretty busy with ABN and the like? Will we get that with the report and accounts? I am just following on from that, will we -- it sounds like the answer is no, but will we ever get a proportionally consolidated balance sheet at any point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we dealt with the second part. I think we dealt with that, but do you want to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sort of trolling over old ground. I think in terms of the Basel position as you can imagine after 76 days it's &#x2013; we've not yet managed to do the full integration of all the risk modeling and risk systems to ABN. Of course the ABN situation is slightly unique in as much as the eventual home for those assets will be divided amongst the three consortium partners. So the sort of precise details of how that sort of regulatory oversight will happen are still a matter of some discussion, which is why I can't give you a precise answer today and why I didn't give you a precise answer earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. The second question is on the investment gains, probably one for Johnny actually, there is a comment in the release about how the private equity portfolio has been sold into a fund, which is now managed by RBS, giving more stable returns on that portfolio moving forwards, can you just explain in a bit more detail what has actually happened there and maybe give us some guidance as you have historically on where the other operating income line might come out in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah sure. Partly actually for reasons related to Basel II, we took a view quite some time ago that the right thing to do is take our principal private equity business and put it into a fund and manage it, retaining an interest in the fund. And so we took the huge bulk of our private equity assets in the middle of the year, put it into a so-called opportunities fund raised equity from a range of investors very well supported. We have a stake in the fund as I say and we manage it so that we have got some equity investments left in bits and -- in various parts of GBN. So there still will be other operating income going forward but clearly not &#x2013; I think we talked last year about four digits, we're going to be well back from that going forward, well back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the middle? The one with the mic.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Tim Sykes from Execution. Three questions if I can, Sir Tom, a very quick one on the tax rate, we saw the tax rate fall from 29.3% to 21.1. I wondered Guy, how we should think about that looking forward into 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Reverting to more normal levels I think is the right way to think about it. I think we were the beneficiary of the reduction in corporation tax and the deferred tax liability and some of the gains that I referred to were either low tax or almost no tax. The weaker US performance obviously was a higher tax rate environment and therefore less. From that, I think they are the &#x2013; oh there are some prior year settlements as well, so I mean I think they probably added or took around 7 to 8 percentage points off the tax rate in 2007 and I think I would just put them all back on for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A quick question on bad debts, if I can, we glossed over the commercial bank and retail bank. There is a strong performance on bad debts within the UK, Obviously there is a more challenging environment in the US. I just wondered if you can comment on the outlook for bad debts from more UK perspective, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the retail side, obviously we took a very conservative approach about two years ago, pulled in our horns, particularly on direct lending; that's shown through very well. Bad debts, new flows are down 14% this year and our recoveries process is actually been through a significant &#xA3;20 million investment program. So almost heading to having a world class recovery system if it all happens again. Clearly, I mean, we're very nervous about what might or might not be coming. But quite frankly, its pretty heavy levels of employment still in this country. We're very strongly concentrated in South East, which is probably still the most dynamic part of the economy. There's nothing &#x2013; being realistic, I wouldn't like to comment on 12 months ahead, but looking three months ahead I can't see anything that actually puts it on my top three lists of priorities quite frankly.</p>
          <p>At some point, it's going to level off, but we've deliberately not re-aged our book. We've not changed our methodologies or any other nice forms of words. Bad debts have been dealt with as they've come in and therefore I'm expecting to see, sort of, a steady trickle down. At some point it must level off, mustn't it? I think we could probably exchange a fiver on when.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ellen would you like to add anything further to your earlier comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, just except that you really can't predict where the US real estate market is going to bottom out now. So there's still a lot of uncertainty and there's some strong pockets of performance in the US, but in the real estate market it's still very, very weak, the whole housing sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. As -- if I going to ask just one last question, Sir Tom, on the integration. I'm just looking forward into integrating ABN AMRO businesses, obviously, there is a market perception that ABN AMRO was very badly run, which presented you with the opportunity. And if we look at NatWest, that was an acquisition that had a materially different scale to Royal Bank of Scotland. If we look ABN AMRO, it has -- it doesn't necessarily have scale, but it has scope. I think Johnny referred to the increasing opportunities that it brings. Can you just share with us how you will approach the businesses that are relatively new to you, such as Asian retail and also certain aspects of the wholesale bank, such as cash equities, or things like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe start with Gordon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And well, obviously on the Asian retail side, since we didn't have an obvious owner I've been shadowing it during the period of the bid and working obviously for both beforehand in terms of initial thinking, but then also once we got on board with the team there. We announced a new team in Asia, we've pretty much the team that was there with ABN AMRO, actually a couple of weeks ago. I'm very impressed with the people we found. I'm very impressed with the franchise. As Fred's point is obviously right, they're almost overinvested in many of these countries in terms of scale. I mean there's slightly a bizarre statistic, I think there are actually three staff for every customer, which probably puts us in a -- almost in a five-star hotel league. Obviously, a lot of the staff are actually part time, because there's a lot of direct sales agents. But there are some, sort of, slightly news, sort of, figures for me to get my mind around.</p>
          <p>We're particularly strong in the Indian subcontinent; I'll be in India for the second time visiting the team there in about a weeks time, and then going into Pakistan where we've acquired a very useful bank, that we are actually in the middle of rebranding at the moment. In both those countries, it has been made very clear to us. We're very welcomed by the regulators. We bring lots of GBN experience, for example, in project finance that they're desperate to get there hands on. So I think, it does really open -- we were already looking at India. We had team sort of hidden there under a wealth banner for about six months a year ago, looking at how we'd get into India. This has brought us forward five years. I'm particularly pleased that as part of deal, Fortis has agreed to sell on to us the Indian private client business, which we announced I think a week ago. That gives us 28 Private Bankers. There will be no problem in doubling the size of that and obviously the RBS Cootes name plays particularly well in the Indian market. So, I think that will be one additional synergy that we haven't given a moments thought to that we are now working up. This -- I think finds very exciting. At the end of the day, retail bankers are retail bankers. And that's interesting they have exactly the same issues we do in the UK, different economies. The issue really is to find something distinctive to do and not take the local banks on face on, but we've got plenty distinctive things.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay good. Thanks Gordon. Johnny?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'll to pick up on the other two. I mean, on equities if you look at the chart I put up. This year equities had a good performance in 2007. Frank McKirgan, who runs it we think, is doing a good job and we just reinforced really what he is doing, that business is going well. What we have done is exited the Rothschild joint venture in equity capital markets and combined that with the <mark type="inaudible" />, which I think, everyone at ABN thinks is long over due so we have one equity capital market business globally, so I think that will be another spurt in the business. So happy with what's happening in equities. Transaction services is the new division that will be headed up by Royal Bank of Scotland Executive Bryant Stevenson, who has been with us for many years, but was a Senior Executive in Deutsche Banks transaction banking business. So, he brings excellent experience in that area. And so we are very comfortable with how to run that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe you're over there is Chief Executive of ABN AMRO, perhaps you would like to share any views?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think, when we did the bid we talked about ABN being a good bank, but maybe not such a good business and that is generally what we're finding. There is good customer franchise, good capability, overly complex, over staffed at the center and poor on execution. And we are really trying to cut away those bad bits and exploit the good bits. We have some very good staff who are aligning and very enthusiastic to what we want to do. So we're very pleased with what we've found, but there is a lot of work to do to get there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean just not to prolong it, but just this is exactly as Mark said the issue is not the people on the ground doing business with the customers, it was between there and the tallest was where the problem was with a lot of the good customers basically in one go or good management as well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. It's Leigh Goodwin from Fox Pitt Kelton. Just a question please on your -- the write-downs that you took in what looked like the final months of the year quite a substantial increase it would seem to me, and a lot of that obviously you've related to monoline exposures. And thank you for this disclosure on those as well. I just really wanted to invite you to make a comment on how we might think about what's happened so far this year, we're two months into the year. We can read in newspaper and see what seems to be happening elsewhere. And I wonder whether you wanted to say something just about what might have happened so far this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, so far this year we've traded very well. We continue to watch those issues carefully. I don't think that &#x2013; we monitor the monolines daily, I don't know there is much I can add to that conversation. But the mark we took at the end of last year and again as you described pretty accurately was to reflect how we saw the situation then. And as things continue to move, we take the marks. And I mean that's the most important piece here that you don't start with what you want the P&amp;L to be, we must at all times make sure that we mark our book to where we think it's going and that is the policy and that is the practice in the organization. And I think -- I don't know if I could add any great wisdom on monolines beyond anyone else in the room could join, I don't know if you feel inclined to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just want to highlight that we had an excellent trading month in January, started the year well. Notwithstanding the sort of general market at the conditions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And -- can I just ask a second question if I may? Just on the leverage finance portfolio really and I am just interested to get a little bit more of an idea of where that's going and how much -- where it's shifting at the moment the backlog and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, a statistic is worth throwing out and this applies to our entire book of syndicated loans, not just leverage. But we've sold a &#xA3;3.6 billion of loans, so far this year. So people can over estimate the stickiness of the market. We have sold 3.6 billion of loans as I say this year. As far as leverage loans is concerned, we've always had a very strong credit culture in RBS and we're very happy with the credits that we've under-written and we see no sign of deterioration in those credits. We've shown you the actual exposure here. In Americas particularly it's still -- there is still difficulty getting buyers and sellers to agree on a price. But I think the general view of the banks would be that the marks prices are an overreaction if they suggest risk of default that is way of the chart in terms of anything we have ever seen before and that's what's causing the over hang, if you like, because we the banks are saying here we are, we have credit that we are happy with, there is no sign of deterioration. The price you're saying you're going to pay us for this credit is ridiculous and we're sort of stuck there at the moment. But that will change, I can't say -- I am afraid it's not going to be an overnight sudden change but it will gradually leak away, but we are in very comfortable position and we are certainly comfortable with the marks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll keep it succinct. And the &#x2013; just the first question on the CDO exposures, thanks for the exposures, their net of our hedging, can you give an idea of what the overall hedging coverage is on the CDO books et cetera? And specifically in the CDO squared side it was a zero exposure to CDOs squared or should we take that to mean that you -- that there is no exposure to synthetic CDOs?</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Michael Helsby from Morgan Stanley. I am just looking at page, sorry slide 46, where you break out the revenue in GBM, we can say give you on ABS, CDO and equity finance. I was just wondering if you could help us in terms of the over credit markets? Clearly a lot of markets have closed down, just what proportion of that bar, if you like, isn't active at the moment?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yeah. It's my slide.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can -- I certainly can't do it mathematically; I can only do it sort of anecdotally so to speak. The investment grade business or corporate business is moving along reasonably well and indeed many of our corporate customers are seeing opportunities and the private equity community is less active. So you are seeing pretty substantial deals in that area. Securitization is extremely quiet. Leveraged finance, again we are seeing and are able to execute small to mid-size deals. So we're quite busy in that area. Real estate is patchy depending on what geography you are talking about.</p>
          <p>What else is in there? I think those are -- bonds. America is going well and I'm particularly pleased with our performance in bonds. We've -- in December we underwrite dollar bonds from Marks &amp; Spencer and British Telecom, which for RBS is a sign of just how far we have come in that dollar bond market, and that's probably the most active bond market in the world today. So, I'm pleased that we've established ourselves in that and are taking -- able to take advantage of that activity. So, what proportion, I don't think I can put X percent is going fine and Y percent is bad. But it's a collection of ticks and crosses within one bar that is in itself, a tick or cross.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John, if I have a just one quick follow-up question, just on a slightly different topic. On the non-observable inputs, which Tom was asking about, there's clearly a hell of a lot of assets that must have an active market. I've got a lot of feedback from investors that, obviously invest in bonds and they can't believe at the movement that the banks can actually find active prices because a lot of the bond markets have frozen up. So, I just wondered in the active parts, is there any of mark-to-model within that book as well or is that all genuine mark-to-market on the rest of the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the quick answer is everything in our balance sheet is genuine. It's all audited and if we say it's level one, it's level one and marked to observable price, level two is a gray area and level three is unobservable input as reported.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in center here.</p>

          <p>Derek Chambers from Standard &amp; Poor's Equity Research. Perhaps a similar theme, some questions about the credit market exposures. I think you've made it plain that everything is fair value to where you can and you seem to be making distinctions through your trading book and to the RBS CDOs which are more proprietary models and other things. You've noted that the overall marks from most of this is much the same at end December as at end November whereas, to the extent that one can observe things like some of the indices, there was a deterioration in some areas in December. So, I am wondering if this because your particular portfolio and detachment points didn't deteriorate in line with market, all because your methodology means that you didn't experience any movement relative to November?</p>
          <p>And then on the slightly different area or two slightly related questions. One is, I think you've indicated an extra 10% on some of the ABN exposures, which looks like about a 100 million, does that go with a consolidated income statement or is it part of the fair value adjustments? And then finally on this area, you've disclosed some Alt-A net exposures of 2.2 billion sterling. I'm not sure if that's quite on the same basis as you discussed on the conference call. Could you say what your view on the integrity of that is or just on how that's performing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just remind you that we &#x2013; yes I'll come to you in a moment -- we issued our trading statement based on later data than most other organizations and indeed on a very prudent basis. So that's the background to the trading statement, but Guy...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, so what we tried to do with the trading statement was clearly take not just the output from our model, but to extend the accounting allowed to put in some sort of prudent buffer in place. I think there was actually no movement in the ABN -- ABX index between November and December, in fact if anything it moved slightly higher. You rightly say that these instruments are specific rather than genetic in their characteristics. We took another look at the ABN portfolio. We felt it prudent to take additional 10% mark that was around the number that you indicated, that was reflected as pre-acquisition adjustment taken as through the balance sheet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And of the total is that from different places from what you discussed at the trading statement, and has there been any impairment in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Johnny you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, sure, yeah. We have the Alt-A failure, we have taken a few minor marks through the P&amp;L. It's not used as a unusual. So, it's not brought out, but they are small numbers. The vast bulk of Alt-A is AAA. We've marked the small amount that's not investment grade down to a very low price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the conference call at the trading statement you might have indicated a rather different exposure, is that a different -- was that a gross figure rather than a net figure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There have been some slight movements in the net figures, as we've taken hedges off or &#x2013; and things like that. But there's not been a -- I mean a -- 100, I think, it's that sort of number. I'm not sure which number you are referring to, but there have been some very slight movements in the exposures across the piece. But they reflect just day-to-day, as I say trading taking hedges off, putting hedges on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. How is the -- the assets that you've given out, so I was wondering, if you've got any just normal residential mortgage-backed securities either in the US or European? There is no actual -- just normal residential mortgage-backed securities that you're disclosing on your balance sheet, so I was just wondering it's just quite strange that there isn't any of those, just wondering how many there is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yes, is the answer. There's a portfolio of some mortgage-backed securities in Citizens that has long been part of the, if you like, the sort of natural hedging program to the retail deposit base. And I can't remember the precise composition, it was around the sort of 20 billion number principally agency and agency class roll, agency securities just sort of bulk standard US conforming mortgage stuff, and toss it around European and the UK not aware of any...</p>
