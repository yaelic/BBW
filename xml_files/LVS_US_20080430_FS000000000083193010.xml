          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Las Vegas Sands first quarter earnings conference call. My name is Katie, and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question and answer session toward the end of this conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would like to now turn the call over tour host for today, Mr. Bill Weidner. Sir, you may proceed.</p>

          <p>And that concludes our first quarter &#x2013; I'm kidding. I have to say good afternoon to you and thank you all for putting up with the <mark type="inaudible" /> that we experienced today. On the call with me today, partially perhaps the cause of this, would be the folks that are calling from further away, Mr. Sheldon Adelson, our Chairman is here and he's out on the east coast connected in. Executive Vice President Brad Stone is here. Brad Stone is calling us from Macau. Rob Goldstein is here, the President of the Venetian and Palazzo. Scott Henry is here, Bob Rozek, our Chief Financial Officer. Dan Briggs, our VP of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today, I need to remind you that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. I would also like to caution you that the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption of forward-looking statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted property EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP measures. The definition and reconciliation of each of these measures and the most completely GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>By now, you should have received our press release detailing our financial results for the first quarter of 2008. Our agenda today calls for is as follows: I'll begin with some summary observations and spend a few minutes on Las Vegas. From there, we will turn our attention to Macau and address some of the recent developments there as well as the actions we have implemented in the -- as the market evolves and the Venetian enters into its eighth month of operations. I will then make some closing remarks including some comments on our opportunities in Singapore and then we will move on to your questions.</p>
          <p>In Las Vegas, at the Venetian, we delivered a very solid performance throughout the property in a challenging economic environment, a testament to our convention-based strategy. We soft opened the Palazzo in late December and its results have steadily ramped up as we spent the first quarter completing and introducing additional amenities to the property with the grand opening of our entertainment offering this weekend: the Broadway hit Jersey Boys on Saturday night. We will near completion of the product set at the Palazzo.</p>
          <p>Turning to hotel operations, our hotel average daily rate and RevPAR statistics were solid. Although less than we would have liked reflecting the conscious decision we made during 2007 to increase our allocation of rooms to the FIT marketplace in 2008. While we've been able to respond somewhat to the softer FIT market by booking more group rooms, we did pay the price for that FIT exposure in the first quarter with lower occupancy than we had actually planned. Looking at the two properties as a whole, first quarter gaming volumes were up across the board reflecting our now significantly larger asset base in Las Vegas. We have also seen a steady ramp, particularly in slot play, throughout the quarter and into April as the Palazzo's gaming business has continued to build as more of its features including some of our high end suites have now come on line.</p>
          <p>With the Palazzo now open, we're extending our successful convention base business model to a far larger 7,100-room asset base. Now with the largest destination resort in the world nearly complete, we're enthused about that platform and hope for it to do well in what is a challenging current marketplace as well as in the future as Las Vegas inevitably recovers. Let's now turn to Asia.</p>
          <p>Our progress in establishing the Cotai strip in Macau as Asia's Las Vegas continues and our development of the marina-based Sands in Singapore is also progressing. At the Venetian Macau compared to quarter ended December 31 of last year, our visitation remains strong, our mass gaming business grew but our hotel and occupancy statistics remained solid.</p>
          <p>There were two developments in the quarter in particular which we want to address. First is that we lost significant amounts of market share of the VIP business. As a result of that loss in market share, our EBITDAR decreased by 8 million sequentially to 110 million for the quarter ended March 31st compared to 118 million in EBITDAR in the quarter ended December 31. That's clearly an unsatisfactory result. We have now taken actions to remedy that VIP market share loss. The second item we're in particular discussion in the quarter is that we have not yet been able to get our ferry service approved to run on a 24-hour basis and at 30-minute sailing frequencies.</p>
          <p>But before we discuss those two important developments and our results in greater detail, we wanted to try to put the current state of market into a larger context by addressing the recent statements by chief executive Edmund Ho concerning the new government policies that will guide the future of Macau's gaming industry. There is clearly much we do not know today about how these rules will ultimately be put in place, but looking at the big picture, we do believe there are likely outcomes that will positively affect Macau's future as a destination and more importantly our position vis-&#xE0;-vis that future itself. First it seems very clear that no additional concessions beyond the current six &#x2013; three licenses and three sublicenses -- will be granted for the foreseeable future. That's something that is not at all a surprise.</p>
          <p>Secondly and clearly more importantly, it appears that no more applications for casinos will be allowed to be filed. No more landfill permits for development of casinos will be accepted. No more additional casino construction beyond what has already been agreed to by the government will be allowed and no current casinos will be allowed to increase their gaming capacity. We'll need to see how this is interpreted and enforced, but this policy has the potential to significantly limit the addition of new VIP halls, gaming tables and slot machines. It's also possible that only those developments that are consistent with the evolution of Macau into a multifaceted business and leisure destination will be approved.</p>
          <p>We understand that the current pipeline of projects under construction, approved or under discussion with the government will not be affected. Francis Tam, the Security -- Secretary of Economy and Finance for Macau was quoted in The Macau Daily Post on April 24, that, and I quote, "total casinos will not exceed 40 with Cotai not surpassing a total of ten." If Secretary Tam's comments reflect the government's view this will be pretty interesting considering that there are 29 casinos operating in Macau today. These pronouncements are quantifiable and measurable and provide a clear backstop to future supply growth.</p>
          <p>Third and again depending upon enforcement, the item with the greatest impact on current gaming operations is the introduction of rules to control junket room operators, licensing requirements and junket commissions as well as the conduct of the review of the current VIP room service contracts which are effectively sub- subcasino licenses. We will stay acutely attuned to these developments and react swiftly and appropriately to their effect. In the long term, the phenomenal growth in visitation and gaming win as a whole, first quarter visitation up 18%, gaming win up 66%. The big piece of that, driven by VIP win at 79%. But more importantly for the future, mass-market table win was up 40% with slot win up 85%. These growth statistics attest to the depth of the market as new high quality destination style product is added to the marketplace. This growing demand, coupled with the supply limitation backstop that is the stated objective of Macau authorities, bodes well for the long term prospects of our strategy, that a critical mass of superior complete destination supply on Cotai that will drive that growing demand and allow us to provide superior returns on the dollars we have put to work in Macau.</p>
          <p>Okay. That's the 30,000-foot altitude big picture, but what about today? How are we managing today's market in light of both the dynamic nature of the market in general and Macau's government's recent declaration?</p>
          <p>First, let me approach &#x2013; let me address our approach to the VIP market. We certainly look forward to seeing how Macau's authorities propose new junket commission rules will be implemented. Successful implementation and enforcement of these actions could both limit the number of licensed representatives in the marketplace plus limiting their ability to the smaller sub-sub unlicensed facility and limit the number of VIP room casinos they operate in themselves. While we clearly support these actions by government and believe they're consistent with the development of Macau as a more well-rounded tourist destination, we will not wait to see how this story develops.</p>
          <p>Today, we've already responded and adjusted our commission rates to be more competitive in the VIP marketplace with two principle objectives: one, growing our VIP market share; and two, increasing our cash flow generated from this portion of our business. As government actions are sorted out, we will react quickly to any actions that the government ultimately adopts. I would also point out that credit is also a very important part of the VIP picture. Historically we have taken a very conservative approach to our granting credit, both to junket operators and to individuals in the marketplace. But in the future we will begin to expand the amount of credit we are granting and continue to do so in a judicious way.</p>
          <p>Second, let me address the critical element of building our mass gaming business for the Venetian Macau: our ferry service. We will continue to press to achieve full operation, meaning 24 hour per day, seven day a week service, as well as more frequent service for our Cotai jet's ferry service. We've already completed the trials required to achieve approval to operate at night and have the equipment to operate on a thirty-minute frequency to the Cotai strip. But we continue to await a formal berth assignment approval from the Hong Kong transportation bureau. While we already have enough ferries in our fleet, we will not be able to sail at night nor will we be able to increase our frequency of service without movement from the Hong Kong authorities to allocate our requested berthing slots.</p>
          <p>This is particularly frustrating to us as we have been given assurances by the Hong Kong authorities in advance of completing our ferry manufacturing orders that more than sufficient slip and berthing capacity existed at the Shun Tak terminal in Hong Kong as that capacity would be made available for us as our boats were delivered. We understand there's plenty of berthing slot capacity available but to our dismay, the requisite approvals of the Hong Kong authorities have not to date been received. We look forward to increasing our sailing hours and sailing frequencies as soon as the Hong Kong authorities provide the requisite approvals. We'll be able to achieve a good frequency of service, that's half-hour frequency, immediately upon the granting of berthing availability from the Hong Kong authorities.</p>
          <p>Additional ferries that will be delivered in the coming months will allow us to provide optimal frequency of service, that's one sailing every 15 minutes to the Cotai strip by August of this year. Ferry services affect every segment of our Venetian Macau facility. VIP from regional and international markets with linkages to Hong Kong and Hong Kong airport, mass tables and slots, particularly high repeat convenience by Hong Kong mass players, FIT rooms business, meetings and convention and trade shows for the convenience of delegate access, arena events, shopper convenience for retail sales, and on and on. All are critical for maximizing the synergies of our integrated resort. Particularly important as we add more reasons to come to Cotai directly, the Four Seasons and the upscale shopping brands of the Four Seasons mall to be opened this summer.</p>
          <p>Third, let me spend a moment on the pacing of our development activities. At this point it's clear that the pace of approvals for development activities throughout Macau have slowed. Looking ahead, we anticipate some additional near term slowdown as government sorts it all out. We will do everything in our control to pursue our announced developments as aggressively as possible, and we anticipate that pace will pick up as the Ao Man Long incident reaches resolution.</p>
          <p>Fourth, and most importantly, we will focus more directly on profitability from the current operations in the near term. We have staff for breakneck growth to be ready for multiple openings, one after another. For example, the staff of the casino for the Four Seasons property without any additional head count. We can operate our current facilities, The Sands Macau and The Venetian Macau more efficiently. Brad Stone is in Macau now heading up a swap team to rationalize operations as we prepare for and open the Four Seasons. Rob Goldstein will focus on the evolving VIP market and direct customer-marketing environment in Macau as he will be there next week, as will I. We can and we will execute better in the near term.</p>
          <p>Our six factors of success measurement are still in place. Despite our inability to hold market share without responding to competitive junket commission pressures and the fact we have only partial ferry service in the first quarter, nearly 14 million visitors have experienced the Venetian Macau since it opened, approximately eight months ago. Our hotel performance is solid with ADR reaching $232 for the quarter, occupancy reaching 78.6%, and RevPAR reaching $183. Our entertainment offerings to date have worked. The opening of Cirque de's &#x2013; Cirque's Cosmos in a custom built theater at the Venetian Macau this summer and appearances by Team USA as they prepare for the Olympics will expand our entertainment offerings further.</p>
          <p>Our group meetings and convention business after a strong start continues to grow. The business is seasonal so there are naturally weaker and stronger periods of the months, but overall the trajectory is positive. Retail sales figures of the Grand Canal Shoppes with more stores opening over time and retail sales per square foot on average exceeding $700 today. With more visitation and ferry service set to drive those numbers higher in the future, our retail offering is a clear success.</p>
          <p>Gaming volumes fall the VIP market. We certainly hit a road bump. We will be more competitive with commissions going forward and we'll grant more credit on a judicious basis. We expect to grow our share of this business and our cash flow. Our mass gaming volumes have been solid, clearly the largest in the Macau marketplace reflecting the acceptance and appeal of the Venetian Macau. We can squeeze more profitability from this robust base, and we will. So what will drive our performance in the near term? Besides executing better on operating efficiencies as we open the Four Season, the most important development would be for more frequent Cotai jet ferry service from Hong Kong Harbor to the ferry terminal at the foot of the Cotai strip, followed by direct service from the Hong Kong International Airport. These services will enable increases of visitation to the Macau and the Cotai strip and a more satisfying customer experience and more convenience for shoppers, arena events attendees, commission and trade show delegates and others.</p>
          <p>Second, the opening of the Four Seasons Macau this summer with the upscale shops of the Four Seasons Mall will create more traffic to the Cotai strip. Third, competitive ferry service to drive the mass business. Now not to give Singapore a short shrift because of the dramatic announcements of the Macau government dominating the news, I want to say that our Singapore construction continues apace despite challenging site conditions. Singapore set a new record for visitors in March with 908,000 with an average length of stay of 3.7 days, representing 3.4 million visitor nights in March alone. 98,000 of those visits were from mainland China, second only into Indonesia's 155,000. Average daily rate was up 23% year over year to over $160. Occupancy was 87% of Singapore's nearly 40,000 rooms and service departments.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe we have tremendous opportunity in Singapore and we continue to execute there. So that includes the highlights. But before we go to Q&amp;A, I will make a few concluding thoughts. First in Las Vegas, the Venetian's performing well in a weaker Las Vegas market overall and the Palazzo continues to ramp up to full power. On the Macau peninsula, the Sands continues to be the resilient market leader of mass gaming volumes on the peninsula despite a very large increase in high quality competitive capacity, both compared to the same quarter last year and sequentially. We'll continue to work to capture more VIP play and additional operating efficiencies and focus on maximizing the Sands' market leading cash on cash returns.</p>
          <p>Finally on the Cotai strips, we will rationalize more efficient operations of the various profit centers at the Venetian Macau: rooms, retail, entertainment, events, convention, trade show, VIP table business, mass table business and slots. And capture synergies among them as we continue to grow our revenues. We will also complete the Four Seasons this summer and continue to construct other operating &#x2013; the remaining properties on the Cotai strip.</p>
          <p>By the end of 2009, there will be nearly 15,000 international standard rooms on Cotai, more than four times as many as the Macau peninsula has today. With the bulk of the peninsula investment now in place, the focus of future development will be on Cotai. Those factors, together with the strong market growth and with supply being backstopped by government decree, combined with expanded infrastructure improvements including additional ferry service, paint a pretty compelling picture for the futures of our Cotai investments. We remain confident that the execution of our plans will lead to superior returns for our shareholders as we focus more particularly on the near term and executing on our operations that are currently in place. With that, I will open the lines for your questions and answers now.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I heard it. I think Felicia, it's not a matter of percentage. It's a matter of decisions that make sense. I think we will be challenging our people over here. Certainly we have a strong base of Asian business that we've granted credit to in our Las Vegas operation. We've established certain credit lines. We are going to review those lines. And I think it's really a balance. We were in a call the other day, we were talking about our provision for bad debts is basically nonexistent here in Macau. It's almost like a bank that doesn't have a few bad loans they probably aren't lending enough indiscerniblemoney. We are going to go through that. As Bill said, we are going to be cautious about it. We have extended credit to our junket reps, and as we've talked in the past we have them somewhat collateralized by the commissions we owe them. We are going to look at that as well and probably extend more credit to the junket reps themselves, those who have performed well. So we don't have a target. The target is to issue as much quality credit as we can to attract particularly the premium customer directly to our property, and certainly continue to support the junket reps in their endeavors as well. To say we have percentages is probably not, you know, we haven't established that, but we are going to look at those barriers that we've had in terms of extending credit here.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then on the same line of addressing your VIP share, you know, we've heard and you have implied in the past that the Four Seasons could be an all VIP property. I was wondering if you wanted to address that? And then I have some follow-ons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, it's interesting. We're finding that we're going to have two different types of experience for the VIP customer here in Macau very shortly. One is the big property, the Venetian experience which includes obviously Celine Dion shows, lots of restaurant, shopping and entertainment options, a lot of variety of room product. But we're also finding the desire of the VIP market for a smaller, more boutiquey hotel experience and certainly the Palazzo &#x2013; excuse me, Four Seasons allows that opportunity for us. There is -- and the plans for the property are that we will have a ground floor, what I'll call premium player area, which is designated for customers directly marketed by Las Vegas Sands and Venetian Macau Limited here. We will end up more than likely with two floors of junket rooms above those because we are seeing a real desire by our junket reps to have a presence at the Four Seasons itself. And then later on at the end of this year, we're opening 19 really luxurious apartments with their own casino, each suite actually has their own casino gaming room as well as restaurant. Kind of reminiscent of what you would see in London in terms of the type of experience and similar in a way to what the Mansion provided in Las Vegas for its customers. There is certainly going to be an emphasis on product and we're hearing from the market itself that there's a strong desire for a Four Seasons-type of product to round out our initial offerings here at the Cotai strip.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're looking at a July opening right now, Felicia. Some time in third quarter. We want to &#x2013; I guess the key there is the shops are progressing well at the Four Seasons. The property is a gorgeous property we want to make sure that this property is opened properly as a Four Seasons would be. And so we are focusing in on an early third quarter opening.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and then just finally, moving to Las Vegas during the quarter as you were having meetings, you kind of mentioned that the overall property now with the increase of 70% in terms of room base, conference bookings, at the time you were talking about it were only up about 25 to 27%. I was wondering if you could tell us in the quarter how that was and then just looking forward how your conference and convention business is looking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I quite understand. What we've done actually at the Venetian and Palazzo is, the group bookings are really a combination of both properties. We really don't say group bookings at Palazzo versus Venetian. It's a total. What we have done recently because of the better known name of the Venetian as we launched the Palazzo product is we have moved a significant number of phgroup room nights that were originally booked in the Venetian product over to the Palazzo and backfilled the Venetian with FIT business because, quite frankly, we get a higher call volume per room on the Venetian because it's a well established product, and that's kind of a short term strategy. Certainly, we're aggressively out there in a more than competitive environment right now economically, aggressively booking the group business, and we may have some statistics there. I don't happen to have them here on Macau, Rob?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's just explain the April numbers perhaps, give you an indication where we're going. April both Palazzo and Venetian are above 95% at an ADR in excess of 245. Bookings are trending upward. Palazzo is really filling up. As the property ramps up, I think we will get stronger. Obviously its ground rooted to the economic conditions in Las Vegas have been difficult in the first quarter, but we're improving. And as always the first segment to improve and to grow is the group segment, which is our strength, and we will keep playing to that strength.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the Sands Macau it's a little more complicated to calculate that now because of the two different programs we operate at the VIP level. But if you go back and look at the way we do it, we do it where we hold win constant and we also do it where we hold the rolling volume constant. And the midpoint of that range is probably around 7 or $8 million at the Sands.</p>

          <p>Just under $20 million, Larry, for the quarter. Keep in mind, we opened Jan. 17 at 44,000 units off the books and obviously, it was a work in progress.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. That's fair. As far as timing of the future projects in the budgets for everything, Brad, can you do your usual, go through that, or is that possible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I can take you through. We mentioned the Four Seasons property opening early in the third quarter. The budget on that is intact as we discussed at the Investor Day. Sites five and six continue to move towards their spring -- first phase of spring of '09 opening for the Shangri-La Traders and first Sheraton tower, again with the second Sheraton tower and the St. Regis and the St. Regis Apartments opening towards the end of the year. Again, that project is roughly in the same budgetary state. It seems to be tracking on very well.</p>
          <p>Sites seven, eight and site three, as Bill mentioned in the conference call, we are ready to start work on site seven and eight. We have the rigs there. We've just been frustrated because of some challenges within the government based upon the scandal that happened here in an area that related to the Public Works Department, and there has definitely been a slowing in the pace around Macau of approvals, and so we're anxiously waiting to get through that, and again, that's a project whose budget is still a work in progress as we go through and take the conceptual design and work on pricing it. We really don't have any reports specifically on that project.</p>
          <p>And then site three is very similar. Site three is somewhat behind seven and eight. We have filings in for all these projects with the government, and again, we're just waiting for the government to right itself in such a way that we can get to a more normal development cycle. And Singapore, that project is progressing very well. I was there about a week and a half ago and spent some time on the site. If you look at pictures of it, one has to realize that there's actually several floors underground. We are coming out of the ground with the towers now. We have a very aggressive goal of the end of next year in the fourth quarter of '09. We are working basically 24/7 on that project where we're allowed with the government. I mean, that's just a fantastic project. We're still in a range that we've been talking about in the 4.5, $4.6 billion range including land and all end costs on that project.</p>
          <p>Bethlehem is progressing nicely. Steel is being erected very aggressively now. Our goal is to get that open by the third quarter of next year, and again, that project is consistent budgetarily with what we expressed at the Investor Conference Day back in February. I think that's the main projects that we've discussed. The condo tower is also moving along nicely and that's currently on the same budget that we discussed at the Investor Day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a complicated process here, and we've met some resistance, shall we say, in Macau in terms of the sale of the units. I don't want to get into too many details here at this point. We have plans to move forward. I think the primary issue we're having there in Macau is having those that have a vested interest in real estate to understand we're not selling residences here. We're selling what we call vacation suites and we don't want to just sell real estate and pick up dollars. Although that's a nice thing to do. We want to sell reasons for people to visit. We want our cake and eat it too. We want people to pay us a lot of money for these residences that they use when they come to visit. We don't want a residential tower. We want units that wealthy people buy so they have their own place on the Cotai strip, similar to the market that we're focused on here in Las Vegas. We want that tower not to be, quote, unquote, residences per se. We want them to be residences for wealthy people that want their own place on the strip. So they pay us and they make an investment, and they expect to make money on that investment when and if they decide to sell it. But in the meantime, they come and visit three times a year, eight times a year, seven times a year or whatever number times a year to have their own residence on the strip. It's exactly the same intentions in Macau. It's just that the local market guys who sell real estate don't get it. Though we're working our way through it and we're confident we will find a resolution.</p>

          <p>This is Sheldon. Latest time I talked to our head of &#x2013; the president of Asia over there, I talked to him last night -- and I'm on the east coast right now until tomorrow -- and I'm told that there was a separate committee that was formed by the Macau government, and the committee decided &#x2013; there's no guarantees on this, but it appears as though they wanted to take a different approach and call it something else other than residential, but they've concluded the only approach that everybody can be happy with is a co-op approach, but the New York, you know, where people buy into the shares of the company with the right to use a particular apartment. So without any guarantees, it sounds more encouraging that we will be allowed and if it goes through in the near future to move the property into a separate condo regime and be able to sell co-op address.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, the rates that we have been talking about historically haven't changed with respect to minimum rents. You notice that we put for the first time in Bill's script that revenue or retail sales themselves are running north of 700 a foot on an average basis. Obviously, you've got some high end retailers that are doing far, far in excess of that and then you've got people in the pieces of the mall that will benefit from more traffic that are doing south of that number, but we're pleased with the progress there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early to make any predictions. If you ask me what I'm wishing for when I fantasize like they reduce all the casinos back to eight or ten and get rid of all the VIP rooms that operated independently. My fantasy is such: I mean, when we first got involved in Macau, we were assured that it would take a couple years to phase out their VIP rooms. That hasn't happened and they've allowed more independent casinos to open, and I think the announcement by Edmund Ho last week was a reaction to pressure he's gotten from both us and hopefully, and we're not convinced about that pressure, from the CLO, the Chinese Liaison Office, that the way the development was going it was not what they intended originally for it to be. We're hoping it that our goal is to turn a city of seedy backwater gambling dens into a city of convention, business travel, and business and leisure travel, where the casinos represent no more than 10% of the total amount of space. So I mean, right now, the biggest casino in the world that we have at the Venetian is only 5% of the total amount of space. So I think we're getting a good &#x2013; we're speaking to welcome ears when we say that you have to have a &#x2013; we're suggesting you got to have a certain percentage, certain ratio of exhibition space, convention center space, shopping space, et cetera, et cetera and if you don't have that we're suggesting that the proportion of casino occupancy be reduced.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On the financing front from Macau, I think the message, Steve, is the same that we delivered during our Investor Day is that we intend to finance our needs for the Macau properties that are under construction and to be developed in an offshore transaction. Predominantly anchored by Asian banks and other global banks that have a large operation and lending capacity in Asia. Similar to what we did in Singapore. I've been having very active conversations with a number of our bigger banks and even some of our medium and smaller sized banks and the level of interest and the level of enthusiasm there is actually quite good. Hopefully by the next quarter conference call, we'll be able to have more indicative direction in terms of the size of what that financing might be and what it may cost us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll go now. As far as our opportunities here in Macau, Steve, you know, labor is certainly an opportunity for us. We want to take advantage of the opening of the Four Seasons to readjust our labor counts here at the Venetian Macau and you know, move people that have experience over there without disrupting the labor market here. We're very sensitive about that and certainly the Four Seasons provides an opportunity to get ourselves more efficient here and we will do that. There are other opportunities here in Macau.</p>
          <p>Energy is a huge cost. We are looking at focusing on areas like that, but the reality is, I mean, you're never going to save your way to success here in Macau. And our goal has to be to drive to correct our market share at the Venetian Macau, the VIP business. I think you'll see our efforts really start hopefully becoming evident this month as, you know, discussions with junket reps and et cetera, you know, do take &#x2013; they can't move immediately so month end is the time where people can shift some of their business. We're hoping to see some of our more competitive moves on the VIP market start reflecting themselves truly in the month of May. And on the math side, the good news is we have a tremendous amount of business here at the property. But it is disserving when you look at the fact that we have two and a half times the size, the amount of visitation here at the Venetian that we do of the sister property at the Sands and yet we're generating only 15% more in mass lines. One of our goals there has to be convert a lot of that traffic. Certainly as Bill pointed out, we have significant upside in the ferry business in terms of bringing people directly here.</p>
          <p>So our goals have to be two-fold. One, translate more visitation in the gaming win. Drive more visitation to the gaming floor itself, and then adjusting our VIP commission so we drive both more revenue and more EBITDA or cash flow out of that market. At the same time, really addressing as we understand our business better now and as we have opportunities like the Four Seasons to correct some of our structural issues as far as staffing and we will do that, and I think you'll start seeing those translations, you know, later in this quarter and going particularly into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As far as the Venetian, Palazzo, I mean, I think we've always done a pretty good job there managing costs. We told investors that we believe the synergies between the Palazzo and the Venetian would generate in the area of about $60 million of efficiencies compared to if they were two separately and &#x2013; separately operated entities. Our initial analysis of that shows that we're meeting that goal. So I think that as a base the structure that we've set up in terms of the overhead at the Venetian, Palazzo in Las Vegas will work. And as we drive, as Ro said, as the property matures and we get the products in place, we see our increase in occupancy and rate as we have seen &#x2013; as Rob pointed out in April, I think we'll see the revenues drive the majority of the EBITDA growth and that the cost structure is in fairly good shape. Of course, like any new property, we'll learn more and we will make adjustments accordingly, and it's a lot easier to make adjustments in the market like Las Vegas than it is necessarily over here.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks. I have got two questions. The first is: you talked about focusing more on the profitability of your existing facilities and the timeline you gave for additional Cotai property sounds like it's unchanged but is there &#x2013; when you about focusing on existing facilities in the near term, is there some thought to delaying the openings of additional capacity at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think in the &#x2013; as I mentioned in the script, you know, the intention is to continue to aggressively develop those properties as quickly as we can. But we need to make sure that we turn our efforts in the near term to make sure that between now and the &#x2013; and significant completions in 2009 that we generate as much income in the near term as we can. So you know, we have an opportunity with the Four Seasons coming along and as I say, Brad is there in Macau now as we begin to more rationalize the cost structures there, and then as we ramp up the Palazzo, I think it's more a matter of controlling the costs as that comes on line so we can deliver more EBITDA. So that's all I was saying. Is that we're not losing focus of the near term but the construction process for the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thanks. I wonder if you can give a little more color. You talked about you have taken actions in the market in Macau and that at the end of the month here, you may start to see the impact of some of that. I wonder if you can give us a little more color on -- it sounds like the market is moving towards 45% of revenues as a payment to junkets, but in some cases, we're hearing it's above that. We're hearing it's 48% of revenue in some cases. I wonder if you could talk about what level you are now? Also, do you expect to announce anything as you're taking different actions in Macau? Do you expect to announce anything with a large aggregator? Or is that something would you do just without announcing it? If you could give us a little more color along those lines.</p>

          <p>I'd just like to mention that don't disregard the possibility of these commission rates eventually going down as the supply of gaming capacity decreases.</p>
          <p>If it does contract as the government has indicated, they're going to consider. If it does contract, it will take the leverage away from the guys who were demanding greater commissions, and hopefully and just the increase in demand and reduction of supply, it will create a different <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was hoping just on the lines of the commission structures or the commission rates, what was the average VIP commission rate at the Venetian Macau in 1Q and can you remind us what it was in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will give you that information. Give me just one second here. I have it. The commission rate for the first quarter, I believe, 1.13%. Give me one moment here, Joe. Unless somebody else has it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm looking for it as well, Brad.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The commission was 1.13%. And that compares to the prior quarter. I believe about 1%, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>1%. And maybe looking at it differently, can you comment on margins on VIP gaming revenues? What they are in absolute basis and if we talk about it in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter? Do we see those sequentially go down at Venetian Macau?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Again, I don't have the breakouts directly of all the &#x2013; I don't think we're going to get into that. I would say that obviously as commissions go up, you know, the profit margins are going down. Our goal is to drive enough volume as we, you know, and being competitive, we are kind of caught in the switches. Our rates went up. But they didn't go up enough so we incurred additional expenses but we didn't drive enough volume through the door. That won't happen again.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one interesting point you have to understand about the first quarter is an unusual quarter in the sense that it's so dominated by Chinese New Year that it's almost like there should be a separate hold percentage for the first quarter for Las Vegas. Traditionally, we hold significantly higher than our normalized rate in that quarter. I mean, we're actually lower than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then I have a comment for Scott in relation to his prior comments on the financing. If you look at your CapEx on the Cotai strip what is left to spend assuming for the remainder of the development pipeline and what do you have existing right now in terms of your existing available cash, existing amounts under your facilities over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Joe, as far as required funding necessary to completion, you know, a portion of that is expected to be generated by a combination of cash flow, that comes from operations as well as from the sale of residences is what we're forecasting internally. I don't think we've shared those internal estimates because we don't want to give forward forecasts for those properties. The balance, the balance that we're talking about and focusing on can take us out to completion of all of our funding requirements and goes out through 2011 and actually, some of the costs even leak into 2012 because of the way construction contracts and contractor payment schemes are practiced in that part of the world. It is several billion dollars. I think, what we indicated during our Investor Day was we require approximately an incremental $4 billion to get us to what we believe is completion, and a fully funded program over in Macau.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>4 billion is inclusive or after the benefit of the sale of residential stuff, right?</p>

          <p>That is correct. Now, can you remind me of the other part of your question</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ability under our existing facility, that was the other piece of your question? We're almost fully drawn on our facilities over in Macau and as we had indicated at the Investor Day that we will require incremental funding, but before the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one final question and I'll let someone ask some additional questions. Along the lines of internal forecast. Obviously in the press, with regard to one of the lawsuits out there, there's this idea that internally there's a document that you lowered internal forecasts for 2008. I'll leave it as broad as that. But do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was mostly including first quarter or this quarter results. That was a revenue number relating to internal forecasts that mostly included updates based on this quarter. So it's in the numbers, baked in the numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have a good sense for why the non-gaming was down sequentially in Macau? Is there seasonality or is it the initial surge of people and it died off a little bit? Surprised to see it with Chinese New Year?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As good as Chinese New Year is for the gaming side, it does affect us. And I think Bill or somebody made a comment about seasonality. And you don't book a lot of group business before or after Chinese New Year. And so we ended up going a little bit more into our -- in this particular quarter -- into our wholesale business and other segments and that affected rate and affected to some degree the occupancy. The time before Chinese New Year is very slow here and there's really not group business you can fill in typically, you don't have FIT and you don't have groups that rely on wholesale. I think somewhat of that is seasonality regarding first quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Are you seeing an impact on the business in Macau overall with the shortened Golden Week this year or is that better for you from a non gaming perspective per what you just said with Golden Week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Golden Week this year is weaker than last year. So there's no question about it. Even though Golden Week is no longer seven days, there's still a couple of days in there where they do celebrate it. So it's kind of a double whammy it's not as strong as it was as last year as far as number of days and they still don't book group business around Golden Week itself. It's a one- or two-day holiday that they stay away from group business as opposed to a seven-day holiday. Yes, it affected us. Although we see more demand on the shoulders of it on weekends and things like that. So we'll have an increase in shorter-term vacations as it were as opposed to the seven to 10 days of Golden Week.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly the driving factor is what we pay these guys to bring business in. As we mentioned, I think credit is going to certain junket reps, not to all. It's something that helps drive and helps them with their business. So I think those people who we feel comfortable with and to who it's a meaningful asset to help them along bring business to our property. We'll look at that. And certainly there's operational issues and how we run our place and how we complete the experience. So I would certainly rank being competitive in the commissions as number one, and we have to be competitive. We've tried in the past to remain below the given rate and we're just finding that in this current environment we're going to have to be aggressive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. I have two questions, please. My first goes back to the comments and the statements made by the Macau Government, because I believe there was a separate statement that seemed to suggest that they were trying to constrain the number of tables and slots that they were going to give going forward. Do you view that as a set for limitation for the limit of 40 casinos and does it change, perhaps, your plans for the makeup of your remaining sites there, sites five through nine?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think the bottom line is that they will control the slots and tables of the current operations that are there now. While they then review, for example, the service agreements that have essentially set up sub- sub- sublicenses that are not controlled or not -- that are not rationalized, shall we say. They're not suggesting that on a going forward basis that those individual places don't have an appropriate mix of tables and slots that go with them. No one is going to spend billions of dollars without additional capacity in more destination-type places.</p>
          <p>I think if you read between the lines, what you see is as Sheldon suggested, they're saying they don't necessarily like the old Macau style proliferation of the casinos that don't drive visitation from further away. Those that are what you would call cannibalistic or call it leaches from those casinos that drive first class visitation from around the region, I believe are going to be controlled and frowned upon. The future of Macau are destination style casinos like exist on the Las Vegas Strip. That's why when Francis Tam talks about additional casinos if there are 29 now, and you do the math, that's one more casino on the peninsula and 10 casinos on the Cotai Strip. For the kind of casinos that are more like what's on the Las Vegas Strip. So I think it confirms the vision of government that in the future they're going to encourage destination-style multi-day-stay places that drive visitation from further away. I think that's what to read between those lines. And they're not going to discourage additional capacity for the billions that's spent in those style of casinos.</p>

          <p>Okay. And my second question is with regards to infrastructure. You've obviously identified that you need that ferry to drive mass volumes in Venetian. But as I look at your pipeline over the next three plus years, you're trying to more than double, almost triple your footprint again. And my question is: What additional infrastructure commitments do you need, because what I'm worried about is that there's obviously a differential between when you build and when the infrastructure follows that allows you to fill that build. Is that an issue for you?</p>

          <p>The key thing about ferries is the scalability of ferries. The fact is this temporary, this temporary facility that's on the Pac-On, that's on the foot of the Cotai Strip, if you understand the geography, that's a three minute ride directly down a four lane highway to the Cotai Strip. Relative to peninsular Macau, the streets are narrow. You can't change. It is what it is. The government is recognizing by saying additional developments in the peninsular Macau are not going to take place because it's just too crowded. How do you move around? How do you get around? The beauty of the Cotai Strip and that ferry terminal at the foot of the Cotai Strip is as the new ferry terminal comes on line, more and more capacity comes on line.</p>
          <p>Now, as you look down the pike about the additional capacity on Cotai Strip, ferries are simply a process of ordering them long enough in advance to be able then to deliver them and then those are, as I say, are ultimately scalable and you can send to the different destinations. You can have higher frequency of service, et cetera, et cetera. That's why we keep dwelling on the idea of ferries. This current ability to Takph to Hong Kong is just the beginning. There are many more places, phothers up the Pearl River Delta and the airport at Zhuhai, which is currently underutilized, connections to the airport in Hong Kong, expansion of the Hong Kong &#x2013; the airport right there, again, in Macau, because that airport is like a minute and a half from all of the hotel rooms, the new hotel rooms on the Cotai Strip. So the scalability of the ferry operations is the lowest hanging fruit, but additional space, I guess you would say, apron space at the airport that increases capacity there, too. We're confident that with the right combination of scalable ferry service and the expansion of the opening of the new Pac-On ferry terminal, which will be well before all this new product comes on line, will make that transportation capability in the infrastructure there of married directly with the increased capacity on the Cotai Strip.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then just coming back to my first question. I understand what you're saying about them wishing to get, to upscale and to improve the quality of Macau. I entirely understand that. But as I understand it, they are only giving permits to the new style American quality casinos. That is the shift from 29 to 40. So I wonder, why are they making a separate statement about constraining the number of tables and slot machines if they're only giving permits to American-style quality casinos? Do you see my...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't necessarily say American-style. I would say international-style.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Okay, international. But these are all good projects. I wonder why he has to specifically make a comment about constraining tables and slots when you're the only people allowed to build new capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because look what's happened. The smaller, old-style Macau casinos, quite frankly, sapped the power required to drive the investments. So if you read between those lines, those that have been granted to the older style less attractive more regionally focused places are, if the communications there are -- they'll be discouraged, they'll be discouragement -- if that's such a word -- of adding more capacity in current places. Capacity is granted to the places that are more destination style casinos.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much again for listening in on our conference call today and participating in it. Again, I want to apologize for the technical difficultiestechnical difficulties at the beginning. We had a interesting quarter, shall we say, and there are things happening in the marketplace in Macau that we are reacting to as we speak. We still are very bullish about the long-term direction for Macau about the encouraging comments by government in terms of the development of the more destination style casinos of the future. We're very bullish about what's happening in our developments in Singapore and how Singapore is in fact coming along. And daily we walk through the property here and look at the traffic counts and watch what's happening with the ramp up of the Palazzo, so we're very confident that the combination of the Palazzo and the Venetian here will continue to make this the destination place here in Las Vegas overall. We appreciate your participation today and we look forward to next quarter's conference call and thanks again for your comments and your questions and we look forward again to interfacing with you in the future.</p>
