          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our conference call. First of all, I would like to thank you all for accepting our invitation to take part in this conferencing after which we will present the 2009 results. 2009 was a year of contrasts. In the first semester we had an adverse economic climate and a negative feeling, but we decided on implementing liquidity and the credit lines to our client.</p>
          <p>In the second semester, we saw a recession of the positive expectation for 2010 with the arrival of a new class of consumers as a result of the social mobility, social inclusion and the corporate asset to the banking systems by the CDs and the elite classes.</p>
          <p>Despite this, Bradesco maintaining its investments. During these two semesters, we continued to expand our attendant network and investment. We opened 441 branches and the sub-branches and ended 2009 with 6,015 attendant upon. We set up 4,139 Bradesco Expresso units, bringing our network of 20,200 Correspondent banking posts.</p>
          <p>This was also a year marked by national integration during which Bradesco consolidated its presence in 100% of its 5,564 Brazilian municipalities. We also opened the first floating banking branch in the world on a boat on the River Solim&#xF5;es in Amazonas.</p>
          <p>In terms of the results, we are presenting net income of the R$8.012 billion, 66% of this income came from the financial sector and 34% from the insurance sector. Assets totaled 506.2 billion. Shareholders' equity ended the period at $R41.7 billion. The completed statement will be presented in statements by our colleague, Abreu.</p>
          <p>In terms of the loan portfolio, we indeed ended this year with a volume of R$228 billion. We granted new loans amounting to R$243.2 billion and the average turnover period for the credit was 247 days.</p>
          <p>In terms of our IT model, we continue to believe that the technology brings commercial benefits. The pillars of the new architecture of the systems are flexibility, agility and simplifying profit.</p>
          <p>In terms of our organization model, we are reinforcing the collegiative management style directly as the convergence of the business segments bringing gains of synergy. At the same time, we have an advanced development program for our executives. Our business model involves operating by segment. The retail segment ended indeed last years with 20.9 million account holders client and 800,000 new accounts. We opened 1.9 million saving accounts.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we foresee the inauguration of the 250 branches, which will lead to an increase in sales and efficiency. Deploying the segment reserved special attention and now has national coverage with 277 branches in 25 Brazilian states. The middle segment will add an extra third branch to its current network of 69 endpoints and will continue to operate within the production chance concept.</p>
          <p>The corporate segment obtained their 1,200 largest Brazilian economic growth. It's operated in complete synergy with the investment bank. Our investment banking took part in the main capital marketing operation carried out in Brazil. We are second in the rankings of the fixed income operation, with 25 operations and 19% of the market share.</p>
          <p>The investment banking is in definitive position in the variable income ranking with a 10% market share. Looking at the order size decline, the insurance group presented a net income of R$2.723 billion with an impressive return on equity of 27.90%.</p>
          <p>Total revenues came to R$26.3 billion, an increase of 14% over 2008. We retraded our vocation for a specialization with a bid on our Dental royalty operation with Odontoprev, the leading company in dental brands sector. We carried out other important business deals with the acquisition of the Banco Ibi Brazil. We are also taking advantage of the opportunity presented by Ibi M&#xE9;xico.</p>
          <p>We carry out this business by showing respect and admiration for our partners, the C&amp;A retail store network. We are continuing expanding our cooperation with the National Institute of Social Security incorporated by payment of 100,000 new beneficiaries amounted for January.</p>
          <p>I would like &#x2013; in this moment, I would like to take this opportunity to inform you that apart from all our commitment to fostering the professional development of our executive base on the most disciplinary concept, and in order to strengthen our business area, our much respected Jean Philippe Leroy, who was our Investor Relation Officer for 10 years, will become Bradesco Luxembourg, where he will develop activities in the international, private banking and asset management area in Continental Europe.</p>
          <p>Among his many contribution to our organization, I would particularly like to mention the creation of the Investor Relation area in 2000, and six months later the Market Relations Department. Jean was responsible for taking Bradesco's investment methodology to investors and shareholders in Brazil and abroad and &#x2013; for the pioneering initiative of the yearning in IR and the social and environmental responsibility area.</p>
          <p>He will be replaced by our esteemed, Paulo Costa, who possess more than 10 years experience in both the broker dealer area and who was responsible for implementing Bradesco Securities, international operations in the United States and United Kingdom, where he was a CEO. He wants to coordinate the approval of the financial of the company as part of Bradesco in USA.</p>
          <p>Paulo will bring all his international experience to bear on our IR and social and the environmental responsibility area. Paulo and Lee together will be in-charge to coordinate the investor relation area. They are available to attend to any demand from you.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, our aim for 2010 is to focus on increasing our market share and the quality of our services. We are well positioned to grow organically where we will have a greater possibility within our own organization.</p>
          <p>Finally, we stress the investment in 2010 will total R$4.2 billion and go towards to the expansion of the technological restructure, purchasing of the equipment, and the expansion of branch network. The aim will be to strengthen the condition for consistent long-term organic growth.</p>
          <p>Please, Mr. Abreu, explain the &#x2013; our position.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. On slide two and three, we show some of our highlights. I would like to draw your attention to our net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 of around R$2.2 billion, totaling an annual net income of more than R$8 billion in 2009, 5% up on 2008. The assets managed reached more than R$700 billion, growing by 17.5% over December of 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide four, on this slide, we give a summary of all those events we consider as non-recurring and which affect our results in the respective fields. The last line in red, therefore, shows our results, which we call as adjusted net income or recurring net income.</p>
          <p>This quarter, our results were benefited from non-recurring events, especially the net gain of R$388 million resulted from the payment of certain taxes pursuant through Law 11,941. It's called the REFIS.</p>
          <p>This was particularly due to our decision to drop certain theories in which we have been contested in the court the legality of these taxes. As a result, part of the provision made for this proposal was reversed. The remaining non-recurring items are shown in the charts or underneath in default footnotes.</p>
          <p>In an event, we may offer additional explanation during the Q&amp;A section.</p>
          <p>On this slide, I would also like to draw your attention to our fourth quarter net annual return on average equity, both in terms of reported and adjusted net income, which stood at around 20%.</p>
          <p>Slide five, before moving &#x2013; before moving to slide five, four of the slides. I would just like to make clear that the data numbers and indicators we will be dealing with from now on have not been adjusted for the non-recurring events shown on the previous slide, since we have maintained the same reporting procedures as of in our press release and economic analysis report. However, whenever we consider any of these events to be important, we will certainly mention these facts during the presentation.</p>
          <p>Going now to slide five, we highlight our operational efficiency ratio, which closed 2009 at 41%, presenting a substantial improvement over the previous year, particularly due to the increase in our fee income and net interest income.</p>
          <p>Slide six. Total assets reached R$506 billion, 11% up on December 2008. The return on assets stood at 1.7% and return on average equity at 21.4% in the period, excellent ratios given the economic scenario during the year.</p>
          <p>The Basel ratio also improved reaching 17.8% in December 2009. This ratio will allow us to double our loan portfolio, leaving us in a very comfortable position to sustain expected growth in the coming years. Even considering the ongoing regulatory changes, if you remove those surplus allowance for loan losses from our poorest capital base, which will occur as of next April, our Basel ratio would reduce to 16.9%, which is a level that we still believe to be exceptionally comfortable.</p>
          <p>Slide seven. This quarter, 62% of our net income came from financial activity and 38% from insurance business. This higher share on the insurance business was due to the fact that the quarter is now recovering, events had a bigger relative impact on these business results. If you consider just net income in this calculation, the insurance contribution would fall back to 33%, very close to the historic average level.</p>
          <p>In the financial revenue, we can see that the results from loan portfolio increased its share over total net income this quarter, essentially due to reduced provision needs in the annual comparison. However, for actuality share over net income was reduced due to higher provisioning needs because of increase of delinquencies, while the relative increase in the share of the security line was largely due to the good performance of our treasury.</p>
          <p>Slide eight, unrealized gains stood at $R10 billion in December 2009. This was less over the previous quarter. It's worth mentioning the inclusion of the investments in OdontoPrev, Laborat&#xF3;rio Fleury, and Cetip whose joint goodwill totaled more than R$900 million, offsetting the reduction of our stake in Cielo in certain fixed income securities. Without question, these numbers exemplify the strength of our balance sheet. We should emphasize that these numbers do not include the potential gain from our own properties of almost R$2 billion and neither the tax spread of R$830 million on the social contribution rate increase.</p>
          <p>Slide nine. As you can see in this slide, the non-interest earning portion did exceptionally well in 2009 increasing by R$2.3 billion over last year. In the quarterly comparison, however, it fell back to what we consider as a reasonable level given that the price of most financial assets has already returned to pre slide levels. It's also worth noting that income from interest, earning operation also increased by a substantial 18.7% in 2009 mainly due to higher average volume. We will be dealing with this in more detail in the coming slides.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, regarding the net interest margin, I would like to highlight it's raised to 7.8% in the quarter and is significantly improved in 2009. The performance of our net interest margin reflects improvement of &#x2013; in our margins in turn caused by better economic conditions and improved mix, with an increase in the higher margin portfolios especially individual loans .</p>
          <p>However, we believe the rise of these integrated loans during the year can be considered atypical. In our opinion it will fall gradually in the mid to long-germ, as it did in June 2008 due to the increase in lower margin operations and their consequent relative share gain.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, this slide gives a breakdown of net interest income. In the annual comparison, the highlight is the performance of net interest income from loans, which increased by 24%, being primarily due as we just mentioned through the growth of the loan portfolio and changed mix. The reduction in funding line reflects a decrease in interest rates during the period partially offset by the increase in the funding volume. In the quarterly comparison the 22% increase in the insurance line was strictly due to higher gains from security index through the EPCR consumer price index and reduced expense from the restatement of reserves in line with the general, the general market index.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, the highlights on this slide is the 19% improvement in the net margin for loan operations in this quarter, the blue part of this graph, which is best out of the series, due to the growth of the gross margin and the reduction in provisioning expense. In the annual comparison, however, the net margin fell by almost 7%, indicating that gross margin growth was insufficient to absorb the increase in provisions. It was emphasized that for the purpose of this slide we're not including in non-recurring provisions made in 2008 and 2009. As we had already mentioned, the exceptionally optimist outlook for Brazil's economy, as well as the trend of our delinquency indicators, reinforce our belief that the worst is over in terms of provisioning needs, and we expect a continuous improvement in this net margins in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Slide 13, Bradesco's total portfolio reached R$228 billion at the end of 2009, moving at 5.8% in the quarter. These indicators were influenced by &#x2013; incorporation of Banco Ibi's operations in the total amount of R$4 billion. If you ignore this factor, loan operations still recorded growth, chiefly driven by loans to individuals which increased by 3.7%, and the loans to SMEs, which moved up by 7.2%. The products for individual segment that lead the growth were credit cards with a growth of 15.4%, payroll-deductible loans with 11.8% and mortgages with 6.2%. It's worth noting that the lower large corporate loan growth was partially due to the depreciation in real currency, against the U.S. dollar with impact on dollar index loans, which accounts for around 22% of total loans in this segment.</p>
          <p>We believe that demands for them will increase in 2010. Thanks to improved economy. Consequently we expect our total loan portfolio to grow by between 21 and 25%. We'll go into more detail on this later. New borrowers in 2009, were people or companies who had no loans with Bradesco in December 2008, accounted for around R$22 billion of the loan portfolio, underlining the fact that we had grown with quality while diversifying risk.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, as we expect the delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days record a reduction in this quarter, reaching 4.9%. Excluding the incorporation of Banco Ibi's portfolio in order to give a more accurate comparison with the previous years, the ratio would have been even less just 4.7%. Note that, individual delinquency ratio has already returned to the same level as in the beginning of the year, which shows that delinquency peak is definitely behind us. We expect these ratios to improve even further in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, on this slide we show the behavior of early stage delinquency of between 61 and 90 days. Note that the individual delinquency ratio continues to fall. If it reaches its lowest level at the year in December &#x2013; of the year in December 2009, very close to its pre slide level. The corporate ratio has recorded a continuous decline since August 2009 and giving a promised economic outlook for 2010, we believe it will also return to its pre slide level shortly.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, this quarter we had also included an undeterred representative write off net of recoveries. The last curve in this slide, it gives us another dimension to our provision levels. If you look at the historical figures for the allowance for loan losses and the effective losses over the subsequent 12-month period, we can see that written-off losses gross or net of recoveries has historically a strong correlation with non-performing loans ranked from E through H. This historical trend allow us to assume that our effective losses a year from now will be close to 5.8%, indicating a surplus provision of around 2.7% of the credit portfolio, equivalent to R$5.2 billion. Using the write-off net of recovery concept, we would have losses of around 5.1% with a surplus of close to 3.4% equivalent to $R6.5 billion. Without a question, whichever concept we look at, we have an ample portion to cover any possible difficulties that may arise.</p>
          <p>Slide 17, reinforce our comments on the previous slide. This one shows the coverage ratio of the allowance for loans losses to loans overdue by 90 and 60 days. As you can see, this quarter we recorded our highest ever coverage ratios under both concepts. As a result, we believe that there is no need to make additional provision in the future. On the other hand, we believe we will not have to use the additional provisions we had already made. Since, as we have mentioned, we expect delinquency to improve from now on.</p>
          <p>Slide 18, considering the debt was incorporating in November 2009 for a better comparison mainly with third quarter numbers, we added an extra column in this and the next two slides, in which we report fourth quarter revenues and expense with a going back 12 month lead.</p>
          <p>Fee income increased by a substantial 6.7% this quarter, particularly driven by taxes due to seasonality, followed by brokerage and the royalty income, reflecting the improvement in the capital markets. For 2010, we expect the capital markets to remain strong and we believe your investment bank is ready as a condition to generate important levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, operational expense increased by 4.8% this quarter. Personnel expenses fell by 3.3% in the period, especially due to the non restructuring portion giving lower expenses from profit sharing plan for employees and executives.</p>
          <p>The annual comparison reflects the management's effort to cost control, increased expenses by only 7.6% -- 7.5% in spite of 2008 and 2009 .Collective bargains agreement and investments on organic growth during this period.</p>
          <p>Slide 20, administrative expenses were strongly impacted by the advertising expense in the last quarter, as seasonally happens in this period of the year. The other expenses lines were 5.3% up in the quarter, which is compatible to higher business volumes in this period. The annual growth of 30.1% is in line with our covered network increase 17% and the consequent higher business volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, this slide shows our revenue from insurance, insurance premiums, pension plans and saving bonds, which increased by 20.3% in the quarter, reaching R$80 billion. In line with the seasonal trends in the last quarter of the year, life insurance and private pension plan products recorded a substantial growth of 33% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net income moved up by around 36%, reaching R$828 million, typically due to reduced grants, the improved financial results and the non-recurring impacts mentioned earlier, mainly from REFIS. Based on the latest figures from Susep and the ANS, Bradesco's Insurance Group maintained its leadership with the 23.7% market share in terms of revenues.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, this slide presents some of the main numbers from the insurance activity. Beginning with the combined ratio, the improvement this quarter was primarily due to reduced client claims since the previous quarter was impacted by swine flu and to the higher revenues in this quarter, which as we saw increased 20%.</p>
          <p>Our all financial assets and those with guarantees technical reserves totaled R$83.7 billion. Technical provision stood at R$75.6 billion, of which R$65.7 billion were related to life and pension products. Here I would like to emphasize that, we worked with actuarial assumptions that leave us very comfortable in relation to our future commitments with the beneficiaries of our insurance and pension plans.</p>
          <p>The actuarial table, we use 80 to 2000 with an improvement of 1.5% per year. In addition, in terms of expected interest rates for our assets, we have adjusted our provision to more conservative levels by adopting a real rate of 4% per year &#x2013; this year versus a 4.3% at the end of 2008, which demanded more than R$500 million of the new provisions.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, you can see here our economic department projections for 2010 and 2011 regarding GDP, interest rate, inflation and the U.S. dollar exchange rate. Given the current economic performance and the stated favorable projection, we expect our 2010 GDP growth of 6%.</p>
          <p>If it is confirmed, it will be well above the average growth for the last 30 years and one of the highest rates in the world. As economic recovery becomes stronger, inflection demand will increase. We therefore believe that if Selic rates &#x2013; Selic base rates will increase in 2010, albeit with no adverse impact on economic growth.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, here we show our 2009 guidance and the actual numbers side-by-side. In the case of loan operations, we were below our forecasts, typically due to the large corporate volume shrinkage, partially due to the foreign exchange rate variation and partially to the immigration of some of the spreads to capital market operations.</p>
          <p>One slide 25, for 2010 we expect a loan portfolio growth of around 21 to 25%, driven by credits for the corporate segment and by certain specific lines for the individual segment, especially payroll-deductible loans. In mortgage, we expect to originate around R$6.5 billion in new operations, representing a growth of approximately 50% over 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally, confirming what we have been stating, we would like to underline the fact that 2009 really was a year of major challenges. However, given the solid results we achieved, we can say that Bradesco regained them efficiently. I say that's not only because of the profit reported, but also because we had managed to improve even further our provisional ladders for both spread and technical reserve in the insurance business. Another important achievement was the balance of our unrealized gain, which improved during the year from over R$600 million to over R$10 billion.</p>
          <p>And all of this was achieved without losing sight of our organic and sustainable growth, maintaining our positive and constructive vision for our company. During the year, we expand our presence, expanding our customer service network, our own by more than 6,400 service points, consolidating our presence in 100% of Brazil's municipalities. Moreover, we kept expanding our client base and business volumes. We also have invested heavily in technology over, and that was optimizing our resources and possibly improving our operational efficiency. Thank you all for your attention and we are now available to answer any questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Jorge Kuri with Morgan Stanley.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. And congratulations to Jean for his new role. I have three questions, if I may, really quickly on your guidance. The first one is, can you explain why your guidance for individuals' portfolio growth is 60 to 20%, which is lower than the guidance for total loan growth of 21 to 25? I guess over the last many years we've seen you and most of the banks be able to grow consumer lending much faster than the overall portfolio. That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second, in your guidance for financial margin growth of 14 to 18%, can you clarify if that includes trading gains or this is excluding trading? And second, what type of margin contraction is implied in this, what year-on-year basis point reduction are you assuming?</p>
          <p>And the final question on the guidance is can you help us a little bit with the outlook for provisions? You &#x2013; provisions were around 6.5% of total loans in 2009. Where do you think the number could be? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jorge. This is Abreu speaking. We understand that they gradually grow more in the corporate side because the company is investing a lot. It's a year where the economy &#x2013; the big drivers for the economy will be now the investment for companies. That's why we are posting &#x2013; we understand that the portfolio of corporate will grow more than individuals. Of course, individual will continue to be important for us even in consumer side, but we are posting more conservative guidance for this. This could be more, we understand it will be more, but we are just being more conservative.</p>
          <p>One thing is because &#x2013; exactly because it has been growing more in the past, right. There's a movement that we need to replace some threat. For example, we grow in 2007, 2008 in auto finance for example, much  and more, it was a very, very, big growth that we had. Once we were replacing that plan, so we need to replace that part and we need to grow the portfolio. So that's why you have this impact in the consumer side.</p>
          <p>And say about net interest income that we are projecting growing between four to 18. It's including a part of trading gain, but it's just some part. It could be &#x2013; if you consider the average of trading gain that we have was in the past, okay, we can consider its including the less exceptional gains or losses is of course we need to reduce. And why this year? We are less, let's say, optimist about this net interest income than we were the last year.</p>
          <p>One thing is because we start to remember that the last year we have an average movement in the credit portfolio. In 2008 we grow it a lot but then what happened? You transfer the revenues for 2009 because we start in a point, a higher point. During 2009 the portfolio didn't grow as much that its growth in 2008, so you have this aspect on this. And they'll have some pressure of course in the spreads during 2010, during 2009 we &#x2013; during the higher, the most complicated period of time we need to increase spreads of course once we have the economy going back in the normal base, we expect that the spreads will continue to reduce a little bit. So, are there other questions? I forgot your one point. Is that?</p>

          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Peter Robarta with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, a couple of questions. Just a follow-up on the financial margin you spoke about before. You said you used some of the trading gains in your estimates, but some you don't. So just want to &#x2013; I know it's hard to calculate, but more forecast? But just to get a sense, if you look at the trading gains over the last few years, it averages around R$600 million. Is that more or less what you are using or do you think it could be lower than that, particularly since the fourth quarter we saw trading of only around R$300 million. So if you can maybe give us a little more color on that?</p>
          <p>And then just second question related to your acquisition of the Banco Ibi Mexico? Can you maybe just give some more color in terms of do you expect to grow more outside of Brazil? Is this kind of a sign you plan to grow in Mexico or is this just related to the previous acquisition of Banco Ibi? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Peter. We consider &#x2013; look, when you look at the slide nine, you'll see that we have the no interest gain of course you see that the three previous quarter was very, very strong. But you can see in the past it's very &#x2013; it's out of the curve. I think this year was particularly very good in terms of trading gains. We don't have a specific number for this, but we consider as the number of around three and R$400 million could be a good guess for this number. Okay, in normal base, let's say, right?</p>
          <p>In terms of the operational fee, Ibi's in Mexico, you need to understand this more as an opportunity that we have, once you have made the agreement with the people from C&amp;A company in Brazil and we have a good opportunity to &#x2013; they've shown and the operation in Mexico is a very small operation so far and we understand that we have some synergy with this because the &#x2013; all the &#x2013; reprocessing in Brazil the cards match and so. We have many, many situations that give us opportunity to go in a different country as Trabuco mentioned in his presentation, the second biggest country in terms of GDP in Latin America.</p>
          <p>So it's an opportunity, of course. It's opportunity to know, to stay, to understand a different country, but it definitely does not indicate that we haven't &#x2013; we have in our strategic plans to continue to expand outside Brazil. It's an operation that could be &#x2013; we understand this more as a good opportunity to stay with lower risk, stay in a different country with a lower risk, with a partner that has been proved to be very, very positive with us. So it's &#x2013; that way that we understand the need to see this.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on loan growth in general, and I would make two questions on this big topic. One, if I know correctly, some of Mr. Trabuco's remarks, he said that their focus for 2010 will be to grow organically and to grow market share. Yet, if I look at your guidance for loan growth for the year, which is 21 to 25%, that seems to me to be pretty much in line with what we've been hearing from most of your peers.</p>
          <p>So if that's what you grow, it seems to me that you're going to grow pretty much about what the market will grow, and therefore you will not grow market share. So what if you're on the line and for how much in the system, the market will grow loans this year. And if you really want to grow market share, don't you need to grow a bit more than that?</p>
          <p>And second, if you could elaborate at least in broad picture terms what do you expect for 2011 even though you're not going to give any specific guidance? Because if I look at your macro outlook, you expect the GDP growth to be exceptionally high this year, 6%, like most economies out there. But do you expect a slowdown or at least to more sustainable levels in 2011 to 4%?</p>
          <p>And when we get closer to 2011 we would have experienced significant increase in interest rates as you correctly call. So do you think that once when we get to 2011 we're going to see a significant moderation in loan growth or do you think that by 2011 you can sustain something in the order of a 21% plus that you're likely to see this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a minute, Daniel, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Daniel, I was just -- just to be sure if I had understood all your points. And the center point that the bank is having the same guidance for growth in this way we will be in the same place in terms of market share, okay you were right. But of course when we gave &#x2013; we give some &#x2013; our guidance, we try to be more conservative. When we said we'll have space in different lines which will continue to grow to &#x2013; to grow and gain much. Of course our &#x2013; in our view even if you feel you'll gain something close to 0.2, 0.3% of market share. Okay, it's not a big, a big, a big gain, but it's a share. Of course, it still going to depend how the market will stay. In relation to the 2011, we don't have numbers for 2011 yet of course, but once you consider that 2009 &#x2013; 2010 we will be growing a lot. Of course it's actually expected to grow the same, the same level. But normally we use something like to &#x2013; close to four or five times the growth in GDP, let's say, but not against just we didn't exercise 2011 yet, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you say something like four to five times GDP growth that would put you somewhere in the 15 to 20% range. That's a very preliminary number. But the significant increase in interest rate that you expect by then, you don't see that having any affect on volume growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again if you consider that we'll have to &#x2013; we need to have in mind that Brazil being the mid of the many, many process of investment. We could have some World Cup come in Brazil, we have &#x2013; you have Olympic Games. So I think Brazil would be &#x2013; would have many, many there. So I think it could be possible to grow even more, even if you consider this growth of 4%, right? And why it is growing only to 4% in '11? I don't have the reason for the &#x2013; our economic schemes right now, but we understand it just because we have growth in a base that is higher, right, When you have &#x2013; if you have 6% in 2010 you need to carry over movement let's say. But the expectation of interest rate in 2011, it should be &#x2013; if I remember that the movement that I saw the last movement. It should be a movement to start to moving to reduce again, all right. It's that &#x2013; when say 12.75, it's high okay, but if you beat the adjustment that you need in terms of monetary policies this moment, which would be less that it was in the previous time. Of course the Central Bank needs to increase to 12.75, remember that the last time it was 13.75.</p>
          <p>It's a movement of the policy monetizing. It's right to achieve exactly a point where it needs to be stood. But if it's an attempt to at least to try to refine the level of those rates. But we continue to have even for 2011 even when they post this 4% of course it should be the reduction support to 4% will be the &#x2013; driven by exact &#x2013; driven by the increased interest rate that we have in this year. But in order to keep the inflation in control of what we need to, how do I say to let go a part of the growth, to sacrifice a part of the growth is the point. But again, in terms of breadth it's just a multiple that you normally use to say 4% or four times, we don't have a specific number, sorry.</p>

          <p>Hi, everyone. I wanted to clarify one thing on the provisioning charge. As I see it, but at least could we looking at the decline in the custom risk of more than 100 basis points in 2010, versus 2009. And in fact, I was looking more at 150 basis points of decline on my calculations. I don't know if that calculation is correct, if that sounds right to you or not? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Sorry, I don't have specifically, I mean the way that you're looking. Maybe we can talk it later to understand. But the point that we &#x2013; the way that we see provisions has acted the way that we already mentioned in this to answer another question, is that we considered the total provisioning in the year would be around 44% of the gross margin of credit, as reported in slide number 12. Unfortunately, I don't have exactly the way that you're seeing this. So maybe we can &#x2013; refine this later if you don't mind.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning. Just a quick question here on the IT CapEx program. I think the CEO mentioned R$4 billion for 2010. Can you just clarify as to whether that is expensed or capitalized and amortized over time?

        <plist>
          <p>When Trabuco mentioned R$4 billion on investment, it includes everything that we invested in Brazil, which includes the investment that normally we have in IT. I would say that the most portion of this is a normal basis, you don't be &#x2013; I don't need to be worried about this in terms of projection in the future, the most part, because it's things that we as Trabuco mentioned is 20% higher that we had, last year, okay, the impact in the numbers the next year. You can see that could be marginal, I would say. The newest thing you hear is about the &#x2013; that we are planning to open 250 new branches. It will demand close to maybe R$300 million only, and the rest of course would have a part of the IT program that would have more &#x2013; we are investing a little bit more that we normally invest. But it's something that has been happening since the last two or three years, all right? So I don't think it should be impact so much the &#x2013; your projections in the future.</p>

I mean, do you have any data you can share with us, or any kind of color you can give us in terms of how that is going in terms of penetration into those socioeconomic classes, say, how you are penetrating the C class? What your level of penetration is now relative to where it was maybe two years ago? I don't know if you have anything like that or maybe we can talk about that after the call.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. A lot of my questions have been asked. But maybe I can &#x2013; I can just ask a question on asset quality, which you focused on in your presentation ex-Banco Ibi loans to individuals delinquent more than 90 days, improved quarter-on-quarter. Can you provide us with a sense of the movement by product, especially was there any product &#x2013; consumer product that showed deterioration in asset quality rather than improvement, is there anything that's not getting better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, Abreu speaking. If &#x2013; when you have deteriorations, I'd say, it's more &#x2013; if you only credit card you could live apart of this. Credit cards keeps the, during the period give the hedge, a very good, good, it'll have a &#x2013; it stayed very good during this period. It didn't have so many impact in this &#x2013; in credit card. The other lines all of them that will have movement too, will have a deterioration. So now, we are going back, all of them is coming back in the good opportunity. I don't know if I answered your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean &#x2013; I mean, maybe I mean, I'm just thinking like some of the areas, I mean you mentioned that on average we are seeing NPLs move back to pre-crisis levels. But for example, in the auto business, what did we learn through this crisis, is there segments that you would rather not be as active in? We've seen some of the market participants say that very used cars, let's say, cars over seven years of age had very substantial losses and some have backed away from that business entirely. I don't know if you can give us any comments on the auto space and if your strategy has changed. Clearly, we're seeing you grow much slower in the auto space or your expectation is to grow much slower in the auto space this year 2010.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, we understand that we, the credit you need to be very careful at all the time. When the economy is going very good, you need to be very careful with credit. You don't &#x2013; not only when the economy is not good and is going so good. What has happened that when we have a change in the cycle like you had this, even that with all the &#x2013; all the care that you have with the credit of course you need to be effective is different of course.</p>
          <p>We understand that the &#x2013; what we &#x2013; I think this even for us we have some internal comments about this. This crisis was in a &#x2013; you understand what we're going to say now, right. This crisis for us could be very important for us because we have been growing credit for a long period, three or four years and did not have any moment that we have some movement like this, right. That's why I think it was important for us to &#x2013; and to prove for us or for the markets that we have very, very good approach in terms of credit.</p>
          <p>Of course we felt what happened I think when you have a big change in the cycle like this. But what's important too that we have condition to absorb &#x2013; absorb what happened. That's why the bad thing that we have to take from this movement, I would say. Of course lines of credits, we &#x2013; some credits that we need to be changed some movement, the models we are improving everyday and every month, it depends on the &#x2013; sometimes some practice of one model that explains better in a moment, and in another moment, it could change. So, something is very &#x2013; something that you need to be very careful of every time.</p>

          <p>Hi, everybody. I'm &#x2013; I have two questions. One is regarding, I have some sell-side analysts here expecting to see an increase in Brazil requirement. So, I was wondering if &#x2013; what do you expect and you have incorporated in your projections?</p>
          <p>And another question is regarding the investments and how you're going to grow more on the corporate side, because I think if it's true that we're going to have a lot of investments, maybe we should see more capital markets activities this year. So I was wondering if you did &#x2013; part of your fee income grow, it's because of this higher capital markets and if you are somehow dividing what is going to be just corporate loans and what is going to be capital market activities.</p>

          <p>Okay. Flavia we understand that we can have some change in Visa requirements once the Brazilian government start a movement to take out of the uncycled policy they create. But it was a standard it won't affect us &#x2013; our budget for the &#x2013; it will affect the liquidity of the system of course, but once we &#x2013; now we have a very, very high level of liquidity. I don't think it will be affect too much in our net income at the end.</p>
          <p>And the other point, you are right when you say, you are correct when you say that in the last quarter we expect to grow 20 to 26, and just to answer a question like this in the Portuguese section, it was exactly the point. Maybe you won't see these in the Portugal portfolio because we don't know exactly where we are going to grow. Maybe you are growing in some securities like debentures, like notes and others then to grad. Maybe we need to show to post the mark. But in terms of risk, where it's in the growth will be decided. All right. Maybe you see this in other lines of the balance and not in the credit, in other words.</p>
