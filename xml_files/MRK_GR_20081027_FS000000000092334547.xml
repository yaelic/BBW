          <p>Good day, and welcome to the presentation results, Merck Q3, 2008 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to the turn the conference over to Mr. Sascha Becker. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen also from my side, and thank you very much for joining the Merck KGaA call and for webcast of the third quarter 2008 results. We have posted the quarterly investor relations presentation on the Merck website this morning, and we'll refer to these slides during the call.</p>
          <p>You may have recognized that we have restructured our quarterly presentation. To simplify your analysis, a comprehensive number set is provided now in a separate excel sheet available in the Investor Relations section of Merck KGaA's website ready for download.</p>
          <p>Today's executive participants include Dr. Karl-Ludwig Kley, Chairman of the Executive Board, Elmar Schnee, Head of Pharmaceuticals, and our Chief Financial Officer, Dr. Michael Becker, who will review the performance of the Chemicals divisions, as well as group financials.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements and that actual result may vary from management's current expectations and I refer to the disclaimer including in today's presentation.</p>
          <p>With that Dr. Kley will now start our prepared remarks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Our quarterly and nine months results demonstrate we are delivering against our financial goals and commitments to investors. They also affirm that our strategy implementation is on track.</p>
          <p>The overview of key group financials on slide four shows core EPS up 19% year-to-date to &#x20AC;4.76 per share, due to operating growth and improved financial results. Our net debt position has improved again by &#x20AC;255 million during Q3. Today we have almost no financial debt to banks outstanding.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow remains strong at 579 million, below last year due to higher working capital requirements. For the three quarters, all four divisions have contributed to top line growth. Merck Serono is up 11% growing at a rate nearly twice of the industry, which is growing according to IMS with 5 to 6%.</p>
          <p>Liquid crystals grew by 6.5%. Negative currency effects have influenced the results considerably. Organic revenue growth was 19%. The operating results of Merck Serono improved considerably by 15%. Liquid crystal results are again influenced by the mentioned currency effects, so ROS remained strong at nearly 48%.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the strategies, we are measuring our numbers against our business strategies and look at the financial results if strategies generate. Slide six is intended to remind you of the strategic priorities of each of the four divisions of Merck. We have reoriented our quarterly presentation to consistently update you on our progress against these guiding strategies as we go forward. I won't review each element in detail now, most of them are familiar to you, but what I would like to point out is the divisional strategies highlighted here in that chart are consistent with the business model of Merck as a group.</p>
          <p>The financials of Merck are known and they are of value as such in these stormy times, and so is also our business model. Our business model derives its strength and character from various central principles. We manage risk diversification across the two sectors, pharmaceuticals and chemicals, with different industry cycles and also different exposure to the economic drivers.</p>
          <p>Across all these businesses, our product portfolio has only modest cyclical exposure. This is true for segments such as pigments, automotive, some areas in the Liquid Crystal Display business. Nevertheless, we feel well prepared for even recessive tendencies which could come up in 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving up to page seven, you can see that we have made good progress in each division delivering against the strategy. And I should even report on the progress of Merck Serono in detail. But aside from some global progress, regional implementation remains of utmost importance to us. Examples of that include the launch of Erbitux for colorectal cancer in China and in Japan and the filing of Gonal-f for ovulation induction for infertile women in Japan.</p>
          <p>Within consumer health care, we have invested more in marketing and selling to build this strategic plan, and that's paying off with improved sales growth. To support the development of innovative efficient lighting applications within Liquid Crystals, we acquired Light Tech platform in July. Also within LC, we are commercializing the new PSVA technology for TV applications. In PLS, we see double-digit growth, particularly in most Asian markets, and have recently committed special investments into India and China to continue the growth path.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I would like to point out that the nine months results meet the original guidance corridors, which we provided in February. This is something which always remains on the top list -- top priority list of our endeavor to deliver what we promised. As year-end comes closer, we will now narrow our corridors, and Michael Becker will give you more details on that.</p>
          <p>With this I would like to conclude my short introduction, and pass onto Elmar Schnee and his fascinating story about Merck Serono.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, very much. Let's starts with Merck Serono's key financial. The division's overall results were at the top and the bottom line driven by organic revenue growth of 17% as our strategic brands all contributed to the 13% increase in sales.</p>
          <p>Royalty income continued a steady trend of growth from higher sales on Royalty-driving products particularly. The 32% increase versus last year was unusually high because of a change in accounting related to our U.S., co-promoted sales that was implemented in Q3 last year, which reduced volatility in that quarter.</p>
          <p>The increase in marketing and selling support ongoing programs such as the new ERBITUX launches, the Rebif new formulation launch in the EU, rollout of new devices for Gonal-f, and SAIZEN, as well as regional expansion in Asia and Latin America, and higher commissions to Pfizer due to strong Rebif growth in the USA.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses are in line with our plan to rebalance and build the clinical portfolio and also included a &#x20AC;14 million in one-time cost associated to terminate all the privatized project as matuzumab in oncology.</p>
          <p>Our return on sales remained strong at 26%. Last year's core ROS of 29.3% was unusually high due to the timing of some marketing costs and lower R&amp;D expenses. Free cash flow was 120 million lower versus last year, due mainly to a restructuring and receivable financing of Italy. Additionally, we received about 20 million cash from the sale in the last year's quarter.</p>
          <p>You can see the details of sales growth for our key brands on slide 11. ERBITUX sales gained 13% over last year, but were down sequentially due to the metastatic colorectal cancer label transition in Europe, which I will review momentarily. Worldwide REBIF sales were up 10% to a record &#x20AC;338 million, due to its favorable benefits risk profile. Organic growth was 15%.</p>
          <p>European sales of REBIF increased 7% due to higher prescription volumes, while US sales jumped 27% in local currency reflecting the benefit of higher prices and net patient acquisition. We boosted Gonal-f sales 11% by implementing regional strategies. In certain countries -- this mature facility markets like the US, we succeeded in gaining share from competition while in other countries with low market penetration, Asia and Latin America, our growth is coming from market expansion.</p>
          <p>Our cardio-metabolic product has maintained its pricing strength also due to regional focus. It grew 36% outside the EU, due to its use for both, hypertension and heart failure. The line extension Glucophage XR and Glucovance have sustained growth in this family. Strong cash flow contribution from this product will be used to build our priority therapeutic focus area, oncology, autoimmune/inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
          <p>Turning to Erbitux on slide 12. Sales in Q3 grew 13% to &#x20AC;134 million compared to last year's quarter. This is slower growth compared to 24% in the second quarter, was the consequence of the tradition &#x2013; of the transition to a new EU label that simultaneously added first line use in combination with all kinds of chemotherapies while limiting treatment only. This is a short-term trend that does not cause us concern.</p>
          <p>The drivers in play here include KRAS screening, establishing reimbursement for the first line mCRC and oncology in the first line. KRAS screening of mCRC patients in EU has increased throughout 2008. And since the label change in late July, the debt method is a standard practice. These are being implemented from an increasing number of sources with a typical turnaround time of one to two weeks. We are establishing first line metastatic colorectal cancer reimbursement on a country-by-country basis. These discussions have no impact on the ongoing reimbursement in patient treatment in second or third line metastatic colorectal cancer or head and neck cancer.</p>
          <p>As of today, we have first line reimbursement in 11 new countries including the large market of Germany and Spain. This process can take up to a year or longer, but we expect to have most markets covered before 2009 begins. The primary driver of Erbitux growth during 2009 will be the increased penetration in first line metastatic colorectal cancer KRAS wild-type patients, and here we remain confident. There are 128, 000 first line patients, about twice as many as second and third line combined.</p>
          <p>Duration of the treatment in first line can be up to twice as long as third line. Up to 65% of our colorectal cancer patients have KRAS wild-type tumors. So you can see that even with the addition of KRAS screening, the available European metastatic colorectal cancer opportunity for Erbitux has multiplied by a factor of three or four. This European summer holiday season immediately following the Erbitux label approval on July 23, ours was only started in earliest, during September. So, Q3 sales tell us little about first line adoption. A feedback from field visits and the European Society of Medical Oncology or ESMO confirms that oncology see a real advantage to having a tailored therapy option with ERBITUX and the KRAS biomarker. They like tailored therapies because they provide a substantially higher likelihood of the patient response and benefit.</p>
          <p>Additionally, oncologists recognize that in mCRC wild-type tumors on the ERBITUX, when combined with today's standard chemotherapies, has consistently higher efficacy, including outstanding response rates and resections rates of liver metastases. Data presented at ESMO including the CELIM neoadjuvant study and data on CRYSTAL showing a strong trend towards long survival, beyond 24 months, affirm that ERBITUX would be an appropriate choice for almost any first-line patient with KRAS wild-type tumors.</p>
          <p>From Q4 on, we anticipate acceleration adoption in first-line metastatic colorectal cancer in Europe as well as increasing sales in Japan following the approval of product pricing there in August for second and third-line metastatic colorectal cancer treatment. We achieved an 18% agreement to European pricing. In Japan, Merck has co-promotion rights with Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone under which Merck is booking the total product sales for ERBITUX, but we share the cost with our two partners. Merck is paying 4.75% royalty on total sales.</p>
          <p>Regarding RAPTIVA, we were recently notified by Genentech of a case of PML in a 70 year old man with chronic plaque psoriasis, who had received RAPTIVA for more than four years. The patient who had no confounding factors associated with PML, subsequently died. We have now convinced the EMEA and the physicians to more thoroughly evaluate the risk and benefits of RAPTIVA, and to update the RAPTIVA level and determine if further action is needed.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 14, and the review of recent progress in our late stage pipelines, the second half has already been a busy period in terms of new regulatory opinions and market authorizations. During Q3, we received the mentioned ERBITUX marketing authorization in the EU and Japan. And we also filed for approval in non-small lung cancer in Europe.</p>
          <p>Last Friday, we received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, CHMP for approval of ERBITUX plus chemotherapy for first line recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. This was a record approval based on the compelling results of the EXTREME study, which was the foundation of our filing package. You will recall that we filed for this indication only in June.</p>
          <p>There are approximately 100,000 patients for this indication in Europe, and we anticipate adoption will be fast compared to the local advanced indication for ERBITUX plus radiotherapy, which we received in April 2006. We expect initial sales in Q1, 2009.</p>
          <p>We also received in September a positive opinion for KUVAN, on an all treatment for patients with phenylketonuria PKU or BH4 deficiency that should also lead to initial sales during Q1 2009. This could be a treatment option for 20 to 50% of the 35,000 diagnosed patient population on our records. We also announced updates for two placebo-controlled Phase III studies in patients with the first clinical event for treatment of multiple sclerosis who are at the risk of conversion to clinically definite MS. First, we complete enrollment in the 517 patient REFLEX study with Rebif and expect results in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Second, we also started enrollment in the 600 plus patient ORACLE study that will evaluate cladribine tablets in a similar patient population. The next update of cladribine tablet development for MS will be the top-line announcement of the data from the CLARITY Phase III study in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis early next year. The drug safety monitoring board for the study has not highlighted any unexpected safety signals from CLARITY, which provides us with confidence in moving ahead with ORACLE.</p>
          <p>We have a number of Phase II and III studies underway in Atacicept for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, optical neuritis and multiple sclerosis. Merck Serono recently discontinued one study in ongoing systemic lupus erythematosus development program, the Phase II Aspreva's lupus nephritis study following the observation of an increased risk for severe infection. Infections were likely the result of the underlying significant disease activity and the continued use of several immunosuppressive medications. This combined with mycophenolate mofetil or MFS, corticosteroids and atacicept in patients with kidney disease, a clinical program in atacicept can generalize SLE and other indications are not affected, but study investigators has to ensure that no patient receiving atacicept is currently treated with MFS.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we have outlined Merck Serono's catalyst for the next 12 months, level of which I have already mentioned. In Q4, we expect to see some additional FLEX data presented at the Scientific Congress, followed by Phase III safinamide and levodopa results in advanced Parkinson's patients during the first half, as well as the CHMP opinion lung cancer Erbitux reorganization in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Moving on to consumer health care, which reported total organic revenue growth exceeding 13%, driven by performance in strategic brands within four key heath themes, mainly cough and cold. Advertising and intensified sales activities consistent with our brand focus increased selling and marketing expenses. We have delivered a return on sales of 12%. This division is well positioned to continue delivering growth at the best market rates and improved return on sales.</p>
          <p>Now, Michael Becker, will review the chemicals business and group financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We are now on pages 20 and 21 of the handout. Liquid Crystal revenues of 239 million were solid, inline with both Q3 of last year and sequentially versus Q2. Organic growth versus last year was 12%, a decent result given the slowing of production for panel manufacturers, particularly the Taiwanese AUO and Chi Mei.</p>
          <p>The negative currency effect was 12%, a slight improvement from Q2's 14% negative. The year-to-date average rates are used to calculate the Q3 currency effect, the sequential effect is not as significant as they move in the US dollar spot rate. But we're pleased to see some modest improvement.</p>
          <p>Operating result was 6% below last year at 112 million and return on sales was 47%. While Q3, ROS is an improvement from Q2, it remains down from last year for the same reasons; currency effects dropping from the top to the bottom line, regular trends of modest in-price erosion for higher volumes and somewhat higher selling expenses and R&amp;D to sustain our leading market position in Liquid Crystals.</p>
          <p>This allows us to deliver customized solutions and new technologies such as PSVA. R&amp;D spending also supports continued development of potential successor technologies, including Organic Light Emitting Diodes or OLEDs as well as possibly new applications such as lighting with very little offsetting rhythm.</p>
          <p>The cash flow of the business improved 24% to 130 million, due to higher working capital efficiency. In order to provide you some insight into the dynamic industry, we have incorporated general requirements from the industry as well as challenges and our responses to those.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, there are mixed signals in the markets. We hear that some players are delaying their capacity expansion plans, while others are intensifying their capacity plans in order to position themselves in the market for the long-term. Overall, the display price erosion has been steep; but prices here appear to be stabilizing. Consumer demand for TVs was still robust in August. But there is uncertainty how consumer behavior and overall economic development might be impacted from the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>As a general comment, we found in statistics that historically there is no correlation between GDP growth and TV panel growth. Corning, which is regarded as one of our closest comparables in the industry is forecasting in a 15 to 25% increase in the panel glass revenue. Overall this result is consistent with the market outlook discussed by Bernd Reckmann in July, and we remain on track to give a full year ROS within our guidance range.</p>
          <p>Revenue for performance and life science of 301 million was also in line with last year and up 3.7% organically, but the operating result improved 30% to 37 million. We announced on August one price increases of 5 to 15% on most PLS products that were implemented in the following weeks, which should offset increased expenses going forward.</p>
          <p>Last year's operating expenses included restructuring cost for the US and Swiss operations. Cash flow was half of last year's level due to higher working capital requirements and capital expenditures for pigments. Within PLS product mix, we saw growth in life science solutions approaching 8%, but we also experienced a 9% drop in pigment sales due mainly to severe weakening automotive coating and cosmetic applications. Regionally, strong organic growth continued, with 10% growth in Asia and 6 in Latin America, but this was negated by currency effects.</p>
          <p>I'm now coming to page 25, and as far as the Group Financials are concerned, the numbers are now provided in separate excel sheets. But I will no longer guide you through the tables and numbers, however, when there are questions on specific figures or lines, I'm more than happy to provide you the explanation and background for the figures.</p>
          <p>For Q3, organic revenue was double-digit in all divisions except PLS. Currency continues to reduce the top line, especially in Liquid Crystals. Cash flow decreased by 4% compared to last year mainly due to shifts in working capital needs in the various divisions. Core EPS improved 5% due in part to a 60 million improvement in the financial result, associated with reduced net debt, as well as a lower tax rate.</p>
          <p>For clarification purposes, we again incorporated in the presentation deck on slide 25, the background on the IAS practices regarding the consolidation and translation of the foreign subsidiaries into the euro-denominated profit and loss statement. According to IAS Standards, the translation has to done on the moving average exchange rate starting on January 1 each year. The moving average of the US dollar is one example, but an important one for the first nine months 2008 was 1.52 per euro, compared with the full year 2007 moving average rate of US$1.37 to the euro. This is a depreciation of 11%. So for translation purposes the spot rate of currently 1.34 is not taken into consideration. The current levels only helps to reduce the moving average modestly.</p>
          <p>Let's assume the current US dollar levels are maintained and they are now already, again, consistently below the 1.34 mentioned, until year-end, this means that the moving average exchange rate for the dollar would end up at around US$1.48 per euro, which is still a depreciation of more that 8% versus last year. So even if the dollar spot rate in Q4 2008 remained below last year's level we will not see a positive currency effect in 2008, but we will see an elevator effect in January 2009. We have resumed revenue hedging of US and Taiwanese dollars and yen for Q4 and for a portion of anticipated revenue in the first half and second half 2009 and we are moving quickly into 2010 taking advantage especially of the very favorable yen exchange rate which we haven't seen since many years.</p>
          <p>Low debt, a strong balance sheet and steady cash flow are the hallmarks of our financial position and worth a lot, especially in today's market environment. We believe Merck is in a very strong position to weather whatever the future may hold. We have only 566 million in net financial debt and with &#x20AC;1 billion in bonds maturing in 2010 and 2012 we have virtually no short-term bank debt.</p>
          <p>Most of our cash balance, about 400 billion, is located in short-term accounts at what one might call quasi-autonomous government organization or Quagos as opposed to Quangos, such as German Landesbanks which are highly capitalized with private deposit and possesses relatively strong cash balance. Our exposure to marketable securities, such as third-party equity investments and derivatives, is immaterial at around 100 million. Any potential write-downs would be immaterial as well. Lastly, we have the added flexibility provided by a 2 billion syndicated loan facility in place through 2014 that we have not drawn up to-date. Our balance sheet includes another very big and important amount, 8.1 billion in intangible assets, over 6 billion of which are related to the Serono acquisition. These assets are subject to periodic impairment testing which could result in non-cash impairment charges to our P&amp;L in future periods including Q4.</p>
          <p>Now to the outlook, Merck is on track to deliver against the guidance corridors we provided in February and recently confirmed analysts consensus. Now, we are three quarters through 2008, so it is possible to narrow our guidance corridors. Merck Serono has remained rock solid throughout 2008. It can deliver results in the middle of its ranges, with revenue growth of 8 to 10% for return on sales between 24 and 26%. In spite of the currency impact within Liquid Crystals and the slower display area growth that has emerged in the second half, we have enough visibility to Q4 orders that we are confident we should end up at the low end of the original guidance range at 5 to 6% revenue growth and 47 to 48% return on sales. For the Group, we foresee revenue growth of 6 to 8%, core return on sales between 23 to 25%.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation and we are now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will take our first question from Erica Whittaker from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I've got a question about Michael Becker's comments on the Liquid Crystal business, and you said historically television sales were not related to GDP growth. So first of all, I was wondering if you had data for the depression era, because I think that television was invented just before that, but seriously are you bullish then about '09, or are you cautious then in Liquid Crystals? And then secondly, just I wanted to know what proportion of the PSL sales and EBIT, and if you can give us a ballpark is on specialist pigments that are consumer exposed, excuse me -- for automotive and cosmetics as you said? Then I've just got a question on KRAS testing, that I can ask more after?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If we start with the Liquid Crystals, the main driver of Liquid Crystals has historically been events rather than economic developments, events like every year Christmas or sports events and so on. I think we didn't want to suggest that if we have a real depression that Liquid Crystals sales are unaffected, but so far we are not talking about a depression, and for our businesses, we do not anticipate a depressive development, we think that our business will be stable. The next question, ballpark area of pigments in the industrial area, I have to postpone this answer later, perhaps you can --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your question about KRAS then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I just had ask question about whether you have received reimbursement for first line use of Erbitux. Generally, are the authorities reimbursing for the KRAS test as well, and I was also wondering what proportion of clinical centers in Europe approximately can now get the results of a KRAS test with that one to two-week turnaround that you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In general, that KRAS test is reimbursed, but since this is not under a direct reimbursement, but not really under a separate box where you have less restrictions that is not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding how many hospitals have internal capabilities, I can't tell you in the European base, because there are still too many hospitals in each country to come up with this number. But it's still regularly improving and we are still rock unique to get everybody involved.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how far away, would you expect that most of the major centers to be &#x2013; to have the testing online with the good turnaround period by the end of this year or sometime in the first half of next year. When do you see all that that will be comfortably covered?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. I just wanted to ask two quick questions. Firstly, Mr. Becker about working capital, it just appears over the last two or three quarters we're seeing negative working capital. I'm just trying to understand the makeup of the significant rise that seems in accounts receivable, and also inventories and if you can just maybe talk us through the business dynamics that are causing those effects, whether you're seeing any of your customers neglecting to pay, for example?</p>
          <p>Secondly then just coming back to Liquid Crystals and appreciate obviously your anticipating a steady outlook, but in &#x2013; on the off chance that we do have a major depression here, what kind of cost flexibility do you have in that Liquid Crystals business? I'm presuming that R&amp;D and SG&amp;A are somewhat fixed and obviously the cost of goods is where you might have a degree of flexibility, can you talk us through how easy it is for you to sort of adjust to perhaps a lower demand for liquid crystals? Or just what portion of cost to fix would you say in that Liquid Crystals business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, working capital, perhaps we have an increase in the accounts receivable, one is structural because we have a change in our policy of showing receivables due to a different factoring set up. So the Italian receivables for the hospital business are now in our balance sheet and are causing sort of an elevator effect in the free cash flow which has been approaching 200 million. This effect will be softened in the fourth quarter when we are starting to collect now receivables of our own. We also, of course, see the effect of our increasing hospital business in Southern Europe where there is a tradition of social security systems paying but paying sometimes after a very long time. And this portion becomes bigger. As far as inventory is concerned there is no such development, but there is a fluctuation in inventory levels due to new product introductions, or new formulations in the market.</p>
          <p>Now the more difficult question is what happens if we will have depression to LC? By nature, I would propose to cross this bridge, when we meet it. But of course, one always has to be prepared for major adverse events. I can't see that a depression will only affect the liquid crystals business in chemicals. Although, we think that we are rather recession proof with our strong stance in regulated market, I think this is more an overall problem of liquid crystals, and PLS and also part of CHC.</p>
          <p>We are in our production very flexible, but if the flexibility stems from being fully protection. So, if only liquid crystals are affected then we can use this equipment for other purposes. If the whole company is affected, then the other purposes aren't there.</p>
          <p>I think for us, it's more important, do we see at the moment a depression in our businesses, in our world, and we don't. I think that is the most important thing that I would like to get across. We will certainly have the appropriate reactions, if contrary to our expectation depression comes. But at the moment we don't see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just follow-up on that, then just how much visibility ahead of time do you have to something like, say, liquid crystals business demand? In the past, you have indicated that it was a relatively short timeframe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that remains so. Yes we have from the figures there is no such thing like long-term order inflow. But of course, we see that our customers are holding high capacities and adding capacities and we are confident that somehow these capacities will be filled.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Holger Blum, Deutsche Bank. I just had a question on hedging. You mentioned that you did start an opportunistic hedging. Could you give us a hint at what rate and how much of your dollar and NT exposure you have hedged at what rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would be too long a story because we started at 1.58, very cautiously to hedge. And we hedged again at 1.48 and 1.42. We have now hedged at 1.24. And the yen we have hedged at 1.32 and at 1.14. And the rate of 1.14 is the one that really triggered us now to go there into that, what we would call, big time. So a longer time horizon, higher rates, but I don't have an average hedging number because that changes everyday. I don't think it's a very meaningful figure in a moving environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But at least the basis historically is clear now. You've had the negative impact from currency in the past that has been fully reflected by your reported numbers and there are no hedging gains or losses, although we have a clear basis going forward. And then the currency in 2009, depending on the levels you've hedged should play big time in your favor given current rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean please don't forget that the translation of the turnover is always at the exchange rate that is applicable at the time. And if we have, just where the currency moves, if we have better hedging then this will be shown under other operating income because then the hedges will render positive results. So the turnover will always be translated at the average existing exchange rate. And we hope that we'll be better starting January then because we are starting it new, then in January we would have a very favorable translation of the exchange rate of yen and dollar and also from Taiwan and Korea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. Then one more question on Erbitux. Could you give us some more details on the reimbursement you have received in the individual countries, i.e., to what extent we could expect when we'll have sequential acceleration in the fourth quarter? And how you would see the timing of the transition period of Erbitux, if you have swing? Whether do we expected in Q4 already or should we anticipate that about in 2009 on a sequential basis or year-over-year comparison?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reimbursement which we had so far are more or less in line with the price which we had to follow for second and third line. This is actually our strategy. And having the KRAS actually made Erbitux cheaper because we have increased efficacy on a set of patients that are Erbitux dosed. So in current economic terms we are more attractive as to KRAS and we will use this argument of course to maintain the price. And so far that's worked.</p>
          <p>Regarding the KRAS testing, I believe that you will see in the second half of the fourth quarter an acceleration of Erbitux. We had followed that in few occasions of hospitals which have the full testing capabilities and we have seen some very nice increases in these hospitals. So I have any confidence that as soon as the testing will come online that we will see a better utilization of Erbitux that in aspect to the growth trend which we are more used to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with regard to first line, did you ever see European reimbursement in the major markets already or did these --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No we request, the biggest one are for Germany and Spain. And there are few smaller ones mainly in the Northern European area, but we worked the due diligence in France. And we should get them before the 2009 will start, because the patients need Erbitux and urgent drug.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I had three questions on the Safinamide Phase III program, which I understand has experienced some delays. Firstly, when can we expect the start of the Phase III trial in advanced Parkinson's?</p>
          <p>Secondly, should we still be anticipating Phase III MOTION data in 2009? And thirdly, finally, are we still on track for 2010 filing in both indications? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it seems the studies are events driven, we cannot really say when the results are coming out. We had delay in recruiting based on some testing requirements in the clinic and supply, but this is now resolved. And we will restart the trial as soon as it's feasible. There is also some issues with renal degradation, which we found in some animal models, which leads to discussions with the authorities. But this is not an unusual thing, some other products in the Parkinson's disease arena has the same findings as we have seen. And we take this serious and we're in discussion, but so far there has been &#x2013; the studies have not been halted because of this finding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, maybe I could just follow-up then and ask what sort of delay has been built in by these extra requirements in terms of pre-clinical testing? Are we looking at a six-month delay for the trial, because my understanding is that it's still yet to start?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. Three questions, if I may. The first one is with regards to the margins for Merck Serono. The second one will be in the Liquid Crystals division, and the third one on the pipeline. First, regarding Merck Serono, if we take the middle of the guidance for the core operating results for full-year 2008, we have implicitly drastic erosion of the margin for the last quarter of the year by 8 margin points. What's behind &#x2013; can you please give us more clear &#x2013; is that R&amp;D, is that SG&amp;A?</p>
          <p>The second question on the Liquid Crystals, can you please give us breakdown of volume and price for this quarter and your assumptions for the remaining quarter of the year and beyond if possible?</p>
          <p>And the last question on CLARITY, you told us that you should publish the topline results early '09. Can you give us more details on the disclosure policy? Do you expect to publish first press release with just the topline and than the full results maybe at a medical conference or everything directly in a press release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually the deterioration of last quarter is 2 percentage points, not eight. I don't know where you've seen the eight. There are several reasons for this. We have seen in the last quarter between deferral and defaults exactly the same happening. It's based on the phasing of the marketing and sales cost, which sometimes we should develop when facing them.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we had here soon to be launched and we accelerate expenditure also in this regard to have a successful launch. And the third issue is that the R&amp;D with &#x2013; run closely to 1 billion this year, we had last year only 890 I think it was, which makes all the difference marked in the fourth quarter. If you take this into account I guess they are more or less the same.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Liquid Crystals, we have always given a guidance that the prices erode by the between 5 and 10%, and this is correct at the current environment and this is &#x2013; also remains correct looking forward. And if you take our nominal growth at the 12% currency and 5 to 10% price erosion then you have the volume.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>It's Claudia Lacatos from Sal Oppenheim. Good afternoon. My question centers around Erbitux and the new discussions and the research finding on the new genotyping on the BRAF. Is that &#x2013; how important are those findings in colorectal cancer? And is there anything you can say on other indications like the BRAF distribution in lung cancer or how that might influence the breast cancer trials? Is there anything can say that already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we can't because the study, which was published about BRAF was I think an analysis on 11 patients. So on 11 patients you cannot have some statements done, what that seems to mean for the treatment. So I think it's by far too early to say this and it's &#x2013; we will do further investigations. We have a big move in biomarker reserve for any of our compound already including addressing this Erbitux. That's the reason we have correct indication and we will do the following, but currently I think there's absolutely no influence on the Erbitux coming from this side.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Three questions if I may. So firstly, perhaps you could some indication of the current percentage of your patients with colorectal cancer who are receiving Erbitux, getting it reimbursed, but yet have yet &#x2013; have yet to have KRAS assay. So patients to Erbitux, getting Erbitux reimbursed within a KRAS assay, and that's one?</p>
          <p>The second question is one of your competitors actually breaks out usage and the various indications of their competing assets, i.e. Avastin. I wonder whether you could give us some indication of the percentage of first-line use you have since the label was given earlier in the year? And then the &#x2013; actually, I'll stop there and I will wait for the final question, if I may.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So regarding the market share, if you like, which is reimbursed regardless or KRAS testing, I don't know because that's for each country very much different. So I can't give you. Regarding Avastin what's the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So whether you could just give us some indication of how much first-line use you have actually achieved so far with Avastin and you can choose an individual market where you have secured reimbursements, and I think you mentioned Germany and Spain. If you can give some indication of that and what you're modeling in terms of the duration of use in the first line, because your chart seems to suggest 32 weeks and playing devil's advocate one could argue it may be substantially less than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, for this question regarding first-line use of Avastin I think you're in the wrong company because it would be. Secondly, I think our first-line penetration is already on a low-single digit percentage kind. You see that in first line we have 32-weeks treatment period and I mentioned already before in my presentation that we've a three to four-time potential available from the KRAS first-line indication.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically you are modeling a potential 30-week significantly &#x2013; a longer treatment time in the first-line setting with Erbitux in the KRAS likely for patient, that that's a way you anticipate the field results?</p>

          <p>On an average, yes, because some go over the 32 weeks, if you have rejection it may be lower, but if you take the selling there is no way around Erbitux in KRAS wild-type patients because if you have one served, which is to free of cancer I guess every patient will get it whether it is possible that they have the momentum.</p>

          <p>And then my final question is for Dr. Becker. Could you just confirm that the currency calculation for Liquid Crystals, i.e. the rolling 12-month average is something that has been a historic practice rather then a change, for example, as in the inventory &#x2013; the working capital situation with Italy as you outlined earlier. So, just to confirm that this has been standard practice over recent quarters, that the currency calculation is rolling?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the calculation is not rolling, it is an average for the year. So it's not rolling 12 months. What we have now is 9-month average of the year 2008. In January, we start afresh. It's not rolling, then we have one--.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've got two questions. One is on the Erbitux and the other one is a financial question. So first one is on Erbitux, you mentioned that you'd be presenting further data from the FLEX study in the fourth quarter. And I am just wondering if you could tell us which medical conference you're targeting and further if you will be presenting KRAS sub-group analysis?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the restructuring charges for the Merck Serono division. If I remember correctly in previous conference calls you guided to total cost of around &#x20AC;175 million including this quarter, which was much higher than the first two quarters. Yet you've already reached 178 million. So I'm just wonder if that means that you've already booked all the restructuring costs or if there is more to come in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if my memory serves me well, we have said that it will be closer to 200 than to 175. But even if we said 175, this third quarter was exceptionally high and we don't expect a lot more restructuring costs. So we have reached the end of these measures. And there has not much more to expect in the last quarter. And then we're going to discontinue the restructuring cost or call the restructuring cost integration, we will then enter into normal time.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are several analyses performed currently on FLEX. But regarding KRAS, I would have serious doubt, but of course we will look into this that it makes any difference because you have actually the KRAS wild-type you find in excess of 80% of the patients in the lung. So I'm afraid I and you have to wait until we see these results.</p>

          <p>Yes, just a follow-up question regarding hedging. Can you remind us in 2008, so in this year, how much you hedged because you said for next year at the moment it is 30%? So just to compare apples with apples if we want to do mark-to-market for next year? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I said, this figure changes daily because at the moment we are adding daily to the hedges. And I'm afraid I don't have the actual figure of today and if I had tomorrow it would be obsolete.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm sorry &#x2013; I'm not saying the hedging for next year, I'm just saying in 2008 year-to-date how much you have hedged your exposure?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. I still can hedge for the rest of the year, I mean I can hedge two months if I want to. We haven't hedged 100%. I think we are about to hedge maybe 50%, but this is a ballpark area, I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, because you said that you have already hedged 30% for 2009.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I wanted to know if you hedged already a similar amount or higher amount this year, so which means that basically the positive effect of the lower dollar will be 100% because it's apples with apples?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks, two questions if I may. One question on POF, as you have increased prices for specialty chemicals in August do you already see a negative inventory effect from the end customers? And the second, as some of the chemical companies, do you see negative--?</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure, of course. As you have increased prices for specialty chemicals in August, do you already see negative inventory effects from your end customers as some of your peers in this area have already reported some of those effects? That's my first question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. We haven't.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fine. Second question on acquisitions, do you already see multiple declines for potential targets? And can you remind us on your M&amp;A criteria? And do the financial crisis change your criteria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The financial crisis don't change the criteria. I think multiples are in the beginning just a very rough estimate on what things will cost. I don't know the deciding factor. If we get closer to the project, then and of course we have our own calculation, which is mainly a discounted cash flow method. And for that we need to have a business plan. But we are at the moment in no great project that fills this condition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just as around the topic of recession related exposure, I'm just wondering what your thoughts are about GONAL-f sales? Because I mean just looking back through what Serono reported, I guess the drug was launched in late '90s and in local currencies sales never declined I guess in ten years. I was just wondering, what your expectations are for sales of this product in a downturn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Erica, I think we do roughly just short of 50% of the GONAL-f turnover is paid out of pockets by the patients. I could imagine that if you go into a deep recession that we will see some effect there.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Some couples will not be able to or do not wish to pay for IBS. But it's only half and so we will see something I guess, but it will be not major on the whole division.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So things haven't changed there. And then also with Rebif, are the strong sales in the US, mainly you're seeing the impact from patients leaving Tysabri or are there other dynamics there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think that the main increase was the price element, which was 5% which we took. And one cannot say in terms mainly from Tysabri because I think the latest two cases of PML which we had was not so new, and it comes throughout, but mainly from the other two guys we discussed.</p>
