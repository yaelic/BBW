          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Atlas Copco Q1 Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct the question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to your chairperson, Hans Ola Meyer. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and very welcome to all of you participating on this First Quarter Report Conference Call today. We will follow a normal procedure, which means that I will very soon hand over to our CEO, Ronnie Leten, who will take us through some comments on the first quarter results and other events. And after that, after let's say 10, 15 minutes of that, we will move over to an open Q&amp;A session.</p>
          <p>And with that, I think we just leave it to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Hans Ola, and good afternoon to all of you. As usual, I will go through it and try to keep you together. So I will refer to the slide number. Let's go immediately to slide number 2 where we talk about the highlights.</p>
          <p>Like it says there, a very strong order intake and this we have seen in all businesses, in all business areas and in most all countries I could say this time. So that's nice to see. Also, on the operating margin, last time in the quarter four, I thought it would be a unique moment that we had all three business area above 20%, but we met it again. So I'm very pleased to see that all business areas improved and on top of that, are above 20%.</p>
          <p>And then, I will go immediately also on &#x2013; elaborate a bit on the new business area structure. As you have seen, we have announced the new structure, where we go from three business areas to four business areas.</p>
          <p>So let's go immediately then to slide number 3 sorry, where we talk about the new business area structure. This structure is built to grow. This structure has no IT or no plans that we want to divest any of the businesses. So I want to make that straight statement, so all of you &#x2013; so that we know where we go. This is the structure we built to grow the company.</p>
          <p>And, of course, to strengthen the focus on specific products, on specific customer segments as you've seen specifically on the Construction segment where we will strengthen our effort. It's also to capture all the opportunity in the aftermarket, so we also will establish dedicated organizations in the different business areas to capture all the synergies what we have in the aftermarket. And yeah, I think this slide says also the last bullet point, to increase sales and service synergies between the different businesses not only in Construction, but also in the other businesses.</p>
          <p>Then if we take the next slide, slide number 4, here you see the four business areas, with also the different names and the scope what it all adds and, of course, the pro forma operating margins. And we have reported here the 2010 figures, where you see that Compressor is around SEK 30 billion, with 25% margin; Industrial Technique, of course, it is what it is; Mining and Rock Excavation Technique, which is around SEK 22 billion and having a margin of 22%; and then we have Construction Technique, which consist of our tools, construction tools over the kind of back route, construction engineering and portable compressors and generators and, of course, the related services, which comes out then with 10%. Before the end of the next quarter, so quarter two, we will also give you more pro forma data so you have all the comparisons before we come out with quarter two.</p>
          <p>Then next slide, slide number 5, where we have the new Head of the Mining and Rock</p>
          <p>Excavation, it's Bob Fassl, Canadian citizen. He has worked since 1982 for Atlas Copco, now in the Mining business from inside outside and he will also &#x2013; and has a broad international experience and he will come and live in Stockholm, Sweden. At the same time, we are also looking for a new business area President for the Construction Technique area and that search will start immediately from tomorrow onwards. And that person will go and live in China. So this was about the new structure.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to the topic of the day, and that is about the figures and then I'm on slide number 6. Fantastic order receipt income, as we already said, 33% organic growth. Revenue, 27% up. Solid output. We recognized that we had strong supply chain spreads, so it could have even a bit more if we succeed to get everything out, but yeah it is what it is.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, 21.9%. Operating margin, even with some headwind from currencies, but Hans Ola will elaborate a bit more when we talk about the bridges where it is all coming from, but a very solid result, I would say a record result in this case. Yeah, the rest you can read yourself. You see also operating cash flow is also giving <mark type="ph" /> all the (0:07:05) growth today, which, of course, is less than in the previous quarter, but is still at a good level, so a very good start of the year.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going to slide number 7. Strong growth overall, you see here North America, China above 50% and all the others above 20% growth, so a very solid development. To remind you, of course, 2010 first quarter was not the strongest quarter; it was the quarter where we really saw the click. So we are still comparing with a bit softer quarter, but still it is a good development.</p>
          <p>And let's go through the Americas, the next slide. Yeah, very strong. It's a bit boring that I have to say several times very strong so, but it is an extremely good North America in all businesses, Mining but also our Compressor business, our Tools business is developing very strong. And even we see a favorable demand in our Construction Equipment business and especially when you talk about the rental component.</p>
          <p>South America very, very good, you would say plus 24% is a bit less if we're used to 50%, but remember that here we got &#x2013; the business increase came already end of 2009. So we are comparing here already with higher figures than we did with North America.</p>
          <p>So then let's go to Europe and Africa. Europe is plus 24%. We can say that it is pretty solid and very good, but it's a bit mixed as also before. We see a very good Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Europe you can say development, where the East &#x2013; the southern part is still, yeah, less developing. We see that Spain, Portugal, France, Italy, Greece, these are areas where business is there, but at a very low level. One takeaway maybe when we talk about Europe that Russia was very strong.</p>
          <p>Then Africa, there we have bit of a mixed performance. Southern Africa, Central Africa is doing very well, where Northern Africa and Middle East was a bit and even small negative we had compared to last year, but we also know due to the turmoil what it all meant there. Luckily, we see that Saudi Arabia is not affected. So I'm sure that in the Middle East, for the time being, we will still see good sales coming.</p>
          <p>Then Asia, yeah, an unbelievable performance in China and India, so what made also the region look very well in quarter one. So a fantastic start of the year, and all over good in all products. And then Australia, yeah, what can we say more that it continues to develop again a very strong quarter.</p>
          <p>If you take on this slide and you look that we are now 25% in Asia and 7%, and Australia you see already, 32% of our business is coming from that region.</p>
          <p>Now I'm going immediately to slide number 12 on the same page and, of course, what we can see the currency, minus 10%, very strong negatives but okay, like I said, Hans Ola will talk a bit more on that, what it means for the bottom line. Price, we succeed to get a good development in the market on the pricing so that is good as we also see some cost inflations coming in, so it's always good that we get some recuperation from that in the market, and the volume both on orders received and revenue are high then, respectively plus 31% and 25%. So, yeah, I think it would develop.</p>
          <p>The business areas now, 13 Slide, Compressor Technique first. So a record order intake: plus 31% organic, a very strong order intake from the stationary compressors. Also, we see that the larger compressors are coming back so we like to toast that, improved sales for gas and process compressors. We see a good level there. So that is always good to see also this later cycle business coming in place. But also, we see that the portable compressors and generators are doing very well. And we continue to have a good development for our aftermarket. And, of course, this then, yeah, a very good margin of 23.9% supported, of course, by price what we have seen in the bridge but also from a good sales volume. And, of course, I'll let it to Hans Ola when it comes to the currency effect. And then we had the cryogenic pump business, strong profit, which we acquired in quarter one, so a very good solid record development in Compressor Technique.</p>
          <p>Then we come to Construction and Mining Technique. Again, a record. Strong and record are words I have used now already for 100 times here. Plus 35% organic, very strong in the mining, but I am sure that is no surprise to any one of you, but we also see some good development now coming on the construction equipment, when we talk about our breakers and our Dynapac equipment.</p>
          <p>And again, a fantastic margin, 20.6% and we know here that we definitely had some negative headwind from the currency but yeah, we made it with 20.6%. That is extremely well done from the organization. And we launched a lot of new products in the market, so that makes also us stronger to get more share and dig deeper into the market.</p>
          <p>Then I'm going immediately to Industrial Technique, which is slide number 17. Also here, a very good development, 33% organic. All segments, MDI, GI, all the different brands, performed very well and we see a good development in the Americas and, of course, like I said already several times, we see very good development in India and China and that is going on, but we also see good investment going on in Europe. So that's nice to see.</p>
          <p>And the profitability, 22.7% and here we have most of the currency headwind. So that is a very good development from this business area. If you're making one year 65% more profit, that is well done.</p>
          <p>Then, I'm going immediately to the group total slide, slide number 19. We see summarized orders received compared to last year quarter, plus 26%, and the operating profit, 52% up, giving us 21.9% in margin.</p>
          <p>Now I hand over to Hans Ola, who can give us more about the rest of the figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On this slide, of course, there is not many details, but I can offer a few comments perhaps on the financial net, for example. You can appreciate, by looking at the slide, that the financial net was positive, SEK 69 million, which is strange until you read that we also had a capital gain in this quarter from selling the old, if I use that expression, rental service shares, shares that we got as, if you like, part payment when we divested that business in 2006. And we have stuck, we have hanged on to these shares for a few years, because it has been a negative stock market development, but now lately it has come back and we have started to realize these shares in the market, or monetize them, and that produced a capital gain of SEK 150 million.</p>
          <p>So the interest net was SEK 74 million negative, again, can been seen as a surprisingly low number compared to what we have indicated in the last quarter, perhaps. And the reason was that we had a few adjustments on pension liabilities and a few of those things that perhaps we didn't mention so clearly when we presented the Q4. Going forward, on the interest net, because that's exchange differences and such, it's very difficult to predict, we would expect roughly SEK 100 million per quarter negative, as a fair guess for the coming period.</p>
          <p>If we move down a little bit further, and I should also perhaps say right away that the shares in rental service, we still have about 4.5 million shares left, which means that we expect to continue to generate some more capital gain in the next couple of quarters. It's difficult to predict, but it could be, in Q2, about the same magnitude as in Q1, if share prices don't move too much from where they are today.</p>
          <p>We move down to the net profit between, then, these profit numbers is also tax. We have the tax of about 25%. Tax charge in the quarter, slightly lower than what I think is the norm for the time being, about 26%, something like that and the reason is again the capital gain, which is not affected by tax in this results. It's a tax-free gain on that capital gain, so hence, the total tax rate came down to 25%.</p>
          <p>If we move to the next one is what we call the profit bridge and it's there, of course, to help you understand what has happened since the previous Q1 quarter in 2010 and so comparison year-over-year. And what we can see there trying to adjust for acquisition and structural effects as well as currencies, is that it's still a relatively high flow-through of profit if we compare with the quarter a year ago.</p>
          <p>Now, we all know that a lot of things have happened in that year, so I think we should keep that in mind that this is a bridge if you like not from the previous quarter, but actually from a quarter that lies 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, it's a slightly higher flow-through than we expected and I would say that we believe that the biggest impact that made that is that we have had a very good load in factories, so the absorption has been good in Q1, whereas the actual invoicing, as Ronnie alluded to, might not have been as high as the load of the factories would indicate, but that is something that we expect and, of course, to come further on the road.</p>
          <p>On the currency, again, the number SEK 550 million almost, negative compared to the same quarter last year, is a very high number. About half of it is related to transaction effects and half of it is translation, which means that it's only a portion of that has really affected the margin. If we compare again with currencies a year ago, we indicate in the report also that it has an impact of about 1 percentage point.</p>
          <p>I think I take the opportunity right away to point out that what we do in our accounting in Q1, by adjusting the receivables and payables to the period and rates, which we always do, that is in a way adjusting the result down to a level of currency situation that we expect also for Q2.</p>
          <p>So it's not to be seen as if we have a 1% underlying negative in the margin that will suddenly pop up and increase the margin in Q2. That is not the right analysis of that situation. So we believe that the result of Q1 is very close to the actual currency situation that we see right now. But, if anything, we expect to see more of a slightly more negative currency basket in Q2 than in Q1, and now I'm comparing sequentially as you hear.</p>
          <p>If we move on from there to the balance sheet, I won't spend much time, just point out that perhaps it is surprising to you that the equity have not moved almost anything between December and March, but there are reasons for that. One is the stronger Swedish krona, which is a pure translation effect. Another one is that we have bought back our own shares, to the tune of about SEK 800 million and thirdly, we have also acquired minority shares in our Indian subsidiary. And that, accounting-wise, has the effect of reducing equity right away. It is not an income statement effect for that. So that explains why there is not much movement there.</p>
          <p>On the capital structure, slide number 23, well so far, it continues to strengthen the capital situation of the company, but you also know that we have already decisions to pay out around SEK 11 billion in May and June, partly annual dividend, partly redemption of shares. So that will push up this ratio for the Q2 report when we will come to that, when we are there.</p>
          <p>On the cash flow, I think the only thing to mention is what you can see. It's very, very clear that the operating cash flow, which is everything before structural changes and dividends et cetera, is almost unchanged from last year, but you can see that the much higher operating result has been compensated by a much more negative cash flow impact from working capital, i.e. we are now building inventory in the quarter and we are invoicing more, so we have more receivables on the balance sheet. So that's a little bit in sort the summary of that.</p>
          <p>And so, with that, I hand over to Ronnie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then we come to our outlook where we repeat a bit what we have told so in our previous outlook. So we expect the market to develop and to increase somewhat, but maybe a bit different to take away from previous time is that we see, we believe, good expectations, to have good expectations, in all markets and like it says, but also maybe with the exception in southern part of Europe and more particularly where we see Spain, Greece, Portugal and depending on this, what is all happening further in Northern Africa but I think also that will have a negative effect on the business. But to the rest, we have a rather positive outlook for the next period.</p>
          <p>So should we go now to the questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that, operator, if I hand over to you, if you can give some instructions for the Q&amp;A session then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Johan Eliason. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, this is Johan Eliason at Cheuvreux. Once again, congratulations to a good quarter. If I may, I think the interesting thing in this, what to say today is obviously your new business area structure. If I look at the comparable numbers you've given us, it looks like the business you have taken out from Construction Mining Technique, which I guess is mainly the Dynapac business, had a margin of around 7% last year. At the time when you acquired Dynapac, it had a margin of 11% and you said the target was to get this up to 15%. Is that still your target ambition? And then would that go for the whole new business area margin target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as you see in the figures which we have published now to give you an insight in the Construction Technique profitability, it's for sure and I've said it also when we give a bit of feedback on quarter four. We see that the Dynapac has a low single-digit profitability, where CPO and portable doing in the double-digit level. So that is where we are. Answering your question what would we expect for Dynapac, of course, our ambition is to bring it up in the double-digit level. What you also hint to, it will take us a bit of time, that's for sure, where we thought maybe when we acquired that it would have gone a bit quicker? But, of course, we had the crisis then and all the other changes in the meantime. But definitely, we have the ambition to come up with a stronger profitability as we had, yeah, to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And this new structure, you say you will focus on a new service division for this specific segment. Is that an important driver of the Construction Technique margin potentially you would say going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think the service is the driver for all our businesses, that you have seen that we have pushed on the service side maybe the last six/seven years we have been talking about that and that is no different in the construction area but I think it is also easier to get focus. When we group this business together, you should also see that over time we have extended our product portfolio in the different segments, in the different business area as it was in Compressors, as it was in CMT. So it was time to give all the different divisions the right room to grow and focus. So that is another area where we believe that it can generate better growth and better profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally on this, what you said on the quarterly revenues that you didn't get out everything you wanted but, at the same time, obviously the load factoring, the <mark type="ph" /> pounds (0:29:48) was high. Could you elaborate little bit more on that? Was your actually manufacturing and then putting the finished goods into the inventories waiting for external suppliers or what happened?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you see in our business, we are selling in 178 countries. We are not having factories in all these countries. So we have a lot of equipment in transit. So that is what also Hans Ola hinted that we have a very good load, of course, and we see it also in our inventory. But what I meant more was okay, the book to bill is high. We get plus SEK 21 billion and we only invoice SEK 18 billion. Yeah, then okay, sitting in my share, you said, hey guys we have the whip and for more output. So that is the reason why I said I would like to have more out of that and we create, of course, our own stress in this. And I'm happy what I see that the factory output is increasing. That is the good sign, but it is not increasing, yeah, fast enough compared to the orders received, so I don't know who to blame now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I understand it. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Nico Dil. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like to ask three questions please. First of all, on the relative flow-through, compared to a year ago, you highlighted effectively there was a bit of a positive impact because the load in the factories is a bit higher than your level of invoicing. So am I understanding it correctly that your margins perhaps are a little bit on the high side due to some inventory builds?</p>
          <p>Second question is, around the payables and receivables, which are revalued sort of this quarter, I sort of struggle to understand how in two or three quarters time, we will not see a reverse of that one-off impact as I would normally call it. So I'd like to get a bit of color on it.</p>
          <p>And number three is, I saw for the first time that the pricing went up again to a 2% positive contribution. Is this sustainable? Is this a net pricing effect? Or is this just reflecting the raw material price increases? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the last question and the two others, I'm sure Hans Ola will take these questions. I think on the pricing, and that is also what I said in the previous call, that we see that we have the ability to get price increases in the market and mainly the biggest ones are coming in the Mining business; that is for sure and that, I think, is no surprise for any one of you. But we see also that in industry when it comes to Compressor and Industrial Technique, we also get say a good sustainable development on the price. So I'm using the same words as you use, it's not a compensation but when there is inflation, when there is material price increases, it makes it easier to go the customer and to get that price and that is also that we are doing. But the way I see it and the way I judge it, I think it's sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is more than compensating the raw material price increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You alluded to the comment on the load and the invoicing, if that is indicating that we have had good profit development in Q1. And, of course, you're right that, that is one part that we have enjoyed that, of course, and hence, it comes out for, example, in this flow-through analysis if we call it like that but it's also, of course, seen as we have tremendously high margins reported also. So, of course, there is an element of that. To quantify that is impossible and we don't attempt that. But, of course, going forward, we also continue to see other effects of pure and simple more invoicing, of course, and other effects of the growth that is positive. So this becomes very difficult to say that, yeah, you had a very good profit load in the first quarter and that will sort of go away going forward. That's not what we mean either, but you're right that it has helped the margins in Q1 to come up to this level very quickly that's true.</p>
          <p>On the currency effect, and I agree with you, it is always difficult when &#x2013; and perhaps we are part of the problem in a sense of giving an indication of a currency impact compared with the same period a year ago. And at the same time, the most interesting analysis is, of course, what is going to happen from Q1 to Q2 and Q3 and Q4. So I understand the problematic situation and I just want to say again that when we talk about this revaluation effect of the balance sheet, i.e. the receivables and payables in foreign currency that we do at the end of each quarter, you can more see it as if that effect is helping the quarter to show the real currency rates in that quarter, in a way that you understand that if currencies are sliding to a less and less favorable situation, the beginning of each quarter is, of course, living from the past, if you see what I mean. And that is why we do this or it's not why we do it but when we do this adjustment of the receivables and payables, I would more phrase it like we are adjusting the period's result and the margin to what is going to be the case in the future. Since the flows are not exactly 90 days from start to finish, of course, this is not mathematically perfect.</p>
          <p>So the only thing that I'm absolutely convinced about is this, if you see this percentage impact of currencies from this period end adjustment only as if a reason to say that next quarter will be about a percentage point higher just because &#x2013; if currency rates stay, that is the wrong analysis. But if you say that it indicates that we can have this margin if currency stayed the same, that I would agree.</p>
          <p>We also know, however, that this is not perfect mathematics. So in our own view, we still see that we'd be slight headwind further from the currency situation in Q2 compared to Q1. However, again that is not the projection for the margin, of course, because there are hundreds of other factors, of course, that comes in, but just to try to elaborate a little bit more on that.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Ben Maslen. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. It's Ben from Merrill Lynch. Three questions please. Firstly, just on lots of kind of global events during the quarter. Can you just give us any impact that there was on the numbers from either the Australian flooding, Middle Eastern conflict or Japan earthquake? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regard to Japan, can you give a sense of how your supply chain is looking going forward? Are there any areas where you see potential kind of component shortages. Any issues expected? That's the second question.</p>
          <p>Then just thirdly, on working capital, slightly bigger build than perhaps some people would have expected for the quarter. How much of that would you say is normal for the level of growth that you're seeing at the moment? And how much of that is just due to maybe some delays in deliveries or any strategic inventory build that you need to do given kind of supply chain constraints? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Ben, I will do that. Yeah, on the global events, unfortunately, we had all the event we have seen in Japan where the earthquake came and luckily, we had no casualties directly with our people, neither with their families. And we actually had a small operation close to Fukushima, actually in Fukushima, which we also then abandoned that. So it had a bit of an interruption when it comes to service areas, but when I look to the business as such for us, I must say I think it is a very little effect when it comes to the sales, such I think maybe on the contrary when we look ahead, because it creates business opportunities for rental and for generators on that part. So that is on Japan.</p>
          <p>Australia, like I already said I think in a couple of other questions before, we are not affected much on that area as we are not in &#x2013; we only had one small service operation in that area and that area was also &#x2013; and the majority was coal and you know we are not so much in coal in Australia, so there I think also we have no much effect.</p>
          <p>On the Middle East, there I see some slowing business when you talk about Syria, when you talk about Egypt, when you talked about Algeria. There it goes a bit more difficult, because there is no foreign investment going on. So that means also that that business is a bit slower in these countries. But on the other hand, I see Dubai, Saudi doing very well. So yeah, also it is also here not the big part either.</p>
          <p>Then when it comes to the supply chain, yeah we have a couple of our suppliers there, which were affected in the beginning, but they have started up again. So we get, again, normal supplies for these components. Our own factories, which are more close to <mark type="ph" /> a sector, (40:54) running normal. They don't have any problems to date. It could be most probably that there indirectly will be some problems coming up but, again, it is not major issues, what we have that we have to stop certain production lines or even stop factories. I haven't picked up any of that in the company. So I think also there, we managed very well and we're looking for alternatives, which we've found if we need.</p>
          <p>Then on the working capital, yes, I agree with you. And Hans Ola has already hinted on that one when we talked about the inventory. In relative terms, the inventory has gone up. So there is a bit more inventory than invoicing, so that is for sure. But when it comes on the receivable side, I think we're doing &#x2013; we manage very well. I don't think that that is anything to worry about. It's only the inventory we need to watch. And on one hand, I'm partly pleased because it's good that effect it has produced. Of course, I would like to see it in the invoicing, that would be even better, but unfortunately, Sweden is six weeks from Australia, so it takes a bit of time when you have to ship these products, and it's in that area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And only to add perhaps that we don't see that any abnormities that we have built for purpose certain stocks in certain areas or something. It's an effect of the rather rapid surge of the orders, of course, pure and simple. I think that's what it is.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And maybe if I can, just is to follow up on the currency. I mean, Hans Ola, I think the previous quarter, you gave guidance for what you thought it would be for the whole year. Based on current currency rates, what would you expect now, do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, again, just to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:43:04) the comment that then, of course, every bridge is then compared to the full year 2010 then, in that case. But if we do like you said, everything else equal and look at what we know, it could be little bit higher than what I indicated a quarter ago. So more than SEK 1 billion, and it could be up to SEK 1.5 billion compared to the situation in 2010, and I point that out again.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of James Moore. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi there, everyone. It's James at Redburn. I wondered if I could come back to the overproduction and the absorption issue and see if we could just quantify it a little. Is it possible to say what the overproduction of inventory is as a proportion of revenue? Are we talking 0.5% of sales or 3% of sales? That would help us just think about the margin boost in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And secondly, I wondered if you could say how much of the old CMT division cost base will be shared by both Mining and Construction. And how will you treat internal pricing and margins? And is that something we need to think about?</p>
          <p>And then also, I wondered if you could talk a bit about the mix boost to Compressor and whether what looks to be quite a surprising share for <mark type="ph" /> Master Market (0:44:33) can stay at that level, or whether you'd expect it to drop into the sort of 20s as we move forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You have a lot of questions, James. But I will try to answer as much as I can. Yeah, on the overproduction, we have, let's say, you can &#x2013; in percent, it's a bit difficult doing percent, but I will go back to the answer I've given to Ben, when it comes to &#x2013; we have a couple of percentages more inventory that we normally should have to run an operation, and that is something which has given higher absorption for the factories. So you should think in a couple of percentages higher stock, of higher inventory, that is the magnitude of the load. So it plays a bit in certain areas, but I don't think it will have a tremendous effect on that.</p>
          <p>Then I will take your second question last, because I have a bit difficult to understand, but that I will take, yeah, then the third one, when it comes to the mix and the boost in CT. We have a good load and good working aftermarket. So that we see a very quick development on the top line, and we see also a very solid development on the bottom line, coming from efficiency. And we see that either in the aftermarket, but we see also that in the equipment divisions, which are also bringing good result, because otherwise, you cannot come out with a profitability of 23.9% in the quarter. So the mix, it's getting a bit unfavorable, but on the other hand, you should know also that our equipment is also profitable. So it is more an isotopic development what you will see, but still a positive one. Then, James, you have to repeat your second question, because I have difficulties to see what you really hinted to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I've always imagined that businesses like drill rigs were sometimes made in the same plant and then sold to different customers' mining and construction for the same equipment. So I imagine that there is some of the cost base that is going to be shared between these two new divisions of the Mining division and the Construction division. And I wondered whether we should think about how &#x2013; how we should think about your internal pricing and transfer pricing there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm very happy you asked that question, because that's actually a good question and gives me the opportunity to elaborate a bit how the structure will look. You see, in the construction business area, we group three divisions and that is Construction Tools, so that is our breakers, to take it simple; then we have our Dynapac business, if I then use the brand as an umbrella, so the road construction engineering equipment; and the portable compressors and generators; so that we put under the umbrella of Construction Technique.</p>
          <p>In the Mining and Rock Excavation Technique, we have the drill rigs, which are sold to the Mining business, but we also have the drill rigs which are used for civil works like tunneling, ground engineering and other type of quarries, which in some cases, you can also put under the umbrella of Construction, but that we put under the umbrella of Mining and Rock Excavation.</p>
          <p>You should know Atlas Copco is a product-driven, customer-focused organization. So it would be a &#x2013; I don't think it would be wise to have the drill rigs which we sell in Construction to put in the business area of Construction, because then we will lose a lot of synergies, as you also pointed out. We keep this together and I think that is &#x2013; it has been already for 50 years, and I think we don't change that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="ph" /> Klaus Berdwin (0:49:15). Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon. <mark type="ph" /> Dan Cutler (0:49:17). Three questions. First, just on the new business area of Construction. SEK 11.2 billion of revenues, you talked about Middle East being negative. Can you just quantify sort of how negative that was on that new business area? And what percent of sales Middle East represents? And sort of, if there's any sort of impact on the margin, that would be quite useful.</p>
          <p>Second question, just following up on the Dynapac discussions earlier, how big is this now, in terms of revenues? I know you said it was about low single-digit margins, but useful on where we are revenues.</p>
          <p>And then just finally, we're obviously seeing orders in CMT up 35%. We know how strong the mining cycle has been. But I just want to give you &#x2013; if you could give us a sense on where we are in the construction cycle. Are we seeing many quarters of growth? Or is sort of that still ahead of us and we're starting to see some recovery there? So what I guess the question, 35% in CMT, can you quantify roughly what the order growth rate, just approximately, would be in the new business area of Construction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On your first question, I think I, at least, meant to say that the Middle East as such, and then I was talk about countries like Syria, Algeria, Egypt, that that business was negative affected, but on the other hand, Dubai and the other countries around Saudi Arabia are doing fine. So it was not meant to say something about any business area. So it is general. It is as much in CMT as, as much is in CT.</p>
          <p>Then, when it comes to Dynapac and how big it is, I would suggest that we will come up with &#x2013; in a couple of weeks, we will come up with more specific data where you will have a better insight in the different business areas, the four business areas. And I suggest then, when you look to that, that you pose the question, either back to me or to our Investors Relation organization.</p>
          <p>Then the third question, yeah, CMT plus 35% and what Mining and what Construction. First, okay, you will also see that when we get the new figures, when we probably add further transparency, we will speak better for you, it's based on Mining higher than in Construction. And in Construction, we have a bit of a mixed view. Where in Mining, we see it all over the world doing fine, where in Construction, and we have said it also in several previous calls, where we see a good development going on in India, Australia, China, where we were a bit, reluctant and not at all positive when it comes to development in North America and Europe. So there, we are still more to come, let's hope.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And any notice of double booking yet in the mining area? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Today, when I meet these people, they are really having the project. There is a very strong demand for copper. There is a very strong demand for iron ore. These people have real projects. If the world goes on in the development, they will need them, but if we get something like we had in October 2008, yeah, we will get again the stock of these customers and they will say that they don't need them. So that is why we in Atlas Copco must make sure that we are agile, that we have a resilient business model, and that we are quick in reacting when we need our agility. And for the time being, my crystal ball doesn't say that there is any double booking.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Colin Gibson. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. It's Colin Gibson from HSBC. Two questions please. First is perhaps you could just try to summarize for us, and this is a very big area I'm about to ask about, but thinking of the ongoing geographical and product mix development. So I guess we're seeing more OE sales and a bit less MRO sales at the margin. I guess we're seeing a bit more recovery of developed markets and a bit less emerging market growth of the margin, although, to be fair, here in Q1, that's not absolutely clear.</p>
          <p>Anyway, given all those trends, what sort of effect <mark type="ph" /> are that (53:58) having on the margin? Obviously, overall, a pretty good one would seem to be answer, but just trying to get a sense of what the level of dilution, if you like, from some of those effects might be, or whether there's any dilution at all.</p>
          <p>Second question is, it really comes back to what you've been telling us over the last couple of months, Ronnie. You've been quite cautious about the margin. I distinctly remember you saying, for example, that you seem pretty uncomfortable about the consensus EBIT margin, as it was, I don't know a few weeks back of, I think, 21.5% for this year. And then you come out with a 21.9% margin for Q1. So I'm trying to understand, were you yourself positively surprised by Q1? Or are you just a very cautious guy at heart? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, you always make it so difficult for me to answer. But let me first answer the first question. And I think, in other meetings we had before, I also have said, and I make this statement, that I don't mind where we grow, is it either in Europe or Asia, South America. From a margin point of view, I don't mind. We have a good setup in South America. We have a good setup in Asia. We are further developing our aftermarket businesses in these different countries and they are very performant and they really deliver results.</p>
          <p>So from that point of view, when the geographical mix, which is &#x2013; if it's doing and you have seen several discussions we had, you have seen my graph when we made the comparisons of the different years, it will not hurt Atlas Copco in general. So that point, I would say we can rest in piece for that. Of course, we need to work hard to make sure that our factories in India, our factories in South America, our factories all over the world are efficient and top-notch and our product development goes on. But that is the work what we need to do everyday.</p>
          <p>Then, yeah, on the margin, to answer you frankly, yes, I was also delighted to see the result. And the reason why when we met a couple of weeks ago, why I was a bit cautious is also not so much on the price and not on the cost side, because you know that I was rather firm on that. It was more on the currency. There, I had expected more a more negative effect as I saw the dollar moving, as I saw the Swedish moving and the Euro hold its part and I had expected a little bit more on that part.</p>
          <p>But, yeah, it's better to surprise positively, Colin, than to surprise negatively. I hope you join me on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Frederic here at UBS. I'll be quick. Your orders in Compressor Technique were very strong and I apologize if you already gone through this, I came in a bit late. But was there &#x2013; you booked a couple of large orders in power gen and oil and gas. Is that part of the explanation to the strong orders in the quarter? And I remember last quarter was a bit weaker and then you missed those big orders. Could you maybe quantify the impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Yeah, I will answer. First is my yellow birds were doing fine. So I think that the thunder, the canaries were there. I think that the underlying standard business was strong. So there was the stationary, the portables was strong. And on top of that, the little bit late cycle part of the business we have was also strong. So the gas and process, the larger turbo compressors, we had a very good development there when we see the quarter compared to previous periods. So we see also that, that business is developing positively.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Yes, they are meaningful. Yeah, right, otherwise we will not &#x2013; but they're not golden <mark type="ph" /> bait (0:59:19). Yeah, they are meaningful. They are above &#x20AC;10 million orders, yeah.</p>
