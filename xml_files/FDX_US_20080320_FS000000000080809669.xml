        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Mickey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our earnings conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2008. Like many companies, FedEx is facing a challenging economic environment that includes persistently high oil prices, sluggish US growth and significant concerns in the credit markets.</p>
          <p>The FedEx diversified portfolio of transportation solutions and our wide global footprint, however, give us flexibility to adapt to shifting economic conditions. We believe in fact there are significant opportunities to add new customers who appreciate the global FedEx value proposition. Morale among our team members is strong and our service levels are very high. We are concerned by the steep relentless rise in oil prices and we see little justification based on near-term supply and demand conditions to support these prices. There is no doubt speculative trading has driven prices higher, overriding market principles and adversely affecting consumer and corporate spending.</p>
          <p>Our Chief Economist, Gene Huang calculates that the increase in retail gasoline cost since mid-October has resulted in consumers now paying over $1 billion more per week for gasoline for example than they would have at last October prices.</p>
          <p>At FedEx, we believe persistently higher fuel prices and the related effects of our fuel surcharges are reducing demand on a macro economic basis and leading some customers to shift to less expensive services, but fortunately, we have a broad portfolio and are able to offer our customers those types of alternatives. As many as you know, we have been very active over the last couple of years in trying to get the Congress and the administration to come up with a more forward-thinking energy policy and we were gratified with the first step taken last December with the Bill that was passed, which hopefully will have some effects in the months and years to come in addressing this problem.</p>
          <p>Now at FedEx, in particular, we will continue to invest in more fuel-efficient aircraft, vehicles and facilities and we will accelerate the retirement of equipment when we can achieve a good ROI from doing so. As we survey the current economic landscape, we expect limited earnings growth in FY '09 given the current outlook for macroeconomic conditions and fuel prices. There is clearly stress in the housing and financial sectors and they create a drag on the overall US economy as well as the fuel prices.</p>
          <p>In calendar year 2008, we expect US GDP to grow more slowly than in 2007. Our United States revenue growth rates will continue to be restrained across all segments for the remainder of 2008, because of this slower demand for US domestic express package services, and the slow LTL freight market in general, although we are doing very well there as Doug Duncan will talk about later. We continue to take revenue share in the US domestic express package market for example. We expect the international economy will continue to expand overall albeit at a lower rate and this will be fuelled by the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, our average daily package volume grew 5% year-over-year overall boosted by continued strong increases in FedEx International Priority shipments, international domestic express shipments and FedEx Ground shipments. Now the wild card going forward remains the price of fuel. We are in uncharted territory when oil consistently sells for more than $100 a barrel. Risk remains in elevated oil prices, credit concerns and a softening labor market. Despite these short-term issues, we remain optimistic about long-term growth prospects as cyclical swings give way to more historic stable macroeconomic trends, and the U.S. and world economies adjust to these very high fuel prices as they undoubtedly will.</p>
          <p>I, for instance, have lived through this now for the fourth time in 73, in 79, in 1990 and now, in this fuel run up. I would point out however that based on my rough calculations, this is probably the largest transfer of wealth in the history of the world, $2.5 trillion from the OECD oil importing countries to the oil producing countries since the price of fuel began to run up in 2002.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our strategic investment in key markets over the years, we are confident that FedEx is well positioned to take advantage of long-term global economic growth trends and to deliver better results in the longer-term. One example of the strategic investment now paying off for FedEx is our FedEx National LTL based on the acquisition we made over a year ago. We've reengineered that network and it now provides a high level of service that quite frankly has never been seen in that industry segment.</p>
          <p>As we manage our costs enterprise wide, we will look closely at ways to realign our expenses with revenues. We will continue to limit discretionary spending, reduce and delay capital expenditures and hold the line on adding staff. We will continue to invest in long-term strategic projects like the 777 and 757 programs that we believe will benefit our shareowners and our customers. Another example of that long-term orientation is our significant expansion into the Chinese domestic market, which began on May 28 last year.</p>
          <p>I would like to share with you several accolades we received since we last spoke. Earlier this month and for the seventh consecutive year, Fortune magazine named FedEx to its Top 10 list of America's Most Admired Companies and the World's Most Admired Companies. In January, FedEx was recognized as among the 100 Best Companies to Work For, a distinction that has been awarded to FedEx in ten of the last 11 years. In addition, we were also named a top 50 employer by Equal Opportunity magazine, InfoWorld's top 100 Technology Innovators and the number one in Most Admired Company for Human Resources by Human Resources Executive magazine.</p>
          <p>Now such recognition is gratifying, but it is important from a business perspective as well, because this trust and respect that the public have for FedEx helps us recruit and train the very best people, to gain new customers and to expand more easily in communities around the world.</p>
          <p>In April, we marked 35 years of continuous operations and it is gratifying to realize we built such a world-class reputation in a relatively short period of time. From the earliest days of this company, we made a commitment to put a lot of emphasis on our folks and in turn our teammates would work each day to make every FedEx experience outstanding. That is the FedEx Purple Promise. As we move forward in these challenging times, we are committed to keeping a sharp eye on our costs and capital expenditures across all segments. We will continue to maintain and in fact improve our very high levels of service to our customers.</p>
          <p>We intend to leverage our unmatched portfolio of services to market and sell the right service in the right network at the right price. We intend to roll out productive, innovative information technology applications and to take good care of our people.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn the microphone over to Alan Graf, our Chief Financial Officer. Alan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Fred and good morning everyone.</p>
          <p>Today, we've reported earnings of $1.26 per share for the third quarter ended February 29th compared to $1.35 per share a year ago in the face of a very challenging economic environment as Fred discussed. I should point out that last year's earnings per share included an $0.08 tax rate benefit. So excluding that, we were essentially flat year-over-year. Revenue growth, up $10% from the third quarter of 2008 was primarily attributable to continued growth in International Services and FedEx Express, growth at FedEx Ground and increases in FedEx Express US domestic package yields.</p>
          <p>Higher fuel surcharges continue to be the key driver of increased yields in our transportation segments. Operating income was flat due to the continued impact of substantially higher fuel prices and the weak US economy which pressured volume and yield growth at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. For the company, fuel expense increased 42% in this third quarter versus the prior year.</p>
          <p>Additionally higher expenses associated with advertising and promotion and strategic technology initiatives as well as expansion and service improvement initiatives at FedEx Kinko's and expansion of our domestic express services in China also had a negative impact on our results. While FedEx Kinko's continues to be a significant source of profitable revenue for the FedEx Express and Ground divisions, its core and print business continues to be a drag. Lower variable incentive compensation combined with cost containment activities partially mitigated the negative impact of these factors.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at our segments and we will start with Express. FedEx Express revenues increased 11% in the third quarter primarily due to increases in fuel surcharges, the impact of favorable exchange rates and International Priority volume growth of 6%. US domestic package volumes decreased 2% during the third quarter of 2008 as the ongoing weak US economy continued to negatively impact demand for these services.</p>
          <p>US domestic yield increases, up 6%, were primarily due to higher fuel surcharges and general rate increases partially offset by lower package weights. IP yield increased 10% due to favorable exchange rates, higher fuel surcharges and increases in package weights partially offset by decreases in the average rate per pound.</p>
          <p>FedEx Express operating results were negatively impacted by the continued softness in the US economy, increased inter-company charges and continued investment in our domestic express service in China. Net fuel costs versus last year's third quarter, one additional operating day and favorable exchange rates partially mitigated the impact of these factors on our operating results versus last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to Ground, revenues increased 13% during the third quarter of 2008, due to continued volume and yield growth. Average daily volumes at FedEx Ground increased 7% and the continued growth of our FedEx Home Delivery Service was outstanding where volume grew 15% versus last year.</p>
          <p>Operating income and margin were lower due to increased inter-company charges from the FedEx Services segment and cost to enhance and defend the independent contractor model partially offset by the benefit from one additional operating day. Fuel costs increased 96% during the third quarter of 2008 and purchased transportation costs increased as a result of higher rates paid to our independent contractors and their higher fuel costs.</p>
          <p>Inter-company charges increased during the third quarter, again primarily due to increased net operating costs at FedEx Kinko's associated with reduced copy and print revenues, store expansion and service improvement activities.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at our Freight segment. Revenues increased 5% during the third quarter due to higher less-than-truckload yields. Although average daily LTL shipments decreased 3%, as demand for these services continues to be restrained by the weak US economy, we are growing market share in both regional and national sectors. FedEx Freight's segment operating income and operating margin decreased primarily due to the net impact of higher fuel costs, the fuel surcharge rate reduction and fewer long haul LTL shipments.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at our guidance. As Fred mentioned, we expect our revenue growth rates to continue to be restrained across all segments for the remainder of 2008. For example, at Express, our fuel surcharges are indexed to the spot price of jet fuel and for the month of April, the fuel surcharge will be 20%. Based on current prices with the exception of the last two days that could increase in May and we are in areas of very high elasticity.</p>
          <p>FedEx expects to earn between $1.60 and $1.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to $1.96 a year ago. Last year's fourth quarter results did include a $0.06 per share benefit from a settlement with Airbus related to the A380 order cancellation. I must say I don't have as much confidence in this range as I normally do due to oil price volatility.</p>
          <p>The volatility in oil prices has been so high that it could cause us miss this range on either side depending on how fuel prices react for the rest of 2008. This outlook assumes no additional increases to the current fuel price environment and no further weakening in the economy.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to our fiscal 2009 and based on the current economic environment, we are expecting a continuation of fourth quarter trends which would result in limited earnings growth next year. We are in the middle of our fiscal 2009 business planning process now. So I cannot give you any clearer picture on the future than that, until we meet again in June.</p>
          <p>We expect capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately 3 billion, very similar to what we spent in 2007. Much of the anticipated increase is on spending to support long-term volume growth including expanding our additional facilities and aircraft. We'd also plan to continue to invest in our technology capabilities to improve productivity and service levels. Because of the substantial lead times associated with the manufacture and modification of aircraft, we must plan our aircraft orders and modifications well in advance of the expected delivery of the aircraft. While we also pursue market opportunities to purchase aircraft when they become available, we must make commitments regarding our airlift requirements years before aircraft are actually needed. We are scrutinizing all capital expense initiatives to realign with current business volumes.</p>
          <p>FedEx Kinko's did open 252 centers this fiscal year to date as part of its plan opened 300 new centers this year. Given the weak economic outlook, Kinko's will significantly slow its rate of expansion in fiscal 2009 to about 70 new locations. To answer a question that I anticipate being asked, for both goodwill and recorded intangible assets at FedEx Kinko's, the recoverability of these amounts is dependent on execution of key initiatives related to revenue growth, location expansion and improved profitability.</p>
          <p>We will perform our annual impairment testing of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2008. We will continue to invest in our long-term strategic projects focused on expanding our global networks and broadening our service offerings to position us for future growth once the economy begins the recovery process. However, if the economic downturn continues or becomes more pronounced, we will take additional actions to control costs and capital expenditures.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator the team is now ready to answer questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And we will go first to John Barnes, BB&amp;T Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, could you talk a little bit about when you're talking about making these changes to the CapEx budget, specifically where are you talking about pulling in? Is it aircraft, is it &#x2013; I know you talked about Kinko's and slowing the growth there. But is there any more specifics you can provide there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me talk about aircraft first. With fuel prices where they are and who knows where they're going to go, the fact of the matter is, I wish we could get our 757s even faster an retire our fuel inefficient 727s much more quickly. And while that would require more CapEx in the near-term, those are very high ROI projects that will have significant long-term benefits to us. The utilization is more or less 50% more efficient per unit carried with the 757. So that is a significant reduction in fuel costs right there on our cost per package. As we look at where we thought we would be on our capital plans, as late as the end of calendar 2007, we are seeing significant reductions in the demand for our services compared to what we thought they would be. So therefore we look at dock doors, for example, at Freight or expansions of the domestic express capabilities. They are not going to be needed as soon as we need them. So we're looking to push those out to better align our CapEx with our long-term growth opportunities and try to time them better. So we'll have a lot of very interesting decisions to make here over the next couple of months and we'll have more to say about that in June.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I hear you right, no real change to the equipment spending, but a little bit of a pull back on more of infrastructure spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. We're going to try to better match our capabilities with what we think the market demands are going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then my follow-up question would be on the acquisition front, obviously the last couple of years you guys have been pretty acquisitive, Watkins and the like. What are you seeing right now? Does the current economic backdrop give you pause there and would you just rather hunker down and integrate what you have and kind of complete the rebranding before getting back there, or does this kind of environment create unique buying opportunities, better valuations and would you still have an appetite for acquisitions even with the current backdrop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. I think we are going to continue to be aggressive over the long term in expanding our service capabilities and filling the gaps that our customers tell us that we have in some of our service offerings, and that we'll be very opportunistic. We have a very sharp pencil in terms of payback and ROI on those investments, and there is nothing that we have to do today. We think we are very well positioned and we have these networks as tight as we can get them from a cost and capability standpoint versus what we see is the current demand and we will continue to balance those things. So it's just going to depend on how things proceed and what happens in the environment but we will remain aggressive and we will be opportunistic.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>And we will go next to Art Hatfield with Morgan Keegan.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning. Hey Alan, historically you guys have always talked about keying off of industrial production growth with regards to your outlook. That fell off in February, is that something that you're really keen on with regards to how you are speaking about 2009 at this preliminary point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Art, this is Mike Glenn. As Fred said, we do expect GDP growth to be lower in calendar year 2008 than 2007. With the news on industrial production being negative in February, just coming out in the last couple of days, I think it's a bit premature to determine what's the long-term impact of that. Our volumes in the quarter were relatively stable although below where we would like to see them. So we didn't see any immediate impact of that throughout the quarter and specifically in the month of February, but it's premature to see what kind of long-term impact that would be. We are planning for lower GDP growth in calendar 2008 than 2007.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us at this point in time kind of where that falls out from your perspective?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it would be kind of a wild card to throw that out there. It's going to be at least a couple of 0.3, 300 basis points less I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan, I'm wondering if you can tell us how much the China investment hurt Express margins in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can say that they were a drag. We are not going to start breaking out individual countries and individual services profitability, but we still have a tremendous amount of long-term confidence in what we're doing in China. And of course our overall &#x2013; I was speaking about the domestic business in China, of course we have a very lucrative business to and from China that we have had for quite some time. So we are in great position overall in China, but we are building a domestic express network and we are having a little bit slower of a revenue growth than we had originally thought, again that is economic driven, but we have a great service over there and it will be less of a drag going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Mike, you mentioned that you are not so confident on the economy here, but you heard UPS' comments last week, can you compare your volumes here in March versus what they were suggesting, that is down for the last six weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say again. Our volumes coming out of December, our peak season have been relatively stable and from that perspective. We are pleased with that, although again they are below where we would like to see them due to the overall weakness in the economy. But they have been relatively stable on a month-to-month basis.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He's talking about Express; obviously we are continuing to grow at Ground. As I mentioned, our Home Delivery Service which is just outstanding is having terrific growth of 15% right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one last question on the multi-route versus single route drivers, do you have a sense for your thinking as to when you'll think about whether that should be applied outside of California or sort of all throughout the network?</p>

          <p>This is Chris Richards. We've been looking at options with respect to our independent contractor model and ways to improve it and continue to provide outstanding service to our customers for years; we will be continuing to do that. We've been very pleased with results of our California transition and have achieved overwhelming acceptance from the single-route contractors in their move to multi-route contractors or in accepting positions with multi-route contractors.</p>

          <p>I wanted to ask about FedEx Ground margins for a second. From '98 to 2000, they were around 8 to 10% per year. Then they got hurt in the recession in 2001, but 2002 to 2007, there were 11 to 14%, and I thought we were looking at a new trend but now they are back below 10%. So with I guess the enhanced kind of contractor incentives in place, do you expect I guess longer-term for them to trend somewhere in between those two growth ranges or where do you expect the Ground margins to be going forward?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>This is Dave Rebholz. If you look at the current year, we certainly have made investments, but there are a number of factors both nominal one-time costs associated with this ongoing transition. But there is also the economic implications of productivity on the core numbers when you get into pieces per shop and the economics associated with Home Delivery, we have every confidence that with our continued growth over the next two to three year time line horizon that our margins will improve as a function of productivity. There are many beneficial offsets that come with growth. We have a convergence of a slowing in our historical rate while we are very proud of the 13 to 14% in Home, and in our SmartPost volumes as well. The fact of the matter is that that continued growth rate will allow us to offset many of the cost factors that we are experiencing right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody. Two questions on IP. The first is just about the volume outlook there. Obviously the numbers have stayed pretty strong in terms of volume. You noted, I think it was Alan or Mike that noted domestic China wasn't performing as well as you at least initially thought it was. Is there any sign that we should expect the IP volume growth rate to start to decline here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Dave Bronczek. No, actually the volumes continue to be strong as you pointed out, 6% this quarter. Overall revenue as Alan pointed out are up 18.5% which I should point out is the highest growth rate IP has had since '05. So we're optimistic that things on the international, intercontinental front, continue to do exceedingly well around every region of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is probably pretty logical that the elasticity of a very high fuel surcharge is not as high with an International Priority packages as it is with a domestic express because the alternatives are significantly slower for high-value goods as opposed to the alternatives in the United States. I think that is one and secondarily, the weak dollar has had a very stimulative impact on exports from the US which is part of what is saving the economy right now and also helping drive our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And actually, Alan, that was the follow-up that I wanted to ask. Can you just give us the sense of the magnitude? You noted part of the yield improvement in IP is tied to currency. What is sort of an organic yield growth net of currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, currency was approximately half of the yield increase in IP. And so that obviously had a pretty stimulative impact, but again the US outbound volume is significantly stronger than the domestic express volume for the reasons that I mentioned and we expect that to continue at least in the next couple of quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you talk, I mean &#x2013; if you look at the Ground margin contraction, is the majority of that related to the conversion and legal expenses and when should that start to taper off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Alan. Let me just say that the answer to that question is no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were a lot of significant impacts. I took the extra time to talk about the services charge backs which had a bigger impact on Ground on a margin basis than they did at Express. And so, as we improve Kinko's profitability and better tightly manage our services expenses, that drag will start to disappear and hopefully become a positive impact as we go out the next 12 to 18 months. Some of the one-time costs associated with what we're doing to enhance the model will go away, and then the more permanent things that we're doing, we will get paid back in the longer run with a significantly improved productivity and we're very confident about that. So, also fuel had an impact on this quarter as well. So it was just a lot of things and so the majority was not the contractor enhancements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for the color. And then the follow-up question. If I look at domestic express, maybe if you could just bring us back in history a little bit, in the early 2000, I guess in fiscal '02, we saw mid-to-upper single digit declines in volume. And if I recall, I think a lot of that was due to kind of the initial mode shift to Ground, but how much of that would be a realistic scenario if things got bad here? Meaning if you look back at fiscal '02, how much of that do you think was just the initial mode shift versus the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. It is difficult to say exactly because you don't have full visibility into customer decisions whether mode shift is caused by higher prices on fuel and fuel surcharges or the a value proposition itself. Let me remind you that one of the things that we have been able to do is make tremendous investments in the Ground value proposition where now over 80% of those items are delivered in three-day or less. Just less than 10 years ago, we called that an express transaction. So the portfolio that we've built and the value proposition that we have built at FedEx Ground gives customers tremendous choice in determining what's in their best interest and having said that, when you have fuel surcharges on Express as high as 20%, clearly customers are going to rethink the best way for them to take advantages of the broad portfolio that we have. We do expect as the fuel surcharges increase and get in the 20% range, that more customers will rethink these decisions and either slow those down to afternoon &#x2013; next afternoon delivery, two day delivery or perhaps moving it into the Ground or LTL network. But it is difficult to say exactly what percentage was driven by economic factors and what was driven by enhanced value proposition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a follow-up on that if I may, the inelasticity I guess, we thought we would see it when fuel hit 50, then we thought we would see it when fuel hit 70. Just wondering, are you actually seeing customers now start to pull back and then to follow-up on John's question, do you think you see that upper-single digit volume decline even with the IP down as you noted to these levels, or do you think it takes a much slower economic impact to get to those upper-single digit declines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I'm talking, what you are saying that whether we get to that now or not. Clearly &#x2013; I'm sorry; would you repeat the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to start-off with, on the fuel like, we thought we would see some of this inelasticity when fuel hit 50, then 70, those were the big numbers at the time. I'm just wondering, what caused you to see that large of a swing right now, or are you seeing it because of fuel hitting 100?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. Clearly, there is more discussion in the market about the fuel surcharge. Having said that, one of the things that FedEx led was the implementation of a dynamic fuel surcharge for Express and Ground services, which is now common in the markets where we compete. So customers have full visibility in advance to what's going to happen to the fuel surcharge and that helps in that regard for them to plan accordingly.</p>
          <p>Our job is to make sure that we assist customers in getting the traffic into the right network that's going to meet their service requirements. So there is elasticity to higher fuel, there is no question about that, and we will feel the impact of that and have felt the impact of that on our domestic express services and we will feel the impact of that going forward. But the good news for FedEx is we have alternatives to move that into the Ground network or a slower mode of Express transportation or into the LTL network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also historically, if you go back to 2001 and 2002, that was a different kind of shock and the Ground capabilities were nowhere near what they are today. I mean we have got up tens of thousands of lanes, we have perfect information, much better custodial control, Home Delivery Service, all those additional really fantastic alternatives for Express that were not there in 2001 and 2002. So we are expecting to see a little bit more impact of this going forward if prices stay where they are and the economy stays where it is which is basically no growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So. Alan, when you talk about '09 being relatively flat at this point based and then I know you said there is a huge swing factor based on fuel. Can you tell us what is in that comment, what is in that target as far as kind of whether it's a volume or a margin kind of impact on a year-over-year basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I'm telling you is that we have previously announced and continually discussed financial objectives. We try to grow earnings per share at least 10% a year and try to target a 10 to 15% range. What I'm saying is that is not possible with fuel at these prices and no economic growth. As good as we are going to be as well as we are going to manage the company, we just aren't going to be able to do that. Now if those things would change and I think they will maybe not in fiscal '09, but beyond, we are extremely well positioned. I mean we are &#x2013; again we are running as lean as we have ever run with highest productivity levels. So we're in the middle of a plan right now and it's obviously the crystal ball for everybody, it is very cloudy here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Fred Smith. Let me mention one other thing here which is very important and that is at inventory levels now, the inventory stocking out there is at all-time low levels. So people with the visibility they have of supply chains these days, invented, I might add by FedEx some years ago, are able to adjust to changing macroeconomic conditions. So if you have some bite from these actions of the Fed and fuel prices go down and so forth, there is a good news scenario out there too, but the wild card, as I said in my opening remarks, is fuel.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to put some color on a couple of these comments here and I know most of the folks on the call are focused on what the next quarter is or the next six months or so forth. But, we've been saying this for years. The Express business in the United States, we have not looked at that as a growth business for over a decade. 2000, you are talking about the meltdown of the dot-coms, you're talking about the real beginning of a lot of migration of overnight envelope business into more electronic modes. So our capacity in FedEx Express sorting capacity, vehicle capacity, aviation capacity, even in the United States has been directed towards the movement of international traffic to and from the hubs and then on into the international system.</p>
          <p>Now that is a very good thing for us because most of the cost in Express are transaction driven, they are not yield or size driven. So as those IP packages come through the formerly domestic capacity at a 50, 60, $70 per unit level and displace a domestic unit which has migrated into our much faster Ground system, that is a very good thing for us. And both Express and Ground absent the fuel price would see benefits in terms of margin and profitability it's just that simple.</p>
          <p>Also, in the international business, and I think I ended the last call we had on this, what has been going on for a long time and it is going to continue for a long time is as the Internet continues to hook up millions of people who can now sell and source their goods with a common language, low-cost medium of exchange with systems like our trade tools which makes it very easy to cross borders. The traditional movement of goods by air is evolving into more of a small shipment door-to-door paradigm, rather than into a consolidation type mode. And it is that long-term secular trend that continues to have IP growing even when you have got fuel prices of this level.</p>
          <p>Now, will that be 10% or 15% or 6%, I don't know, but I can tell you that those trends are very powerful. So, I always say this, you've got to look at the Express network as a global system. And we've tried to the extent that we can by putting this really outstanding Ground system in place to accommodate what the customers want and to use that capacity for international and I don't know whether to this day that strategy has been as well understood as it should be.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Let's see I wanted to ask you about the cost control. You said obviously things are little weak and the outlook is challenging. So it sounded like you would ratchet up your focus on cost and maybe fourth quarter and into fiscal '09. Can you give us any sense of the magnitude of the opportunities? And then I guess within the current quarter, you mentioned the incentive comp was down and wondered if you could give any sense of the magnitude of that impact, was that 10 million, 50 million? Just kind of &#x2013; just a ballpark number so we can think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think it does us any good to go into specific magnitudes on those things. I don't think it adds a lot of value. We have shock absorbers built into our compensation plans. This company is a very much pay for performance organization and we do well when the company does well and we don't so well when we are in times like this. And so that shock absorber is working and we've reduced our annual incentive and long-term incentive accruals accordingly. Having said that, the opportunities in a very big company like this to have immediate quick impact are fairly high. We have a lot of smart people around here. They all have a lot of really great ideas and all of them have ROIs. What we're going to have to do is on a Pareto basis pick the ones with the best ROIs and put the rest of them off until we can find a better time to do them. All of which I think will add long-term value to the company. So we will have some tough decisions to make here, but we're going to make them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me come at it a little bit of a different angle. If you have volumes in Express down 2% or something like that, and let's say fuel prices are at a high level, but stabilized, can Express margins be flat because you do some good things on cost to offset the volume weakness or is there so much leverage to volumes that it is just tough to keep the margins flat with the expense focus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All I can tell you is we just had a flat quarter year-over-year in that exact environment you just said. So we're doing it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I point out again, this is Fred Smith speaking, what I have said before. Margins at Express even with flat to declining, "domestic express" volume can increase and will increase absent the fuel run up, because we are trading the same expense base for a $60 door-to-door IP shipment for a $15 or $20 domestic business. So, again I am not sure I am getting across to you, you just asked the question will margins go down because of domestic express volumes going down and the point is as long as IP grows, domestic volumes stay flat or decline a little bit, that is not a bad thing, that is a good thing. Because it means we don't have to increase our expenses and our margin goes up. What has eaten the margin up is obviously the cost of fuel. So does that clarify a little bit for you?</p>

          <p>Good morning guys, Michael Beard in for Ed Wolfe. Quick question on the Ground and Home Delivery contractor model, can you tell us the percentage of single work area drivers versus say multi-work area drivers and maybe how that looked a year ago or five years ago?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you some sense that more than 50% of our routes are currently handled by multi-work area contractors, that has been growing steadily over the last few years. In California, where we have stated our goal and plan by May 31 to have 100% of the operations to be with multi-work area contractors, so that has obviously contributed significantly to the growth this year.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is more helpful if you think about this really in terms of the routes. The productivity benefits from a multi-work approach are significant and it is easier to understand if you look at it from a route point of view than the drivers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning everybody. Once again, we've had a quarterly conference call and Doug Duncan despite contributing 12% of the revenue hasn't had a question, so I think it's his turn. I was looking at the release you got 3% negative volume and the stat book says 2.1% negative volume, obviously pretty tough comp last year. Can you give us some granularity or some color, whatever you want to call it on what was the growth pattern in regional versus national?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not going to break them out because we run these two networks together, and they do share some resources. But I can tell you this, that all of the negative growth rates were in the month of December. January and February were positive growth rates for both the regional network and the national network. So we really think with all the things we have done, we've got our legs under us now and have some good growth momentum going in both networks now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, but Doug, can you tell us at least did regional grow faster or shrink slower than national or was it the other way around?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously, we have more upside at the national network. We are a small player in a big long haul sector and we've got a service product that isn't even close to being touched by any competitors in that marketplace. So our growth rates are and should continue to be much faster in that national network for several years to come.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. I wondered if you could help explain why Federal Express and other companies are reporting increases in domestic air freight tonnage while at the same time reporting, like in your case, a decrease in small package business?</p>

          <p>David, Fred Smith here. This is a &#x2013; I can't say that we have quantified this, but as you know there have been for the domestic freight, air freight business, there have been a number of secular developments. First the domestic airline industry has moved almost completely away from any wide-body equipment in the domestic market except a few transcontinental routes. So there really isn't any capacity in the underbellies to move things in the domestic air market in that mode any more.</p>
          <p>Number two. There have been some withdrawals of people who were in the door-to-door freight sector, air freight sector, and then third, the FedEx both domestic door-to-door express freight and particularly our intercontinental door-to-door Express freight are fantastic products. They are able to deliver levels of service and reliability that customers have never seen. And so for that market, which isn't all that big a market, we have a very superior value proposition and then when you put it across our entire portfolio with our FedEx Freight products: Regional Freight, National LTL, and Custom Critical we are able to have a freight portfolio that for the people that need expedited freight we have got the answer for them. So that's why it's growing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It is a very good trend. It's just surprising in such a supposedly weak economic environment but I'm very pleased to see it. In the fuel surcharge catch up in fiscal '09, won't that &#x2013; assuming, again, we don't know, but if fuel prices were to level out, wouldn't that fuel surcharge catch up create earnings growth in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you have to look at each quarter and dissect it year-over-year. And it's not only if it levels out which, that's the one thing I can promise you it will not do in fiscal '09, which will be stable and therein lies the issue, and why Fred said it was the wild card for us going-forward.</p>

          <p>We will go next to William Greene, Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just one quick follow-up. Mike can you talk about the trends in B to B versus B to C? My assumption is your B to C package trends looks positive and your B to B were probably down. But I don't know if that's in fact correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well obviously in the quarter December has a strong B to C period because of the holiday shipping season, but in our Ground business in particular we have seen strong B to C growth. And it's been less distinguishable in the Express segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The difference between the two you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

          <p>We will go next to Jason Seidl, Credit Suisse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. Question for Doug. Doug could you talk about the differences in pricing in the LTL product between the regional and the national product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly in our regional market, this is a mature business and we're trying to protect our market share in slow economic times. We have a premium service and a premium price value proposition. Still 88% of those shipments are delivered next day or second day. So that's one value proposition and so the yields have been pretty stable there.</p>
          <p>On the national side we have been pretty aggressive in trying to grow that business after getting past all the integration issues. And that's a little more competitive than the regional market, but I am not &#x2013; nothing I would call irrational at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next question looking at the International Priority business, still strong &#x2013; I know the comments were made that we anticipate they are still to grow because the emerging markets, but if the U.S. does flow into sort of a full-fledged recessionary period, what could we see the international growth rate dip to even with the emerging markets kept growing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Dave Bronczek. We continue to grow in every region around the world including our U.S. International outbound. We had excellent growth and foresee it to be the case going forward, Latin America for example, Mexico into the United States the transborder market Canada as well, Europe and Asia continue to grow. So we foresee the future for international to be positive and growing and growing across the world.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Fred Smith. Let me at the risk of being a broken record, mention again that what is happening in the Intercontinental market is the traditional Airfreight business, because of the increasing ease of use and the reliability of the network, a lot of that market is devolving into door-to-door express rather than into consolidations. And in fact, my guess is as the price of fuel goes up, what it really makes shippers do when they examine their supply chain is to decide whether it needs to go door-to-door express or it needs to go on the water, and it's that big middle ground where people have been consolidating and holding small freight shipments, which goes to David Campbell's point it's not just packages, it's like freight too. It's skidded light freight, that's now going door-to-door through express networks and that's why we think that the business has excellent long-term prospects.</p>
          <p>Now, as the macroeconomic issues flop around, clearly it affects that but there are long-term secular trends going on in this business than we have been following for over 15 years now.</p>
