        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for the fourth quarter earnings and full year 2007 conference call. I am joined in this conference by Enrique Nava, Chief Financial Officer of Grupo Ferrocarril Mexicano, and Jorge Pulido, our Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Today, I will start with the main remarks of Grupo M&#xE9;xico during the fourth quarter and for the full year, and provide a brief update on Asarco Chapter 11 proceedings. And then, I'll turn to developments and financial highlights of our Mining division and will then pass on the call to Enrique Nava. Finally, we will open up the forum for questions and answers.</p>
          <p>During 2007, on a consolidated basis, Grupo M&#xE9;xico had a strong performance posting a double-digit growth year-over-year. This growth was really due to strong metal prices and by a major increase in molybdenum production, which propelled some copper results despite declining volumes in copper as a consequence of the illegal stoppage at our Cananea Mexican mine.</p>
          <p>Additionally, the transportation division continued its growth trend in sales and EBITDA, supported by higher volumes and cost containments. As a brief comment on our main metal fundamentals and expectations, I can say that 2007 copper market was characterized by strong demand and good supply response. The U.S. housing downturn impacted global demand by about 1%. However, at the same time, the emerging economies demand grew, mainly led by China.</p>
          <p>On average, copper was $3.26 per pound this quarter, an increase of 2% year-over-year and a 7% decline quarter-over-quarter. The copper prices in 2007 averaged $3.23 per pound, a 6% year-over-year. For 2007, we expect that strong demand of emerging economies will offset the weakness of the developing -- the developed economies.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, new projects and expansions that will contribute with more copper would be somehow offset by lower production from assisting operations as well as by delays in some capital good deliveries and technical and labor problems at the operations. Consequently, we have a positive copper price outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>Shifting now for molybdenum, the average price for this quarter was $32 per pound, an increase of 20% -- 28% year-over-year, a 2% increase quarter-over-quarter. Molybdenum prices in 2007 averaged $30 per pound, 24% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In 2007, our total revenues reached a historic high of $7 billion, an increase of 11% year-over-year. This was achieved despite the fact that copper prices only increased 6%. This increase is mainly attributable to 30% increased production of molybdenum and a rise in revenues from our Transportation division.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net sales declined 7% -- 17% year-over-year due to the illegal labor stoppage at Cananea in Mexico. This effect was partially offset by an increase of 7% in the revenues for the Transportation division due to an increase of 6% of the transported volumes.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, the cost of sales was 708 million compared to a decrease of 2% on a year-over-year basis. The full year cost of sales amounted to 2.7 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year due to higher administrative, labor, fuel, and power costs.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in 2007 reached a historic level of 4 billion, an increase of also 11% year-over-year, with an EBITDA margin of 57%. In the fourth quarter, EBITDA was 767 million, 31% below the EBITDA of fourth quarter 2006. Net income grew 9% from 1.5 billion in 2006 to 1.7 billion in 2007, of which 207 million were generated in the fourth quarter of '07 and amounted 7 pesos or $0.65 on the dollar per fully diluted share in 2007.</p>
          <p>On its meeting of January 25th, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.09 of a peso per share. The dividend will be payable in a single installment after February 15th. Total CapEx amounted to 637 million in 2007, of which 356 million was spent in the Mining division and 281 million in the Transportation division. These resources were mainly allocated to the development of the Mining division's leaching process, the completion of the Peruvian Ilo smelter, and the new infrastructure and equipment in the Transportation division.</p>
          <p>For 2008, we estimate total capital expenditures of 717 million. For the Mining division, the total of 530 million that were mainly allocated to the Peruvian expansion projects and of those amounts, the maintenance CapEx will be 150 million.</p>
          <p>For the Transportation division, a total of 187 million will be mainly allocated for the rehabilitation of rail tracks, enlargement in new findings and telecommunications infrastructure. At year-end 2007, the cash position of Grupo M&#xE9;xico on a consolidated basis was 2.7 billion and then on stand-alone basis, 1 billion.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Asarco Chapter 11 proceedings, we believe it is approaching the final stage. As most of you know, Asarco has reached several settlements in the mediation with respect to environmental claims. On the other hand, the bankruptcy judge recently ordered mediation of the asbestos claims in order to determine the asbestos liability.</p>
          <p>On timing, I can only mention that Asarco requested to the judge an extension in order to submit a reorganization plain by 11th of April, 2008. The current deadline is February 11. We expect this bankruptcy process to be resolved in the next month to the satisfaction of all parties involved, resulting in Asarco having the certainty it needs to properly conduct this operations. Asarco's cash position is an important indicator of the situation.</p>
          <p>We are turning to Southern Copper's new developments. I will try to keep this brief. Southern Copper already had its conference call yesterday. And as mentioned in yesterday's conference call, at this point, we are confident that the Cananea operations will return gradually to regular production and will continue with the ramp up of the facility.</p>
          <p>Currently, one of the SX/EW plants is back to operations and we are expecting the second plant to resume operation soon. Considering the effective ramping up of operations, Cananea copper production is estimated around 136,000 tons in 2008, 38% higher than the 99,000 tons produced in 2007. Copper production was 592,000 tons but 2% lower than our production in 2006. Southern Copper is expecting to produce 635,000 tons of copper this year, 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2007, molybdenum sales increased to 16,000 tons, a little bit north of that, positive variance of 39% year-over-year. Southern Copper's total revenues in 2007 reached a record high of 6 billion, an increase of 4% year-over-year. The cost of sales in 2007 was 2.1 billion, an increase of 5% year-over-year. EBITDA in 2007 reached a historic high of 3.7 billion, an increase of 14% year-over-year. This was equivalent to 62% of net sales.</p>
          <p>Net income for the 12 months of 2007 increased to 2.2 billion from 2 billion in 2006, an increase of 9% year-over-year. During the fourth quarter, a non-cash charge to income tax of 90 million was recorded to recognize the effect on taxes of net of Mexico's dividends paid out to Southern Copper in 2007. Finally, Southern Copper's capital expenditure plan prioritizes the T&#xED;a Mar&#xED;a leaching project, the expansion of the Toquepala and Cuajone mines, and the expansions of the copper smelting and refining facilities in Peru.</p>
          <p>These projects represent a total investment of 2.1 billion and will increase our copper production by 270,000 tons per year by 2011. This represents a growth of 39% of our current production. Our best estimate at this point of total CapEx year-by-year is as follows.</p>
          <p>In 2008, total expansion CapEx will be 530 as I previously mentioned and 380 will be for expansion and 150 million in CapEx. For 2009, expansion CapEx will be 808 and 16 million and 120 for maintenance CapEx.</p>
          <p>With this, ladies and gentlemen, I will pass on the call to Enrique Nava, who will discuss the financial highlights of the Railroad and Infrastructure division. Enrique?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And, I will now turn to the main remarks of the fourth quarter 2007 results of the Transportation division represented by the subsidiary, Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico (ITM) and its main subsidiaries, which are Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano (GFM) and Ferrocarril Mexicano (Ferromex).</p>
          <p>The low volume transported during the fourth quarter 2007 measured in net tons kilometer moved 10,007 million compared with 9,472 million year-over-year, an increase of 5.6%.</p>
          <p>For full year 2007, the low volume moved was 40,458 million compared with 39,087 million in the same period of 2006, an increase of 3.5%. This growth was contributed to an increase in market share of trains compared to road transportation in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter 2007 net sales increased to 259.4 million from 242.7 million, an increase of 6.9% year-over-year. The net sales in 2007 reached 986.1 million compared to 934.5 million a year ago, an increase of 6.6%, in line with increase in volume. The cost of sales was 159.7 million in fourth quarter '07, 1.3% increase year-over-year and a decrease of 2.2% compared quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2007, total sales were 996.1 million compared with 934.5 million a year ago, an increase of 6.6%. The main reason for this increase were increase of 1.7 million invested in materials and in spare parts for equipment for locomotives and 0.8 million in maintenance to locomotives, largely reflecting an increase in the size of the company's Railroad fleet. And these bring forward increase &#x2013; increases of 7.1% in 2007 which combined with larger volumes amounted &#x2013; amounted to U.S. 11.0 million. The operating income was 66.4 million in fourth quarter of 2007, an increase of 19.2 year-over-year. The operating income for the 12 months of 2007 was 236.9 million compared with 227.0 million, same period of 2006, a 4.4 increase. The operating margin in the fourth quarter was 25.6% compared with 22.9 a year ago.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to 90.1 million from 76.2 million year-over-year, an increase of 18.3% and was equivalent to 34.8 of net sales. The accumulated EBIDTA as of December 31, 2007 was 323.9 million, representing an EBIDTA margin of 32.5%.</p>
          <p>The net income during the fourth quarter of 2007 increased to 50.1 million compared with 39.9 million, an increase of 25.6% year-over-year, and an increase of 12.8 quarter-over-quarter. The net income in 2007 amounted to 155.7 million compared with 141.2 million in the same period of 2006, an increase of 11.1%.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures in 2007 amounted to 281.2 million compared with 253.2 million in 2006, a 11.1% increase year-over-year, due mainly for the acquisition of 40 new GE locomotives, the modification of some tracks, the acquisition of railroad machinery which have increased train velocity, improved operating safety, and produced savings in diesel consumption.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Well, with that, we conclude our remarks for the quarter and for the full fiscal year 2007, and we will be very happy to answer any questions you might have. Operator, will you please open up the forum for questions and answers.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Victoria Santaella with Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some five questions. And the first one is regarding Asarco, if the situation &#x2013; the legal situation is solved, then what is &#x2013; what Grupo M&#xE9;xico is planning to, are they going to consolidate, do they -- are you guys expecting to pay a significant amount to solve the &#x2013; solve these issues? What would be the second stage of this or are you going to be planning to sell the company as a whole?</p>
          <p>My second question is regarding the Railroad division. I see that for the whole year, our volumes grew very much in line with GDP, is this something that we should continue expecting and is it very vulnerable to the slowdown that is expected in the U.S. economy? If you can give us a little bit more light on what can we expect as this is a division that is growing in the single digit rate. And last but not least, if you can give us a little overview of how are you seeing demand for copper in this first month of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes, Victoria, thank you very much for your question. Well, first, I'll start in the same order that you commented on. Well, as you know, Grupo M&#xE9;xico has previously stated its intention of retaining ownership of Asarco, and &#x2013; however, this is still pending in the proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi. However, we do believe that there's material value in Asarco and that we have &#x2013; notorious claims on the company should be returned back to Grupo M&#xE9;xico. Whether that company should be &#x2013; could be merged, sold, what have you, I mean we do think that it complements the Mining division, and that's a decision that could be taken at that point though. However, I mean I would emphasize that the sale would not be &#x2013; would not be one of our alternatives. So I think it's more a matter of operating a U.S. division of mining.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Railroad, I could say that as you know, railroads do &#x2013; are impacted by import and exports and by &#x2013; generally with the economy. So yes, the Railroad, even though it has had a great quarter, the last quarter of the year, it is impacted by the decrease of importation and exportation. To give you an example, one of our important clients, Cemex Cement, has agreed that &#x2013; but I'll let Enrique Nava comment on this in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, following on Daniel's point and the expected growth will be in -- much, much in line with the growth of the economy, although you are right in saying that we may be affected by a deceleration of the U.S. economy. We have to consider though that fortunately, the statement that we attack our values and one of them, which is very important, the agricultural represents about roughly 35% of the volumes. And that is something that fortunately remains more or less stable because the consumption of grain in Mexico, either it will be the sum of the Mexican crop together with the importation from the United States regardless it is a year net very solid in growth. And we have various segments that will make the company a bit more defensive but yes, we will have to be alert on the development of the U.S. economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the last point, Victoria, I think we haven't seen a slowdown in the copper demand at least from this year. I mean we do believe, as I commented, that still this &#x2013; the markets have overreacted on that that emerging economies will offset the decrease in demand from the U.S. And at this moment, we continually see all our contracts still awarded and still expecting to &#x2013; it's with the same rate of demand. At this moment, we cannot -- we do not see any weakness in demand at least from our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from the line of Rodrigo Heredia [IXE Casa de Bolsa].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everybody. I have two questions, the first one will be, what is your -- what is your copper and molybdenum sales forecast for the full year? I think you already said about it, I missed the figure. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Rodrigo, certainly. We are expecting 635,000 tons of copper production for 2008 and a little bit south of 15,000 tons of molybdenum for 2008, that's 14,969 our budget.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the first one was -- sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>635,000 tons of copper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my second question is what do you think about this recently changing the union impression regarding the meeting between them and the authorities here in Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yes, I guess, our position regarding the strike at Cananea  has always been that we have yielded to all the requirements of the union. However, there are some requirements that are excellent labor matters, which we would not of course yield to. We believe that most of the employees and workers are willing to change to a different union. And we say &#x2013; I mean we say that based on the last year's change from -- out of our 11 units, eight have moved to a different union. So I mean we do see that being solved at the end and hoping that the workers decide what's better for them, but the change at the end will come from the workers themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would like to have another question that I had regarding this issue, you have a very clear strategies regarding the union conflict. Do you see any change in this strategy that you took a few months ago regarding the conflict between the union and the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not certainly. I am not sure what kind of strategy you are referring to. But I mean what we are aiming to is to have &#x2013; I mean our operations are full capacity. And we do believe that the work force we currently have is a good work force and that at the end, the reason is going to prevail and that we are going to end up having full production. I mean from May this year. And hoping that the labor stability, and the legal and judicial system prevails in what it should be a positive outlook for the &#x2013; I mean for the industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> with HSBC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning, buenos dias. And my question is relating to Asarco. I know it's impossible to establish or kind of value what kind of liability if any would come out of the Bankruptcy Court. But do you guys have any ballpark figures of what range we are talking about or is this just impossible to quantify? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Well, I mean, as you know, I mean we are one of the parties involved in this whole process. We, I'm referring to as the parent company. It's very hard to estimate. We do have ballpark figures on what the claims are and we have been looking at the settlements reached in terms of environmental claims that Asarco LLC has reached with creditors. However, I mean to have a number, that's their objective, and particularly because all these settlements need to be ratified and authorized by the Bankruptcy Court Judge. So I guess what we are looking at at this moment, the same numbers are out there and they're made public through the Asarco Web page.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Circling back on Asarco, could you quantify where the claims are at this point given that you had another $1 billion settlement last week as I understand on the EPA side? So rough tally, I think you're at about 2.5 for EPA and 2.5 for asbestos claims at this point, but could you just give us those up-to-date numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jorge. Unfortunately, as I said, most of the settlements need to be ratified and authorized by -- at the end of the day, by the Bankruptcy Court. So I mean although these numbers and these settlements that we are looking at, we do believe are positive, we could not -- we could not take those within the standard. We see there is a positive trend and looking at the settlements in average, they have been settled around 20%. Claims, in terms of the environmental claims, are more or less in the range of 6 to $8 billion, out of which probably half have been already settled between Asarco. But still pending the ratification offer, or final solicitation of the judge. So I think we &#x2013; I mean our position is pretty much the one that you are looking at. I mean seeing a positive trend, not having final numbers yet. I mean this whole ideation and estimation proceedings at the end is what's going to come out. But at this moment, it's very hard to have a number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but I'm just going to keep pressing you for a number again if you could give us. You said EPA was about 6 to 8 billion, approximately half settled but I understand pending of judge's final acceptance. So that would put those numbers at roughly 3 to 4 on the EPA and asbestos, where are your claims and have there been any settlements at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with asbestos and I'll say what I can in environmental given that this is a legal loss and the trial is still pending. In asbestos, the claims range around $2 billion and that no mediation has been reached or settlement has been reached regarding asbestos. If Asarco could not reach a settlement in the mediation process with the creditors &#x2013; with the asbestos creditors, if you're to have to set up a date in order to have a trial and estimate and have a final amount of liabilities in order to be able to prepare on the organization plan.</p>
          <p>In the environmentals, the numbers I'm quoting is the numbers that all of us are looking at that are out there. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose what our estimates are at this moment and you'll fully understand the reasons why. And that's again only our best estimates that we are internally preparing, I guess this pending judicial decision and we are still subject to that. So I apologize that I cannot &#x2013; that I cannot obviously comment our estimates and strategies in terms of the legal scenario.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is there any truth to &#x2013; we had heard that Grupo M&#xE9;xico had offered $300 million to the Credit Reorganization Committee of Asarco in order to effectively -- I don't know if it was to take control or 100% of the equity, could you kind of comment if the -- what your status is with rights to that equity, assuming that there is positive equity after the reorganization? Will there be any further monies that Grupo M&#xE9;xico would have to inject into Asarco or would Asarco be open to be sold to any other interested party at that time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jorge, I could certainly comment on that. Well, what we believe, first of all, and the reason of turning this $300 million as backstop is, we do believe that the liabilities of Asarco should be in a comfortable level for Asarco to be able to -- to confront and pay off those liabilities at the end of the estimation process. What we have said is, we are still positive and feel strongly about that, that even... that we are even willing to put a $300 million backstop in the way that if required, we could capitalize Asarco's parent or Asarco in as much as $300 million if required.</p>
          <p>We do believe that they will not be required at the end of the estimation process, that's based on our estimates and also could be said that based on the settlements that have been reached at this moment. Before the court, I am looking at the financial statements of Asarco by year-end and we &#x2013; and which -- that's why we say that those are reinforcing. So that's pretty much what we referred with $300 million, that's a backstop. We don't believe that an additional amount would be required at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how does that relate to any potential ultimate ownership in Asarco's equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that remains in the way that we do believe that there is still value in the equity of Asarco and that Asarco curtailed its liabilities and therefore the equity will have value on that, that already as you know we are 100% owners of the equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So there is no question that if Asarco comes back and has positive equity, in your opinion, you have the complete 100% equity ownership at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct. We do believe that if Asarco can pay off its liabilities and we being the 100% owners of the equity, we should be able to file a reorganization plan to pay all the creditors and recover Asarco as part of Grupo M&#xE9;xico.</p>
