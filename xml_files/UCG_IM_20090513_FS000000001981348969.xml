          <p>Good morning. This is the Chorus Call conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group First Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredit Group. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So good morning to everybody. Many thanks for being connected to us. Shall we start immediately at page three of the presentation with executive summary? First of all, the net profit, 447 million in the first quarter in a still challenging environment, mainly based on a very good performance on the operating profit level where we have a growth quarter-on-quarter of 44% and year-on-year of 18.6%, which would be 52 respectively and 27% at constant forex and perimeter. This result has been achieved thanks to the diversification and cost control. The priority on cost control is giving good result with operating cost down by 2.8% year-on-year at constant forex and perimeter. It would be 6.4% quarter-on-quarter. The reduction on total and trading assets is ongoing. We are down 2.9 and 8.9% quarter-on-quarter respectively net of hedging instruments. The core Tier 1 at the end of the first quarter is at 6.38 with organic growth, which has been offset by specific factors, party reversed in the second quarter to date. The specific factors are the forex in Central Eastern Europe plus the available-for-sales reserve. Underlying profitability is still providing us very strong loss absorption capacity.</p>
          <p>Going to page four and talking on the operating profit, as you can see we have a good performance both on the commercial banking and on the MIB side. Commercial banking is still &#x2013; is quite resilient. We are down 89 million quarter-on-quarter, which would be plus 28 million at constant forex. Clearly the forex devaluation in Central Eastern Europe had a significant impact on gross operating profit. I would like also to remember the fact that the first quarter do have two days less than the fourth quarter of the year. So today is 2.3%, which do have a direct impact on net interest margins. MIB is back to profit with a net profit in the first quarter of &#x20AC;367 million.</p>
          <p>Clearly a significant contribution to this good operating profit results, going to page five is provided by the cost savings. We will have some further detail in this page, but also in the following pages. At year-on-year, we are down by 2.8% with a significant reduction on the staff cost 4.2% and a reduction on the other cost as well minus 0.5%. Quarter-on-quarter, we are down by 6.4% thanks to both staff reduction as well as other cost. As you can see, on the second half of the page, the contribution to the growth of the operating income is coming partially from revenues as well as from cost.</p>
          <p>If we go to page six, we are seeing what has been done in terms of staff rightsizing. We are down by 3,800 people more or less in the first quarter with a good contribution from all the division of the group. Clearly retail is the main contributor, thanks to the delivery of the synergies of the Capitalia, integration. CEE is also reducing. You remember that we said that we would change the focus in Central Eastern Europe from growth to cost control. You see that the revenues are still performing really well in Central Eastern Europe. But also the cost control is undergoing, then we have a good contribution of MIB, Asset Management, Corporate Center and the rest <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>If we move to page seven, I'm talking of other costs. Clearly here we have to split the reduction in different elements. We have, what we call, cyclical elements that are &#x2013; who are related mainly to forex effect, but as well as to other minor effects. And we have fractional items where clearly the reduction is related to activities that will continue to have a positive impact as well as in the future.</p>
          <p>Moving to page eight, clearly the asset quality is one of the key topics. There is a deterioration which was expected due to the economic cycle. As you can see, the non-performing loans are quite stable. We have a small reduction of 0.2%. We have a significant growth in the other gross impaired loans, which are mainly watchlist, a 23.99% growth. Clearly, this is due to the negative cycle which is having an impact on the quality of the portfolios. We are in line with what the model it would consider as expected losses in relation to the GDP growth &#x2013; better decrease, sorry.</p>
          <p>Page nine, coverage ratio; there is a significant growth of the coverage ratio on the NPLs. There is a small reduction on the other impaired. Overall, there is a reduction due to the fact that we have growth only in the other impaired loans where clearly the coverage ratio is lower, so the weighted average is lower than the previous quarter. That is mainly due to this mix effect or mainly &#x2013; only due to this mix effect. The group risk is stable quarter-on-quarter. You remember that in the first quarter last year we had a stated of 86 basis points and we had and we had communicated transparently the 300 million of write-backs in Germany for the RER portfolio -- that write-backs we freed up reserve. So the cost of risk was 105; we are at 109 in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to page &#x2013; to the following page, page 10. We are &#x2013; we have the concept of loss absorption capacity, which is a concept we have talked of in the last presentation. We are quite stable and very strong in terms of loss absorption capacity. It is at 232 basis points at the Group level <mark type="inaudible" /> you have to compare with 109 we were talking before with 186 in Western Europe and 524 in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 11, is a clear demonstration of the fact that the leveraging is ongoing. We have a small decrease in terms of total assets when we consider also the derivative instruments where the growth is only related to volatility. As you know, on the liability side we have slightly more than what we have on the asset side in this <mark type="inaudible" />. So when we consider the cash assets or the assets funded we are down by 2.9% at &#x20AC;898 billion, which is a continuous, significant reduction. It is also very important to say that the tangible equity &#x2013; and I'd like to remember that for us tangible equity is also excluding other intangibles, not always. This is calculated in a similar way by all our competitors, is quite stable at &#x20AC;2.19 per share. So it is at a very, very stable level. When we talk of the leverage ratio, our leverage ratio is improving a little bit. We are at 29.1 in the first quarter. If we would net the hedging instruments over the portion that could be netted in the case of a central counterpart, we would at 26.3% which is again a quite comfortable level.</p>
          <p>At page 12, we have the reduction in trading assets. As you can see we are going down in all the lines, so we are stable on government bonds, corporate debt, and securities is down &#x2013; sorry, it's important to say that we have reclassified 9.3 billion in this quarter, with a really negligible impact on the profit and loss. The reclassification is due to the fact that there are no trades at all so our completely liquid assets, but there is no impact on the profit and loss as far as this reclassification. But even without this reclassification, the corporate debt and securities are down by 5.2 billion. Then we have a reduction as well in the traded loans and in others. So overall the reduction is 8.8% in the other assets.</p>
          <p>Capital position, we were already stating the fact that it is at 6.38. The reduction we &#x2013; you will see the reduction to what is due on the following page. Overall, we would be with the government bonds above 7% in terms of core Tier 1 and 28% in terms of total capital in terms of Tier 1 &#x2013; sorry, Tier 1 ratio. The risk-weighted assets are still going down significantly by 1.7%, which is quite a good result.</p>
          <p>In page 14, we are explaining the reduction of the core Tier 1; 08 bps are due to &#x2013; of reduction to the forex effect, which is again partially recovered in the second quarter &#x2013; five basis points have been recovered, mainly on the zloty. Then we have 06 basis points for the available-for-sales reserve and again <mark type="inaudible" /> accounted that in &#x2013; only in Italy, Portugal, and Spain this available-for-sale reserve negative must be deducted from the capital. Five basis points are related to Generali, of which three basis points have been already recovered in the second quarter, and then we have the positive contribution from the reduction of risk weighted asset and from the net earnings reduction of net Basel additions.</p>
          <p>Now shall we move to some more detailed numbers? So I move to page 16. Here we have the profit and loss line-by-line and as usual we have the quarter-on-quarter changes and year-on-year change and then year-on-year normalized which means at constant forex and perimeter. Starting from the revenues, the revenues are up by 8% quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year 1.8%, but if you would consider again normalized is 8.1%. The costs are down, so the operating profit is significantly growing. The net write-downs are going up quite significantly, as expected with this economic cycle. The other non-operating items are reduced compared to the previous year. Income tax is quite high, the tax rate is 36%, mainly due to the IRAP effect in Italy. As you know, the IRAP is effectively a labor tax which is flat in relation to the labor cost. So that we go to the net profit of 447 million.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 17 and considering the profit and loss line-by-line. I want to immediately say that clearly we had a very good resilience of the net interest income, if we compare the year-on-year results and the quarter-on-quarter. We had a strong contribution of MIB where &#x2013; with a portion of the net interest margin which is related to trading activities. So in reality as all &#x2013; many our competitors are doing for MIB would be better to consider the total revenues and not splitting of trading income and net interest. With the interest rate curve which is deepening, clearly you can book some deal on one side or on the other side. The net commissions are affected by the reduction of assets under management. This is the main impact on the year-on-year reduction. When we talk of quarter-on-quarter, there are also other components because, for instance, in corporate, the fourth quarter has been a very good quarter in terms of fees in corporate finance. This is due to seasonalities so that in the first quarter we had a reduction. Trading income, as I've said before, a very significant improvement <mark type="inaudible" /> positive if we would consider the portion which is booked as well in the interest margin.</p>
          <p>When we go to the following page, page 18, you see the main &#x2013; the revenues in MIB that came back to a black figure in all the lines despite of the high credit spreads. So in the different business lines we came back to profit.</p>
          <p>Cost, page 19, here we have the split of Western Europe and CE. As we said, we have a very good reduction at the group level on year-on-year. Quarter-on-quarter also in Italy we have a reduction, normalized, clearly when we consider the year-on-year is a growth rate &#x2013; a growth because of the fact that in Central Eastern Europe we had in the last quarter the opening of branches. But when we go to the quarter-on-quarter it is reduced as well in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>Page 20, operating profit, as we said the operating profit is quite stable in the commercial banking. If we wouldn't consider the forex effects and the one-off we had in retail in the last quarter, we would be positive by 1% in commercial banking. Clearly, the non-comparable in MIB where we had a loss in the first quarter while we were <mark type="inaudible" /> in the first quarter of this year. Asset management is still affected by the reduction in assets under management, so we have a reduction in terms of operating profit of 31% quarter-on-quarter. Central Eastern Europe, which apparently is down by 2.4%, at constant forex <mark type="inaudible" /> it would be up by 10%, so it is quite a good result.</p>
          <p>Moving to the following page we have the cost of risk at divisional level. As we said, we are almost stable quarter-on-quarter with some delta in the different divisions. Retail is slightly growing due to a deterioration in Italy. This is due mainly to small business. Corporate is stable at 100 basis point. There is a significant reduction in MIB and a growth in Central Eastern Europe from 115 to 170 basis points. We have to consider this is a weighted average of an improved Poland with a deterioration in the other countries. Poland is being excellent in terms of quality of our assets.</p>
          <p>Page 22 I think has been described before. I want to only to recall your attention to the tax rate which is 36%, and which is expected to remain relatively higher than the previous year during also the following quarters.</p>
          <p>If we move to page 23, we had the reclassification of this 9.4 billion of assets. As I said, the impact on the profit and loss is completely negligible; are mainly composed of government bonds, as you can see in the first bullet point, second line. This is &#x2013; and covered bond as well. So it's really a matter of liquidity; it's not a matter of quality.</p>
          <p>Now I have finished my presentation and with the colleagues we are open to all your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, this is the Chorus Call conference operator. We are now &#x2013; we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question is from Mr. Marcello Zanardo of KBW. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. Profumo, to you and to all your colleague there. The first question is actually on the positive surprise on the results which is on cost. There was some forex effect as you mentioned, but could you tell us what you are implementing in the last three or four months? Clearly the environment is now getting better. So give us a bit more details, for instance, on the merger between the CAB, the investment banking division and the corporate division, the closure of branches and so on? And should we assume this cost basically to have lower seasonality versus last year?</p>
          <p>The second questions is on trading income, there was pick up on the revenue environment in the investment banking division, but a lot of your competitors posted a much better trading income versus your loss. I mean what is driving this loss? Actually these two questions only. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost side then I can leave the floor to Sergio Ermotti in order to answer on the trading income. On the cost side, I think, that we have to go back, Marcello, to page six and seven, because we have relatively clearly explain. Page six gives you a view on the staff reductions, which is quite significant. So we have speed up the process of rightsizing, which clearly will have an effect &#x2013; a stable effect during the year, because you start from a lower level. In the staff cost &#x2013; in the staff cost there is reduction. There is more or less 40 million, which is cyclical because it is related to the fact that we had a lower impact versus previous year of the MBO system. We close all the incentive plan in March with the approval of the year-end results. So we book the cost every year in a conservative way and then we release in the first quarter what is not paid. So on the staff cost this is &#x2013; the portion that in the first quarter is "cyclical".</p>
          <p>Talking of page seven, you have a very clear view of what we call cyclical and structural, so &#x2013; which is very clearly defined. The structural costs are related to internal and external communication; the advertising, traveling, consulting, so many different elements plus some ICT savings we had. So clearly, we are working structurally on a lower base also versus the banking. Talking of trading income, as I said before, it's not proper to see trading income splitted from net interest margin <mark type="inaudible" />, but we leave the floor to Sergio Ermotti.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In addition to what Mr. Profumo just said, which has substantial impact on our trading results offset by the net interest line, we have to clearly highlight that the first quarter was still a very stressful quarter for all high rated paper, including government bonds, covered bonds and we have substantial spread widening there. So &#x2013; which was to a big extent offset by gains in the basis risk, CDS versus cash items. So when we look at credit market related activity, we had major volatility in different asset classes, more or less offsetting each other, and therefore creating this number &#x2013; this net result. I think we had a favorable environment in equities compared to the fourth quarter. So overall, again, I think I would say a successful environment for trading, but still not without any major surprises coming from credit spreads widening in higher rated asset classes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I understood correctly, going back to cost, sorry, for a minute. The net of the FX effect this year, we should not expect a high volatility such as in the last quarter of the year. We will have a big pick up in the cost because you're structurally lowering the cost base throughout the year. Is it a correct assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And sorry just looked at some new data now, also if I may, the very last question. Clearly the cost of risk -- the watchlist increase has been quite significant, as you pointed out 76% year-on-year. And the coverage there is lower and also on the gross restructuring loans, you said Italy retail is one of the area, the small business clearly. Looking on page...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And small corporate as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And corporate as well. I am looking at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Small corporate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. I'm looking at page 21 where you show your cost of risk by division. First of all, the big drop in MIB, there were some big <mark type="inaudible" /> before. What are you seeing in the MIB division going forward? Especially look at your leverage loan book that you have there is it still &#x2013; I guess it's still performing, but if you could give us a little bit more of color what you've said on this area which clearly is quite difficult to make some forecast given the seriousness of the crisis and such a big loan book that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. On the LBO portfolio, first of all clearly we are taking some increased provisions due to the generics, but at this point in time there is negligible provision made on single names are particularly all major positions, our big positions we have are still performing and they are not in any areas of breach of covenants or any close to that. So, for the time being we are comfortable, but clearly if we have this GDP forecast figures for the year being confirmed or into 2010, we may see some need of impairments of positions. But at this point in time, again, there is no &#x2013; we feel very comfortable with the quality of the underlying names.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the corporate division, what are you seeing. I see the cost of risk gets stable basically from Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, cost of risk is stable but clearly if you look into the different countries and the different segments, there is a high degree of volatility clearly. Large corporates are performing relatively well compared to the small names. We see a stable environment in Germany for the time being and also stable environment in Austria. I think Italy is much more challenging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Alessandro Roccati of Fox-Pitt, Kelton. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, everyone. I've got three questions. The first one is back on the cost of risk and more specifically in Italy retail where the cost of risk was 131 basis points and in corporates where it was 147 basis points. Just wondering whether you can expand on that? The increase has been quite significant, both year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the MIB division or revenues and in particular on the market division. I've seen quite poor performance in rates and forex 170 million revenues, 300 million was the figure last quarter. <mark type="inaudible" /> your competitors are actually seeing a steady increase of almost 100% in these divisions, and I believe that going forward FICC is going to be one of the drivers of growth in the CIB division. I'm just wondering whether you think you'll be able to benefit from these strength going forward or you will lag compared to competitors?</p>
          <p>And finally the last question is on the reclassification of the division of profit and loss. I'm just wondering why you made this reclassification and what are the major changes, the purpose? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I can start with the second question. And basically when you look at the rates and FX, you are right to point out that we had a decrease quarter-on-quarter compared to the market strength. But one issue to be noted is that a lot of the spread widening on <mark type="inaudible" /> and highly rated quality paper is part of this business segment to manage liquidity, and therefore we suffered the mark-to-market on this position. Compared to standard and that's the reason why we are &#x2013; we moved it to &#x2013; from held for trading to loan and receivables because it is, as you may know, is market standard to not to hold in trading -- these positions are for liquidity reason. And therefore, we created a mark-to-market effect which is not, I would say, industry comparable to other players.</p>
          <p>So from that standpoint, it explains a one-off drop in revenues quarter-on-quarter. We do expect, as we see in the second quarter, the rates business and FX business to still continue to contribute a stable revenue pattern for the rest of the year. And the question regarding why we reclassified is that despite the fact that we are talking about covered bonds, government bonds and so on, in some of these asset classes there is lack of liquidity and again the mark-to-market volatility was not any longer in line with our intent. The intent of this position is not really to trade but it's to hold it for liquidity purposes. Therefore, having P&amp;L swings coming from trading for some things that we deem to be &#x2013; to be hold to maturity for liquidity management was not appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roberto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as far as &#x2013; as far as retail is concerned, the delta is ascribed to two phenomenon. On one side, when you look at Germany, you have a movement from actual write-backs, net write-backs, at Q4 of minus 16 basis points; that came to a kind of normal 38 basis points level. So clearly in terms of delta plays an important part.</p>
          <p>The other &#x2013; the second factor is Italy. In Italy, what we have currently are two phenomenon. On one side we have a slight increase of mortgage. But the increase in cost of risk of mortgage is now plateauing. In reality, we had the peak of increases in regular loans in January. But then all the flows are becoming steady and actually slightly even decreasing in the last weeks, while instead we have seen an increase in the small business provisioning level. Moving forward, we tend to see a kind of stability with mortgage, possibly a reduction in the small business, possibly instead increasing. It will depend clearly on the depth of the recession in the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just going back to the cost of risk in corporate Italy which was 147 basis points, I think is quite high compared to your comparison. Just wondering whether you can make a comment on that please?</p>

          <p>I think that here there are two effects. First of all, clearly we have a deterioration and which is clearly reflected in the numbers. And second we also had &#x2013; we implemented towards the end of March a new model for generic reserves and classification, which created, I would say, what we can call a one-off situation. So I would expect &#x2013; as we are expecting this number to come down in the second quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to everyone. Just three quick questions on provision. First of all on Poland, clearly the assets you have are of very high quality. But I was wondering what is the run rate you expect for provisions, because if I look at the recent past I think we were looking at 42 bps in Q1 and then average of 15 in the last four quarters?</p>
          <p>Then on leasing instead there was a sharp increase in cost of credit, I think it threefold quarter-on-quarter to 109 basis points. And I was wondering if you could give a bit more color on the break down by geography or by sector or whatever you see the deterioration coming?</p>
          <p>And again on provisions, just to make sure I understood well, the cost of credit of 69 bps that was including the charges on the LBO portfolio. And I was wondering if there was any update on that?</p>
          <p>And then finally moving to fees in retail, I think there was an increase quarter-on-quarter in Italy and Germany, and I was wondering if it is related to upfront fees or rather to &#x2013; there are some change in trends? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Poland, this is the trend. The quality of the assets are really good, so we are not foreseeing deterioration. On the contrary we had some small improvement. But &#x2013; so Poland is quite stable, and we are not seeing &#x2013; at least for the time being deterioration. On leasing, Sergio will give you the details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on leasing, as I mentioned before, as for Italy we had the same issues in respect of implementation of our new model. So this number needs to be normalized for this adjustment. And also clearly we had some migration of impaired loans mainly in the doubtful loans and &#x2013; so and <mark type="inaudible" />. I think that you have clearly, as I said before, this cannot be taken as an annualized number. And we will in any case also need to take in consideration that the underlying assets and the recovering of those assets despite the difficult market environment make it &#x2013; put us in a much more comfortable position in terms of recovering values and protecting the asset values. So &#x2013; but again also like for Italy I think that we have to really adjust this number due to this new modeling that we implemented at the end of March.</p>
          <p>In respect of the LBO portfolio, there is no change compared to the year-end and there is &#x2013; geared around 300 million of new business. The business activity is still there but at much lower pace than we saw in the second half of 2008, and as I said before the quality of the portfolio remains unchanged. We have around 8.7 billion of exposure with around 160 million underlying. So, no change.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the increase in commissions that we mainly catch in Italy versus Germany, the main driver is a surge in the sale of bancassurance product, especially traditional policies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Growth in watchlist loans that was very strong in the quarter. And I wonder taken into consideration that watchlist were already growing in the fourth quarter of 2008, why this has not led in your opinion to increase in NPLs. So I was surprised to see that gross NPLs were flat quarter-on-quarter. So why there was not an increase in NPLs, and if you believe that the strong growth in watchlist will inevitably lead to increasing loan loss provisions? So my point is the 109 basis points of the first quarter probably are not sustainable for the full year. If you agree on this point?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the payout policy, if we can assume that, let's say, barring unexpected events UniCredit will pay dividend this year?</p>
          <p>And a final question on the net interest income, in the retail segment in Italy in particular was clearly down &#x20AC;200 million quarter-on-quarter. If we can assume that this trend is going to accelerate in the next quarters because of the trend in Euribor rates or a slowdown? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start to answer from the payout policies and Karl will talk of &#x2013; Karl Guha of the watchlist versus NPLs and Roberto of net interest margin for retail Italy. Clearly payout policy will be defined at the year-end by the board, is related on the capital base we will have at the year-end. So clearly, we are continuously working on the capital base. You're seeing the reduction we're having in terms of risk-weighted assets while we are continuously supporting small and medium size enterprises. So it's a really tight way we are moving in, but we'll see at the year-end the capital position, considering also all the other activities we will be able to realize in terms of capital generation. Talking about watchlist, Karl?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are three comments I'd like to make. The first one I think it's reasonable for you to expect continuing &#x2013; a slight continuing deterioration in credit portfolios. It's just a straightforward lag effect that you see in credit portfolios across the board, and I think you will see it in every single participant in this industry.</p>
          <p>The second part of your answer really is the composition of what's flowing into the overall impaired loans. As you know that there are four specific categories within that, so depending on which category the contribution is. At the moment the watchlist is one of the first ones. It's obviously increasing and we're trying to do that also in a preemptive sense so that we are able to take managerial actions upfront to fix it. So what you do see is a contribution of increasing at that at end which allows us to deal with the underlying collateralization or restructuring. <mark type="inaudible" /> objective, of course, is to avoid any default is as such the objective. So, we have look into each of the compositions and de-composite in order to get a better view and understanding of it. But at this stage the largest contribution is on the watchlist.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To interpret the net interest margin evolution, <mark type="inaudible" /> you have to look at three factors. First of all, clearly the most important one is drop in the interest rates. That has been steady throughout Q1, in a way we went Q2 at the lower level. Now this means that Q1 did not have fully the impact of the drop of net interest rate.</p>
          <p>The other aspect to keep in mind is that we've been very, very cautious in terms of new asset generation; in fact, in terms of revenues on risk weighted assets there is a very good improvement of the results in the quarter compared to the previous quarter because especially mortgager money is an area which we are not renewing mortgage that don't give margins positive enough to generate a positive EBITDA.</p>
          <p>The other aspect to keep in mind instead is a lag in the re-pricing effect that we can do on the lending side, that typically will <mark type="inaudible" /> a positive effect during Q2. All of this to say that we overall expect Q2 to be the Balkan in terms of net interest margin. Sorry, one point that before I mentioned regarding fees is that in reality in light of the improvement that we have been seeing in the financial market, these might lead us to be slightly more optimistic moving forward. For instance, in the most sensitive piece of our business, overall we <mark type="inaudible" /> in Italy being Fineco we have been in the last weeks and a normal surge of trading activities and that typically is a first signal of potential increases moving on, on the let's say more traditional retail business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just as a follow-up because on the loan loss provision. Sorry, so I don't understand, if you share the view that the annualized 109 basis points of the first quarter as a cost of risk anyway is too optimistic for a full year projection at this stage or it's impossible to say? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I still have three questions. The first one is regarding the classification once more but rather the one you did in Q3. You didn't mention what impact there was on your P&amp;L from the first reclassification in Q1 '09?</p>
          <p>The second one is, have you any target regarding the evolution of the risk weighted asset for the group for the full year?</p>
          <p>And the third one, regard the government bonds of 4 billion you were talking about already in the last quarter presentation. That 4 billion &#x2013; my question is when &#x2013; what is the split between Italy and Austria? And then what is the method we could &#x2013; in which we could treat them? I mean, this is a payment of dividend then directly in the balance sheet, not through the P&amp;L. But shall we have like the French bank do, to have a dilution in term of earnings per share, in term of new share just because of these government bonds? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, the impact of the reclassification, as I said before, is negligible is <mark type="inaudible" />. Okay, sorry. The new reclassification of the impact, as I said before, is negligible is at &#x20AC;13 million &#x2013; 13, so it's completely negligible. The overall impact of the reclassification is &#x20AC;260 million, also considering this 13 and what we have reclassified in the past. I think that what we have seen today in the market in terms of spreads is a clear demonstration that the reclassification was proper, because clearly there was a matter of liquidity, there is a matter of liquidity in terms of pricing these instruments, and the volatility we are seeing is showing clearly that also considering, as Alessandro was saying before, our aim in terms of position vis-&#xE0;-vis this stock, these bonds, it was correct the reclassification.</p>
          <p>Talking of the split between Germany and Italy &#x2013; sorry, Austria and Italy, for the government bonds, we have never posted the number we <mark type="inaudible" />, but as you know the cost is pretty similar on one side and the other. You can &#x2013; if you want a model that consider one up and one off but there could be some small delta vis-&#xE0;-vis this average.</p>
          <p>Talking of dilution, as you know, these are not instruments that are creating a dilution on the net profit and earnings per share. There is a cost that you have to model as interest margin because our bonds and we &#x2013; sorry interest margin that goes directly to the capital. So in reality it is not having any impact on the profit and loss. It is reducing the capital base. So it depends on how your model is built because clearly you have to consider in terms of capital reduction the cost for these instruments and it's relatively easy to calculate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm sorry, just a quick follow-up on that. The <mark type="inaudible" /> has been fairly creative in a very similar way through the French government bonds. And the French banks are using this kind of bonds which are paying a coupon which is deducted from the capital exactly just like you said. Being, nevertheless, core equity, the French bank themselves and DMT indicated very clearly in the presentation written on a slide that you have to take dilution into effect even if there are non-working share. You use their advice &#x2013; the analyst to taking into account for dilution in the earnings per share, and I just have a little problem there in term of comparison between one country to the other in term of doing my job.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's exactly what I've said. I said that the cost of these bonds will have a direct impact on the equity. We have never provided earnings per share, so it's impossible for me to say what is the impact on the earnings per share. So when you are modeling our net profit for the year-end, we have a certain net profit. You model the capital as well. As we know, there are other elements that are having an impact, for instance, for the French bank the negative available-for-sales is not deducted from the capital, for instance, while we are deducting from the capital this number. But again, then you go to the capital considering other elements, forex translation effect for presence in Central Eastern Europe, available-for-sales reserve, risk-weighted asset growth, and earnings retained; you deduct the cost of the bond and at the end you have a new capital. So we're completely transparent as the French bank.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I had few questions. One regards currencies, you gave an interesting update on the impact of the rebound of currencies particularly in Eastern Europe to your capital ratios. Can you give us an idea of how much in the second quarter this is having an effect on your operating results?</p>
          <p>On cost we have seen that in fact the currencies had some impact; in the first quarter you're talking about part structural and part cyclical impact on cost. Do you believe that all in all is achievable a 5% cost cutting in 2009?</p>
          <p>And finally, I heard the comments on the Fineco performance in recent weeks. I probably can have in mind that that does not apply to Italy only, first; and second, in general how you see moving the risk appetite of your retail clients through the board, but let's say particularly in Western Europe so Italy, Germany, and Austria not just on asset management for mutual funds but also in bank as well?

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see clients moving a little bit more <mark type="inaudible" /> on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. So starting from the first answer, we have provided the impact of the currency effect on the capital until today. We have not provided the number on the net profit because clearly you have different impact on revenues and cost. So it is something which is not provided. It is today very difficult to foresee what could be the exchange ratio at the end of the quarter. So in our planning activity, as you know, we hedge the net profit in order to &#x2013; on a yearly base so in order to freeze the net profit in terms of exchange ratio because this is something we always had as a policy, clearly not being macro-hedging you have the volatility in the trading profit of the holding company which at the year-end will be offset. So it is something which is pretty difficult to calculate because again the net profit is moving as &#x2013; if it is moving then you have the currency on the other side and we have the hedging on the net profit for year-end. So the impact on a quarterly basis is pretty complex.</p>
          <p>On the cost cutting, we are clearly working. We don't give guidance in terms of target for the cost cutting. We are continuously working on cutting costs. Clearly it is an ongoing process on a stable base. Also, of course, that &#x2013; it depends on what will be the exchange ratio in Central Eastern Europe partially. There's been 80% of the cost cutting indicated in Western Europe. Risk appetite for retail customers, Roberto?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Clearly in the last months customers have been extremely risk adverse and the surge in commission that we have seen the bancassurance product in Q1 is mainly related to the sale of products with very low risk profile. If one wants to interpret the very latest signals, two factors may be read as the signal of potential change in shift towards a higher risk appetite.</p>
          <p>On one side, as I was saying before, we have seen the most of <mark type="inaudible" /> customers which are typically Fineco customers who have been generating a very significant surge in the trading activities in these last &#x2013; in the very last four weeks and that might be seen as an early signal for a future increase in financial market intermediation for the broader retail customer base. These are further slightly supported also by an increase in the sale of recovering premium with equity components that once again we've been seeing in the last few weeks. So, some very first signals that we are now trying in terms of product development and sales activity to turn hopefully into a return of financial markets ease in the next quarter.</p>

          <p>Talking for retail really will &#x2013; this will depend a little bit on two things. On one side once again on financial markets evolution, on the other side also on the overall economic development. Because for instance one area that has been clearly lagging in the last month has been the production of CPIs related fees, total protection, a product of that typically linked with the production of mortgage in consumer science. And also clearly if, let's say, the economy at least stabilized a little bit and financial markets are not going to be as bearish as they've been in the last quarter. Then one can probably believe that in terms of retail commissions we have bottomed out. down.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Also a few questions from my side. Going back to the profitability of the MIB division, what I wanted to clarify is this, some of the banks actually had a come back off the profit on the basis rate which is actually higher in terms of percentage of the previous quarter, write-downs or loss then do you have nearly double. If not all the profit come back, are you spreading it and it's just coming at in the second quarter. If you could just &#x2013; obviously difficult to compare with other banks, but to clarify that a little bit. Also how &#x2013; I understand your point to need to look at MIB revenues all in? But how should we look in at the split between net interest income and trading? And especially how is the trade off? How come this has got a still very stronger interest income with the loss on trading?</p>
          <p>The reason, I am asking is depending on what drives it, when will we see reverse? When net interest income weakening and trading get in positive because that will have an impact optically at the Group level on your P&amp;L lines? On ABS, have you taken any mark downs, I don't think so, looking at the numbers, have you seen any rating downgrade on your portfolio, I know there has been a volley of rating downgrades by the rating agencies. But on the other hand, have you actually taken any right back given your mark to model is very conservative. Just clarifying that point. As a second question on leasing your higher provisions, is any real estate transaction there that has required provisioning? On risk weighted assets what's the reason for the decline, is more credit risk or is more market risk we might have the data, but I haven't seen it. I'd like to understand how you managed to get the risk weighted assets down again which is a fantastic result? And lastly one clarification, your goodwill and the stock of goodwill goes down this quarter by around 400 million and what's the reason about, is it FX or anything else? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back to your question about trading results, we did indeed benefit a lot from the basis tightening. But as I said before, the counter effect of this gain was basically the spreads widening on government bonds and financial bonds. So as you look at your combined numbers, you loose this insight, but we had substantial marked back in the basis book, offset by government bond spread. Your question regarding trading versus net interest income as I said, it's difficult to look at the two numbers together, but to give you an idea, we are talking about 300 million of variance. So if you can put &#x2013; you can deduct 270 to 300 million from net interest income down to the trading line, you have the picture that you're talking about. And not necessarily, the bottom-line will change but you may have a change in the distribution between the two lines.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Cash instruments versus derivatives. While one may be booked against trading and the other one is seen as from an accounting standpoint of view as a net interest income asset. So is purely depending on what kind of hedging strategy you have and the underlying instruments dictate where we book it.</p>

          <p>Yeah. So, when interest rates are coming down, you have this account &#x2013; this way of booking it. And then when interest rates reverse order too many components to really in same point. Just to understand when will it reverse, because I think we'll have an impact on the headline number at the Group level which people may find surprising?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's exactly the point that we are giving you in the explanation. The reason why we have these major changes to avoid that in the future we may have surprises. I think that we've been considering, we will consider potentially, reviewing and recasting those numbers. But at this point in time given the volatility that we have &#x2013; it would have been inappropriate to do recasting without creating further doubts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, so going forward we will continue to disclose if we have major movements, but not necessarily interest rates movements are driving what you just said, it depends which instruments we use.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ABS portfolio we had amortization for us, 1 billion in the second quarter at par &#x2013; in the first quarter sorry. And no major issues regarding downgrades that changed the full picture as you can see we're still around 97% of investment grade quality. So the picture has not changed, particularly has not changed as much as bringing investment grade assets into non-investment grade assets.</p>

          <p>The reduction on risk weighted assets is mainly related to a reduction of credit risk because with the volatility there has been &#x2013; the VAR is growing a little bit, is not decreasing.

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also you have to take in account that reclassification of assets &#x2013; trading to loan and receivable increases of risk-weighted assets. So what we are doing on the trading side...</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are deleveraging and de-risking, which may create a deduction of risk-weighted assets, but the increased volatility in the underlying market has offset much of that. On the other hand the reclassification has created an increase of risk-weighted assets. Overall, we are reducing.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. As Sergio said before, partially the increase in leasing, in the leasing provision is due to a model review, which went through in the first quarter as well as in corporate. And it's a good portion of that and then there is a very tight classification as Karl was saying before that went through all deposition. We don't have any major exposure, which is worrying us. What is impressive both in corporate Italy and leasing Italy is the fact that in reality that the biggest provisioning is really small. So ....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's really on the small business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's across all the different positions we go continuously through a revision of the performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just for one second, still talking about Italy, we spoke in the fourth quarter and after Lehman October, November and I spoke to a lot of corporates, they saw a significant deterioration in their order book. Has the deterioration continued in Q1? What are you hearing from your corporate clients because clearly the small business is the one that always suffers first but it's a structural situation. What are you actually hearing from your clients in terms of the prospects of their own business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So today, they are slightly more positive in terms of future book order. So, they are starting to see some improvement clearly in any case from a very low position. So, you have to consider that a significant portion of the Italian companies are export oriented and there has been a significant deterioration of the world trade. Today the mood, but this is also visible from the confidence reserves, is improving. This is a quite clearly then how much this is already in the number, very difficult to say.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Well, most of my questions have been answered, but a couple of ones more. One is again on the investment banking business, you mentioned a delta between trading and net interest income of some 270, 300 million. Just to understand that if we're moving ahead to Q2 we're going to see this been rebooked on the trading line or not just to clarify? And then an additional point we understand that a number of Italian banks &#x2013; I understand also UniCredit are promoting plans to support those retail clients that are running into temporary problems particularly on the mortgage side.</p>
          <p>So, I think that the plan is to award a grace period to those client in the payment of the interest to those clients that have particular problems. If you can give us an idea of the percentage of your Italian residential mortgage book that this is accounted for. And what do you expect this to be at the end of the year and particularly if you classify this as performing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there is no plan to re-class in the second quarter. We're not even allowed so I think that we are for regulatory reason, we have to report it this way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the initiatives of providing a grace period to customer who enter into difficultly, we launched an initiative at the end of 2008. When we launched the initiative we were expecting to have approximately 25,000 customers accessing. At the movement, the rate of acceptance is lower than the forecast we made at the time. The classification depends on the fact that the loan in itself was regular or irregular, once the agreement was made; if it was regular up to that movement, then it stays in performing, if it was showing already signs of irregularity clearly we will have a different treatment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just two questions. The first one is on dividends. I understand that you will decide of course at the end of the year, I just wanted to know, if the capital ratios that you have disclosed include some accrual in line with your budget or not? The second question is on slide 23, which is the one referring to the IAS39 reclassification; there is obviously a gap of 3.5 billion between the notional amount and the fair value of the instruments that you have reclassified so far. Is there &#x2013; or should I net that with the markdowns you have taken last year, if not, 3.5 billion is quite a big number and I'd like to know if you have perhaps a more updated number as of now or end of April? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry &#x2013; well of any dividend in the capital base we have presented just now. It clearly gives <mark type="inaudible" /> we seasonally given at the year-end. We have to see that the all profit in the capital base and then when the decision will be taken we have to deduct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in respect of the difference between the fair value and the book value of our positions, we have an overall impact of around 2.6 billion of which then the 300 that we mentioned before were due to Q1. So the difference between book value is 2.10 and is 2.6 billion. Book value and net value is 2.6 billion.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Pierluigi Passerone of Intermonte. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions, the first one is on government bonds. I'm asking will you consider alternative options to the issue of such an instrument in the case that things will actually going forward be better compared to what we've seen in the last three months or even comparing to the current scenario. So just to understand that if there is a scenario in which you might decide to issue alternative instruments to government bonds, and still on government bonds if in the case you will go ahead with issue of such instruments. There is a reasonable timeframe for the issue, may be third quarter &#x2013; end of third quarter, beginning of fourth?</p>
          <p>Second question getting back to page 14th of you presentation, is it possible to have a split of the impact coming from positive contribution from RWA, a split between the Basel 2 migration impact and that pro-cyclicality effect in first quarter. Also if it's &#x2013; what's the reasonable additional pro-cyclicality effect that we might assume at this stage looking forward? Third question is just a confirmation you already elaborated on this probably I didn't get the answer. Did you said something like net &#x2013; at Group level net interest income is expected to bottom in second quarter whereas fees are likely to already have bottomed in first quarter as other competitors of yours are seeing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Starting from government bonds. The timeframe is expected to be in the second quarter for the open instruments and in the third one for the Italian instrument. For the time being we are not considering any alternative choice. Talking of volatility, clearly we are not forecasting any changes in all the capital that we are working on for the year-end number. We are starting from 638 so we are not considering even what we have already recovered because it's impossible to make a plan of the price of Generali, or the price of government bonds to recover the delta for <mark type="inaudible" /> is reserve our government bonds. Clearly the closing down of the spreads is positive, but we cannot have any required number in our capital growth, that's exactly the same for currencies and so this is something that we are not changing to the....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Actually I was asking the actual number for first quarter, what has been the additional Basel 2 migration impact on the one hand, and on the other what has been the negative impact from pro-cyclicality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, you told me all that, sorry. This is implied in the risk-weighted assets &#x2013; in the risk-weighted asset numbers. So the pro-cyclicality has been mainly offset by managerial action in terms of the risk-weighted asset optimization. I have to be honest is that the pro-cyclicality impact is significantly lower than the expected one.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't think so. Then talking all about net interest margin and commissions, on the net interest margin as Roberto currently told it was tied to the second quarter, would be the one in which we will bottom down. Because the Euribor reduction we think has reached the bottom, since the impact as we have seen is completely on the deposit side mainly for Italy while clearly the asset reprising activity will come in during the quarters. So we do expect that second quarter will be the bottom line than we will see recovery. On the fees, clearly today we're slightly in a more positive financial market which is a good for all the management fees in asset management, is also slightly better for the retail network based activities. On the capital market, clearly the first quarter was the best, we, that the first one has been the bottom and we do see a stability or a small improvement.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. When you were elaborating on net interest income saying that second quarter is likely to bottom down, it's reasonable to assume that you're talking about commercial net or net interest income. Which means basically first quarter results deducted by the impact from trading, let's say that you mentioned before in the tune of 270 and 300 million.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the cost income ratio, shall we be looking more towards the 58 as in first quarter or if that's the case would it be or do you think 62 as for the full year 2008 is more what we should be aiming for 2009? And then secondly with respect to MIB, I just sort of like struggled to understand the underlying revenue numbers, so you have 684 as the revenues and it seems to include 155 negative from credit spreads, 106 negative on ABF.</p>
          <p>And I think on the positive side you mentioned about two or 300 million, is that probably year's comp and is it fair to say two to 300 million from reversal from basis risk. And I just wondered if you can may be give us, a bit of an update about your Q2 performance in MIB? And then just lastly in terms of IAS39 reclassification, a number of banks have given us the, basically benefit or avoided cost to the P&amp;L from the reclassification. Is this around 2.5 billion that you said, you've already taken 2.6 billion before. So we are looking about 900 million avoided costs from the reclassification? Thank you.</p>

          <p>I'm sorry, starting from the first question, on the cost income ratio, if you go to page four, I think that you have the answer. Because as you can see the cost income ratio, the commercial banking is quite stable. Clearly the delta fourth quarter versus the first quarter is due to the results of MIB, which were the trading income is negative are deducted from the revenues clearly having an impact on the cost income ratio. So, we think that the cost income ratio in the commercial banking would improve and may be it depends on other revenues will evolve. And clearly is an area where there is today less volatilities then in the past but some volatility is still there.</p>
          <p>At page 39 and 40, you have the details of all the different business clients as you can see we have rather resilient investment banking and in markets then one day we have do discuss on what about risk appetite because till the fourth quarter all of you were talking of reducing market exposure. We have to understand what are you looking for, but in any case with a significantly lower exposure in terms of proper risk &#x2013; but as we said is now in the reclassified assets. So it's not having anymore an impact on these numbers. So there is a small portion which remains in the trading assets as proper position, and the other one have been reclassified and are in the process of being reduced. As Sergio was saying, we are continuously going down. So the revenue base now is more stable, but in that case Sergio can provide more detail.</p>

          <p>I guess, first of all in respect of the impact of reclassification, again, everything that has been reclassified in the first quarter had an impact of 13 million. So we avoided losses for 13 million. The overall benefit in Q1 for the entire portfolio that has been reclassified since 2008 was around 260 million. Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, then when we look into the second quarter, of course market environment is much more favorable and we are satisfied, very satisfied with the first six weeks, but as we save in bad times, we're not going to change our stands. We cannot make forecast in these environments.</p>

          <p>Hello, good morning everybody. I had a question reconcile on the CEE division, if I look at the CEE division, I see loans down 1 billion more or less and the RWA down 1 billion. And these are Basel 2 numbers. But if I go back to Basel 1 numbers. I have actually loans down 1 billion, but RWA up moving from Basel 1 and Basel 2 up more or less &#x20AC;7 billion, which is 8 to 10% of the total. Can you give us a little bit of detail on the composition of this lending book, maybe giving us details regarding the FX assets on the lending book, please? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I am looking at the page of the divisional data base, which is CEE division, where I have Q1 '09 RWA 75 billion and loan 63, while in Q4 I have loan 64, and RWA 67 &#x2013; 76, sorry. So, minus 1 billion loss and minus 1 billion RWA. But If I look at 2008, which is Basel 1, I have the same loan, I mean actually same loan, but RWA is 68, 47, so I have actually moving from one, I mean the same quarter, the last quarter of '08, I have RWA which in basil one is 69 billion and in Basel 2 is actually 75, 76, sorry, so last 6 billion. So given that there has been an FX effect I think and just a few details regarding the lending book if possible. If I look at the....</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I'm back just to underline that we have talked pretty little bit on Eastern Europe, you just explained it because of the question you got, but I had impression that your comments were particularly cautious let's say on the evolution in Italy of the credit quality. And I didn't see much about how cautious you are on the situation in Eastern Europe? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Central Eastern Europe, clearly, as we have seen from the page on asset quality per division, page 21, there has been a deterioration, clearly. So we are cautious on that. But clearly, the underlying situation is less negative than the one the market was seeing in January and February. This is pretty clear to us. It's always very difficult to make judgment because if you say that you are less worried then what is in the market, somebody can say that you are under-evaluating the problems. So what we have seen from the numbers is the fact that the division is still quite profitable. From what we're seeing in terms of asset quality, the deterioration, the pace of deterioration is slowing down significantly.</p>
          <p>So, we are less, so clearly, we are cautious, but we are less negative than what the market was considering a few weeks ago. I would say that today also the market mood is significantly improved. Clearly, also the IMF intervention or as you have seen from us the BRB funding, as such the funding concept is not capital as somebody wrote. It's clearly quite important because this is easing also the liquidity situation in this market. So we are seeing an improvement. Having said so quite clearly the oil price is relevant for many of these countries, because if we consider Kazakhstan and Russia mainly, which is a very, very important in terms of export as well as for Germany and for all the other countries of the area. And Ukraine is an important element. So as a combination of the IMF, interbank, the oil price that something which is also improving the overall situation.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that means your strategy remain unchanged which means no more openings there, cost control or cost cutting and see the remaining in the regions where you are?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but this is what we have said also because today to talk of change of strategies is mainly wishful thinking. So we have to be pragmatic because it's a market where there are clearly no changes in terms of strategic position for anybody.</p>
