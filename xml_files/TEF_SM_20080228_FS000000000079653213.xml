        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mar&#xED;a.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica's 2007 full-year results conference call.</p>
          <p>First let me introduce Santiago Fern&#xE1;ndez Valbuena, Telef&#xF3;nica's Chief Financial Officer, with whom I will share the review of the Group performance.  During the question and answer, you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to our effective committee.  As I have today with me Julio Linares, Chief Operating Officer, Guillermo Ansaldo, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe.</p>
          <p>Before turning to the numbers, I would like to stress that Telef&#xF3;nica equity as current remains very solid, combining the strong fundamentals and high returns. The results we are presenting today, the guidance for 2008 and the announcement of a new share buyback program reinforced our differential profile in the industry.  That profile, that shows our strong prior record of execution in a close industry with tangible results. First, we have again delivered on our commitments, meeting or exceeding our ambitious targets for 2007.  Second, we continue to out perform our peers, extracting value from our well-diversified asset portfolio, the deeper integration of our operations and our scale. Third, we have materially increased shareholder remuneration rates and dividends in launching a new share buyback program.  And finally, we are again set to post very solid results both in 2008 and in the long-term.  Let me now review these topics in detail.</p>
          <p>Slide number 4 shows the summary of 2007 P&amp;L.  Consolidated revenues grew by close to 7% year-on-year to top 56.4 billion euros.  In organic terms, sales went up by 7.4% position in Telef&#xF3;nica at the top of the circles in terms of top line settlements.</p>
          <p>2007 OIBDA exceeded 22.8 billion euros, up close to 20% or 7% in organic terms, showing the benefit of a scale and higher efficiencies achieved through our integrated management model. Operating income surpassed 17.3 billion euros, equivalent to a 42% nominal growth rate or more than 18% when translated into organic terms.  As a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow topped 14.8 billion euros in 2007, up 33% on 2006 figures. Operating cash flow organic growth was 12% in 2007.  Forex negative contribution to major financial methods growth stood in the 1.1 to 1.4-percentage point range.  In summary, very strong growth rate that is picked up from top to bottom line.</p>
          <p>The operating income growth flowed directly into a very solid net income increase as presented in slide number 5.</p>
          <p>Net income amounted to 8.9 billion euros in 2007, 43% more than a year ago.  Reported earnings per share reached 1.872 euros per share, or 43% annually, while excluding the impact from PPA's earnings per share will reach 2.012 euros.  Reported free cash flow percent totaled 1.859 euros in 2007.  These figures are totally in line with our organic target of doubling reported earnings per share, a free cash flow percent by 2010 from 2006 levels.</p>
          <p>And we continue to deliver on our commitments as we present in slide number 6.  I would like to highlight that once again we have met or exceeded our growth targets, target that have been upgraded along the year for the third year in a row.  Revenues and OIBDA growth reached the top end of the guidance, while operating income exceeded by four percentage points the high end of the target.  CapEx came in line with our estimate of 8.1 billion euros.  We believe at the group level, all the business lines meet their respective growth commitments in 2007.</p>
          <p>Slide number 7 plots the reconciliation between reported and adjusted for guidance 2007 OIBDA figures.  As noted, we are implementing restructuring measures that will increase efficiencies in the future years.  The impact of these measures on our numbers, I'll explain in detail in this slide.</p>
          <p>Group diversification and subscriber growth, which are key to reliable results are outlined in the slide number 8.  Telef&#xF3;nica continues to manage current industry level, capturing new customers, extending their usage patterns through bundled offers across all the markets.  In 2007, we had close to 26 million accesses to reach almost 229 million accesses.</p>
          <p>Broadband, Pay TV and mobile expansion are the key drivers of customer expansion, posting high double-digit growth rates.  In addition, our initiatives to capture more value from our customers are fighting their way with 34% of our total accesses having voice, broadband and TV bundles.</p>
          <p>From a regional perspective, Latin America continues to be the main revenue growth engine increasing growth to 13% year in organic terms to account for more than 50% of Telef&#xF3;nica top line expansion.  Spain and the rest of Europe represented more than 50% of Group sales and continued to post mid-single organic growth rate.  This explains the remarkable 7.4 organic revenue growth at Group level.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 9, in 2007 Group profitability remained high as we get in a strong hold on costs while driving a strong commercial activity.  Organic growth in operating costs was cut by close to two percentage points in 2007 to just 7.2.  The low status organic increase due to the high efficiencies achieved.  As such, Telef&#xF3;nica OIBDA margin has stood at 75.8, practically flat year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Slide number 10, reduced CapEx and operating cash flow generation.  2007 total CapEx reached 8 billion euros in nominal terms with 75% of this figure dedicated to growth and network transformation.  A strong CapEx effort is in comparison with high operating cash flow generation enhancing the ratio of our revenues to close to 22%.  Operating cash flow grew across all the regions, leading to an 11.8 year-on-year organic increase at the Group level to reach 14.8 billion euros.</p>
          <p>And now let me turn the call to Santiago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, C&#xE9;sar.  Ladies and gentleman please turn to slide number 11 for a review of our regional business units then we start with Telef&#xF3;nica Span.</p>
          <p>Let me first highlight that the fourth quarter has been just another quarter within the 2007 year with a strong commercial activity and revenue growth in line with the first nine months of the year.  Business has exceeded all announced targets with revenues growing 4.7% and OIBDA 11.6% on guidance terms in 2007.</p>
          <p>This year we have completed the 2003 to 2007 redundancy program in the wireline company with the provision of 229 million euros in the fourth quarter of '07 and we have already launched and started a new program for 2008 as part of the ongoing integration process of the wireline and wireless operations.  This has led to an additional provision of 322 million euros in the fourth quarter of '07, which takes the total '07 provision to 667 million euros.</p>
          <p>While this charge has reduced OIBDA growth in the short-term, it is paving the way for enhanced efficiency networks in coming years.  In respect of this, the 5.6% underlying OIBDA growth in '07 showing the outstanding business performance throughout the year.</p>
          <p>Slide number 12 shows the results of the wireline business' commercial strategy focused on upselling towards existing customer base and expanding accesses.  Fixed telephony accesses evolution in the fourth quarter was outstanding with positive net adds of 33,000 lines, losing just 0.3% of the lines in 2007.  This is our best performance since 2001.</p>
          <p>In broadband, we maintained our market share above 56% and reached 4.6 million retail clients or 22% better than a year ago.  With the recently launched new products, we are ready to lead the broadband growth opportunity having products targeting all segments, high-end with the 10 to 30 mega connections to be enhanced through 2008 with products based on fiber and VDSL, our reference 3 mega offering, and a range of 1 mega products for the lower segments.</p>
          <p>In the Pay TV market, we surpassed half a million clients, increasing our share of the market to just below 13%.  This is the resulting in both higher ARPUs, which have gone up 5% to 67 euros and increased revenues.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 13, revenue growth of 3.7% in Q4 was similar to the first nine months.  Traditional access and voice revenues are showing an improved performance, twice the '06 fourth quarter figures.  The excellent telephony accesses evolution together with the monthly fee increase are the basis for differential business performance, enhanced with broadband, data and IT growth.</p>
          <p>Broadband remained a growth engine at revenue level with over 800,000 retail net adds in '07 and a resulting ARPU at 45 euros. Adding data and IT revenue growth, we get to the 3.7% total growth in revenues exceeding the guidance and standing out among European peers.</p>
          <p>In the next slide, slide number 14, we show the almost 15% reported OIBDA growth and how it is affected by the lower provisions related to workforce reductions in '07 versus '06.  If you strip out this effect, and you adjust it for one-offs as in 2007, you find among others OIBDA growth stands at 5.1%, showing the sound underlying performance of our businesses.</p>
          <p>OIBDA growth exceeded revenue growth by 1.4 percentage points as higher efficiencies have been achieved.  According to guidance criteria, OIBDA grew by 15.8%, or at the top end of the guidance.</p>
          <p>On slide number 15, we continue with our mobile operations in Spain, which posted very strong commercial results, both in the fourth quarter and for the whole year.  2007, we led the growth of the market, achieving higher net adds than any of our competitors, and sustaining our undisputed leadership.  In the fourth quarter alone, our net adds reached 407,000.</p>
          <p>The Christmas campaign was very strong, with a different approach versus last year.  We moved from short-term traffic promotions to a campaign focused on customer loyalty that will continue paying off in the next few quarters in churn containment.</p>
          <p>We focused our efforts on value growth, recording an excellent performance in the postpay segment, with 1.5 million net adds in the year, and contract customers growing over 12% versus December '06, to represent close to 60% of our base.  The churn rate has not only been outstanding, but also a differentiating factor, in a year where we have seen the 4th player and 9 MVNOs entering the Spanish market.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we review usage patterns.  In 2007, outgoing ARPU remained almost flat, with growth in data ARPU offsetting voice ARPU pressure.  Data ARPU growth continued to be driven by the strong increase in connectivity revenue, up 72% on a yearly basis.  Cumulative termination rate costs in the year of 14.9% hit incoming ARPU, resulting in a 1.8% decline in total ARPU. <mark type="inaudible" /> more weight in our customer base, it is worth having a look at outgoing ARPU performance excluding these rates, which for the whole of 2007 posted positive growth.</p>
          <p>In the last quarter of the year, we led the push on 3G, adding close to 700,000 3G customers, reaching 3.5 million, or 16% of our customer base, up 10 percentage points versus December '06.</p>
          <p>In slide number 17, we show that we have met our guidance in terms of both service revenue and we have exceeded the OIBDA targets.  Service revenues increased by a healthy 4.2% over 2006 on comparable terms, and retained by the strong 6.5 advance &#x2013; the 6.5% advance in customer revenue, fully backed by the customer base growth.  Incoming revenues, including both interconnection and roaming-in, declined year-on-year due to lower prices.</p>
          <p>Regarding profitability, a 154 million euros provision has been recorded in Q4, leading to a 2.8% growth year-on-year.  Excluding these one-offs, OIBDA would have grown 6.5% ahead of the committed 4 to 5% guidance and expanding margins on good &#x2013; on the good quality of revenues.</p>
          <p>In next slide, you have the reconciliation of how to get from the 2007 reported OIBDA to 2007 OIBDA for guidance comparison, should you want to check those numbers out for yourselves and verify that we have fully delivered.</p>
          <p>Let me now start and, to go through the review for Latin American properties on slide number 19.  The commercial activity in the region remains very strong.  Mobile penetration surpassed the 70% mark in December of '07 and over 12 percentage points increase in the last year.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of '07, we achieved record mobile net adds of close to 7.3 million, up 61% year-on-year.  Customer growth accelerated to increase by almost 17% versus December '06 and surpassed the 134 million accesses mark, driven by wireline, broadband and mobile services.  This strong operating performance led to a solid revenue evolution that increased 11% year-on-year in current euros, on the back of favorable 6% mobile ARPU increase in the year or well ahead of the indication given in London.</p>
          <p>Reported OIBDA expanded by 8.4%, impacted by personnel reorganization that reached close to 320 million euros in 2007.  Excluding this charge, OIBDA would have increased by 11.8%.</p>
          <p>Operating cash flow in the year almost reached 3.8 billion euros, with positive cash flow generation in all the countries, except Mexico.  Revenues and OIBDA performance across the different countries are shown on slide number 20.</p>
          <p>The top line performance has been robust along the year in most of the countries where we operate, reaping the benefits of our business diversification. Regarding operating income before D&amp;A, please take into account the personnel reorganization programs in place, as their reported OIBDA growth figures of the integrated operators are impacted.</p>
          <p>All countries show the positive performance with the exception of Brazil, where the bad debt provision and the new revenue stream with lower margin are hitting the profitability.</p>
          <p>Let me now share with you how we are accelerating the transformation of our wireline operations in slide number 21.  In the fourth quarter of '07, broadband net adds reached 332,000 or up 19% year-on-year.  Total retail broadband connections surpassed the 5 million mark in 2007 for a 33.2% increase on an annual basis.  This progress on broadband development is a key to our strategy, both fostering bundles and increasing broadband speed to enhance the use of our value-added services.</p>
          <p>Growth in Pay TV was even higher at this last quarter of the year.  Net adds were over three times those of the fourth quarter of '06, partially due to the incorporation of TVA customers.  Pay TV is enabling us to offer triple play solutions, key tools to limit the pressure on the traditional baseline business.</p>
          <p>Let me also highlight the strong increase in bundles, which already represent 53% of our fixed accesses, 15 percentage points better than 2006.</p>
          <p>Let me now review our mobile operations here in Brazil in slide number 22.  Vivo's performance in the last quarter of the year has been robust in a highly competitive market.  Vivo leveraged its highly quality network &#x2013; its high quality networks, commercial channels and store brand awareness to increase gross adds by 66% in the first quarter of '07, 83% of them in GSM. Churn continues to go down to reach 2.1% in the fourth quarter, allowing to increase last year fourth quarter net adds by 6.6 times. In 2007, Vivo grew its customer base by 15%, topping 33.5 million.</p>
          <p>ARPU evolution was also outstanding, up 14.5% year-on-year, or 6.6% if we exclude the B&amp;K effect.  This brilliant operating performance translates into an 18% growth in service revenue on the back of outgoing service revenues that accelerated their growth rate in the last quarter of the year.  Revenue growth, coupled with strict control measures, resulted in a 30.8% OIBDA growth, on a like-for-like basis, expanding margins by almost 3 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Now on slide number 23, we continue with our Mexican operations.  Fourth quarter commercial results have been very strong on the back of new innovative and competitive products.  Gross adds in the last quarter of the year increased 31% to reach 2.3 million.</p>
          <p>Churn continued its positive performance against the market trend and came down year-on-year to a standard 2.5%, driving net adds up by 32%.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we gained close to four million customers, expanding our customer base by 47% to surpass the 4.5 million mark.  Let me remark, the good performance of churn on a yearly basis that allowed us to cost lead a 43% increase in gross adds in the year include an 82% advance in net adds.</p>
          <p>Our usage patterns continue their strong momentum.  In 2007, minutes of use soared by close to 80%, leading to a 16% ARPU increase, a very positive trend in the Mexican market.  This robust operating performance drove outgoing service revenues up by 82%.  Despite the strong commercial activity, 2007 OIBDA reached 179 million euros, a 12.5% margin versus the negative figures registered in 2006.  Operating cash flow improved significantly in 2007 from minus 191 million euros to minus 51 million euros, though it is still impacted by the stronger investment efforts made in 2007.</p>
          <p>And in the next slide, we review our other Latin American mobile operations.  In Argentina, Venezuela, Uruguay, and Colombia, outgoing service revenue growth in 2007 outpaced customer growth.  Let me highlight Colombian performance, where fourth quarter outgoing revenue growth excelled the usual performance.  This strong revenue growth combined with efficiency advances led to margin expansion.  Peru's commercial activity has been very strong, leading to the highest customer growth in the group.  Revenues in OIBDA grew steadily, though margin was diluted due to the high commercial activity.</p>
          <p>In Chile, the most mature market in the region, we achieved strong ARPU advances that lead to a 23% growth in outgoing service revenue.  To finish with Ecuador, where the turnaround of operations is showing up, usage is increasing, leading to 16% increase in fourth quarter outgoing service revenue versus the minus 1% growth recorded in the first nine months of the year.  Therefore, for the whole year 2007 service revenue remained flat.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to Europe starting with slide number 25.  Revenues went up by 9.9% year-over-year to almost 14.5 billion euros.  Excluding Airwave, revenue growth was 11.7%, in line with guidance.  OIBDA reached almost 5 billion euros, including the gain from the disposal of Airwave.  Excluding personnel reorganization and other non-foreseeable charges, OIBDA would be around 4 billion, representing growth of over 10% at the top end of guidance.</p>
          <p>Personnel reorganization implemented across the group during the year forced the cancellation of the T-Mobile national roaming agreement as we accelerated the build out of our network gave rise to a one-off charge of 338 million euros in 2007.</p>
          <p>CapEx was below guidance and fell almost 17% year-on-year due to the exclusion of Airwave and 2007 CapEx brought forward into 2006 for O2 Germany's 3G network rollout.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide number 26, the U.K. business continued to outgrow the market and both customer and ARPU growth were behind the 18.6% rise in total revenues in 2007, above the top end of our guidance.  O2 U.K. ended the year leading the market with 18.4 million mobile subscribers, up 4.2% on an annual basis. The contract customer base grew to 37% of the total base by the end of the year, an increase of 1.8 percentage points driven by good gross adds and continued improvement in churn.</p>
          <p>During the year, 79% of total net additions were on contract.  The iPhone helped to deliver record net connections of contract customers in the fourth quarter. On-net ARPU went up by 4.4% in the fourth quarter with positive evolution of both usage and data ARPU, growing by 9.8% and 9.1% respectively.  Non-SMS data revenues are growing at over 40%.</p>
          <p>Growth in OIBDA was 1%, but excluding personnel reorganization charges, growth was 10.6% and fully in line with guidance. OIBDA margin showed a steady increase over the year as expected, reaching 26.4% for the full year, excluding personnel reorganization charges.</p>
          <p>And now in slide number 27, we present O2 Germany's result. From an operating standpoint, O2 Germany has successfully focused on growing its convert customer net editions with 756,000 customers added in 2007, representing 48% growth over 2006. The total customer base ended the year at 12.5 million customers, up 13.1% versus '06. This included the reduction of 310,000 in the prepaid segments after a review of revenue generating customers. Our Chivo mobile base continues to grow well, now with 1.2 million customers. The Fonic brand launched in September, has already grown to 200,000 customers. Regarding in units and mail tariffs, more than 2.14 million customers have already signed up.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica Deutschland grew its unbundled plans by a factor of 3.5% to reach 671,000 in 2007. O2 DSL is beginning to gain traction with 75,000 customers at the end of the year and a strong order book. The trend in revenues improved during the year with fourth quarter revenues flat year on year.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth in 2007 was 6.7%, slightly under guidance criteria. With continued mobile customer growth during 2007 and a re-balancing of the mobile tariff portfolio underway, along with the growing DSL wholesale business and a strong order book for O2 DSL going to 2008, O2 Germany will return to growth in 2008. 2007, OIBDA was 473 million euros impacted by personnel reorganization and the charge for cancellation of the national roaming contract with T Mobile among others. Excluding these charges and under guidance criteria, OIBDA grew 23.8% towards the top end of guidance.</p>
          <p>In the Czech Republic in slide number 28, the business continues to grow at a healthy rate of 3% at the top end of revenue guidance, driven mainly by the mobile business but also helped by growing broadband revenues in the fixed business offsetting the decline in traditional access and voice revenues.</p>
          <p>The trend in line loss is encouraging, helped by a growth in broadband connections, driven by speed upgrades and bundled offers with 100,000 customers now taking the bundle.</p>
          <p>O2 TV customers exceeded 73,000 at the end of the year with a 25% increase in retail broadband connections.</p>
          <p>In mobile, the proportion of contract customers in the base continues to grow, now at 43.8% with bundled quarterly ARPU increasing by 2.2% year on year, driven by both increased usage and the changing customer mix.</p>
          <p>OIBDA was fully in line with guidance with the year-on-year decline mainly due to costs associated with the Slovak businesses, which reduced OBIDA margins by around two points as expected.  OIBDA margin for the year was only 1.1 percentage point lower than in 2006 due to efficiency savings and re-branding costs booked in 2006.  The Slovak business reached 565,000 registered customers at the end of the year.  Due to the high level of double SIM cards in the market, inactivity levels remain high.</p>
          <p>And now, please move to slide 29 for a quick update on group synergies.  All initiatives to further integrate operations are running on track.  Yield in synergies up more than 1.6 billion euros in 2007, well above the target that we had committed for this year.  Close to half of our 2007 target comes from regional management mainly related to our focus on the group commercial approach actions as well as the integration of network operations, processes, and IT.  Global initiatives to extract benefits of scale add close to 40% of the total synergies.  By geographies, around 69% of 2007 synergies have been generated in Latin America where regional management has been developed since 2004.</p>
          <p>And now on slide 30, we turn to show our financial profile which has been stable in the middle of the financial turmoil of the latter half of 2007.  Interest expense reached 2.8 billion euros in 2007 which on 50.8 billion euros, total average debt provides an effective cost of servicing debt of 5.59%.  Close to one-third of the increase is due to a high percentage of debt denominated in Latin American currencies and close to two-thirds of the increase, or 32 basis points, are due to higher short-term interest rates in Europe.  In the fourth quarter, the FX breakdown for liabilities remained broadly stable.</p>
          <p>On the bottom left chart of this page, we would like to highlight our maturity profile, which is especially relevant in the current market conditions.  Telef&#xF3;nica has no need to access capital markets in the near future, as we can rely on our free cash flow generation and our unused credit facilities of almost 10 billion euros or more than 50% of which are long-term.  An additional strong point is that our average debt life is 6.3 years, thus, longer than the time needed for full repayment if all available free cash flow was dedicated to this goal.</p>
          <p>We have visited all major bull markets in 2007, in benchmark size, and we have opened the new Czech and Japanese markets.  Most of the funds raised in 2007 were applied to smooth out our maturity profile in years '08, '09 and 2010, to allow us to show current comfortable maturities and avoid dependence on volatile current markets.  Another sign of our healthy position is the rolling over of our 2 billion euro Commercial Paper program throughout the whole 2007 and the first months of 2008, at spreads very close to zero.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide 31, for a comment on our de-leveraging progress.  Please note how Telef&#xF3;nica has been able to upgrade shareholder remuneration to 5.2 billion euros, and de-leverage by 7 billion euros at the same time.  As of December, our net financial debt stands at 2.3 times OIBDA, excluding extraordinary results from divestments, significantly below our 2006 figure, as a consequence of our net debt reduction and OIBDA growth.  Net debt plus cash commitments is within the leverage target range of two to two-and-a-half that we set last October in our London Investor Day.</p>
          <p>Financial debt has been cut by almost 7 billion euros, driven mainly by first, a 3.7 billion euros free cash flow, retained after shareholder remuneration; second, 2.5 billion euros net divestments and third; 0.8 billion euros of foreign exchange savings, thanks to foreign exchange liability management.  And now, let me turn back the call over to our chairman.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Santiago.  Now, I would like to run you through our 2008 guidance.  In the slide number 32, once again, Telef&#xF3;nica sets benchmark in the industry, both in terms of the stability and growth prospect.  We have a very positive outlook for this year.  With solid 2008 targets being totally in line with our long-term guidance provided in London four months ago.  We expect top line growth to grow between 6 and 8%.  We anticipate operating income before depreciation and amortization to go up by 7.5 to 11%.  Growth in operating income is expected to reach 13 to 19%.</p>
          <p>Total CapEx will be around 8.6 billion euros in 2008.  The increase in CapEx in 2008 is mainly driven by initiatives to foster top line growth.  CapEx in Latin America will be above 2007 figure due to the higher than initially expected customer growth. The strong traffic increase in wireless <mark type="inaudible" /> 2.5 and 3G networks in key markets to further expand our programs and basic Pay TV services.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we will continue to invest in growth and transformation, expanding our broadband networks both in wireline and wireless.  In Europe, we are accelerating the network build in Germany, providing the business with a strong product line to capture the significant growth opportunities in this country with a 3.5 billion euros CapEx plan for 2007, 2010.  At the same time, we will further develop our fixed broadband networks both in the U.K. and in Germany.</p>
          <p>In October, we anticipate the total CapEx of less than 36 billion euros for 2007, 2010 period.  But we do not think that the spending will be linear.  We are maintaining our guidance 2008 to mark the peak in the CapEx deceleration and total CapEx in 2009 and 2010 will be in the range of 8 billion euros per year.</p>
          <p>Leveraging our well diversified for portfolio of assets and geographies we are expecting above average sector growth rate across our business in 2008.  In Spain, we expect Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a to post very robust results. Fixed broadband in wireless markets should be lower than in 2007. So broadband wireless growth will be higher.</p>
          <p>We are expecting sales to grow between 2 and 3.5% while OIBDA growth will be in the 6 to 8% range.  This performance remarks our differential growth profile versus all the incumbent players in Europe.  Please notice that from 2008, the business model applicable to most telephony services hasn't changed due to the new regulatory framework.  Thus, only the net margin on the business will be recorded as revenues. To facilitate like-for-like comparisons, 2000 revenues adjusted for guidance are considered in these changes.  I would like to stress that this change did not have a meaningful effect on EBITDA neither an impact in our long-term revenue guidance.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we will advance in our strategy to capture growth opportunities and build a bigger business for the future. This translates into a revenue growth in the 4 to 7% range, while OIBDA is expected to grow between 2 to 6%.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we will accelerate our growth in both mobile and DSL markets, which will clearly have a cost.  We think this is the right thing to do in order to build towards our targets of significant market share gains in the mobile and a higher DSL customer base by 2010.  We want to create a scaled business and capture the opportunities in this market.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the wholesale DSL business has only just broken even at the OIBDA level on a monthly basis.  Therefore, first year contributions to OIBDA will be weighted towards 2009 and 2010.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., we will capture growth and build our DSL base.  Our DSL offer has had very positive customer feedbacks, and we will have a more aggressive push in the market to begin building towards our 2008 target of 1 million customers.  At the same time, we will continue to grow the mobile market in 2008.  We see an opportunity to take more growth and share in post-paid as solid competitors falter.  This will lead to a more valuable business and share growth for post-paid ARPU, but we want to improve our position in the market.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we aim to capture a significant part of the untapped growth potential in wireless and broadband penetrations, forcing bundles and accelerating the transformation of wireline operations.  This will allow revenues to grow between 11 to 14%, while the larger scale of operations and the focus on efficiency will lead of EBITDA growth to stand between 12 and 15%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, in context of different rumors every day, we are not only presenting a very robust guidance for 2008, but confirming our long term target.</p>
          <p>Slide number 34 shows how we are fully on track to meet the guidance we provided in our last investors conference in October.  If you add to the 2007 actual growth rate, our forecast for 2008, you can see that meeting 2010 targets does not imply that we will have to outperform.</p>
          <p>I will now explain slide 35 which includes a guide how 2008 targets have been calculated, that you can review in detail later on.  Our solid growth prospects are accompanied by an enhanced shareholder remuneration policy as we present in slide 36.  In the year 2007, we have distributed to shareholders close to 5.2 billion euros; combining dividends and buybacks equivalent to a 5% cash yield.</p>
          <p>Yesterday, we announced a new 100 million share buyback program which will run until mid 2009.  We will reset the start of the program to the first of January of this year and its complete execution is sensitive to the cash flow generation and share price evolution.  This new share buyback program, jointly with the recently increased dividend for 2008 to 1 euro per share represents a very attractive remuneration policy.</p>
          <p>To sum up, a robust performance in 2007, a confirmation of our track record for delivering our commitments and the solid guidance for 2008 reinforces our differential profile in the industry.  Despite market concerns due to market uncertainties, our fundamentals remain intact. And the underlying performance of our business is very robust.  Commercial momentum continues across countries and business, fostering top-line growth, while benefiting from our integrated strategy and skill in the diversification derives in further efficiency gains.  As a result, we retain benchmark growth rates from top to the bottom.  Shareholder remuneration comes first, our strong free cash flow generation allow us not only to increase dividends but to announce a new share buyback program offering very attractive shareholder returns.</p>
          <p>We hope that 2007 results, 2008 guidance and the new share buyback program released today increase your confidence in our company and alleviate your concerns about the growth prospect.  The rest about Telef&#xF3;nica has not changed since we met in October.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and now we are all ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you sir.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes from the line of Luis Prota.  Please go ahead announcing your company name and location.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello.  This is Luis Prota, Morgan Stanley from Madrid.  I have two questions.  The first one is on fixed telephone in Spain and what are the risks behind the PSTN growth in the fourth quarter of 33,000 lines, whether it's because the market has been growing or you are taking share or campaigns for free connection?  What are the reasons behind?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the impact that you are foreseeing from any potential economic slowdown in Spain in terms of line loss but also ARPUs and DSL, voice traffic and overall for the group.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Luis.  This is Guillermo Ansaldo.  First, the positive net gain that we saw in the last quarter of last year in fixed wireline  in the PSTN we believe it's an exceptional result and should not be extrapolated into the future.  I think it was a coincidence of us having two free of charge installation campaigns during that quarter and maybe the competition was not that agile during that quarter.  The market as a whole according to our estimation grew by almost 2% during the last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second questions, our guidelines for 2008 take into account our best information and estimates for the whole year as of today.  So we feel very comfortable with those numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Terry Sinclair from Citi.  Two questions.  First of all, you make provisions for personnel restructuring often.  I understand that the Spanish process is now concluded, but could you just confirm that? What further personnel reductions are you expecting, for example in Latin America, over the next couple of years?  To what extent are these actually recurring rather than non-recurring items?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could we just talk a little bit about your expectations for German margin recovery beyond '08?  It looks to me from your guidance as though we have strong revenue growth in '08 with revenue &#x2013; sorry with margin pressure and then beyond '08 to meet the guidance one would have to have a strong margin increase.  What kind of commercial policy goes with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the provisions for Latin America, this is Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete speaking, what we have done, as Santiago has said in beginning of the presentation, we are accelerating the transformation of the wireline business in Latin America and therefore we are anticipating that the impact at the end of last year in order, to make it more recurring for the time being, in order to make it sustainable for the time being.  So we are not anticipating any other movements for the time being.  What we are just doing is accelerating the transformation of the wireline business, adapting then to the new market conditions.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Terry, it's Matthew here.  Just on your German question, I think you're right, '08 for us is clearly a year of investment, building foundations, both in the network and in our distribution network in terms of our retail stores and in terms of the customer propositions.  What I would say is though that through '09-'10 we'll clearly start to benefit from having turned off the T-Mobile roaming as we start to use our network more and more.  On your specific question on specific margins for Germany, clearly what we don't do is guide by individual businesses in terms of margins into the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's true that you would anticipate margins building beyond '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well certainly as our DSL wholesale business runs into profit that will start to help us and as the level of investment we put in our customers and our foundations, clearly we would expect to see some benefits, yes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Christian Kern.  Please go ahead with your question announcing your company name and location.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My name is Christian Kern from Lehman in London.  Two questions, if I may, one, the macro environment has changed quite dramatically since you gave your long-term guidance in October.  I understand with the '08 guidance, you remain comfortable with that, but I was wondering if you want to use this opportunity to update us on what the macro assumptions are in your long-term guidance, especially as Spain is slowing down.</p>
          <p>The second question would be on the geographic breakdown of your 2008 CapEx guidance.  We see a trend of CapEx going up across the industry so that would be very helpful for us to understand.  And finally, on Slide 16, you are talking about SMS and as a percentage of data revenue in the split it's decreasing, so I was wondering if we should look at this as SMS cannibalization happening in Spain from connectivity?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is C&#xE9;sar Alierta.  You know we are in 24 countries and when we deliver our guidance, it is very extensive and deep work of all our business operations and what's going to be, we expect to be that year.  So, our guidance for 2008 are on a very sound basis on the very deep work around the business lines, on the micro and situation of poor countries in every country.  We are in a growth sector.  We've had been in predictive functions.  The specifics of our industry in operations are very much sustained and that is in which order our guidance is founded and we are -- so we are in very well deep work and that is the tradition in the house. And now, Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a, because our biggest increase in CapEx is Latin America, Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a will talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first, let me remind you that in the CapEx year for 2008 we very recently announced a successful spectrum billing in Brazil for Telef&#xF3;nica is included and therefore, you have a one-time impact there.  But, on the more underlying trends, also remember that we are anticipating part of the CapEx here follows off the long-term plan indicated in London because we are seeing more robust growth in terms of penetration rates in Latin America globally all around and therefore, we need to be there to capture these clients, and that's why we are anticipating CapEx.</p>
          <p>On top of that, as we have been mentioning before, the transformation of the wireline business is also accelerating.  We need to accelerate that because precisely, for the very robust evolution of the mobile business and that's why in order to be able to bundle, we are also accelerating investment of upgrading our networks for DSL and also in terms of investing in our systems in order to be able to provide more sophisticated double and triple plays, under TEF, which is also accelerated.</p>
          <p>So, that's why you'll see that peak in CapEx in year 2008 in Latin America and that is why the message that we would like to send you is that we're anticipating CapEx that we are foreseeing in the long-term guidance contemplated in London.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Christian, this is Guillermo Ansaldo.  Regarding your question in Page 16, I think the fact that we have to look at here is that we are growing on a yearly basis, but also in the last quarter of 2007, over 70% in connectivity data revenues in the mobile business, this is mobile broadband.  And that's a trend that will continue very strong along this year.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

          <p>So, is it fair to say that you do not see any cannibalization impact on SMS at this point?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  This is Damien Maltarp from Cazenove in London.  Two questions, just I guess going back to the Germany question if I could push a little bit more on that.  The commentary that Germany wouldn't contribute to EBITDA growth until 2009, 2010. Should we be interpreting that as a suggestion that German EBITDA in absolute terms might actually decline in 2008 or is it just going to grow at a slower growth rate relative to the rest of the Telef over 2 group?  And the second question on the Brazilian fixed line, there's obviously been a lot of commentary about Telemar and Brazil Telecom potentially getting together.  Does this pose an incremental risk to Telef?  Is there any risk that they're going start encroaching on the Sao Paulo region?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Damien, it's Matthew.  I'll pick up the question on Germany.  There's a few puts and takes in 2008 in Germany.  Broadly across the whole business the margin will be broadly flat but underneath that we expect to see a bit of growth in the mobile business with further investment in our retail DSL business and wholesale DSL business and also some of the foundations. Okay?  I'll hand it over now.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of your question regarding the Brazilian competitive landscape and this potential combination of Brasil Telecom and Telemar, the message that we would like to send is that 10 years after the privatization, it was foreseeable that the landscape should evolve, and therefore we are not close to that.  The only thing that we are seeing is an opportunity to make the global regulatory environment in Brazil to evolve also, and not being also only for these punctual and specific transaction, or combination.  And as a result we see that there is opportunity to make this regulatory environment more open to the new types of telecommunications, in terms of duals and triple plays.  And that's our position.  And in terms of the potential, more intensive aggression in terms of the Sao Paulo for the new combined entity, we are already considering that because Oi has already &#x2013; or Telemar with Oi, has already been significantly marking that they will be entering into the market.  We are prepared for that, we have products for that.  Remember that Vivo is the most valuable brand in Brazil globally.  That now we have national coverage that we have been able also to be successful also with the Telamin transaction.  So we foresee a Vivo, a more powerful Vivo than the one that we had at the beginning of year 2007.  So we are monitoring that, but we are not, for the time being, specifically concerned.</p>

          <p>I will take care of your first question, Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete again.  On the Ecuador, we don't have any figure of Ecuador included in that CapEx figure because so far we don't have any indication of what might be the amount; because in spite of the noise that you might be hearing, it is still not clear what is the total amount going to be.  It is neither clear what is going to be the split of that amount between the leader of the market in Ecuador, Am&#xE9;rica M&#xF3;vil and ourselves, remember they have two-thirds of that market, and it isn't clear what is going to be included in that figure in terms of CapEx commitment for the coming years, and the potential delay in the payment.  So it's still too soon to say what's going to be the impact of Ecuador, and that's why we are not contemplating any specific figures for the CapEx.</p>

          <p>Yes hello, it's David Wright from JPMorgan in London.  Just on the buyback program, the 2 billion buyback announced just four months after the Investor Day, you know, it has traditionally, I think if I refer back to Valencia, been your policy I think, and also Seville I think, to announce buybacks at the Investor Day.  So, so soon after that, is this a response to the sort of de-rating of the sector? You mentioned that it's going to be a buyback sensitive to stock prices, and as such should we expect it to be fairly aggressive at these levels?  If that is the case, you know, perhaps it's 2 billion, it doesn't last so long, should we be sort of expecting, you know, more of an extended share buyback program to be kind of constantly topped up through the year?  The 2 billion against your cash flow generation is a fairly low number especially if we look at the window into the first half of next year.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question, David, this is Santiago.  You're absolutely right that the tradition that we had was to announce our buyback and remuneration packages at Investor Days.  I think we warned sufficiently at the Investor Day that when the full numbers for '07 were known we will take a look at whether or not a renewed buyback effort would be sensible.  The board has indeed decided that this is the case and it is predicated upon the confidence in the cash flow generation and not any nervousness about the current de-rating of our stock or the sector, which we certainly do not like.  But there is very little we can do to counter it, other than continue to fulfill our commitment. So you should, I think, contemplate that more as a complement to what we announced in London, than to a substitute or an early warning of any other thing.  We're going to do 100 million shares and we always say that those are going to be dependent on the cash flow generation continuing to flow as we expect it to do and the share price. The current share prices we certainly think it is more appropriate to go fast than to go slow, but we have given ourselves the full 18 months until the next general assembly of '09 comes about.  And then we can send those shares to cancel, which is indeed what we will do with this buyback as we have done in the past two programs.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  It's Jonathan Dann from Bear Stearns in London and I have two questions.  One is, in Europe most of your peers appear to be doing network-sharing deals and Telef&#xF3;nica O2 seems to be stepping away from any.  And secondly, in Europe your fixed and mobile assets are merged, and in Latin America they tend to still be separate.  Could we expect mergers in Latin America for these operational and potentially fiscal synergies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Jon, it's Matthew.  I'll pick up the network sharing and then hand to Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a.  I think it's no secret that certainly in the U.K. we entered into relatively heavy discussions with both 3 and T-Mobile on potential network sharing.  And having looked at it in some depth, we came to the conclusion that the size of the prize was not worth the risk to customer experience and really maintaining control over that customer experience and what we consider to be a key asset.  Interestingly, you would have seen the Vodafone and Orange announcement last week, which was certainly a lot shallower than they originally announced because in effect they ended up just announcing a marsh thing, which we do anyway. So their idea of a complete joint venture company clearly didn't come off.  So we'll look at it, if it makes commercial and customer sense for us, we'll do it.  But certainly we haven't seen anything so far that really makes sound commercial sense for us.  I'll hand over to Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question about the fixed mobile structuring in Latin America.  Let me first stress the fact that the main focus that we have right now in Latin America is to take advantage of the growth prospects of the mobile business and that's why we're accelerating in terms of the deployment and the efficiency of our mobile assets and at the same time we're accelerating the transformation of the wireline.  So considering that the agenda of both businesses for the time being is not exactly the same, we are prudent with that approach, but at the same time remember also that the bulk of the synergies that we are getting at the group level are positioned in Latin America.  So there is a lot of things already being done independently of the current shareholding structure of the different companies in Latin America.  We are taking advantage wherever we are present in both the mobile and the wireline business of cross-utilization of the commercial networks, of the coordination of the network deployment.  And a very good example of that is the situation that we have in Peru where we are expanding the coverage of the traditional business in terms of fixed line accesses using our wireless technology.  So yes we are advancing, not in terms of doing corporate restructuring but yes in terms of reaching full collaboration and at the same time we are taking advantage of the huge growth prospect that we have in the region in order to focus the different business in the different topics.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Luigi Minerva from HSBC.  One question on Brazil.  If the consolidation happens between Telemar and Brasil Telecom will that bring the full ownership of Vivo back on your priorities list?  So would you consider it as a higher importance?  And the second point on the U.K. and the communication from Ofcom this morning asking O2 to meet the 3G roll out obligation by June '08, how comfortable you are with that?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you this is C&#xE9;sar Alierta.  We state clearly that we wanted to buy 100% of Vivo and still we are very committed to buying 100% of Vivo.  As far as now, our friends the Portuguese are willing to sell it to us, so we decided a year ago that what we had to do is improve the operation which is the best thing for them and for us and for the whole operation is that what we are doing &#x2013; we are concentrating on that. And anticipating that we buy Vivo at the right price.  That's the situation and the other question will be the answer of Matthew.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="a">

          <p>Okay, thanks, C&#xE9;sar.  Luigi, as far our 3G build is concerned, what we've always said is that we'll build our networks to customer demand and not just for the sake of technology and we've certainly kept Ofcom up to speed with our build profile over the last few years.  And as far as the target of June '08, I can tell you I'm 100% confident that we'll hit that because we have actually, it's only 100 sites, they're already in the land bank, so we'll very comfortably hit the June '08 target that Ofcom have set.</p>

          <p>Calling from Fidentiis in Madrid.  Question for Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a.  I've listened with interest to everything you've talked about, the transformation of the fixed line businesses in Latin America.  I realize that you don't give any guidance specifically on the fixed line businesses, but I was wondering if you could give us any, sort of, qualitative feel as to what you're expecting for 2008?  The only business which we've got formal guidance for is Chile, where you're looking for, the Chilean business is looking for a small fall in EBITDA in 2008.  Is that something we should be extrapolating through to the other businesses, or do you expect a better performance from the other businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, I could very badly hear what you were saying but I anticipate that the question was about the wireline business and then specifically Brazil and Chile and the transformation that is going around those two units.  Am I correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.  I mean, if you could give us some sort of feel for what you're expecting for 2008, even if it doesn't include absolute growth numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, as you know, we are not providing a specific guidance for the wireline business per se, but what we can tell you is that the situation of Telesp, which has been driving most of the impact of year 2007, we have been intensively working, during year 2007 to accelerate that transformation.  And by transformation we mean that we have been trying to build up a leaner company, 800 people left Telesp last year and as you know we have been provisioning for further efficiency this year.  On top of that, we have been upgrading, basically, most of our network in order to be able to deploy the fastest DSL speed of access.  At the same time, we have been able to complete the acquisition of the TVA, and NRGS assets, therefore we have now a triple play offer online both in terms of satellite and in terms of M&amp;GA and we have a commercial bundle with TVA for the cable product.</p>
          <p>On top of that we have been reaching an agreement to have the global content and, therefore, we now have a very competitive product on the market.  And that is starting to provide some result, specifically in the area where we are very aggressively competing with Net.  And finally I would say that the bundle, the duos and trios have been very successful.</p>
          <p>Also take into account that the bad debt impact that we have been I would say adjusting during year 2007 is not recurring.  And, therefore, we foresee, especially in Telesp, a more stable year 2008 because we think that the company is much better prepared for the intensive competitive landscape.  And, yes, you can take Chile as an example.  I mean, Chile has been advancing significantly in terms of the triple play and in terms of the quality of service we are providing to our clients.  We do think that we are on the right track with that wireline business and we will deploy exactly the strategy, both in Colombia where we are growing and in Argentina.  I would say that the main challenge is to have TV licenses or where we do not have that and that's the bica for regulatory for the year 2008.</p>
          <p>So we are very focused on the transformation of the wireline.  We are confident that we are going to be able to have success in our efforts and also remember that if you benchmark Telesp with other wireline operators in Brazil, Telesp is doing better so we are more confident than a year ago, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Would it be possible to get a comment on what's going on in Peru as well where it looked like you had quite a weak fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah on Peru we have a challenge that was there &#x2013; remember that Peru has still a very significant amount of public telephony revenues and, of course, that was going to be adjusted once the mobile penetration was accelerating and that's happening. But at the same time, we have also the opportunity of expanding the number of clients, the number of accesses that we have there, thanks to the agreement that we reached with the Peruvian government and thanks to this fixed wireless solution that we are deploying all around. So, yes, we are showing the impact on &#x2013; and also the effect of the long distance pre-selection change in the regulatory environment. So those are the impact that we are observing but at the same time we &#x2013; and also remember that we have a price cap of CPI minus 7% in Peru. If you take all these things into consideration, I think that Peru is behaving pretty well, and we are pretty confident that this deployment of fixed wireless solution will lead us to have more clients. And therefore we are also accelerating the transformation of Peru.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Simon Weeden from Goldman, in London. Just a quick question on your investment in Telecom Italia, be very interested to know how you feel that's going so far, and whether you have plans to take advantage of the relationship in terms of particularly exploiting synergy in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, it's, well we are very happy with the industrial alliance we have with Telecom Italia. When you look at Europe and you had the number of clients we have in Europe, which in the case of Telef&#xF3;nica is 88 and in the case of Telecom Italia, I think is 70 &#x2013; around 160 million clients which means that our industrial alliance in Europe represents 90% market share of the European market. And that means synergies and everything that can go for revenues and of course it's going to be very important. By the way, the working team between Telecom Italia and Telef&#xF3;nica, we're estimating that the synergy figures for us in between 2008 and 2010 is going to be around the figure of 1.3 billion, which is significant. And this is the stat. So that is the situation. And in the case of Germany, the joint operations are building inside Western Europe. We had a very important CapEx program in Germany, which is focused on organic growth. The whole company is focused on organic growth, as was within the October conference. Our main target for the next year is organic growth and we're going to pursue that. But in the case of Germany, we have good relations with our Italian partners, a better relation, where we will build it. Basically, our German operations, as Matthew was saying, are concentrating on delivery of organic growth in the coming years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's Guy Peddy from Blue Oak. Good afternoon everyone. Three very quick questions. Matthew, firstly there seems to be a lot of accelerating going on in O2 Germany, apart from actually service revenue growth trends, which continue to perform very weakly on the mobile side. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're doing to turn that around? Secondly, to DSL products within O2, you seem to be accelerating the customer growth, looking at your customer basis for January and February that you've detailed, is that a conscious strategy since the new year to push the broadband product? And then finally, to Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a, looking at the way Telesp is performing with its EBITDA declining and looking at the way Vivo is starting to pick up and Vivo's underlying operating performance is very good this quarter, isn't it in your interest to accelerate the integration of those two businesses sooner rather than later? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Guy, I'll pick up the first two questions.  Let me pick up DSL in the U.K. and Germany first.  We were very conscious in the U..K that we wanted to build a first class customer product and not rush to market and once we had a first class customer product then start to market it quite heavily.  The reality is we've got 100,000 customers in the U.K. in our DSL business frankly without marketing it at all.  We're going to go for pretty heavy marketing in Q2 because we believe we've got, and customers are telling us, a market beating DSL product.  And to give you just one stat that I think is fascinating, we're actually, each of our customers are achieving an average of over 9 megabits a second on our DSL network in the U.K.  The highest BT offer in the U.K., not achieved but offer, is only 8, so we're actually achieving higher speeds than they offer.  As far as mobile in Germany is concerned, clearly a very competitive market with a lot of price competition and a characteristic of the market in quarter four in Germany was a significant amount of our customers migrating effectively onto higher value tariffs, particularly our top-end post-pay customers.  As at the end of 2007, actually of all the customers that are going to migrate onto the higher value tariffs, already 75% have migrated, so we can clearly see our path to mobile growth during 2008 in Germany and total revenue growth as well in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your question about Telesp OIBDA margins, well let's first say that part of this evolution of margins is non-recurring.  Remember that in the last quarter of the year 2006 we have this extraordinary recovery of this tax in Brazil that is profit tax. And only I guess in that will give you a 5.5 percentage points of less drop, of a lesser drop in the margins.  And on top of that if you were to adjust by that figure to what we consider to be an ongoing figure, you will see that the margin of Telesp would only be falling by half a percentage point because of their significant cost effort that we have been carrying out during the year.  And that's why we were saying that we have been accelerating the transformation of Telesp.  So we don't know what year 2008 is going to bring to us but for the time being what we can tell you is that the full impact of the year 2007 is not fully predictable for the future.  And in terms of the new integration, as the Chairman has stated, it isn't going to depend on us.  It is something that depends on Portugal Telecom side and of course we will be closely monitoring that.</p>
