          <p>Good morning. This is the conference operator. Welcome and thank you for joining the Credit Suisse Group Third Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. As a reminder, all participants are in a listen-only mode and the conference is recorded. You'll have the opportunity to ask questions directly after the presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brady Dougan, Chief Executive Officer of Credit Suisse Group. Please go ahead, Mr. Dougan.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome, everybody. Good morning. Welcome to our third quarter results call. I'm joined by our CFO, David Mathers, who took over from Renato Fassbind on October 1st. And as usual, I'll make some brief introductory remarks. David will take you through the detail. We'll then obviously entertain your questions and then I'll sum up.</p>
          <p>With underlying net operating income of CHF1 billion and all divisions being profitable, I think we've delivered a good result in a challenging quarter characterized by low market volumes and subdued client activity.</p>
          <p>We continue to make disciplined investments in client-focused, capital-efficient, high return businesses. These are already producing strong net new assets, and we've also grown our market share.</p>
          <p>We had an encouraging performance in Private Banking, with additionally strong net new assets of 12.4 billion in Wealth Management. We saw inflows in all regions, and a particularly strong performance in Asia-Pacific with annualized growth of over 20%.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin at 118 basis points reflects the fact that revenues remain subdued. The industry is near a cyclical low in a current low interest rate environment which is compounded by reduced levels of client activity.</p>
          <p>However, the prospects for growth in Wealth Management remain very attractive. With our integrated model, we're poised to capitalize on improving markets thanks to our disciplined investment in our global platform, our advisory process and our people. And our Swiss Corporate &amp; Institutional business, which is an important provider of financing and services to the Swiss economy, had a good quarter with a strong pre-tax profit and a continued high pre-tax margin.</p>
          <p>In the Investment Bank, we're encouraged by our continued market share momentum. Fixed income in our underwriting and advisory businesses achieved a solid performance, reflecting our improving competitive position.</p>
          <p>In equities, the performance of our client-focused business was in line with industry volumes. Equities has also shown lower overall revenue volatility than the industry in the first nine months, which underscores our strong client position.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, we were pleased with the strategic progress, the solid result and strong net new asset inflows of 3.6 billion, and this is the fifth successive quarter in which we've seen positive inflows.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of a minority stake in York Capital is an important next step in the continuing implementation of a strategy focused on high margin, capital-efficient businesses able to leverage our global platform.</p>
          <p>Our results for the first nine months, with an underlying return on equity of 15% and net new assets of 55 billion, underscore that our business model is able to produce strong returns over the cycle.</p>
          <p>Should the current challenges persist, our capital-efficient strategy will enable us to manage them well. We anticipated much of the regulatory change, both in terms of capital requirements and the new cross-border regime; that means that we're well-placed to meet these new requirements and at the same time compete and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I'd now like hand over to David who's going to give you some more detail on the results and also talk about how we see our capital structure developing over the next few years. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brady, and good morning. I will start my presentation on slide five please with an overview of the third quarter financial highlights.</p>
          <p>On a headline basis we achieved revenues of CHF6.3 billion and net income of 600 million, equivalent to an after-tax return on equity of 7% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Total net new assets in the quarter were 14.6 billion, reflecting a continuing strong contribution from our Wealth Management business. And as per our normal practice, we include the underlying result. Overall net revenues on this basis were CHF6.9 billion; pre-tax income 1.4 billion; and on underlying tax rate of 28%, the net income result was 960 million.</p>
          <p>The underlying return on equities so far this quarter was 11%, and now stands at a cumulative 15% for the first nine months of the year. We include, as usual, a detailed reconciliation of the underlying results in the appendix of the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide six for an overview of our divisional results. In the Private Bank, we continue to demonstrate momentum in our industry-leading, multi-shore business model with strong net new asset inflows. These totaled CHF12.4 billion in Wealth Management, in line of our 6% target, and benefiting from a 20% growth rate in net new assets from Asia-Pacific.</p>
          <p>In the first nine months, net new asset inflows were CHF37.2 billion for Wealth Management and 45 billion for all of Private Banking. And that means that we've already exceeded the net asset inflows for the whole of 2009 when we recorded 35.3 billion and 41.6 billion respectively.</p>
          <p>Private Banking's underlying pre-tax income of CHF880 million was slightly ahead of the second quarter and the third quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Wealth Management's gross margin remained resilient compared to the first half of the year at a cyclically low 118 basis points, reflecting client cautiousness and low levels of activity.</p>
          <p>We continued to capitalize on our competitive position this quarter as we increased relationship managers by a net 60 and a total of 140 in the quarter, around 55% of which were Senior Relationship Managers.</p>
          <p>Let me continue now with Wealth Management on slide seven. Revenues were down 5% quarter-on-quarter, reflecting continued risk-averse client sentiment and the usual seasonal slowdown, which resulted in lower brokerage fees. However, the underlying pre-tax income for Wealth Management, excluding 44 million at litigation provision, stood at CHF656 million, and increased 4% over the second quarter with overall expenses declining 8% quarter-on-quarter. The underlying pre-tax income margin was 28%.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide eight. We had strong net new asset inflows of CHF12.4 billion in the quarter, equivalent to an annualized growth rate of 6.2%. We regard this as a significant outperformance in a challenging market. The balanced regional contribution that we show here demonstrates the strength of our platform and the trust that our clients have in Credit Suisse. Inflows have been particularly strong in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific so far this year.</p>
          <p>On the right-hand side of the slide, the quarterly gross margin comparisons for 2010 shows a stable picture in a period of subdued revenue levels.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide nine. We are regularly asked about the sustainability of the gross margin given the changing business environment, so we thought it would be useful to show analysis of our net new asset inflows and gross margin to help better explain the dynamics of the business.</p>
          <p>This slide shows a booking center analysis of our net new asset inflows and the related gross margins. And this is for our Swiss platform and for our international platform, excluding United States, which operates on a slightly business model to the rest of the Private Bank.</p>
          <p>From this top of the slide downwards, we've listed our major booking centers in descending order of breadth, depth, and maturity of product and service offering. From left to right we show the net new assets for fiscal year 2009 and for the first nine months of 2010. We then show the gross margin for the same periods.</p>
          <p>Of the CHF32 billion of asset inflows so far this year, the blue box shows the asset inflows into our Swiss booking center of 12 billion. This includes ultra high net worth, high net worth, affluent, and retail within Swiss onshore, as well as our mature markets and emerging markets offshore businesses.</p>
          <p>If we look at the sub-segments within our Swiss booking center, you can see we have good contributions from Swiss onshore clients and emerging market based offshore clients. We've seen outflows from mature market-based offshore clients, predominantly in Western Europe, but at a significantly lower absolute level than we experienced in 2009 when we had the Scudo amnesty in Italy.</p>
          <p>Moving down, the orange block shows 20 billion of net new asset inflows to our non-U.S. international booking centers. We think these strong inflows are testament to the sustained investment that we've made here over a number of years.</p>
          <p>Let's look now at the individual gross margins on a booking center analysis. I think the first point to make here is there is a broad correlation between the relative margin and the depth and maturity of the products and service offering. It's not surprising therefore that our Swiss platform had a gross margin of 135 basis points so far this year, higher than the overall business at 120. This booking center is easily the most developed in terms of product and service.</p>
          <p>If we look at the sub-segment breakdown in Switzerland, you can see that the gross margin for the mature market is lower than the average Switzerland and below that of high net worth.</p>
          <p>If we then look further down the page, you can see that the gross margin from our emerging market and international booking centers are slightly lower than the average at 103 and 96 basis points respectively. And the current build-out phase of the product and solution capability of these platforms means that the margin in these areas is generally more dependent on transactional revenues, which have been subdued recently. And the high net new asset growth rates achieved in recent years in those platforms also has an initial dampening effect on the gross margin.</p>
          <p>We do see upside in the gross margins as and when markets improve, but, furthermore, as these international platforms mature to the broadening of the client product and service offering, it should also provide further upside potential for the gross margin.</p>
          <p>Let me continue now with Corporate &amp; Institutional Clients on slide 10. Pre-tax income was CHF224 million with a strong pre-tax margin of 51% for the quarter. Net credit risk provision releases of 16 million was supported by the continued recovery of the Swiss economy and reflects the high quality loan book. Revenues remain stable, with a higher contribution from fees and commissions.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to Investment Banking on slide 11. Investment Banking's results reflected a particularly weak July. Although August was clearly affected by the normal summer slowdown, we did then see some improvement in activity in September.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these difficult market conditions, our fixed income sales and trading results were solid. We achieved strong performances in RMBS, equity trading, and credit, both leveraged finance and investment grade, and there were also solid contributions from global rates and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our equity sales and trading results predominantly reflected the substantial industry-wide decline that we've seen in the exchange and in client volumes through the summer as well as seasonality in our prime service business and weaker client flows in derivatives compared to a particularly strong second quarter.</p>
          <p>Underwriting and advisory were solid despite muted activity levels in a number of products, and we continue to have a strong pipeline heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, this shows you a more detailed analysis of the quarterly results. Net revenues, excluding the fair value of own debt moves allocated to the Investment Bank, were CHF3.5 billion, down 9% from the second quarter in U.S. dollar terms and down 16% in Swiss franc terms.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax income on these revenues was CHF0.5 billion, and so far this year, the pre-tax margin in our Investment Bank stands at 24% and the pre-tax return on economic capital 22%.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to fixed income on slide 13. Fixed income revenues increased 3% quarter-on-quarter with many of our businesses performing well. This increase was an equivalent to a rise of 12% in dollar terms.</p>
          <p>In particular, as I mentioned before, we had good results in our non-agency RMBS trading business and in our credit businesses, driven by increased client flows and strong high-yield new issuance activity. We also had solid revenues from rates and emerging markets, with the latter particularly benefiting from increased client flows.</p>
          <p>Finally, our planned sales force expansion in targeted areas of flow fixed income is now largely complete. The impact of our investments here is starting to materialize as we see better penetration with key clients and as we improve the breadth and the intensity of our coverage.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to the equities business on slide 14. Our combined equity revenues fell 35% compared to the second quarter in Swiss franc terms, 30% in U.S. dollar terms. And in cash equities, our business was adversely affected by the decline in market volumes. For example, NASDAQ volumes were down 26% in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and Euronext down by 21%. And these falls were particularly acute in electronic trading, where we are a market leader.</p>
          <p>In equity derivatives, where our business is predominantly flow based, revenues were also affected by lower client business flows in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I would note that the equity revenue performance does include a debit valuation adjustment, or DVA, in our structured note liabilities as a result of the tightening in spreads on our own debt. And this resulted in a CHF118 million loss this quarter, compared to a gain of 64 in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 15. Turning to advisory and underwriting, revenue from these businesses was resilient, although the benefit from stronger debt issuance was more than offset by weaker equity issuance and lower levels of M&amp;A completions in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Going into the fourth quarter, our pipeline is stronger than a year ago, particularly in ECM and leveraged finance, but broadly in line with the levels that we reported at the end of the second quarter. Clearly, the execution of this pipeline does remain very much dependant on market conditions.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide 16 which shows two charts that we presented at a recent industry conference. The top chart provides an analysis of our Investment Banking revenues. And the key point here is that 98% of our revenues come directly or indirectly from our clients. And client revenues we show here consists of fees; commissions; the gains and losses from matching of client trades; and revenues from client financing activities, such as in prime services, for example.</p>
          <p>The lower chart shows our standard histogram of daily revenues, and it's clear that this much more client-focused business model does deliver more consistent daily revenue contributions. We were very low level of trading loss days.</p>
          <p>Revenue distributions so far this year have been tightly concentrated with few outside gains or losses. In fact, we have seen only three loss-making days in the year so far and only one loss making day in the third quarter, which we do believe to be significantly better than industry levels.</p>
          <p>Slide 17. The chart at the top of slide shows the risk-weighted assets levels in the Investment Bank. RWAs increased by 9 billion, but have reduced by 1 billion in the exit businesses this quarter. This increase resulted from higher lending commitments in our leveraged finance and corporate banking as well as increases in respect to the expansion of our flow business.</p>
          <p>Slide 18. Total compensation expenses in the Investment Bank of 1.9 billion were down 7% from the second quarter, reflecting a consistent approach to compensation accrual based on performance and on the external market environment. Year-to-date, compensation in the Investment Bank is down 20% on the same nine months of last year. With this accrual, the Investment Banking comp to revenue ratio stood at 54% in the third quarter, 48% year-to-date. And across the group, the equivalent ratios on the same basis was 50% for the quarter and 47% so far this year.</p>
          <p>Non-compensation expenses decreased compared to the last quarter. This was driven by decreases across most expense categories as well as the favorable impact of a stronger Swiss franc.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to Asset Management on slide 19. In light of the recent agreement to acquire York Capital &#x2013; or acquire a minority stake in York Capital, I wanted to spend a few minutes reiterating our strategy in Asset Management.</p>
          <p>We're focusing this business on our core competencies that capitalize on the strength of the Credit Suisse brand and on our global footprint. These core capabilities are in asset allocation, in alternative investments in our Swiss platform, and a product suite is aligned to synergies that exist through a collaboration of both the Private Bank and the Investment Bank. For example, asset allocation is a key requirement for our private banking clients and is delivered by our discretionary mandate capability. Ultra high net worth and high net worth individuals require access to private equity and hedge fund products, and our ETF and index strategy products utilize the technology and financing capability of Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>And in leveraging the integrated bank, our objective is to build a high margin, capital-efficient business focused on raising third-party capital by creating best-in-class investment capabilities with superior performance either by in-house funds or joint ventures and partnerships with world-class managers.</p>
          <p>So if we turn to slide 20. Our recently announced agreement to acquire a significant non-controlling stake in York Capital is a very good example of the execution of this strategy. York's key products include event-driven credit and risk arbitrage. It's one of the best performing hedge funds in the world, with a broad-based product platform that complements our existing capabilities. Our decision to purchase a significant non-controlling equity stake aligns our interests and retains the best talents at York.</p>
          <p>We think the leading players in the hedge fund industry need to be at scale in the next few years, and in return for access to one of the best distribution platforms in the world at Credit Suisse, we want to ensure that Credit Suisse also benefits in the upside that we think will result from this collaboration.</p>
          <p>And I'd point out that investment in the management company is wholly consistent with the new U.S. financial reforms and consistent with a capital-light approach of focusing on recurring fee income and avoiding large capital commitments or potential conflicts of interests with our clients.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to slide 21 and look at the results of the Asset Management division this quarter. Asset Management's pre-tax income was strong at CHF135 million. Total revenues were up 16% compared to the second quarter, and expenses down 7%, demonstrating the continued momentum in the implementation of our strategy. There was also an encouraging progression in our fee-based revenues, up 4% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to slide 22. I think as important as the quarterly financial result, is the continued strong net asset inflows in this business for the fifth consecutive quarter. We continue to achieve stronger asset inflows, 5.2 billion alternatives, particularly in real estate, commodity, and ETFs, continued inflows from emerging market products, and private equity funds-of-funds. And there were also inflows in multi asset class solutions. The only outflows we suffered were in more lower margin products within the Swiss platform.</p>
          <p>We are encouraged by this performance compared to quarterly industry trends, and we're continuing to build upon the positive trends we've seen in this business over the last few quarters.</p>
          <p>So, turning to slide 23, this concludes the divisional results review, and on slide 24 I'm going to continue with a discussion of the group's capital position and the recently announced regulatory changes.</p>
          <p>So if we look at slide 24, you can see that we continue to maintain our strong position as one of the best capitalized banks globally with a Basel II Tier 1 ratio of 16.7%. Our core Tier 1 ratio, excluding hybrid capital, improves 12.1%, whilst the Swiss regulatory leverage ratio was higher at 4.3% in the third quarter. And I would note that the Tier 1 ratio includes a dividend accrual in line with our historic payout ratio.</p>
          <p>So, in the next few slides we wanted to spend some time drilling into the implications for our regulatory capital progression in light of the Swiss Expert Commission's recommendations published earlier this month.</p>
          <p>So let's look at slide 25. This shows the progression in risk weighted assets under the proposed Basel rule changes. And please note that these assumptions are based on our current mix of positions on the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So if we step back and look at this slide, it shows that B2.5 increase of 45 billion and the B3 increase of 130 billion, and this is before mitigation efforts.</p>
          <p>Starting at the left-hand side of the slide with 228 billion of RWAs under the current B2 regime at the end of the third quarter. We then look at the first phase of changes under B2.5 which will be implemented under the BS rules at the end of 2011 at the latest.</p>
          <p>If we move from left to right across the chart, the first adjustment column is stressed VaR. This is the RWA equivalent of VaR calculated on the most severe data set experienced in the last three years and results in an estimated increase in RWA of CHF15 billion.</p>
          <p>The second column represents the incremental default risk adjustment, and this is in respect to credit risk held within our trading book. The B2.5 recalibration increases the capital charge closer to what these would have been under a banking book treatment, and we estimate an impact of around CHF20 billion from this change.</p>
          <p>The third column shows the B2.5 securitization changes, and this reflects an increased charge on certain higher quality securitization charges, 50% of which are written off directly to equity under B2.5. And on our current positions, we estimate a total impact of around CHF10 billion from this change.</p>
          <p>So looking across the B2.5 changes, the total impact's at around CHF45 billion and would increase risk-weighted assets to approximately 270 billion prior to the mitigation measures that we'll come to in a moment.</p>
          <p>So let's now move to the B3 changes that are planned to be implemented from the beginning of 2013. So, the first 65 billion represent the gross-up of the capital deductions relating to different securitization tranches. The next column shows the recalibration of the credit valuation adjustment, or CVA, under the B3 rules. We estimate on our current positions this could add around CHF65 billion of RWA, primarily in respect of the counterparty risk from un-collateralized OTC derivative contracts.</p>
          <p>So, in total across the slide, we think that RWAs in our current position mix, post B2.5 and B3 implementation, could rise to about CHF400 billion. But we expect to reduce this amount by between 50 to 70 billion through a number of measures, resulting in net post 3 BWA of between 330 and 350 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let me discuss these mitigation assumptions, which we do regard as conservative, on slide 26. If we start from the top of the slide, the first box represents our exit businesses. You may recall these are businesses that, as we announced back in 2008, are no longer consistent with our client-focused, capital-efficient strategy.</p>
          <p>If we were still to have these positions when B3 is implemented in 2013, there would be a significant increase in RWA from the 14 billion of current RWA that we showed on an earlier slide in the Investment Banking section. So as we continue to run these positions down and achieve the bulk of the disposal of these by 2013, this will contribute 20 to CHF25 billion out of the mitigation total. We don't generate revenues from these businesses and, therefore, we don't expect there to be any revenue impact from this mitigation.</p>
          <p>So let's move to the second box, which is our structured products exposure. We anticipate reducing the size of our trading book that supports our client business in these products by perhaps 3 billion by 2013, which would reduce the B3 RWA-equivalent positions by 15 to CHF20 billion.</p>
          <p>I think this could potentially have some impact on the revenues from this business if we implemented it today. But given how we expect client trading demand in these assets to change by 2013, we would have expected these books to have been smaller by then in any event. So we think the marginal impact of these mitigation changes shouldn't be too significant.</p>
          <p>Let's turn to the third box. In emerging markets, as you know, we're in the process of refocusing this business towards a more flow-based model. We think this will mitigate some of the impact from the incremental default risk charges relating to the credit inventories. What's more, a more flow-based emerging market operation should generate higher revenues and more than offset any adverse impact from this mitigation.</p>
          <p>Finally, if you look at the CVA in our derivatives business, we expect there to be approximately 5 to 10 billion of RWA reduction resulting from un-collateralized exposures that will either mature, be hedged or can be collateralized over the next few years. Furthermore, we think there should be a further 5 to 10 billion of RWA mitigation that's the result from a shift of some of our OTC derivative business to central counterparty clearing.</p>
          <p>So let's turn now to slide 27. We thought it might be useful to provide you with an illustrative simulation or model of how our capital ratios could develop under the new rules as laid out by the Basel Committee and by the Swiss Expert Commission. It is worth noting that this model is based on current market consensus estimates and as such are not forward-looking statements made by Credit Suisse management.</p>
          <p>So let's look at the top of this graph and move downwards. We start with our Tier 1 equity ratio under B2 of 12% at the end of September 2010. This is a conservative starting point that excludes our existing hybrid issuance. But I would note that under B3 the hybrids are still fully capital-effective in 2013 and for some period there afterwards.</p>
          <p>The first bar down shows the positive impact of this ratio from retained earnings until the end of 2013. As we said before, this is based on current market expectations and assumes a dividend payout ratio of 30%.</p>
          <p>The next bar shows the impact on the ratio of the recalibrations under B2.5 and B3 we just discussed, which would lift our post-mitigation RWA to around 340 billion.</p>
          <p>To be conservative here, we've also allowed for some business growth in the next bar. We have assumed organic RWA growth of, say, 5% per annum until 2012, resulting in a 1% reduction in the ratio. So on this basis, by 2013 the B3 ratio will be 12% and, thus, already in excess of a 2019 minimum.</p>
          <p>We then extended the model to give a 2019 common equity ratio. Assuming net income is constant each year at the 2013 level with a 30% dividend ratio, on this basis retained earnings would generate a further 9% increase in the common equity ratio. This would be offset by a 2% reduction in the ratio from a phasing in of the some of the new Basel III equity deductions. So by 2019, on this simulation, these assumptions would achieve a hypothetical common equity capital ratio of 18%.</p>
          <p>We've also modeled the stress scenario with earnings set at 50% of current market consensus expectations for the entire period but maintaining a 30% dividend payout ratio. But even in this scenario, the common equity ratio would still be comfortably in excess of 10% at the end of 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So this gives some idea of how our capital position could evolve under B3. Although clearly this shows the strength of our existing and future common equity position, we also expect CoCos to play a significant part in a B3 capital structure.</p>
          <p>So let me now turn to the next slide which lays out some views on the viability of a contingent convertible market. So looking at slide 28. I think although the market for contingent convertibles is still immature, we are confident that the extended time horizon for the implementation of the recommendations will enable these instruments to develop over time, and that moreover, Credit Suisse will be an attractive issuer of these securities.</p>
          <p>So why would investors buy CoCos? First, we believe there is significant institutional and retail appetite for high yielding assets in a continued low interest rate environment. Second, there is a substantial current inventory of bank capital instruments that will either mature or be called and will need replacement. Just to be specific on this point, there are currently &#x20AC;450 billion of Tier 1 and Tier 2 bank instruments in issuance globally. Thirdly, CoCo structures arguably have a superior value to investors in a liquidation scenario. Bondholders should achieve a high conversion rate on their debt, and the financial institution would continue to trade as a going concern. By comparison, in a liquidation scenario where no CoCo structure exists, bondholders tend to receive a low payout as a percentage of the face value of the bond. Finally, the significant out-of-the-money trigger levels should ensure that conversions are remote enough to enable fixed income investors to own CoCos.</p>
          <p>So who should be interested in acquiring CoCos? Well, as I mentioned before, there are currently &#x20AC;450 billion of hybrid Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments in issuance globally. As these assets roll off, from a fixed income investor's perspective, there will be a need to replace the existing regulatory capital instruments as they phase out gradually from qualifying under B3 and are either called or mature.</p>
          <p>But thinking more broadly, we do think these instruments represent an attractive proposition. If they do indeed convert, investors receive equity at depressed levels, and if they don't &#x2013; which is rather more likely, investors receive a high coupon as compensation for assuming that obligation. And we think this fits well with the investment strategy of many sovereign wealth funds as well as that of a number of hedge funds, and it's wholly possible that the superior economic value will also extend interest to other investor groups.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to slide 29. We've attempted here to model the financing impact of the new capital structure. The left-hand column lays out our current funding structure. And we've split this funding into three main categories: shareholders' equity, regulatory debt capital and senior debt. We've also split out regulatory debt capital between lower and upper Tier 2, hybrids and the Claudius notes.</p>
          <p>Then on the right-hand side we've included an illustrative future funding structure based on the recommendations of the Swiss Expert Commission. And this simply assumes converting our current regulatory debt structure to CoCos. I'm sure we've put different assumptions in than you can.</p>
          <p>But the key point from the left-hand column is that the existing regulatory debt structure already costs around CHF1.2 billion more in debt spreads above that of our existing senior debt costs. So if we look at the right-hand side, the 340 billion of RWA, new rules would imply a requirement for around 30 billion of CoCos, split 10 billion into high strike and 20 billion into low strike.</p>
          <p>So if we do a simple comparison of our 1.2 billion existing financing costs above senior against these CoCo issuance of 30 billion, this would equate to an average spread against senior of around 400 basis points. But furthermore, if you assume that low strike CoCo prices in line with Tier 2 and high strike prices in line with hybrid debt, you can see that the overall cost isn't that different to the cost that we already pay for our current structure.</p>
          <p>So just in summary. First, we know that the CoCo market is nascent for the time being and it will need time to develop. But we do have this time. Second, we think there are clearly identifiable economic reasons to give us confidence that the CoCo market will develop, and we have seen a high number of reverse inquiries at all levels into our DCM and ECM desks, which I think verifies a positive start from these instruments. And finally, we think our business model allows us to accommodate these changes. Institutions like Credit Suisse that already have an existing high capital level would be at an advantage as the CoCo market develops.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you actually for what I thought was an extremely useful presentation on the new capital rules. Just a quick question on the dividend. How open is the board to consider a scrip dividend to accelerate hitting the new Swiss standards?</p>
          <p>And I guess number two, you're obviously pointing towards a 30% dividend payout. Clearly, a CHF0.02 dividend from last year based on the current net earnings just grossed up for the full year would imply nearer 40%, and, again, would that be a subtle hint to us that a scrip dividend is certainly something which is on the table for consideration? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Huw. It's Brady. Yeah, I mean, I think in general, as we've said, we remain committed and think we have a business model that can provide cash, dividend returns to shareholders over time. We have continued to explain that we are broadly consistent with what we've done over the years in terms of dividend accrual. I think that obviously in terms of this year's dividend, we obviously still have a quarter to go in the year, there's still obviously questions around exactly how the business will finish up et cetera. Although I think, in principle, we continue to be committed, as we said, and consistent in the way that we've looked at it.</p>
          <p>Well, obviously, I guess we could think about different alternatives on the dividend, but, in general, I think we're more focused just on cash dividend payments as opposed to scrip. So I would be &#x2013; I doubt that that would change.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I had a couple. Just coming back to the dividend and the payout ratio, I thought historically it was more like 35, so I wondered if you could discuss why you chose 30?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the costs in Wealth Management, obviously those have gone down considerably on the quarter, down 8%, yet you've had less cost flex in the Investment Bank. I mean, are there different compensation accrual programs in the two?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, I don't know if you could talk a bit more about the net impact of the dollar, because obviously it's affecting lots of the different lines. I mean, have you got a number for what you think currencies did to the Q3 P&amp;L of the pre-tax or post-tax level? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Fiona, appreciate it. On your first question, I guess just to make clear, because I guess at the 30% you were referring to the simulation that we put in there, just to be very clear, and I think David said, but we'll say it again, that's really just a model. It's just a simulation; we're not suggesting that any of the numbers in there, whether they be earnings numbers or dividends numbers et cetera, are projections or guidelines as to what we would &#x2013; what we'll actually do. It's really just meant to be illustrative. So to be clear, so if that's what you're keying on is that 30%, that's just very much &#x2013; it's just a model and it's a number that we put in.</p>
          <p>I think if you look historically, actually the numbers have been higher than that, lower than that, so, but we've tried to give you a reasonable idea of the direction that we're going in without kind of pinning that number down exactly, as you know. So I think, again, just to warn &#x2013; just to again to say that is not &#x2013; that 30% is just a model input. So, again though, as we've said, we believe that we're approaching the dividend in a consistent way to what we have done in recent years. So, again, I know that's probably not as precise as many would like to hear, but that's our general direction.</p>
          <p>David, do you want to take the cost question or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the expense issue then, so if we turn to the PB numbers, all of our Wealth Management numbers, we did see declines across most of the expense categories, admittedly helped by the fact that sales and marketing costs were at a seasonal low, but IT costs have also been a lower level than in the first quarter. So I think we have been disciplined about this, and I think you're seeing the benefit from that.</p>
          <p>I think within the Investment Bank, I would point out that the nine-months-on-nine-month compensation accrual is down 20% in Swiss francs, obviously slightly less in U.S. dollar terms. So I think you are seeing that fall there. In non-compensation expenses, admittedly helped by the Swiss franc moves, we also saw like-for-like declines in a non-compensation spend, and the rise earlier in the year I think reflects the IT investment.</p>
          <p>So I think we are taking a very disciplined approach to that across both &#x2013; across all the businesses, because I think you saw the progress in Asset Management too. But I think in terms of the way the numbers came out, you saw the benefit more in Private Banking and Asset Management this quarter.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the dollar / Swiss franc impact, I think I'd hesitate to give you an exact number across the bank as a whole. I would point out though that we obviously have a very successful business in the Americas and in other dollar-denominated currencies. And therefore, even though that will obviously reduce costs because of the depreciation of dollar, it actually has a greater impact on the revenues. So there's no doubt that the weakness of the dollar is a net negative in our results this quarter for the bank. And quite clearly, I think, as you may have noticed, that also contributed to the book value per share in terms of the move downwards in the equity there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a few questions. I actually want to go back to the costs in the Investment Bank, and specifically the compensation costs. On slide 18 you make the good point that the compensation costs to revenue is 48% for the first nine months this year versus 47% last year, which I guess is reassuring except for the last year you had the big true-up in Q4 and that left your full-year run rate at about 42% I think. So I guess my question is &#x2013; there's a few; first of all, could we see another big true-up in Q4 of this year?</p>
          <p>And then more just generally, if you hadn't accrued any bonus for anyone this year, how much lower would your costs have been? I mean, do you have sort of 15% flexibility between paying the bonuses you've accrued and not paying anything, or is it 20 or 25 or &#x2013; I guess given the changes in compensation structure, higher salaries, more deferred, I just curious how much leeway there is there on the cost in the investment banking?</p>
          <p>And I also wanted to ask about, there's been a lot of noise for U.S. banks about U.S. mortgages, and I guess for you guys the big issue is on your investment banking business where you do have the strong RMBS business, when you warehouse these mortgages, at any point do you provide the representations and warranties, or is that all done by whoever writes the U.S. mortgage? And then is there any issues around &#x2013; legal issues around the third-party arrangers and what they may have told you or not told you?</p>
          <p>And then I guess my last question &#x2013; I'll keep it three questions. My last question would relate to the CoCos, and perhaps I should know this, but have you given any guidance in terms of how your CoCos will be written, how they will actually convert into Equity? So will it be done at a fixed exchange rate or will it be done at a discount or done at the closing price the day before? How does it work when it actually if &#x2013; and we don't expect it would, but if it were to convert into equity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, Derek, thanks very much. Let me &#x2013; maybe let's try take them in reverse order I think. On the CoCos, really it's obviously still quite preliminary. I mean, we've got &#x2013; it was announced, I guess, about two weeks ago, and I think we've got nine years to raise it or something in terms of the transition period, so, obviously, this will develop over time. And I think right now it's still obviously formative. And I think it will be partly be shaped by some dialogue with the regulator and partly shaped by dialogue with the market and what really works in the market. And so, to be honest, I don't think we have &#x2013; we obviously have views and ideas about what direction that may take, but I think it's pretty preliminary to be talking about those kinds of terms. So I guess just stay tuned; I think over time it will develop.</p>
          <p>We do feel though, as you know, and we talked to the conference about just the &#x2013; we do believe that this will be a viable market, and I think the most compelling fact is, as David mentioned, there's 450 billion of hybrids out there that are going to get called out or matured over the next five, 10 years, and those investors will be looking to replace those. So our view is that it will be a viable market. But we'll see.</p>
          <p>On the U.S. mortgage issue, I guess I would say a few things. I mean, I think probably the most important summary comment is overall we don't think there is any material impact on our business from this. We were a very small player; particularly if you compare us to some of the other banks that were much more active in this group, we're a very small player actually in these markets over time. So that's the first overall comment.</p>
          <p>The second thing is this is not a new issue. I know the market has sort of seized on this, but there's obviously these issues have been out there for a period of time, there's been a lot of regulatory activity around this and a lot of dialogue. There also have been, as you know, there is some legal activity already around this. So in many respects this is not a brand new issue that's just popped up from nowhere, at least certainly from our point of view.</p>
          <p>I guess what people have focused on and what we focus on in terms of the real source of risk here is the actual origination of the product, as you know, the actual origination of the loans. And I can give you some specific numbers in terms of our activities there, which is, in the 2004 to 2008 period, which is, as you know, since '08, there really hasn't been any origination of private label mortgages. But over that period we originated 6.1 billion of whole loans; that constitutes a 0.14% -and let me make this very clear, that's one-tenth of one percent market share in that market was Credit Suisse's market share and origination of those loans. Of the 6.1 billion, 1.7 billion were sold as whole loans. The remaining 4.4 billion were put into securitizations. Of the 4.4 billion that we originated, 2 billion is currently still outstanding. So the others have matured. So we have a total of 2 billion of originated loans that are still out there as parts of securitizations. And so it's a very small exposure. And our view is that that is &#x2013; when you talk about these issues around foreclosure documentation et cetera, that's where the real issue will be. Although clearly, again, this is an area where there are clearly issues across the business. But that's where the issues are in terms of exposure.</p>
          <p>In terms of our current activity in that area though, we're really very much just involved in a secondary purchase and sale of securities. And so, frankly, I think that this, A), will not have much impact on that flow, nor are there sort of embedded risks to that. So our view is that, overall, we have a very small presence in this market and we don't think there will be any material impact.</p>
          <p>David, you want to take the costs...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the compensation point, I think as we've discussed before, we don't target to a specific comp to revenue ratio in any one quarter. What we do instead is we make an accrual based on our risk-adjusted profitability, our full-year expectations and our assessment of the external competitive market conditions, and try and actually accrue through that period.</p>
          <p>That said, I think, clearly, the regulatory changes in the market have resulted in a requirement for higher salaries and the distribution of that. So there's a degree of reduction of flexibility in our cost structures as a consequence of that, and you're probably seeing a component of that which we need to adjust for fully in our bonus calculations.</p>
          <p>I think just as a supplementary point, you may note there's actually a new table on page 102 in our financial release which does give a deferral disclosure, but for the bank overall, which may be helpful in the analysis.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from line of Kian Abouhossein of JPMorgan. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, Brady. A few quick questions. First of all, actually coming to the Merrill Lynch presentation, slide 19, where you had this useful slide of your highest and fixed income, up about 30%, and you want to be top five in all regions. Looking at the results, it looks like the gap is actually widening against your competitors rather than closing. So I'm trying to understand how I should think about the revenue P&amp;L movements in terms of higher where you are and in terms of movement in terms of revenue closure over the next, let's say, two years. And at the same time, is that the reason why we see a comp ratio which is out of line with your peers? So, really it is a P&amp;L movement, that's kind of what I'm trying to understand.</p>
          <p>Secondly, if you could maybe give some indication of mortgage putback reserves on your balance sheet. I'm not interested in foreclosures, but mortgage putback reserves.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, if you could just briefly talk about trends, in particular in equities, within your flow businesses? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me, Kian, let me just &#x2013; thanks for the questions. Let me take the middle question first, just on the mortgage issue. We don't have any material putback reserves, because we don't believe we have any material exposure there. So we don't have any &#x2013; no material reserves.</p>
          <p>I would say on the first question in terms of the fixed income business, I guess maybe I can just give you some general comments and then David can give you a little bit more specific. But, I mean, again, as you know, our focus is really on the client flow aspects of that business, and we do feel like we've &#x2013; we actually, if you look at the third quarter performance, I think it was actually quite good in terms of trend quarter-to-quarter et cetera. And I think that is representative of some of the progress that we've made, but also representative of the strategy that we have out there. But, again, we continue to try to distinguish between these issues around businesses that have very asset-heavy, risk-heavy approaches versus a more capital-efficient approach that's more client focused. And so I think what you're going to see is continued progress in the business and continued growth in the business, but also, importantly for us, high returns, because that's really what we're looking to do, is drive the returns off that capital. But, David, you want to..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly, I mean, I think a few data points &#x2013; fixed income revenues were up 12% in U.S. dollar terms quarter-on-quarter, which I think is supportive of this. We've added 118 sales people across our fixed income businesses in flow rates, credit, foreign exchange. And I think we are definitely seeing benefits from that in terms of improved penetration of our key clients, although, quite clearly, just given the normal timing of recruitment, those benefits are only beginning to sort of flow now and we wouldn't really expect to see the full credit from that into 2011.</p>
          <p>And then you had a final questions, equities I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up on that, I mean, if you want to be top five, I would think that we're talking more like 15 billion, 14 billion of revenues, which is more like doubling of what you're making in fixed income. But is this kind of what we're talking about, and are you geared up in terms of people to that kind of revenue level, or should we expect ongoing investments in fixed income to come still?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think I could comment on that exact number. But I think the point we'd make is we're actually talking about top five in client flows. I would guess that that kind of revenue level would imply a quite different approach to risk than we would consider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're very pleased with the progress we've made in our sales effort in the key areas. Clearly, I think &#x2013; I mentioned during the course of the presentation that a core part of our strategy is to re-orientate the emerging market business towards more onshore flow-based business. I would expect that probably will require some recruitment over the coming years as we actually build that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think your last question, Kian, was on the trends on the equity business, I guess. And I think our view is &#x2013; obviously, I think for the whole industry you can see the volumes yourself. Obviously for the whole industry equities has just been a more muted, I think, activity in this business for the whole year really. We continue to think we have one of the best equity businesses around with a top cash presence, a top prime brokerage / prime services business, and so we think we're in good shape to benefit when the volumes in the market comes back.</p>
          <p>I think clearly <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; I mean, we're two weeks into the fourth quarter, so I think, as we said, our best guidance is just that so far October looks a lot like September and obviously we'll see how the quarter progresses. But we do think longer term, you know, in the more medium term, whether it's into &#x2013; whether it's fourth quarter or into next year et cetera, I mean, we believe actually that these markets will become more active, and that's certainly going to benefit us because of our strength in that area. So hopefully we'll see that happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good morning. Had a couple of questions to start off with on the Private Banking side. What are your views on the kind of upcoming German-Swiss tax treaty? How do they factor into your thoughts on the, I think, 25 to 35 billion of AuM at risk?</p>
          <p>And related to that, just looking at slide nine, clearly the pressure versus 2009 on the margin has been greater from the international booking centers. I suspect part of this is coming from the One Bank revenues drawing off to some extent. So just wondering if that is the case, and what kind of pipeline you see for One Bank revenues going forward?</p>
          <p>And the final question is on the Investment Bank. Would I expect to see any change in terms of the economic capital calculations backing the Investment Bank and from moving to Basel III, and will that result ultimately in a change in pricing in front of clients actually from needing more regulatory capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much for those questions. I guess on the first question with regard to the potential, as you say, the sort of rumors or reports around discussions between Switzerland and Germany on a tax treaty. I think our view is, as you know, we have been for many years building our business in a way that makes it &#x2013; prepares it well for these changes should they come. We've built strong onshore operations around the world and certainly in Europe and we have made sure that our cross-border business was completely compliant, and so we really obviously have not had a business that's been focused on tax type issues. We've basically built what we think is a fully compliant business. And so from our point of view, actually we welcome getting some of these issues resolved and being able to move on. I think, as you say, we have highlighted overall just an estimate that there might be 25 to 35 billion of AuM at risk throughout Europe, so that's the whole &#x2013; that's across all of the markets in Europe, not just Germany. And so I think that clearly the German number would be significantly smaller than that.</p>
          <p>And again, at the end of the day, our belief is actually that we think that once some of these issues get clarified, I think actually our business will actually have a lot of upside to it from that point. So once we do get some certainty around it, that will be helpful. And we continue to have a very strong brand and a very strong presence, and as we said, even with the issues that have been going on in Germany, we've actually had inflows in our onshore business in Germany this year, so &#x2013; net inflows. So we actually feel like we'll be well positioned for whatever changes come through. And there will be certainly an initial adjustment period, but we think in the longer run this is something that's good for the Swiss financial center and good for us.</p>
          <p>Your comments on this slide nine and the revenues, particularly on the international side, I think as you said &#x2013; I mean, I think one of the things that we do see is that obviously the more mature markets, there's more content in terms of managed revenues as opposed to just transactional, there's obviously a broader array of products that we can offer. And so, not only do we see higher margins in the more developed markets, but we also see probably a little more resilience in terms of those gross margins over time.</p>
          <p>I do think your comment on the single global currency or the One Bank approach in those markets is a good observation. I think it's correct. Clearly, in the emerging markets particularly, those are business models where there is a lot of integrated bank approach, and it's something that's been very powerful for us and therefore is something that has had an impact. And clearly, as we see &#x2013; if we see &#x2013; and as we see some of these levels of activity in the markets picking up, as we've seen, for instance, in Asia-Pacific with an increased ECM calendar et cetera, that should have a positive impact on some of the One Bank revenues and the overall margins in the business.</p>
          <p>I guess on...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Final question was on the economic capital or ERC calculation. I mean, we don't really anticipate any significant changes to that as a consequence of the Basel rule changes; it's an entirely separate process. We do continue to revise that for estimates. So there's always a number of small changes, but we wouldn't expect a radical change in this as a consequence of Basel 2.5, or Basel III for matter.</p>
          <p>I think your comment on pricing levels as a consequence of the capital changes, I think is apposite. It's very difficult to comment on as &#x2013; the clearly (1:04:44:) that the pricing impact would be more coming from, I guess, the industry-wide recalibration of RWA and what that means the necessarily around economic capital. And I think, to be honest with you, one would expect something as a consequence of that, but it's very difficult to estimate how much.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jernej Omahen from Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Good morning. It's Jernej here from Goldman's. I have a question on the page of 29 of your slide pack, and I believe it's 54 of your financial statement. Can I just confirm something with you? It seems that the volume of Claudius issuance is up from 1.8 to 3.4 billion during the quarter. And if I'm not mistaken, this counts towards your core Tier 1 capital. So is it fair to say that the entire core Tier 1 capital generation during this quarter is due to the increased issuance of these Claudius notes? And then second question on this topic, can you explain to us why the other hybrids are what we think is correctly excluded from core Tier 1, but Claudius counts towards your core Tier 1 calculation?</p>
          <p>Then just two questions, very short. On the issue of contingent capital, contingent convertibles, how are you thinking about timing of issuance? If I understood you correctly, the suggestion was that the interest is reasonably high and you think that the appetite for this instrument is going to pick up or it will be there in a sense. I was just wondering whether you're thinking of waiting or whether you're thinking of testing the market reasonably early.</p>
          <p>And the final question is a very, very simple question. The tangible book value per share, which whether we like it or not seems to be a base of any investment bank valuation, has not increased for Credit Suisse over the course of the past five quarters, even if we adjust for the dividend payment during this period. This quarter I guess it's down because of the FX impact. I was just wondering, is Credit Suisse thinking that maybe tangible book value per share or book value per share should become a key performance indicator for you at some point, and were you thinking of trying to hedge some of your more obvious exposures, I guess currency would be one of them? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Those are good questions. Let me maybe start with the CoCo timing of issuance, and I'll let David address the other issues. I think it's, as you say, obviously it's a very formative market right now, and so it's extremely early days, and so from that point of view, obviously it is early days. On the other hand, we do think that there would be a lot of appetite, but there are also probably some issues that need to be clarified, looked at. There is &#x2013; so I think in general, we're still sort of weighing that out. I think we'll see how things proceed. And I think we would like to be opportunistic to the extent that we could, but clearly, we need to make sure that we've got all the issues ironed out. But I do think it would be good actually probably to move sooner than later because I think it would help reassure the market that this is something that will develop.</p>
          <p>And our belief is there is &#x2013; I think as David said, we've actually had a fair amount of reverse enquiry and interest in it. So our belief is that it will be actually a market that can establish and go forward. But we'll have to see. I mean, truth is I don't think we really know how exactly what our approach will be to it. So, but those are some of the considerations that we have in thinking about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the technical questions, I think if you refer to page 54 on the financial release, you can see two numbers there which I probably would pull out. Firstly, is the foreign exchange impact to Tier 1, which was minus 2.2 billion? And then secondly, the other, which was plus 1.176 billion. So the Claudius issuance which we did in July is basically contribution to that 1.176 billion, and that's kind of offsetting the foreign exchange impact.</p>
          <p>So the real issue in the quarter really was the foreign exchange move on our capital base. So your question then essentially is what does that mean, I guess, for our foreign exchange strategy. Our foreign exchange strategy for our equity is being based around hedging to a neutral Tier 1 ratio hitherto essentially. So clearly, whilst that has obviously shielded the Tier 1 ratio from being from volatility as a consequence of the FX move, you see the move essentially at that point in terms of the retained capital.</p>
          <p>I mean, I think that's something that we obviously look at constantly. It is part of our planning, and I think it's fair to say that we do look at the book value issue, and in terms of the volatility, the FX is resulting on that, and that's probably something that we need to consider further. But I don't think at the moment we plan any changes. At the moment, essentially what we do is we do hedge to our constant Tier 1 ratio, which means we have a certain amount of our equity etched in U.S. dollars, and therefore affected by the depreciation of the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>In terms of the treatment of Claudius, Claudius is treated by the regulators currently somewhat differently from hybrid, which is why it's treated as part of core equity. I think if you look at the capital projections or capital simulation we included in the slide deck, you will see this 2% of deductions between 2013-2019, that includes the phase-out of Claudius as part of that basically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Actually just a couple of clarifications really on previous questions, if I could. Firstly, on the investment banking activity, you obviously highlighted the acceleration into September and October, but I just wondered if you could give us a feel of how much of an acceleration had been. I think you're sort of implying that we're still running below what you might consider a normalized run rate, but are we back to sort of Q2 levels of activity, or maybe a bit better or a bit worse?</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the hybrids. I take your point about wanting to be opportunistic in CoCo issuance, but could you give us an idea of the maturity or the core profile of your current hybrids? Does that force when you might have to first tap the market? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in terms of IB activity, I think, as we said &#x2013; I mean, and July was probably abnormally weak. August was seasonally weak, and this year wasn't any different, and we did see an improvement in September.</p>
          <p>I think really commenting that deeply on October when you're a couple of weeks into it, the fourth quarter, I think is probably premature. I think as we have said though, we have seen more similar trends compared to September continue into October. Does that mean that's normal? I guess not basically, but I would point out it's certainly better than what we saw in July, for example. And I would say that comment, by the way, really applies across the bank, not just to the Investment Bank, if that's helpful.</p>
          <p>I think in terms of the second question, in terms of the hybrid issuance, a large proportion of our hybrid issuance comes due for first call in 2013. So that's when it becomes first due for...</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. The question would be, on slide 26 you provided some guidance how the risk-weighted assets mitigation methods will impact your revenues, but I didn't get your statement here on the movement from OTC derivatives to central counterparties. Maybe you can give us an indication what that would imply on the revenue side as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think there's two issues here really. First of all is the move to central counterparty clearing, which we wouldn't expect to have any particular impact on our derivatives business. I guess the related question is then what happens from the move to exchange clearing, which is separate from this, but &#x2013; and I think really that could &#x2013; leads onto what impact do we expect from dollar/francs in terms of that move as well.</p>
          <p>I mean, I think it's difficult to be wholly confident of that. Clearly, history's suggested that moving products onto exchange-cleared markets tends to boost transparency and impact volumes, and that certainly in other markets there's actually been positive elasticity from that. Whether we'll see that happen across the derivatives business globally, I think remains to be seen. Clearly, in some OTC derivative products, the actual spreads, even though their OTC basis is actually very narrow, in other products, however, they're quite wide. So how that actually is going to move, I think is difficult to project.  But certainly a move to exchange-based clearing we would expect to boost volumes, and that will wholly, partly or fully offset for any margin squeeze that comes from that.</p>
          <p>So I think &#x2013; but specifically on slide 26, in terms of derivatives, we therefore don't expect any significant impact to revenues either from the collateralization, hedging or roll-off of our existing OTC business, or really from the move to central counterparty clearing.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, hi. Three questions, if I may. The first one would be on costs in Wealth Management, but also partly on the Investment Bank. Would you describe the reductions as rather cyclical, given the low activities levels on the top line, or is there any structural items in there?</p>
          <p>The second question is on slide number nine &#x2013; and thanks for disclosing the gross margin of the various pockets. I was just wondering, in order to square the numbers with the overall gross margin of the Swiss booking center, the 135, what is that business which is included there? Is it the mortgage business which isn't in the denominator of the assets under management? But could you just give some color how the three pockets basically then come up to the end result of 135 basis points gross margin?</p>
          <p>And the third area is on the Investment Bank, and I was just wondering, if activity levels hasn't picked up and if we assume the current run-rate of October going forward, are you confident, or are you happy, with the size of the Investment Bank, given that you added 600 headcounts during the quarter? And basically connected with that, Brady, you said that fixed income, as long as there is a high return on capital, you're actually fine. But Basel III is going to reduce it significantly. So what's the impact in terms of Basel III on the return on capital for your fixed income business according to your calculations? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Philipp, thanks. Maybe let me answer the second and third, and David can address the first one. I think, yeah, in terms of the numbers, as you say, on slide nine, I mean, obviously the difference between what we spiked out and the total was everything else. So that includes, as you say, mortgages, credit cards, the affluent business, all of those areas. So that's the remaining piece. But we were more &#x2013; obviously more focused sort of on the private banking flows and the net new asset flows; we thought were probably more instructive for people to see just in terms of those different categories. But, yeah, the rest of it is clearly, as you know, well, affluent business, credit cards, mortgages, and as you say, often things that impact the gross margin that don't actually have assets there. So I think that's right.</p>
          <p>In terms of the sort of scale of IB et cetera, I mean, I think we continue to be constructive on the business in the medium term. And we think we can continue to generate good returns. We saw &#x2013; so in general, we're constructive on the business and we think that it will be a good business over the medium term, over the next quarters. And whether that means the fourth quarter or not, we don't know, but over a longer period of time we think it will be a good business.</p>
          <p>We are actually taking a very disciplined approach to the costs, but the head count increase in the third quarter, a lot of it relates to more seasonal type issues. As you know, a lot of the campus recruiting heads actually come in in the third quarter, and so a lot of that was actually just head count increases that were sort of in the works from earlier. We continue to be quite disciplined on the overall cost and head count in the business and I think we'll continue to be disciplined no matter what happens. But certainly, as you say, if conditions continue as they are, we'll continue to be very, very disciplined.</p>
          <p>The Basel III impact in terms of the capital against fixed income business or any of those businesses, clearly, we are &#x2013; and as David discussed in terms of the mitigation, those are some of the specific mitigation areas, but we'll also continue to adapt the business and take measures to make sure that we're running it efficiently. I mean, we certainly think we can run an investment banking business and a fixed income business that's quite &#x2013; had good returning business on Basel III, but it will require additional development et cetera.</p>
          <p>I mean, we happen to think we're probably much farther along in that because of the fact that we have a more client-focused and a more capital-efficient business than many of our competitors. And so just from a &#x2013; in terms of a remaining work to do in terms of getting the business in line with those, we feel like we are a lot farther down the line. But there is still work to do, but we'll continue to adapt that. But, David, do you have anything to add to that or you want to answer the cost question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only point I'd probably add on the &#x2013; I mean, just to supplement to that, is that the largest component of the increase in IB head count was obviously campus recruitment. The second largest component would be IT staff as part of the flow expansion we talked about before, all of which are, I guess, relatively low cost in the context of the Investment Bank.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I have two questions. Mr. Mathers said during that conference that the cost flexibility of the Investment Bank in particular has decreased as a result of rising salaries, obviously, on the expense of bonuses. Can you be more specific on that effect?</p>
          <p>My second question is, I understand that the Investment Bank realize now even more than in the past on these RMBS trading revenues. I would like to know to which extent &#x2013; more about the dependence of the Investment Bank on this specific business line.</p>
          <p>Yes &#x2013; and maybe just a third question. I understand that you have in the Investment Bank increased the capital, you have allocated more capital to the Investment Bank over the last 12 months or so significantly, according to your presentation. What is the logic to &#x2013; when I look at the revenues of that business, which the business is producing significantly lower profit, what is the logic to that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for those questions. I think on the cost flexibility, I think all we were really commenting on was more of a structural issue, which is just exactly as David said, we're &#x2013; I think as in general regulators around the world have pushed us to increase fixed levels of compensation and decrease variable, so on the margin that has made it a little bit less flexible. There still is a lot of flexibility in the cost base, so we still do have a fair amount of flexibility. But on the margin, it has certainly become less flexible. I don't think we're going to &#x2013; I don't think we are specifically laying &#x2013; specifically delineating the percentages or whatever, but I would say it's not a huge impact &#x2013; but it's noticeable, but it's not that significant. So I would say that that's sort of the answer to that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the RMBS trading, as you said, it certainly is an important area for us. It's a good area. And we think it's one that has good prospects. It's not such a large part of the overall bank's business. So, obviously it's a good area. We think we've got a good business there. It's a very client-focused business. It's a very capital-efficient and low-risk business, but it's not that major part of the bank's overall revenues.</p>
          <p>And then, David, you want to answer the question on RWA he asked &#x2013; capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think you're probably referring to slide 17 which showed an increase in risk-weighted assets up to 151 billion, of which 137 were ongoing and 14 was in respect to our exit business. I mean, the increase is predominantly in respect of our credit businesses, both corporate banking and debt capital markets. And it is pretty much in line with the market share gains which you may see on slide 37, where you saw that, for example, we've moved up to third in our high yield debt issuance and fifth in investment-grade debt issuance. So it's very much in line with that. And I think as I referred in our results presentation that we had seen that business as being a key part of the improvement in fixed income revenues quarter-on-quarter. So it does support that and it's very much in line with that.</p>
          <p>I think I'd also point out that compared to industry levels of risk-weighted assets, these are pretty low compared to the revenues we actually operate with. You will get mix changes like this, just depending on the actual mix of business in any particular period.</p>
          <p>And just as a supplement on the first point on cost, I would point out that the year-to-date compensation accrual in the Investment Bank is down 20% compared to last year. So, I think on Brady's point and my point, I think there clearly still is very substantial flexibility in the compensation costs for the Investment Bank and for the group overall.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think it's also just worth restating that the business model that we're running is really one that I think quite differentiated in the industry; I think it shows that we've really learned the lessons from the crisis that we have &#x2013; we're really running a much lower volatility, more capital-efficient business that's focused on clients. And I think if you look at the first nine months of this year, our 15% underlying ROE &#x2013; actually 16% stated &#x2013; that 15% underlying ROE is among &#x2013; I think that's probably pretty much best-in-class among global banks. And I think that's a good indicator of the strength of this, because we've really in the second and the third quarter, there have been some pretty challenging conditions our there with the euro, euro zone, sovereign issues and the slowdown in volumes in the third quarter. So I think that's an important thing to note.</p>
          <p>Okay. Next question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It was a question on the securitization risk-weighted asset impact that you give on the Basel III slides. It just looks a bit higher than I would have expected, given you don't really have that much in the way of banking book deductions or banking book risk-weighted assets from securitizations under the current Basel II regulation. So am I right to think that you get hit more on trading positions that no longer qualify for low trading risk-weightings? Is that a reasonable way to think of it? And is there anything you can say in terms of what determines whether a securitization can be put in the trading book or the banking book? I'm just wondering whether you've got lots of scale among securitizations that are in the trading book but still qualify for a fairly benevolent trading risk-weighting under the current rules that will go away? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, <mark type="inaudible" /> at least <mark type="inaudible" />, no, we haven't. The B2.5 securitization changes actually reflect a change, a recalibration in actually sort of middle or higher quality securitization charges, typically BB minus, as opposed to a lower rated dub, which actually moves under B2.5 to being deducted, and that's what you're really seeing there in terms of the step-up in B2.5. The gross-up then follows from that. So there isn't any particular legacy of lower quality securitization.</p>
          <p>I think the other point here of course is &#x2013; which I did emphasize, was the risk-weighted asset impact relating to our exit businesses, where, as you know, there's 14 billion there. Those businesses are &#x2013; or those positions, would be, if we still have them by 2013, significantly affected by the B3 rules. Clearly, our intention, our plan is to continue to sell down those assets, and I think you've seen the progress we've made this quarter, so that would further mitigate it.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just one follow-up question please, and then a second question. The follow-up, just have you given us the assets under management corresponding to the segments on slide nine, and if not, could you?</p>
          <p>And then second question, do you have any comments at this stage on the implications of the organization section of the Swiss Expert reports about resolvability and emergency measures and what kind of changes you need to make to implement that? And also in that scheme, would the Swiss booking center of the Private Bank be part of what goes into the bridge bank in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeremy, appreciate it. Gee, we thought we were giving a lot of new disclosure on slide nine. So we're &#x2013; I guess there's always more you can do. No, we're not actually &#x2013; we haven't put out and we're not planning to put out the total assets under management in the different segments, as you say. But hopefully that gives you some idea. I mean, we were just trying to be responsive in terms of obviously people's concerns that that sort of mature market segment was the highest gross margin segment, and that if that were to be reducing over time, that that would really challenge the gross margin. So that's what we were trying to give a perspective on. But we haven't disclosed and don't plan right now to disclose the overall numbers.</p>
          <p>The organization segment of the report, I think one of the very positive things from our point of view that came out of the whole Expert Commission discussion is the fact that &#x2013; in fact, in terms of the organization of large banks and the sort of integrated bank approach, that that was something that actually the Expert Commission ratified and supported in terms of not requiring or not asking for any additional &#x2013; any measures with regard to that. So we actually, we think that was actually a positive.</p>
          <p>I think actually some of the other things that were talked about in the Expert Commission report, as you mentioned, but also obviously by regulators around the world, our issue is just around simplifying structures, talking about market-critical utilities and things like that and making sure that those are things that under any circumstances would be able to continue to operate et cetera. So I think our general view is that obviously this will probably develop over time, but we don't view it as something that has really any impact on our business structure or our direction.</p>
          <p>I mean, we will &#x2013; you've probably seen we've taken these steps to buy in the minority in NAB, which just helps to &#x2013; really helps us to streamline the structure and make us just basically more a simpler structure overall. And so that's really the direction that we're taking. So I don't think there's anything &#x2013; it's a good question, but I don't think there's anything significant in those measures that we think would have an impact on our business model or strategy or prospects.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And do you think that the Swiss booking center of the Private Bank, would that be caught under that sort of Swiss deposits, Swiss loans, Swiss payments, sort of the bits that go into the bridge bank?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't &#x2013; to be honest with you, I don't think there's really been &#x2013; it's not a very developed discussion. I mean, I think the &#x2013; obviously, one of the things that the regulators are obviously quite interested in is just more the utility, the payment systems et cetera, and there's really been more focus on that. And frankly, I don't think it's a very developed discussion, and frankly, with the kind of capital requirements that we're going to have and with these contingent convertibles et cetera, I think obviously that's been the focus, is really taking sort of the whole "too big to fail" issue off the table through very strong capitalization, is really been more of the focus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. You've answered most of my questions. I just wanted to come on to the fair value of structured liabilities which you're now disclosing. And my question was why are you sort of now disclosing that? And secondly, what do you think that means economically? Is it the same as your other DVA adjustments?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, the third quarter impact looks a lot bigger than relative to the second quarter than your other DVA marks, and I wanted to know why that was that much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks very much. Well, I think we felt that improving the disclosure around this was meaningful, particularly as it was &#x2013; the move was actually larger in the third quarter than it had been before. There's always been some volatility around those positions for us, as I'm sure you've seen at other banks. So it was a decision to disclose that. I think if people find that helpful, then that's something we'd probably carry on doing going forward as we do with the other fair value own debt type moves.</p>
          <p>I think just in terms of the structured notes move, it is obviously clearly partly correlated to moves in our own credit spreads, but not wholly so, because the structured note discount curve moves is only approximately correlated to our own debt spreads, and that will move up and down depending on acquisitions and market environment and the product. So I'm not unduly surprised to see there is &#x2013; you're seeing some degree of a basis shift there in the third quarter, and I think we should probably expect that; it can really &#x2013; it can actually run in both directions in any one period. I think those are... Does that answer the question, Robert, sorry?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I mean, are you sort of basically suggesting that we should strip that out now of numbers or, I mean, is that <mark type="inaudible" /> DVA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we didn't in the underlying calculation; I think we wanted to be broadly consistent we've done before. I think that's your decision in terms of how you wish to adjust your numbers. It isn't perfectly analogous to fair value own debt because, as I said before, it's not perfectly correlated. Equally, although most of it through the lifetime basically does even out, there is a certain amount of secondary trading around structured note which doesn't exist in our own debt, so it's slightly different than that. But it's clearly very close to analogous and has some of the same economics.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you also going to disclose any realized gains based on the trading around those then as well, and were there any in the quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think &#x2013; we can look at that; I don't think there's anything particularly material. It's just part of the ongoing business.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks. So I guess we're through the questions, so, thanks, everybody. Let me just briefly sum up.</p>
          <p>Obviously, our view is 1 billion of underlying net operating income is a solid result in a challenging quarter. We were particularly encouraged by the net new asset inflows, both in Private Banking and Asset Management. We will continue to be very disciplined, but nonetheless invest in our client-focused, capital-efficient, high return businesses; that's already been delivering results with strong net new assets and improved market share.</p>
          <p>We do think the nine month results, return on equity of 15.9%, net new assets of 55 billion underscore that the business model is able to produce strong results over the cycle. Should the current challenges persist, we think our capital-efficient strategy will allow us to manage that well. And we did anticipate much of the regulatory change, both in terms of the capital requirements and the new cross-border regimes.</p>
          <p>So this means that we think we're well placed to meet these new requirements, and at the same time compete and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thanks very much, everybody, for your time and attention.</p>
