          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Keith and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the DIRECTV's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Jonathan Rubin, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Planning. Sir, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our First Quarter 2012 Financial Results Outlook Conference Call. With me today on the call are Mike White, our President and CEO; Pat Doyle, CFO; Bruce Churchill, President of DIRECTV Latin America; and Larry Hunter, our General Counsel. In a moment I'll hand the call over to Mike, Bruce and Pat for some introductory remarks, but first I'll read to you the following.</p>
          <p>On this call we make statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by the relevant forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are described in the Risk Factors section and elsewhere in each of DIRECTV's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and our other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.sec.gov. Examples of forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements we make related to our business strategy and regarding our outlook for financial results liquidity and capital resources.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in accordance with the SEC's Regulation G that requires companies reporting non-GAAP financial measures to reconcile these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, we do provide reconciliation schedules for the non-GAAP measures which are attached to our earnings release and posted on our website at directv.com.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'm pleased to introduce Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon, and thanks all for joining us today. DIRECTV is off to a strong start in 2012 as our first quarter results for both Latin America and the U.S. business reflect solid execution of the long-term strategies we put in place last fall designed to maintain our long-term growth momentum and profitability.</p>
          <p>In particular, as I look at the quarter I'd make three points worth highlighting. First, the strength of both the DIRECTV and the Sky brands along with our differentiated suite of products and services drove strong double-digit top line growth for the 11th consecutive quarter. I might add that DIRECTV's consolidated revenue growth of 12% leads our industry and is due in large part to the diverse geographies, the macroeconomic conditions and the diversity of growth opportunities in our portfolio of businesses across the Americas.</p>
          <p>Second, strong OPBDA and cash flow growth in the quarter demonstrates our commitment to striking an optimal balance between growth and profitability through effective cost management and a highly disciplined approach to improving the efficiency and productivity of our operations on every line item.</p>
          <p>And third, we continue to execute on our strategy of aggressively returning capital to our shareholders. As you saw in our earnings release we repurchased nearly $1.3 billion of DIRECTV stock in the quarter fueling a 26% increase in earnings per share to $1.07.</p>
          <p>Now before I turn the call over to Bruce and Pat for a more detailed review of our Latin America and U.S. businesses, let me give you just a few observations on each of those two businesses. Starting with Latin America, as we hopefully demonstrated at our Investor Day in March, our Latin America business has quickly become our biggest growth engine and continues to demonstrate outstanding growth momentum. For the first time ever, gross additions not only exceeded those posted by our U.S. business in the quarter, but they also surpassed the 1 million subscriber mark, achieving yet another major milestone.</p>
          <p>In addition, our net additions of nearly 600,000 reached another all-time high. This significant subscriber growth continues to be driven by the strength of our premiere brands and our segmentation strategy of offering the rapidly growing middle market segment attractive, lower-priced post-paid products and prepaid services. At the same time, we continued to strengthen our leadership position in the higher end A &amp; B markets with our differentiated products and services.</p>
          <p>The majority of our year-over-year subscriber growth came from PanAmericana this quarter, where our net additions nearly doubled. This tremendous performance was driven by strong contributions from our prepaid offerings along with the healthy postpaid gains in Colombia, Argentina and Venezuela. I might point out that the Colombia market is a key part of our growth strategy in PanAmericana, and although it is early days in this opportunity, I am delighted to see the results are running even better than Bruce's very aggressive plan for that country.</p>
          <p>Sky Brazil also had a great quarter, as they delivered one of their best quarters ever in terms of both gross and net additions. As we have seen in recent quarters, Sky Brazil's growth just continues to be driven by the popularity of our lower-priced Sky Fit and Sky Light packages in the middle market segments as well as our differentiated products for A &amp; B segment. Now as expected, unfavorable exchange rates and the increasing middle market sales have resulted in a modest decline in ARPU. But our overall OPBDA margin remains strong at over 30% even as we grew market share.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are also seeing success in several of our new products, including Sky Online and the newly launched DIRECTV Cinema Service in PanAmericana, which drove pay-per-view sales to more than double last quarter's performance in just three-months' time.</p>
          <p>Turning now to DIRECTV U.S., our revenue and OPBDA growth were generally right in line with our expectations and were achieved during a quarter in which we had one of the largest recalibrations of our promotional offers in DIRECTV's history.</p>
          <p>As we've indicated, rebalancing our top and bottom lines is the core of strategic initiatives we outlined on last earnings call to achieve mid-single digit revenue and OPBDA growth over the next three years. During first quarter, you saw us begin to implement this shift as we transitioned to a new promotional strategy. We introduced our Entertainment package, a lower-cost programming offer that tailors our best-in-class entertainment experience to better fit the needs and affordability of our more value conscious consumers. It is off to a great start.</p>
          <p>We also reduced our promotional discounts for new customers by about $5 a month in February and instituted a new advanced receiver service fee on our customer's bill. These two initiatives alone are expected to significantly reduce customer credits and increase ARPU over the balance of this year and in particular over the next several years.</p>
          <p>In addition, we eliminated a few of our over-distributed channels from some of our packages and placed a few sports channels and RSNs on different tiers. At the same time, we successfully implemented our annual price increase on programming packages.</p>
          <p>In spite of all of these changes, churn in the quarter of 1.44% represents the lowest first quarter rate in three years. This outstanding performance reflects the collective efforts that we've made over the past few years in three key areas. First, we have increased our upgrade efforts for higher quality customers to grow the percentage of subscribers who are on commitments. Next, we're getting more customers to agree to sign up for Auto Bill Pay, which we found correlates directly with lower churn. And finally, we are continuing to refine and tighten up our credit policies wherever that makes sense.</p>
          <p>With all that said, I thought if there was one area that we could improve on, we did spent a touch too much in the quarter on upgrade and retention. As I mentioned on our last call, we're going to be more focused this year toward achieving a better balance between our top line and bottom line growth. So we've already made some adjustments and so for the balance of the year I expect upgrade and retention spending will moderate relative to prior year.</p>
          <p>I also expect you'll see better OPBDA growth going forward so that we achieve our full-year guidance of mid-single digit growth for OPBDA. But even with the lower churn I think we still have some tremendous opportunities to enhance our overall customer experience at DIRECTV. And in that regard I recently made two important organizational changes in our company to support two key strategic initiatives that I believe will put us in a much better position to capture the opportunity of creating passionate, loyal customers for life.</p>
          <p>First, I named Rasesh Patel, who's a high potential Senior Vice President in our company, to head up a new organization that's taking a fresh look at every customer touch point with the ultimate goal of improving loyalty and creating passionate, loyal customers. Now, let's be clear: It's going to take a lot more than the efforts of one person or one organization. We're going to do a better job of collaborating with every DIRECTV employment across all of our functions in order to reach our successful conclusion in this project. As such, we've also instituted a company-wide incentive plan with specific performance goals that are structured around delivering an unparalleled customer experience to every customer.</p>
          <p>Second, I also recently named Senior Vice President Tony Goncalves to lead our new digital entertainment products team that will focus on ensuring our product and service innovation remains at the forefront of our industry in the digital arena. Tony's team will take a more integrated approach to product innovation, including everything from strategy ideation and product definition across all of our set-top box but with a specific focus on digital and mobile platforms. Tony played a key role in the recent expansion of our TV Everywhere service a couple of months ago when we started offering pay-per-view and premium network content on mobile devices and personal computers outside the home. The digital entertainment products team will also play a critical role as we extend our TV Everywhere experience later this year when we begin streaming linear content outside the home and launch our next generation home media center nationwide.</p>
          <p>All of these efforts to dramatically improve the customer experience are part of a multiyear journey. And I look forward to updating you with our progress and our performance as we go through that journey.</p>
          <p>In summary, DIRECTV is right on track in delivering on our long-term strategies for both our Latin America and U.S. businesses. In Latin America, as we've said, our goal is to continue to capitalize on the tremendous growth opportunity we see there by maintaining leadership in our A/B markets while further penetrating the rapidly growing middle class throughout the region. In addition, we will selectively continue to pursue emerging growth opportunities, such as wireless broadband and Sky Online. And in the U.S., we remain firmly focused on delivering mid-single digit revenue and OPBDA growth sustainably over the next three years by rebalancing our top and bottom lines while significantly enhancing our focus on improving the entire customer experience. At the same time, we'll continue to return cash through stock repurchases at an industry-leading clip. I believe this is the right formula for DIRECTV to continue delivering the superior returns to our shareholders that they've become accustomed to expect.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll ask Bruce to talk about DIRECTV Latin America's results in a little bit more detail. Bruce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks, Mike. As I commented during our 2012 Investor Day just over a month ago, our momentum continues on all fronts with DIRECTV Latin America having yet another record quarter of both gross and net additions while also delivering solid financial results.</p>
          <p>Just a reminder here, unless otherwise noted our results exclude those of Sky Mexico which we do not consolidate. For the quarter our record gross additions of 1,034,000 was 35% higher than last year. Sky Brasil continues to experience strong sales with gross additions growing 26% compared to Q1 2011. Approximately 65% of our gross additions in Brazil came from the middle market segment. In PanAmericana, gross additions grew 45% compared to last year, with sales in Argentina and Colombia leading the way.</p>
          <p>Prepaid sales represented approximately 45% of our gross additions in PanAmericana compared with 35% a year ago. Middle-market subscribers now make up approximately 30% of our 8.5 million subscribers compared with 23% a year ago. Advanced products represented approximately 14% of our new customers in the quarter, with almost 70% of those taking our HD product. In Brazil, we continue to see strong demand for our industry-leading HD offer with HD gross additions increasing almost 40% compared to Q1 of 2011. In fact, as of today, we now have over 1 million HD subscribers in Brazil. Compared to last year, HD DVR sales in PanAmericana increased 50%. Approximately 13% of our subscribers in PanAmericana have our HD products.</p>
          <p>Overall, approximately 27% of our 8.5 million consolidated subscribers now have advanced products, two-thirds of whom subscribe to our HD service. This is a testament to what I have said many times in the past. While we are working very hard to take advantage of the strong growth in the middle market segment, we have not lost sight of traditional bread-and-butter A &amp; B households. These households are still a very important part of our success.</p>
          <p>Turning to churn, our post-paid churn for the quarter was 1.47%, up from 1.43% a year ago but still within our expectations. Much of this increase in churn came from Brazil, reflecting the fact that the middle-market subscribers make up a larger part of our subscriber base. That said, I am pleased our churn rates are below 1.5% given the growth rates we have expect over the past several years.</p>
          <p>With regard to our prepaid services, our recharge rates are generally ahead of last year and were particularly strong at the end of the quarter, as we have seen positive results from initiatives aimed at increasing our recharge rates. We ended the quarter with 593,000 net additions, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year; it is another record quarter for the DTVLA.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our financial results, revenues increased 33% compared to last year or approximately 38% if you exclude the impact of foreign exchange. If you recall, the Brazilian reais was a very strong versus a dollar through Q3 of last year. So I expect that year-over-year comparisons will continue to be negatively impacted by FX over the next several quarters.</p>
          <p>ARPU declined almost 2%, reflecting negative impact of foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina. Excluding FX, ARPU was slightly higher, reflecting price increases, increased penetration of advanced products and the fact that the country mix continues to shift towards Brazil where ARPUs are generally higher. These factors were mostly offset by the impact of more lower ARPU and middle-market subscribers in the overall mix.</p>
          <p>Consolidated DTVLA OPBDA increased 84 million or 22% over last year, mostly due to the gross profit on the incremental revenues, partially offset by higher subscriber service related costs as well as higher subscriber acquisition costs related to the increase in gross additions. Subscriber service related expenses, which mostly relates to our call centers and technical service calls, were higher across the region, reflecting inflationary pressures on labor and increased spending necessary to maintain service levels on a significantly larger customer base.</p>
          <p>Cash flow before interest and taxes decreased $88 million with higher OPBDA and favorable working capital being more than offset by $100 million of increased subscriber related CapEx and $55 million more of nonsubscriber and satellite related CapEx versus last year. It's also worth noting that last year we received a $43 million dividend from Sky Mexico in the first quarter, which we did not receive this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding Venezuela, there is no new news on regulations regarding the repatriation of local profits. We have been able to repatriate modest amounts to cover certain U.S. dollar costs at official rates through the approved exchange control process. As of March 31 we had approximately $400 million of cash on hand in Venezuela, expressed using the official rate of Bolivars 4.3 per U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>I would also like to spend just a couple of seconds on Sky Mexico, whose results were released by Televisa a few weeks ago. Sky Mexico delivered another strong quarter, adding 275,000 net subscribers in the quarter compared to 268,000 a year ago. Like DTVLA, Sky Mexico results reflected very strong performance in the middle market segment, but also good growth coming from the traditional A &amp; B segments as well and financial results of Sky Mexico were also strong, with double digit growth in local currency revenue and OPBDA. In total then the DTVLA platforms combined including Sky Mexico now serve more than 13 million subscribers in the region.</p>
          <p>As I look out over the remainder of the year, I remain very confident about meeting the full year objectives we set out for ourselves and that I discussed with all of you at our Investor Day. I would like to note that from a financial results perspective the comparables in the remainder of the year will get more challenging given the strong Brazilian real one year ago. On the other hand if you assume current sales levels, year-over-year comparisons on margin will level out in the second half of the year as we get past some higher than normal upgrade spending on some box swap-outs in PanAmericana and benefits from price increases later in the year. So all in all, I remain very upbeat about the prospects for DTVLA.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand it over to Pat. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bruce. Overall, I thought that DIRECTV U.S. had a good quarter highlighted by solid revenue and cash flow growth along with an impressive reduction in subscriber churn and as you heard from Mike earlier, the first quarter results are particularly pleasing as the many changes that we initiated on our offers and prices collectively represent the largest transition we have made in a single quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking first at the top line, our industry-leading revenue growth of 7% continues to demonstrate the strength of the DIRECTV brand in the marketplace and was driven by ARPU growth of 3.6% and net subscriber gain.</p>
          <p>In addition to growth related to price increases, we saw strong premium channel and pay-per-view movie sales this quarter bolstered by our improved HD user interface and the continued success of DIRECTV Cinema and our Connected Home strategy. Paid premium channels generated the highest buy rate per subscriber since early 2008 while pay-per-view movie buys per subscriber represented the best quarterly performance in over four years, and both premium and pay-per-view movie revenues grew at a double-digit clip year-over-year. However, total pay-per-view revenues declined in the quarter as reduced contributions related to the absence of a boxing event and a lower number of UFC events in the quarter more than offset the pay-per-view movie gain.</p>
          <p>ARPU growth also benefited from increased penetration of both new and existing customers paying for advanced services. Compared to last year, penetration of Whole-Home DVR and Connected Home service more than doubled and as you know, we have had some operational challenges that we have had to work through in Connected Home so this quarter's performance was particularly encouraging. Not only was it the best quarter we have had yet in terms of total new homes connected but we exceeded our internal projection for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to subscribers. The modestly lower first quarter gross additions were consistent with our internal expectations and long-term growth strategy discussed at our last earnings call. You may recall we noted that attaining strong financial returns on new subscribers is more difficult as the risk reward equation continues to be challenged by the maturing industry, competitive intensity and most importantly rapidly rising programming costs.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we have continued to refine and tighten up our credit policies to ensure that we obtain new subscribers who are highly profitable. Over the past several quarters we have also increased upgrade and retention spending for higher quality subscribers to improve loyalty. In addition, we have placed a higher percentage of people on commitment as well as auto bill pay.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter churn rate of 1.44% reflects the success of these efforts and represents the lowest first quarter churn level in three years. Continuing to drive churn lower is a key component of our long-term growth strategy, particularly because we are now more selective in our acquisition of new subscribers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the bottom line, first quarter OPBDA growth of 3.4% was in line with our expectations and full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth. In the quarter, OPBDA margin declined primarily due to higher programming, upgrade and retention and G&amp;A expenses compared to the prior-year period.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned previously, rising programming costs continue to place downward pressure on margins. The year-over-year increase in content costs were primarily related to our annual programmer rate increases, higher payments to regional sports networks and higher fees related to re-trans and our new Fox and NFL contracts.</p>
          <p>Cash upgrade and retention cost of $390 million were also up as we expanded upgrade offers for higher value subscribers with HD DVRs as well as our popular newer services such as Whole-Home DVR and the Connected Home to improve loyalty and manage churn. As Mike mentioned, our upgrade and retention spending was a bit higher in the quarter than we had originally planned. We've addressed this by refining our segmented offers even further and I'm confident that our cash upgrade and retention spending will be flat to down relative to the prior year as a percentage of revenues for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>With regards to G&amp;A, as a reminder, last year's first quarter benefited from a $25 million one-time adjustment for our property tax accrual. G&amp;A often includes these types of nonrecurring items making it difficult to predict cost trends. However, from a budgeting perspective we are targeting G&amp;A expenses to be relatively flat to down as a percentage of revenues for the full year.</p>
          <p>Subscriber service cost performance was solid this quarter and exceeded our targets as we are driving higher overall service levels at a relatively lower cost. For example, service call volumes were down 9% and call volumes were down 6%. It's worth noting that some of the decline was due to a particularly mild winter however we are also seeing improvements in three key areas.</p>
          <p>First, we are benefiting from several initiatives in place at both our call centers and installation network over the past couple of years to increase productivity. Next, the improved reliability of our set-top boxes along with more effective self-care options for our customers has reduced call volume and truck roll. And finally, we're doing a better job of getting it right the first time, especially during the critical first 90 days of the customer's lifecycle with improved work order accuracy and installation.</p>
          <p>Lastly, before moving on to our consolidated results, although it did not impact the income statement, the higher cash SAC rate of $857 was mostly due to higher equipment and installation costs related to more sales of advanced services and Connected Home along with an unfavorable impact from lower gross additions relative to our fixed marketing and advertising costs.</p>
          <p>It's worth repeating that these investments continue to yield significant benefits as we are seeing higher ARPU driven mostly by greater VOD buys as well as lower churn rates amongst subscribers taking these services.</p>
          <p>Looking quickly at our consolidated results this quarter, DIRECTV continues to generate solid bottom line growth as diluted earnings per share increased 26% to $1.07 in the quarter. Consolidated cash flow before interest and taxes in the quarter was strong, increasing by 45% to $1.3 billion as higher OPBDA and favorable DIRECTV U.S. working capital more than offset the capital expenditures associated with the record gross additions in Latin America, increased demands for advanced services and higher satellite payments.</p>
          <p>Working capital benefited from the timing of payments received from customers as well as those paid to vendors and we expect it to be positive for the full year. Free cash flow also improved over 40% but was impacted by higher interest payments related to the increase in debt as well as greater cash tax payments.</p>
          <p>Please note that this increase in tax payments is expected to continue throughout the year due to the greater earnings before taxes and a higher cash tax rate in the 30% range primarily related to the reversal of accelerated depreciation benefits associated with prior year economic stimulus programs.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, this quarter we repurchased 28.5 million shares of DIRECTV stock for $1.26 billion bringing cumulative repurchases to approximately 22 billion or nearly 54% of shares outstanding since we began the program in 2006. Looking ahead, we expect to continue repurchasing shares in the same $100 million per week range for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>Additionally, during the first quarter we made some significant improvements to our capital structure which, along with DIRECTV's strong free cash flow generation, ensures that we will continue executing on our strategy to aggressively return capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>As you may have seen in March, we had an extremely successful debt offering, where the demand for our issuance exceeded our offer in the marketplace and enabled us to attain very attractive rates on 4 billion of investment grade notes. As a result, we have achieved our total debt-to-consolidated OPBDA leverage target of 2.5 times. We also announced that we will be redeeming 1.5 billion of outstanding high-yield notes later this month.</p>
          <p>So in summary, I thought we had a solid quarter. DIRECTV U.S. is on track to meet guidance for all of its key metrics, and we are confident that DIRECTV Latin America is on pace to meet or exceed the guidance provided at our Latin America Investor Day in March. If we accomplish all of these targets, I believe we will continue generating substantial shareholder value by leading the Pay-TV industry in revenue and OPBDA growth, as well as returning capital to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn the call back over to Jon.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much. Mike and Pat, can you talk a bit about the change in the Sunday Ticket pricing this year with regards to three areas: what did you see in the marketplace that drove the decision to lower the pricing? What level of conversions of prior-year promotional subs is necessary or should we be looking for, for you to consider the change to be successful? And lastly, does this shift in pricing at all change the value of the service for DIRECTV as we all think about the renewal process for the NFL? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Doug. We've talked about this before. We talked about it a bit last summer. Obviously, we are now coming up on the renewal period, where we are going to get a chance to see how well our new strategy around the Sunday Ticket is working. When we looked at this thing, Doug, we were particularly focused on how do we get to a long-term pricing strategy for this business that's sustainable with consumers? And at the same time, we have a one-time opportunity to take advantage of kind of, if you will, a million free trials we gave out last summer.</p>
          <p>So, we don't need very many of those million free trials. I think if you looked at the history, with the old approach you might have gotten maybe &#x2013; I don't know &#x2013; 100,000 at most that would have re-upped. I honestly think that by doing this segmented offer, where there's a basic package and there's an enhanced package, we've both tried to make the product more appropriate both for existing customers, so there's something in it for existing customers, while we continue our promotional strategy of free Sunday Ticket with the purchase of DIRECTV in Q3.</p>
          <p>So I expect we'll have another strong promotion in third quarter around new customers, but we think we've got a terrific platform that now gives us a three-year runway. And I want to be clear, as we looked at the pricing decision, we weren't looking at a one-year thing. We were trying to figure out what gives us confidence that we can kind of build a value offer for customers over the next three years and maximize the number of existing customers that will renew and keep the product. So it really is kind of a one-time opportunity for us to step up the renewals, and we've always said, I think, going back, Doug, to the use of it in the promotion last year, that the key thing for this product is that we've got to grow the base.</p>
          <p>We've got to grow the base number of customers that will pay for the product. Given that the cost of the products are increasing, our view is use it as a loss leader and we will go from there. So I think it's too soon to say, but I'm very excited about our third quarter promotion. It gives me a lot of confidence that we should have a good take on that in the third quarter, but I'm equally excited about our opportunity for renewals, and we'll see how that goes. We're coming up on it but it's a little early to give you any report out on that.</p>

          <p>What I was trying to get to with the last part of the question is should investors worry at all that the value of the NFL service to the company is different from what the NFL might think the value of the service is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I mean, I think the NFL sees the value of its product as very strong across the board. I think in terms of the role it plays at DIRECTV it's both driving gross adds for us but it's also a unique differentiator at DIRECTV. So I don't see anything &#x2013; I've had &#x2013; talked recently with Roger Goodell. I think we have a good partnership with the NFL, and we both feel good about the role that that product plays with the current approach that we're taking.</p>

          <p>I think, Doug, as Mike said, I think if you go back a year, the subscribers that took the NFL offer was a little bit over 300,000 in total. We ended up this year with &#x2013; and some people didn't get the whole season, but about 1.5 million customers experienced the NFL Sunday Ticket as part of our offer.</p>
          <p>And so again, as Mike said, we're looking for ways &#x2013; I think we feel like we've got the passionate NFL customers that are on our platform. We're trying to find a way to appeal to those people that are interested &#x2013; maybe not as passionate and that's why we kind of also came up with this two tier package to try to maybe encourage that customer to take it now that they've experienced it for a season.</p>

          <p>Look, if you look out there with any programming that we're looking at, as things are available through more channels, games move to Thursday night, whatever, I think we'd love to keep it exclusive and very, very narrow, but the fact of the matter is &#x2013; and I'm sure Roger would be the first to point this out to me &#x2013; we had record gross adds in the third quarter last year. So we still have tremendous demand for that product. All of our consumer research says our customers still love the product, and it's a great part of our DIRECTV brand.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask about the Entertainment Package. Mike, for you guys to move a bit away from sports is a little bit of a departure from the historical DIRECTV positioning, and I think we all understand why. But could you guys shed a little bit of light on the impact it might have had in the quarter on either ARPU or programming costs? Because actually ACPU growth looked a little bit below what we had feared for Q1 and I don't know if that's going to ramp through the rest of the year, but more broadly how you're thinking about tiering maybe at the lower end of the market from a price point perspective then as you move through the rest of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. Appreciate the question. But first of all, in terms of the impact on any of our metrics, it's immaterial. We just started in February selling the product. It really is tiny in the grand scheme of our total metrics today.</p>
          <p>Having said that, the take rates are pretty much right in line with what we expected, Ben. They're probably high-teens, I would say, maybe a touch more but not much. Right in that line. And we're seeing a number of existing customers that have an interest in the product. So I think &#x2013; look, this is a tough economy for the bottom half of America. And I think we're all going to have to continue to think about ways to make the pay television business more affordable for the average American household. It's something I'm very concerned about.</p>
          <p>So I'm pleased with the product's take so far. It's one of those you don't want it to be too small or too big. It's just about right. Just like Goldilocks and it's just about right, right now in terms of where it landed. I think it's an important addition to our portfolio, to your point. Look, we're a national service. We aren't some niche service that only serves high-end homes and sports only. So while sports is an integral part of our brand, for sure, there are a lot of consumers out there who would rather not be paying for those expensive RSNs and I think it's up to us to serve those customers.</p>
          <p>So we see it as an important offering going forward and we're pleased with it so far. But, gosh, in terms of the size it's just immaterial in terms of any of the metrics. It had nothing to do with our programming cost performance in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any comment on programming costs the rest of the year? Is it expected the rate to go up from here as we move through? I think you guys had guided to high singles this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We came in at about 8%, and I would expect we're going to be in about that ballpark for the full year. We do have one extra game in Q3, so that may impact Q3, but net-net I would say we're tracking right in line with our programming cost expectations. It's very difficult. It's forcing all distributors to have to take a very hard look at low rated channels, no matter who offers those channels and look for ways to economize for our customers, who are having trouble affording all this content. But we're right in line with expectations on programming costs, I would say.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug, just to make sure everybody understood, the NFL when their schedule came out, usually they have a regular-season game that falls over into January. This year with the calendar the way it is, they'll have an additional game in September. So we'll report both additional programming costs and additional revenue related to an extra game in the calendar year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Two questions. First, on the U.S., I'm getting a little confused on the comments around promotions. So I hear you when you say you're less promotional, but reading the press releases it says that ARPU was impacted by new promotions, and then there are additional promotions around the NFL. So can you reconcile this and maybe explain where you're being more promotional and where you're being less promotional? And then turning to Latin America just looking over the past two years at ARPU growth organic, it tends to decelerate throughout the year. So I don't know this is seasonal? And if it is, would it be safe to assume that the 1.5% organic growth we saw in the first quarter is likely to be the peak growth rate for ARPU in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce, I'll let you take the Latin America question. In terms of the promotional question, Marci, look, there's a lot of moving parts. Fundamentally, I keep looking at ARPU. That to me, net ARPU growth is the key focus. I think what we're trying to do is very carefully balance reducing discounts and credits with the consumers' reaction to that. So we've taken a very careful and deliberate approach that I look at full year and what we are trying to do full year, and we're right in line with that.</p>
          <p>I think, frankly, just the way the math works, that the rate of growth, first of all, for credits is slowing significantly. Second of all, when you look at ARPU in the second half you'll see an improvement. So this is part of a full-year plan. You can't just look a one quarter and try and &#x2013; and remember, the new stuff didn't come into play until the 10th or 15th of February and the quarter was over at the end of March. So there was only about a half a quarter's impact in there. But we are right in line with what we expected to do. But again, my key focus is looking on that net ARPU growth. And I do expect you'll see an improvement in that growth rate as we go through the year. Bruce, do you want to talk about the DTVLA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't really want to get into a discussion about trying to predict ARPUs on a quarter-by-quarter basis. I think what we have broadly said is that ARPU will be flat to down for the year, mostly driven by really two factors, which is on the tough comparisons with the Brazilian reais, that are going to be particularly tough, I think, in the second part of the year. As well as just the fact that as we sell more middle market products, which have lower ARPUs, and they become a bigger part of the mix, it tends to drag the average down. The two countervailing forces against that are the efforts we always make to continue to upgrade customers, as well as selling into the A &amp; B. So that has a mitigating impact. And the fact that as Brazil becomes a bigger part of the total pie, ARPUs in general are higher in Brazil. So a low priced consumer package in Brazil just in dollar terms is higher than a similar package in Argentina for example. So, I think I'd prefer to just stick with my overall guidance and not try and get making projections on a quarter-by-quarter basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just reiterate, I think it's important when you talk something like ARPU you have to look at in local currency. We have to report in dollars so you get a number in dollars, but frankly, I look at it not through that lens in terms of a traditional management look. I look at it adjusted for ForEx and say what's happening? And we're fine in that regard.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in Brazil it was like 65%, and roughly 45% in PanAmericana. Those two are roughly each 50% of the business. So take the average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in terms of the U.S. business, Mike, look, we start with the reality as an industry that the cost of the product has increased substantially on a long-term basis. We're on a long-term growth in programming cost, and as we look at our pricing and our discounting, we're looking at through what's a responsible position for us to take as a company to best manage our margins for the long haul. We've got a very complete and comprehensive approach to that. That includes looking for $400 million in improved programming margin enhancements or AMPU, if you want, each year, and we've got very clear kind of line items in terms of reducing credits, spelling more addressable advertising, aggressively growing commercial and DIRECTV Cinema to improve ARPU and reducing programming by re-tiering or cutting out small channels wherever possible. We've got a very aggressive $100 million goal for reducing costs in operating productivity initiatives across the board from subscriber services to broadcast ops to G&amp;A.</p>
          <p>When you kind of start from how do you balance an algorithm over the long haul that is sustainable, we frankly look at it through that lens and then to be honest with you we will sell as many quality customers that are profitable as we can sell. But we're constantly adjusting the lenses here as we look at customers to see which ones are profitable and which ones are not, and frankly if they're not going to be a profitable customer I'm not going to chase bad business.</p>
          <p>So we have been &#x2013; I think we have been very deliberate in saying I still expect to gain share this year. I think our strongest promotional quarters are Q3 and Q4. I'm pleased with Q1; we're ahead of expectation. Q2 is always a seasonally low quarter for the industry, and so I think we'll see some challenges in Q2 along with the industry. We hardly had any net adds in Q2 last year. So I feel that we're right on track. Our business is performing well, and I think we'll have a good year overall for the year.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions. For Mr. White, I was hoping to get a bit more color on your TV Everywhere plans that you mentioned in your opening remarks. I believe I heard you mention that you would be launching an out of home linear video product later in the year. Maybe you could describe what that would be just in general terms if possible. That would sound like a Sling-like product. And then if I could ask a follow-up question for Pat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Stefan, it's probably a little premature for me to get too much into it for competitive reasons, but certainly I can tell you that &#x2013; more broadly let's talk about TV Everywhere. I think it's very much in the nascent stage in our industry. You've got different programmers with different rules of the road that we all have to work with. So it's not that simple and clean from a programmer rights standpoint. We can do way more than we're doing today from a technology standpoint, but we're not able to because we don't have the rights. You've got challenges with some of the other portals, like Apple, in terms of what their ecosystem's rules are going to be and how they are going to evolve as well, that we need to be responsive to.</p>
          <p>So I would say you will see us continuing to build, but this is a long-term journey over multiple years. So I would be clear that while we will look to be doing more streaming of products, we're going to be doing more on-demand products outside the home, this is a long-term journey, and I don't think you'll see some big transformational thing out of any of the distributors, 'cause frankly the rights aren't there. And the rights are very much in the stage of evolution.</p>
          <p>So I'm excited. We launched our dot-com with pay-per-view and premiums. We are working on Androids and making our stuff work on Android. We are pleased with our iPad app and how it works in our iPhone apps. But you're going to see a multiyear journey here as we expand TV Everywhere. It will go as fast as we can get the rights to evolve to be honest with you. The technology, I can already stream all of our channels on my iPad, if I want. I just don't have the rights to do it. So the technology is not the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. If I could just ask a quick follow up for Pat, could you provide us with a brief update on your commercial and advertising revenues and their potential for a positive impact on ARPU growth in 2012? You may have mentioned them in your opening remarks, but I did not hear anything about them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we are moving along. We have talked about the fourth quarter we had a little bit of delay in getting the product in a position where we were comfortable launching it. We did get it out in the fourth quarter. It really didn't start to become revenue generating on the local ad sales until the first quarter. So we've saw some nice year-over-year increase in revenue from ad sales in the first quarter, not great, but we see that getting better as each quarter goes by and we begin to rollout more cities more stations. So we are definitely looking for double-digit growth for the full year or better on ad sales.</p>
          <p>On commercial, we are doing very well there along the original plan. Some issues there, but if you go back to our three-year outlook there, we still feel good about that business. Maybe it's not quite at the revenue growth levels that we expected over a three-year period, but both of those are now on track, and again, we are looking for that to really kind of help us on ARPU, because we are looking at double-digit growth for both those opportunities over the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, Stefan, the actual addressable ads, which is the thing that enables you to do local ads, which is where the big driver of difference between us and cable guys. They've always been able to do local ads, and you can charge a lot more money for a local ad than you can for some of the stuff we do nationally. That really kicks in full bore in fourth quarter. We get some of the benefit in the third quarter. So you'll see that start to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, and that will help our ARPU as we go through the year. But we're pretty much right in line with our plan on ad sales so far this year. But the real kick starts coming I think as you get into Q3 and Q4 on ad sales. And commercial, we are a little shy of our plan, but we are well ahead of a year ago in commercial, so we're doing fine there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. First of all, how important is it going forward to actually own the user interface in customer experience? You have precedent with the TiVo relationship and having their non-DIRECTV branded user interface on your CPE. Is that something that you would be willing to explore with other potential CPE providers, given the discussion of an Apple TV or a Google TV?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with RSN costs rising and highly varied across markets, would it ever makes sense to have packages that were non-nationals or regionally standardized &#x2013; for example, a New York specific package without the RSN, given the sports cost in that market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, James, on the &#x2013; I don't think of it as needing to own the user experience. I think of it that our ability to deliver a differentiated outstanding user experience is the reason we do it because we think we can do it the best of anybody. We are 100% focused on our customers and their customer experience, so I don't really see &#x2013; we continue to believe that if you look at any of the consumer ratings of DIRECTV we've got the best sports, most HD channels, the best sound, the best picture and the best user interface. So that's our core strategic advantage in my mind and therefore we're going to continue to capitalize on that advantage and continue to evolve and enhance that user experience as consumers evolve. So that's our primary focus in terms of what we offer the user.</p>
          <p>Now, we've added services. We added Pandora to our DIRECTV service for connected boxes, and it's a terrific addition that consumers love. So not to say we'd never look for other partners in certain areas but in terms of the core user interface, we frankly think we do the best at that and plan to continue to do so. Sports is a challenge in terms of its rising costs across the board. We've looked at any number of options as it relates to regional sports networks. That's partly why our first choice was to launch the Entertainment Package, where you've stripped it out to make it more affordable for customers. Clearly one has to look at areas like the New York City area where RSNs are pretty expensive and ask some of those kinds of questions. And we continue to ask those kinds of questions as to whether you would do a surcharge or whether you would go a la carte. My own personal belief is it ought to be a la carte in the long haul, but in the short run I'm not likely to get there. So we'll continue to look at that, and as we try things and think we've got a plan that we could roll out we'll communicate when the time is right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I'm not sure whether this is a question for Bruce or Pat but I know you guys track very carefully the lifetime value of subscribers. We only get to see the blended averages but I'm wondering if you could comment at all about the trajectory you're seeing in the lifetime value of customers in Latin America? It looks like churn is coming down but there's a lot of puts and takes obviously, especially for customers on the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's pretty &#x2013; fairly competitively sensitive. I guess what I would refer you to is the IRRs that we presented to everybody at our Investor Day a month ago. There's no reason &#x2013; there's certainly no change in any of that information, and the way &#x2013; you're right &#x2013; the way we do look at you can call it LTV, you can call it IRR, but we do take a very close look at how much we have to put in upfront which is the SAC and then what's the return.</p>
          <p>The reason I believe IRR is important is because it's a return calculation. The actual, of course, dollar LTV of a lower ARPU sub in absolute dollar terms is going to be lower even though the IRR might be as good if not better. So I think that's why you need to look at both and I would say there's nothing material that has changed since we presented those to you a month ago.</p>

          <p>Are there any interesting trends on the margins? For example are incremental subscribers coming in showing lower or higher churn rates or lower or higher ARPUs that are being masked in any way by the blended averages?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thank you. Firstly, can you update us on your thinking on the Verizon marketing situation with the cable companies and whether there are parallel opportunities for you and AT&amp;T Wireless, particularly since AT&amp;T needs you more in U-verse markets than Verizon would have needed you in the FiOS markets?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I know this is a little ways out there, but when you look at Ultra-HD with Ka-band, I mean, you have some advantages relative to the cable companies even with the CCAP implementation. Do you have any &#x2013; you must be looking at that on a preliminary basis in terms of jazzing your brand on the video side and even inevitably moving to that five or 10 years out? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Matthew, so the first question on the Verizon Comcast thing, look, so far we track pretty carefully geography by geography, the $200 credit card thing hasn't really impacted our gross adds or our churn in those geographies in any material way. We have a good relationship with AT&amp;T, Verizon and CenturyLink, all three. They're important partners of ours. We now have the ability to sell high-speed bundles, high-speed fiber bundles, as well as the DSL bundle. We're always in conversations with all of those partners about ways to strengthen our relationship with their wireless division, and when we have something to say about that I'll let you guys know. Rest assured we're always looking at opportunities.</p>
          <p>We still think that the consumer &#x2013; from all the research that we have done, the consumer still has a little bit of difficulty trying to see what a quad play is and why they should pay two companies for that thing and then it all gets blended into one and you lose transparency, and I think from a consumer trust standpoint I'm not sure it's a huge idea. But we'll keep an eye on it, and we're in constant conversations with the telcos about ways we could strengthen our relationship with their wireless divisions.</p>
          <p>In terms of the 4K or Ultra HD, there were some 4K TV sets at CES that I saw in Las Vegas. Very interesting, beautiful picture. I think it will be a really interesting technology for DIRECTV. We've got it along with a long list of items that are out there in terms of where we think the business will evolve over the next three or four years, and that's certainly one of them that we've got on our technology road map.</p>
          <p>Frankly I think you'll start to see those TVs next year, but you're not going to see the large screen ones. For whatever reason the television manufacturers are focused more on 50 or 55 inch screens for the 4K, and keep in mind you've got to shoot in 4K to really get the benefits. So you've got to also ask how long it will take the television producers to adopt that technology. So as we have seen with 3D, that could be a long journey but certainly an exciting opportunity for us to longer term to continue to differentiate our sound and picture, and as always we'll be looking at it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. Just had one question on the U.S. and then one on Latin America. Have you seen any change in subscriber trends since DISH launched its Hopper and Joey product in early March and the associated ad campaign?</p>
          <p>And then Bruce, actually two little ones. Have you heard anything about Embratel raising DTH pricing? We heard some rumblings about that and didn't know if that was anything that was real.</p>
          <p>And then also can you talk about your marketing partnership with TIM on fiber to the node broadband? Is that something that's meaningful? Or is it just a small initiative? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Bryan. It's Mike. I'll take the first one. Look, I think you have seen DISH's sub trends in the first quarter were a little bit above expectation. Hard to parse how much of that is Hopper and Joey and how much of it is no pricing, but I would dare to say from my perspective it's probably mostly not taking a price increase. That's hard to sustain with content cost growing high single digits for any of us.</p>
          <p>In terms of our own business I would say yeah. I mean, I think DISH is working hard to revitalize their business, and they're a very formidable competitor as they always are. We're going to continue to compete every day.</p>
          <p>Bruce, do you want to do Latin America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on Embratel, I actually haven't heard definitively whether they have raised their prices or not. I will say that we have done some analysis that suggests that even if they had our costs and the advantage of our scale that they would struggle to make money, so it wouldn't be huge shock if they did raise their prices.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the marketing agreement with TIM it actually isn't finalized so it's not at all in these results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>We'll take our next question from Tuna Amobi with S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. So another angle on the lifetime value question that was asked earlier. As I look at your &#x2013; the fact, the trend in the U.S. versus Latin America, it's my understanding you're kind of close to maybe about 45% in dollar terms of SAC Latin America versus U.S. if my estimate are correct? So I'm trying to get a sense of in terms of the return that you get per subscriber, how much of that &#x2013; how much are you willing to push SAC higher in Latin America in terms of the eventual return? I know you spoke about IRR, so if you can kind of help us out with that, because clearly we are looking at local currency versus U.S., and we are just getting the U.S. translated numbers? That would be helpful.</p>
          <p>Separately, Mike, I was wondering if you had any comment on the hearing on the FCC rule-making process one way or the other? It was something I'm sure you are watching closely. Can you come down on either side in terms of the comment period, if you can share that with us?</p>
          <p>And lastly Bruce, on Netflix in Latin America we are hearing that trends there are getting tougher for online players, which seems somewhat kind of intuitive given the low broadband penetration there. And I know you spoke at your Investor Day about not seeing this as a major competitor. If you can update us there on what the trends there are doing that would be helpful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With respect to the LTV issue and the trade-off between SAC and LTV, obviously the SAC is very different for a high-end customer than for a low-end customer, and it's a relationship that we try to manage. I certainly am not incented to increase my SAC costs. Probably the only thing that forces you to do that is responding to the competition in the market. So it is a balance we try to strike. It's why we look at the IRR because it is very much an idea of how much we invest upfront to get a return over time and factoring in the churn of the profile of those customers. So all of those factors are factored in, and it's a relationship that we watch very closely.</p>
          <p>With respect to Netflix, I think you have to ask them how they are going there. I will say that I will repeat what I said at the Investor Day which is that delivering video over the internet in Latin America is considerably more challenging than it is in the United States, not only because fewer people have broadband connections, but the quality of the broadband is much lower. And when people say they have broadband, they really are often talking about speeds well below 1 MB. So there is a number of challenges that we think are structural that will remain in place for some quite some time, and therefore that's why we have a very modest view of what the near-term potential of video over the internet is in Latin America.</p>

          <p>Tuna, it's Mike. When you say they hearing on the FCC, since there are a number of topics in front of the FCC, which one were you specifically talking about?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was talking about the rulemaking process on the 2 GHz band spectrum that DISH has asked for a waiver and they have declined, and that is ongoing right now, the comment period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not sure we have made a final decision whether to comment or not. It's really not &#x2013; it's kind of up to the commission to look at. My sense is that the commission's public policy interest is to ensure that spectrum is used, and used effectively for America. So in general, my guess is they will be focused on how they ensure that that spectrum is going to be used. And if it's going to be used, I am sure they will be fine with whatever they have to look at.</p>

          <p>We will take our last question from Jason Bazinet with Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I just have a question for Mr. White. I think in the past you guys have kicked around the notion of being a bit more balanced in terms of your capital returns to include both dividends and buybacks. I was just wondering if you can share with us what sort of feedback you've received from the buy side as you chatted with the owners of DIRECTV in terms of their predisposition? Any early thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, every time &#x2013; I do as you probably know ask the question every time I meet with the buy side, just out of my own curiosity how they look at it. I have to say, while there are some that have dividend funds and non-dividend funds, I still look at it kind of through the efficiency lens and say to myself particularly with what is at least speculated to be the tax rates next year on dividends, it's kind of hard to justify doing dividends with that kind of tax policy. So I think we have to see what the tax policy is next year.</p>
          <p>Our board &#x2013; just from a process standpoint in the second half of the year just as a regular matter we do review our capital structure. I'm sure we'll have a conversation as we get towards 2013 and 2014 about what approach we should do. Whether it is share buyback or dividend or some of both. But I think it's premature for me to speculate where we'd come out other than to say I keep looking at it and say with an 8% free cash flow yield, with a borrowing cost that we just saw at amazingly all-time low interest rates &#x2013; I think net of inflation are probably negative and even without inflation are like 2% after tax &#x2013; that it's pretty attractive, frankly, if the market can't properly value our business from a multiple standpoint for us to keep buying back stock. I think that's the smartest thing for us to do for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>So that's the approach that we're taking and right at the moment. We'll always keep an eye on what's happening in Washington, D.C. and see if anything affects our thinking one way or the other. But I would say for right now that's our focus and we'll see what evolves for tax policies as we get to the end of the year.</p>
