          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Gilead Sciences second quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Chanel. Good afternoon, everyone. We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the quarter. The press release and earnings slides are available on our website.</p>
          <p>For our prepared remarks and Q&amp;A, I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, John Martin, our President and COO, John Milligan, our EVP of <mark type="audio gap" /> (00:45) and CSO, Norbert Bischofberger, our EVP of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young, and our CFO, Robin Washington.</p>
          <p>Before we begin our formal remarks, we want to remind you we will be making forward-looking statements that contain certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control. These risks include the possibility that our actual financial results may differ materially from the revised guidance we are presenting today, the possibility of unfavorable results from our clinical studies, including those evaluating GS-7977 and GS-5885 in various patient populations, and the possibility that we may be unable to complete our clinical studies and regulatory filings or obtain regulatory approval in the currently anticipated timeline.</p>
          <p>A description of these risks can be found in our latest SEC disclosure documents and our recent press releases. Gilead does not undertake any obligation to <mark type="audio gap" /> (1:40) statements made during this call.</p>
          <p>We also will be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our corporate website.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Robin Washington.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us today.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with our strong operating results for the second quarter. Product sales were $2.3 billion, an increase of 14% year over year and 5% sequentially. The U.S. contributed $1.4 billion of product sales, up 21% year over year, driven by strong, increased demand across all therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. the early release of Ryan White federal funds and the desire by states to reduce patient wait-lists have contributed to strong year-to-date non-retail performance. This may impact ADAP purchasing patterns in the second half of 2012. The state's efforts to reduce ADAP wait-lists are encouraging, resulting in a 60% reduction since the beginning of 2012. The current wait-lists are at a level not seen since mid-2010.</p>
          <p>Our U.S. performance also includes a new milestone for Letairis, which exceeded sales of $100 million in the second quarter. Europe contributed $786 million of product sales, up 3% year over year, driven by increased demand. From an expense standpoint, operating expenses increased to $729 million, up 24% year over year, due primarily to the continued advancement of our Product Development pipeline.</p>
          <p>Turning to other financial highlights, operating cash flows continue to be strong. During the quarter, operating cash flows were $1.3 billion, which includes the collection of $460 million of past-due accounts receivables in Spain, contributing to a 15-day improvement in our DSO, highlighted on slide 14.</p>
          <p>$350 million of bank debt was repaid this quarter, and since January 2012, a total of $700 million has been repaid, which further deleveraged the balance sheet and will help achieve a targeted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x by mid-2013.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, $241 million or 4.8 million shares of common stock were repurchased and retired.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are updating certain aspects of the full-year 2012 guidance as outlined on slide 17. Net product sales are now expected to be $8.8 billion to $9.0 billion, an increase of $200 million from the prior range. Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses are expected to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion due to accelerated clinical studies in liver disease and oncology. All other aspects of our guidance remain unchanged.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to John Martin.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with the continued strong demand for our products and maturation of the pipeline.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, two successful FDA advisory committee meetings were held, one on the use of Truvada for PrEP and one on Quad for the treatment of HIV infection. Just last week, FDA approved Truvada for prevention of sexual transmission of HIV in high-risk individuals. This is the first approval of an antiretroviral for pre-exposure prophylaxis, providing another option in the fight against the HIV pandemic.</p>
          <p>The U.S. government's commitment to HIV prevention, diagnosis, and treatment was also demonstrated by the approval of the first over-the-counter HIV test.</p>
          <p>The next U.S. regulatory milestone is the upcoming August 27 PDUFA date for Quad, and our scientific and commercial teams are well prepared for the launch. European Union approval of Quad is anticipated in the first half of 2013.</p>
          <p>This past quarter, NDAs and MAAs for cobicistat and elvitegravir were submitted, and this week, the International AIDS Conference is taking place in Washington, D.C. Gilead presented three noteworthy abstracts at this conference. One was on 96-week data from study 145 indicating that Elvitegravir was non-inferior to ritonavir when added to optimized background therapy in treatment-experienced patients.</p>
          <p>In addition, 48-week data from the Phase 3 study comparing cobicistat to ritonavir, each in combination with atazanavir and Truvada, showed that cobicistat was non-inferior to ritonavir. And lastly, the SPIRIT study showed that switching completely suppressed patients from a PI-containing regimen to the once-daily Complera single-tablet regimen was non-inferior to patients maintaining PI regimens.</p>
          <p>Finally, rapid progress has been made with the HCV research program, and we now have a comprehensive Phase 3 development program. Norbert will cover that in his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John.</p>
          <p>Before I get to HCV, I would like to state that multiple programs have advanced across all therapeutic areas. In HIV, two Phase II studies were progressed, which evaluate the safety and efficacy of two single-tablet regimens containing a novel <mark type="ph" /> prologue (7:30) of tenofovir GS-7340.</p>
          <p>One trial, which is now fully enrolled, compares a single-tablet regiment of elvitegravir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, GS-7340 to Quad, and the other study, which should complete enrollment by the end of August, compares a single-tablet regimen of darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine, GS-7340 to the single components of darunavir, cobicistat, and Truvada.</p>
          <p>In oncology, two Phase 3 clinical trials of GS-1101 for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been initiated. These studies in a placebo-controlled fashion compare GS-1101 added to either rituximab or to rituximab and bendamustine in relapsed refractory CLL patients.</p>
          <p>My remaining comments will focus on hepatitis C, where progress has been rapid.</p>
          <p>At the EASL conference earlier this year, data were disclosed from two Phase II studies of a 12-week course of GS-7977 and Ribavirin in Genotype 1 infected treatment-naive patients. In the Electron study, the SVR-4 rate in Genotype 1 naive patients was 88%, or 22 out of 25 patients. And in the Quantum study, the SVR-4 rate in Genotype 1 treatment-naive patients was 53% or 10 out of 19 patients.</p>
          <p>I would now like to provide an update on new data from two Phase II studies evaluating 24 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and Ribavirin in treatment-naive Genotype 1 infected patients.</p>
          <p>In the Quantum study, 19 Genotype 1 patients were randomized to receive 24 weeks of GS-7977 and Ribavirin. Of those 19 patients, 10, or 53%, achieved an SVR-4. The second trial is conducted by the NIID in a cohort of Genotype 1 infected, predominantly African-American patients, a population which has historically been more difficult to treat. In that study, of the first 9 patients who completed 24 weeks of treatment with GS &#x2013; with 7977 and ribavirin &#x2013; all 9, or 100%, achieved SVR-4.</p>
          <p>These results from the Quantum and NIID studies are included in slides 31 and 32 of earnings slide deck. In summary, in the various Phase II cohorts, treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin for 12 or 24 weeks was &#x2013; in Genotype 1 infected patients &#x2013; resulted in SVR-4 rates between 53% and 100%.</p>
          <p>In May and June of this year, discussions were held with the U.S. FDA and three European regulatory agencies, and agreement has been achieved on a comprehensive Phase III development plan for GS-7977, and on a Phase 3 plan for GS-7977 in combination with the NS5A inhibitor, GS-5885.</p>
          <p>The initial NDA and MAA filings will be for GS-7977 and will include data from four Phase III studies, three conducted in Genotype 2 and Genotype 3 infected patients, and one in Genotype 1 infected patients. The three Genotype 2/3 studies are Fission, Positron, and Fusion.</p>
          <p>Fission is the first study in 500 Genotype 2/3 naive patients, comparing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin to the current standard of care of 24 weeks of treatment with Peginterferon and ribavirin. The second study, Positron, is comparing 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin in 240 Genotype 2/3 interferon-intolerant or ineligible patients to placebo. And thirdly, Fusion is a study in 200 Genotype 2/3 treatment-experienced patients exploring 12 weeks or 16 weeks duration of treatment with GS-7977 and ribavirin.</p>
          <p>All three trials, Fission, Positron, and Fusion are now fully involved, and the last patient in these studies has started dosing just today.</p>
          <p>A fourth Phase III study called Neutrino is a single-arm study evaluating a 12-week course of GS-7977, peginterferon, and ribavirin in 300 Genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 infected patients. Screening in the Neutrino study is completed, and the last patient should start dosing by mid-August.</p>
          <p>This same regimen, 12 weeks of GS-7977, peginterferon, and ribavirin was evaluated previously in Genotype 1 patients in a Phase II study called Atomic, and resulted in SVR-4 rate of 92%. These four Phase 3 studies are outlined on slides 33 and 34 in our earnings slide deck.</p>
          <p>With these four Phase 3 studies under way, we anticipate being able to file for regulatory approvals for GS-7977 by the middle of next year. If successful, the initial indication will be for 12 weeks to 16 weeks of treatment, with GS-7977 and ribavirin in Genotype 2/3 infected patients, and for 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 peginterferon and ribavirin in Genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6 infected patients.</p>
          <p>In parallel, we're also advancing GS-7977 in combination with GS-5885 for the treatment of Genotype 1 infected patients. GS-7977 and GS-5885 were successfully co-formulated into a single-pill, fixed-dose combination. The IND on this fixed-dose combination was filed a month ago, and a Phase I study evaluating the bioavailability was initiated last week. If the Phase I data show that the fixed-dose combination results in adequate exposures of GS-7977 and GS-5885, we expect to initiate a Phase III study with this fixed-dose combination in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>This Phase III study is planned as a four-arm, randomized trial in 800 patients evaluating a fixed-dose combination with or without ribavirin for either 12 or 24 weeks, in treatment-naive Genotype 1 infected patients. The study will contain an interim futility analysis after the first 200 patients, or 50 per arm, have been enrolled. An independent data safety and monitoring board will evaluate the SVR-4 rates of the 12-week treatment arms. If the pre-defined response rates are met, then the remaining 600 patients will be subsequently enrolled.</p>
          <p>At the time of this interim analysis, additional data will be available from the ELECTRON study on 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and GS-5885 and ribavirin in Genotype 1 non-responders and Genotype 1 naive cohorts, as well as 12-week data from the ongoing BMS study of GS-7977 and daclatasvir with or without ribavirin.</p>
          <p>All these data will allow us to decide on the design of the second confirmatory study supporting the filing of GS-7977, 5885 fixed-dose combination. If treatment of Genotype 1 infected patients with the fixed-dose combination, GS-7977, 5885, for 12 weeks results in acceptable, high SVR-4 rates, then the second confirmatory study could be initiated in the first half of 2013. The fixed-dose combination regulatory filings could, in that case, follow the initial GS-7977 filings a year later by mid-2014.</p>
          <p>The development strategy for the GS-7977, GS-5885 fixed-dose combination is outlined in slide 36 of our slide deck.</p>
          <p>In summary, a number of programs have been advanced across therapeutic areas. GS-7340 co-formulated in two single-tablet regimens is advancing in Phase II. GS1101 is advancing in Phase 3. And notably, four Phase 3 study evaluating GS-7977 in Genotype 1 through Genotype 6 HCV infected patients are fully involved, and the NDA and MAA are on track to be filed by the middle of next year.</p>
          <p>Finally, we plan to advance the fixed-dose combination of GS-7977 and 5885 currently in Phase I clinical testing into Phase 3 in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In closing, this is a remarkable start to 2012, with strong commercial and financial performance, and significant progress with the R&amp;D pipeline. We would like to thank our employees for their continued dedication in contributing to these efforts.</p>
          <p>At this time, the call will open to Q&amp;A. Chanel?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges, Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for letting me jump in with a question. Congratulations on a remarkable quarter.</p>
          <p>Norbert, I have to ask the obvious question, which is are there differences between the patients in the two Phase II trial arms that you reported for 7977/ribavirin/Genotype 1 that would explain the gap between 53% and 100%? Anything that you see in either how the studies were conducted, the compliance or anything else that would explain that? Or should we just split the difference? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Geoff, unfortunately I don't have a clear-cut answer for you. Of course, we looked at all the obvious baseline imbalances. There wasn't anything there.</p>
          <p>It seems like at this point really the Quantum study seems to be outlier. We're seeing better results in Electron and also better results in the NIID study, and as I said in my script that's a population where you actually would have expected lower response rates, and yet we get 100%.</p>
          <p>So I do not understand it. It's a thing of small numbers, and where the ultimate truth lies, I don't know.</p>
          <p>But either way, I think these numbers are actually a huge improvement with a very simplified shortened all-oral regimen over where we are today. And that's also reflected by the way when we talk to regulatory authorities, that they allowed us to do single-arm studies with no control arm. That's a reflection that even regulatory authorities think that the standard of care control arms are not really worth including anymore in Phase 3 clinical studies.</p>
          <p>So sorry, Geoff, I don't have a really good answer to your question. It's something we've looked into, but we don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much. Appreciate it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Another one on the hep C franchise.</p>
          <p>Norbert, when I look at slide 36 with the 7977-7585 Phase 3 design, with the second confirmatory study, it says TBD. So can we assume that you won't be able to use any 7977 Riba studies alone? Or do you plan to do that over any duration, 12-week or 24-week, as part of the regulatory strategy? Or is that sort of off the table at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Geoff, our current working assumption is that the data that Bristol-Myers generated their study will be replicated in our studies.</p>
          <p>We have made this argument before that from a virological point of view, the daclatasvir and GS-5885 were very similar, and there's no reason to expect a different result. So if that's the case, then obviously the second study might be a single-arm study that looks at the fixed-dose combination, either with or without ribavirin, for either 12 weeks or 24 weeks, depending on how those data come out.</p>
          <p>So that's what our current thinking is. We do not currently think that GS-7977-ribavirin will be included, because GS-7977 with 5885 has &#x2013; is virologically more potent, and moreover, has the advantage of being much safer and one pill, once daily. So it's the ultimate frontier in HCV therapy. That's what we want to pursue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that, when you run the interim analysis, or you get that data, could you start the second confirmatory study to save some time? What sort of shortcuts do you feel like you can make, or what sort of amendments can you make to accelerate an all-oral filing, do you think, until maybe to the end of 2013, not mid-2014?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Geoff, the interim analysis, as I said, is on the &#x2013; first, on the 12-week treatment arm. So if the 12-week treatment arm shows high response rates, then, of course, we would immediately be in a position to initiate the second confirmatory study as a very simple, perhaps single-arm, 12-week-duration fixed-dose combination, plus or minus ribavirin.</p>
          <p>And keep in mind, as I said in my script, we also have data from two cohorts in the Electron study available at that time, that look at 12 weeks of treatment with GS-7977 and 5885 in ribavirin in both non-responders and naive patients. I think with the totality of those data, it should be fairly straightforward to design the second Phase 3 study.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I think you've answered a lot of the hep C questions but I want to be clear. So regulatory agencies don't want to see any control versus an interferon arm, so we should expect your competitors as well to have similar designs?</p>
          <p>And then also to clarify, the population here, this is just treatment-naive? There's no category around interferon intolerance?</p>
          <p>And then as a totally separate question, on 7340, can you just give us a set of what antiviral efficacy &#x2013; or excuse me &#x2013; what kind of differential you need to see? Are you looking primarily around bone-marrow density? What would be a good outcome there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rachel, so the first question you asked for is about Neutrino. Of course, I can't speak for our competitors, but I would assume that the same concept that regulators communicated to us is also applicable to them.</p>
          <p>So whatever in the future Phase 3 studies are going to be done, might be much simpler studies that do not include a current standard of care control arm. That's the clear message we got, and that's why they allowed us to do that single-arm Phase III study that, by the way, is powered against historical controls.</p>
          <p>The second question you asked for is about 7340. So Rachel, as you may know, the monotherapy data were presented at the last CROI meeting, and we showed that 25 milligrams of 7340 actually has higher potency in terms of HIV RNA reductions compared to tenofovir 300 milligrams.</p>
          <p>Now, in a triple combination regimen, higher potency in my mind is almost impossible to show because all these triple combination therapy are very, very potent. They suppress the virus. So what we're hoping for is to show some benefit in terms of safety.</p>
          <p>And you pointed it out already &#x2013; one thing that we should be able to show is less of a PMD effect. And the other thing we're exploring is the use of 7340 in advanced &#x2013; in renal impairment, and maybe we can show some benefit there. But it's not quite clear.</p>
          <p>But the big thing, I think, about 7340 will be that physicians will just feel much more comfortable. They do not have to worry about whatever potential theoretical or hypothetical or real side effects there are. Don't worry about bone. Don't worry about renal. This is the same or higher potency at one-tenth the dose. So I think it would be a great addition to what we have today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Related to the 7977-5885 study just wondering if you have any sense from the FDA or EMA in terms of what they're looking for, for what would be an approvable SVR-12 bar, just given the lack of standard of care. And also any sense of the bar for your futility there?</p>
          <p>And then related on Neutrino, do you have any sense from payers about what kind of flexibility docs may have to prescribe 7977 if it's approved in Genotype 1 &#x2013; about the flexibility they would have to use it in interferon-free regimens, before you get the approval for the 5885 combo? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Brian, I'm happy to talk about the powering. By the way, the powering for all our Phase 3 studies is approximately a similar line of thinking.</p>
          <p>And so first of all, keep in mind that we will enroll in our study at least 20% cyrrotic patients. There has been some criticism by the medical community of previous development programs that have studied relatively healthy patients, and then the ultimate experience that physicians made was worse than what was observed in Phase 3 studies, because the more advanced very cyrrotic patients were not studied. We're not going to do that. So we have 20% target &#x2013; and by the way in our Fusion study, we have actually 30% cyrrotic patients. So that's number one.</p>
          <p>Number two, we calculated historically what would be an expected response rate in Genotype 1 in a population that is 20% cyrrotics. And the answer to that is if you look across a lot of telaprevir/boceprevir studies, the answer is 65% is the expected response rate.</p>
          <p>Now, regulators gave us a bonus. They said you don't have to even meet 65%. If you meet 60%, that will be perfectly fine, because you get the bonus for shorter treatment duration and better safety. So what we have to beat, in other words, is 60%, and I will point out that's a very low hurdle. If you look at the Atomic study, we have 93% &#x2013; 92% response rates.</p>
          <p>And so that's how the interim analysis is going to be conducted. If we see in the futility analysis less than 60% response rate, that will be considered futile. But if we see 60% or higher, that will be acceptable. And as I said, my expectation based on previous Phase II studies and also Bristol-Myers experience that we would see much higher numbers than 60%.</p>
          <p>I hope that answers your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I guess the second question was about the flexibility about using combinations.</p>
          <p>And so as you know, once 7977 is approved, doctors have the flexibility to prescribe it in the ways that they see fit. And I guess we could imagine that there may be other anti-virals approved that could be useful in combination with 7977 during an interim period before we have a fixed-dose combination out.</p>
          <p>My own feeling is that certainly treatment-naive patients &#x2013; and there's a bunch of things we don't understand here, including what the costs of the other therapy would be &#x2013; that in the treatment-naive patient, there would probably be more control over going to a peginterferon 12-week regimen. But in patients who can't take interferon for various reasons or have failed interferon, I can imagine the scenario where payers would allow those patients to be dosed by combination therapies.</p>
          <p>But we really have to see how the data play out in those areas too &#x2013; if there's anything to support those combinations or not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks very much for taking the question. So your Phase 3 with the combination 7977 and 5885 is contingent on this Phase I bioequivalence study. Norbert, can you give us a sense for whether or not there's any risk, or if this is a slam dunk sort of study where you would expect to get adequate exposures a priori?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on duration of therapy, it looks like at least in Quantum you didn't see any change in the efficacy, whether it was dosed at 12 weeks or 24 weeks. Do you think that there's any read-through to other regimens such as <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:23) combination, and whether or not you would expect to see any meaningful difference between 12 weeks and 24 weeks with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:30).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for your questions, Matt.</p>
          <p>So your first question had to do &#x2013; by the way, I want to state, it's not a bioequivalence study but a bioavailability study. Bioequivalence is very strictly defined by being equivalent to a test regimen. We don't have that here. We just want to make sure that roughly the levels of 7977 and 5885 are in the ballpark of what we have seen in the previous studies.</p>
          <p>And while it's always difficult to say what the risk is, I think both compounds, 7977 and 5885, are pharmaceutically well-behaved compounds. So we have diverse formulation, but needless to say, if this first formulation doesn't work out, of course we have backup formulations that we would then put into development. That would delay the program by two months or so.</p>
          <p>The other question you asked was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Duration of therapy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, duration of therapy. Again, I don't have an answer. Honestly, I do believe that there should be a difference in duration of therapy. Why we are not seeing that in Quantum, I do not know.</p>
          <p>And needless to say, we have looked at everything possible that we could look at. We have &#x2013; the compliance was not quite what it should have been in Quantum, although you know that's a difficult thing to measure.</p>
          <p>And the reason why I'm saying there should be a difference with regard to duration of therapy is simply because we have never observed breakthroughs. All our patients that have not &#x2013; that are non-responders are rebounders. So after you eliminate &#x2013; after you take 7977 away, or 7977 and ribavirin, then the virus comes back. During treatment, we've actually never seen breakthroughs.</p>
          <p>That's why I think 7977, by itself or with ribavirin, is a very potent, very effective agent. And if you can cure somebody with 12 weeks by going longer, you should actually get to better outcomes. But unfortunately, I only have the data that we have today, and I can't really speculate anymore.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So another &#x2013; predictably another hep C question.</p>
          <p>So just to be clear, on the interim analysis for the 5885 combination study for 7977, Norbert, is the hurdle rate there 60%, number one? Number two, how will &#x2013; will this passing of the interim analysis be something that will be explicitly communicated to everyone when it happens?</p>
          <p>And then maybe finally, on if you could talk a little more about your FDA discussions? And was it principally the Bristol combination data that got the FDA comfortable going forward with this design? Or are there other data that they saw as part of your discussions that tied it all together? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marshall, the interim analysis &#x2013; let me say it again. We want to beat a response rate of 60%. So if 65% is the expected response rate with the current standard of care, telaprevir/boceprevir, we get a 5% bonus.</p>
          <p>So we want to beat 60%. That means the lower bound of our 95% confidence interval has to be 60% or higher. And if we see a point estimate that's less than 60%, so let's say we see 59%, that would mean we only have a 5% chance of achieving our goal. I hope I was clear in what I said.</p>
          <p>So 59% or lower would be futile to show superiority. 60% or higher would allow us to go forward.</p>
          <p>Then you had another question about the FDA. So the FDA, they were comfortable with the fact that we initiate a Phase 3 study but do an interim analysis after 200 patients. It's really the totality of the data plus the Bristol-Myers data, or own virology data, and the previous and current experience with 7977, even by itself or in combination with ribavirin, that has made the FDA and three European regulatory agencies comfortable with this approach.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Hopefully you can answer this question. If you don't, I hope I get to ask you another one. But on the Quantum 24-week data that you reported, which had the 53%, do you know the IL28B breakdown? If I recall, in the 12-week, there was a lot of differences. They're harder to treat patients. So maybe that was the reason?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So generally in the Quantum study, the CC Genotype was not as high as in the Electron study. If I remember it correctly, it was 25% or 30%, and there was no difference between the 12-week arm and the 24-week arm. That is still true. But it was a little bit higher in the Electron but that doesn't account for the whole explanation, I would think.</p>
          <p>In my mind, if you ask me to speculate, it has to do with study conduct. And remember, the Quantum study was a study where patients actually were blinded on treatment assignment. They were taking 938 or placebo. They were informed that there was a liver toxicity issue with 938, and maybe that could have influenced somewhat the study conduct and the compliance. So that if you ask me to speculate, that's probably the best I can come up with, although we can't substantiate that currently from our data.</p>

          <p>When do you think you'll be able to file for the fixed-dose combination &#x2013; file for approval? Is the single trial enough or are you going to need both trials? And I guess what kind of timeline are you expecting for that first fixed-dose combination trial? I'm obviously talking about the NS5A plus 7977. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yeah, Mark, since this is a new chemical entity &#x2013; it contains a new product &#x2013; we need two Phase 3 study &#x2013; two confirmatory &#x2013; one confirmatory Phase 3 study and one other Phase 3. So the current timelines, if everything works out and if everything goes without a glitch, roughly the filing for the fixed-dose combination would follow one year behind the 7977 filing, which would then be middle of 2014. That's our best guess currently.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick &#x2013; maybe Robin, in case you're still in the room, because nobody cares about financials anymore <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:27). Quick question on &#x2013; so you beat roughly by $100 million but you're raising by $200 million. And I'm going to try to make it in one sentence, one question. What's the difference? How much of inventory stocking did you see? And were the strengths unusually strong in Europe relative to your expectation? Thanks. That was one question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yaron, I'll answer it. Overall, we saw strong non-retail demand in the whole second half.</p>
          <p>Remember, if you recall Kevin talked last quarter about the fact we expected some reduction in Q2. While we saw some of that, it wasn't as much as what we had anticipated. So we do potentially see some inventory runoff happening in the second half.</p>
          <p>All that being said, we're balancing that with the fact that we clearly know that the states are trying to reduce overall wait-lists.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll just add to that, Yaron. Q2 was pretty strong. It was not as high as Q1, but it was as good as Q4 of last year. So that was pretty strong, and certainly far stronger than Q2 of 2011. So it quite surprised us. Puerto Rico, Illinois were particularly big in their purchases.</p>
          <p>I think at the moment, Yaron, there is quite a lot of confidence in HIV right now. The budgets went out early. You saw just about a week ago that the remaining $75 million was allocated, so pretty much all of the budget bar $6 million has gone out now. So the states know what they're working with vis-a-vis the federal funds.</p>
          <p>It's quite remarkable to see the wait-list now down to 1,800. That's over 80% from its peak at 9,200.</p>
          <p>So I think there's a sense of &#x2013; there's a sense of greater confidence, desire to get the wait-list down. The mantra of test/treat/retain is very strong right now. You saw the comments coming out of the World AIDS Meeting. So I think people will recognize that treatment is the right way to go for the individual, and it's the right way to go for prevention. And there is a sense of momentum there that I don't think was there this time last year.</p>

          <p>Since all this macro good news coming out with guidelines, do you think the new-start market will be growing? I think before you said it was around 50,000 a year. Would you expect it to go up?</p>

          <p>I think the remarkable thing about HIV is it's being so consistent, and that's through guideline changes and it's through more data, single-tablet regimens. And it's just got this remarkable robustness and consistency about it.</p>
          <p>So there might be some small tick-up, but I think the reassuring thing is it's just been remarkably &#x2013; just been remarkably consistent. And I think that's the way we see it going forward.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and congrats on another strong quarter.</p>
          <p>The 12-week arms in the Bristol 7977 study started enrolling real early this year, I think, and its status recently updated to no-longer-recruiting. And that would suggest a decent chunk of patients might be out some number of weeks, post-treatment in the 12-week arms. So I was just wondering if you're comfortable saying &#x2013; are you making any inferences from that on relapse or lack thereof that make it worthwhile to include 12-week arms in the Phase 3 study that you're announcing? In other words, is it informed on that at all yet?</p>

          <p>Thanks, and congratulations on a great quarter. I had a question on the HIV front, specifically 7340.</p>
          <p>Given how close you were in the 102 trial to achieving superiority, I'm just curious why you're not pursuing a trial of potentially adequate size as part of the Phase 3 program to get a superiority claim? I guess if we learned anything, you guys were close in 102, and maybe another 100 patients and I guess applying the Glaxo strategy could get you over that threshold.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ian, thanks for the question. Of course, Ian, we would, of course, try and be superior. But as you know, most of these non-inferiority/superiority trials &#x2013; so the non-responders in HIV studies &#x2013; a large part of those are either discontinuations due to adverse event or lost to follow-up.</p>
          <p>And there aren't that many virological failures. The few that there are, you always wonder, they're probably due to non-compliance, more than due to inherent limitations of the potency of the regimen.</p>
          <p>So I just think the lost to follow-up and discontinuation due to adverse events and non-compliance, those are kind of generic things that haunt you in any study. And I think by having 7340 in the regimen, I'm not sure whether you would &#x2013; whether that would not address those issues. And I'm not sure whether you would see superiority.</p>
          <p>But needless to say, of course, it's a good idea. That's what we're, of course, attempting to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask a quick question with the approval of the Quad hopefully coming up. How does that patient population differ versus the dynamics associated with Complera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we've always said the opportunity we have with Quad is to go after the majority of new starts. So we'll have data both &#x2013; we do have data from 102 and 103 versus Atripla, and versus the protease inhibitors.</p>
          <p>So essentially we're able to position Quad against the current almost nine out of ten patients who are starting on those two third agents, either with Truvada or as part of Complera, part of Atripla. So that's a bigger slice of the naive pie than currently Complera operates in.</p>
          <p>I think we've seen some very, very high response rates at 88% and 90% with the Quad. Two very well controlled studies. We'll have to see, but I think we are hopeful that Quad would go into guidelines &#x2013; into the U.S. guidelines fairly quickly.</p>
          <p>So I think that would give more opportunity for the Quad than we have today with Complera. Having said that, Complera is starting to do very well.</p>
          <p>So I think our expectation is that the first single-tablet regimen becomes the Quad, and then the second single-tablet regimen becomes Complera.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a really solid Phase 3 plan for 7977. I just want to kind of get some color on eventful pan-genotypic strategy. I know you've said in the past that 5885 won't be developed in GT3 due to the potency shift.</p>
          <p>When I look at slide 36 on the Phase 3 fixed-dose combo study, especially in the arms including ribavirin, it just seems to me you already have a pan-genotypic regimen with those three drugs right now. Why wouldn't you think about just expanding the study to include all comers, and potentially moving ribavirin to a once-daily dose? It would seem like the activity Riba has in GT 3 would make up for any miss in 5885, and 5885 would make up for any of the weakness in Riba in the Genotype 1 population. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, that's a hypothetical possibility.</p>
          <p>You may remember the Bristol-Myers data that were presented at EASL where they saw 100% response rates in Genotype 1. They saw lower response rates in other Genotypes. So clearly 7977 daclatasvir is not as good in non-genotype 1 patients.</p>
          <p>That's also by the way completely consistent with the virology data. And our own virology data on 5885 would actually indicate that 5885 would really not be suitable for Genotype 2. We see a lot of polymorphs there where GS-5885 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:07) activity.</p>
          <p>So I agree &#x2013; I know what you're saying. You're saying that you have 7977 and ribavirin for Genotype 2, but then you have a drug in there, 5885, which doesn't really do much in Genotype 2.</p>
          <p>So to make a long story short, we have other strategies that will come as kind of the third wave. And we're working on other nucleosides, and we have some very interesting pan-genotypic compounds in two other classes in pre-clinical development that will soon go into the clinic.</p>
          <p>That's what we're thinking about then the ultimate regimen will be. Two drugs. It could be an NS5A <mark type="ph" /> or a PI (50:50) or a nuke combined with 7977. That would truly be a good pan-genotypic regimen. That's our goal and plan.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question on the quantum data, you had mentioned I think in response to a question that you had done some assessments of compliance in Quantum, and that there were lower rates there, and maybe relative to the other studies that have been done with 7977 and ribavirin. Can you give us a sense of how poorly compliant those patients were in Quantum and what it looks like in the other studies, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Tom, the other thing you have to remember, in Electron and in the NIID study, these were single-site studies where like <mark type="ph" /> Ed Gain (51:40) in the Electron study, he knows every patient by name. He's in very close contact with them. The same at NIID. They're in very close contact with their patients, whereas in Quantum is more of a large-center study.</p>
          <p>So we have looked at the measure of compliance in Quantum was simply a self-reported did you take your drug? And as you know, that's somewhat less than reliable. And we have seen low report rates. It's just the question is how much of that do you believe? It would be nice to have somewhat more &#x2013; like plasma levels are the ultimate things that don't lie that you can't hide behind. And we just don't have those data.</p>
          <p>But, Tom, we would move forward with the Phase 3 study, and the Phase 3 studies, we will see what the true response rates are. So I'm not too worried about what is it with Quantum that we see lower rates than in the other studies. And I'm convinced in the Phase 3 study, we would see higher than what we saw in Quantum. That's my own feeling.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congrats on the quarter. I wanted to just push a bit on the concept of confidence intervals, because we don't get much data bounded by confidence intervals. So on Quantum and the NIID study, do you have confidence intervals on those response rates?</p>
          <p>And I'm trying to understand in the interim, when you've got 50 patients per arm, what's the difference between a 59% point estimate that's futile and a 61%, when you think about the confidence intervals there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jim, we actually have done confidence intervals in Quantum and Electron, and one thing I can tell you is they're fairly large because the number is so small.</p>
          <p>So typically, if you have like 10 or 20 patients, and you see a 50% response rate, the 95% confidence interval will go from 20% to 80%. So plus 30%, minus 30%. That's how large the confidence intervals are, so it's not very informative.</p>
          <p>So with regards to the interim analysis, I want to say it again, so our goal is to be superior to 60%. So in other words, the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval at the end of the study has to be 60% or higher.</p>
          <p>So if we see 59% in the interim analysis as the point estimate, that means we will have only a 5% chance of ever making that, and that would then be a futile attempt. So 59% or lower, we would say, this is futile to reach this point. At 60% or higher, we would say it's possible.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Norbert, can I push on that a bit? I guess what I'm trying to understand is if you're trying to hit a lower bound that's above 60%, shouldn't your point estimate be way higher than that?</p>
          <p>And I guess where I'm coming from is 59% suggests that less than 5% chance to hit your end point &#x2013; what's your chance of hitting your endpoint if the point estimate is 61%? Because presumably there's still a pretty wide confidence interval that's going to go well below 60%. That's what I'm trying to understand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Jim, in order to reach the lower bound of 60 or higher, the point estimate calculation is 66%. So if we have &#x2013; if at the end of the study, in 800 patients, the point estimate is 66%, then the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval is 60. So it goes from 60% to 72%, the 95% confidence interval.</p>
          <p>With regards to your second point, I completely agree. But keep in mind, this is such a low bar that I do not believe this will ever be an issue. I mean this shows you how low the bar is.</p>
          <p>Like in Atomic, we had the same power calculation. We want to be at least 67% point estimate. But we were at 92%. And I'm convinced in this 5885/7977 study we will see a similar result.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You've done a good job identifying a Phase 3 program for Genotype 1 treatment-naive patients. I think the last thing we're waiting for is a Phase 3 program for Genotype 1 treatment-experienced patients. Can you give us some sense of what your preliminary thinking is there? And when we could get a more definitive Phase 3 program structure for that population?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I didn't get into this, but we decided with the first filing for GS-7977 by middle of next year, we would not include Genotype I treatment-experienced patients. And the reason is, as you may remember, we presented Electron data &#x2013; I think it was somewhere before EASL &#x2013; where we saw about a 10% response rate in the non-responders. That's just too low.</p>
          <p>We will however, of course, include treatment-experienced patients in our GS-5885/7977 program. I didn't talk about that today, but that would, of course, be another Phase 3 study that we would do, because this compound combination of the two should actually be a great compound to look at experienced patients.</p>
          <p>As I said in the Electron, there's one cohort of Genotype 1 non-responders, so that will give us the proof or the confidence that this is worth doing, and we will include that in the Phase 3 program.</p>
          <p>There's, by the way, a lot of other studies that I've not talked about that will be included that includes special population transplants, HIV co-infection. It goes without saying that this will be a comprehensive program. I just touched on the main Phase 3 studies today to give you some sense as to what the main body of information is.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you speak to what will be going on right behind 5885 with some of your other anti-virals like 9669 in combination with 7977? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we are currently doing a number of again small cohort within Electron, looking at 9669 with 7977. We're looking at our protease inhibitor with <mark type="ph" /> 9669 7977.</p>
          <p>But as I said, the real goal is something we haven't really disclosed or talked about &#x2013; is pangenotypic classes. And one of them &#x2013; we have other nucleosides that we're working on that could be combined with 7977. We have NS5A inhibitors that are potentially pan-genotypic, and we have protease inhibitors.</p>
          <p>And that's just something now that we have &#x2013; we're clear on what the first NDA filing looks like. We have now decided on the second filing. Now we can seriously start thinking about or formalizing a plan to move ahead with our third Phase, and the third Phase would clearly be a one-pill, once-daily, maybe 12-week course for all genotypes. That's our goal still. And we're very close.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="26" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Another HIV question, actually. Just to follow up on the earlier comment that you made about elvitegravir. I'm wondering, given what you said about non-compliance and those sorts of things, do you view that drug as a threat? Obviously it showed superiority. But is that meaningful at all, when you look at the market down the road, once Quad's on the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So just a quick comment on the superiority.</p>
          <p>No, actually, if you compare the data response rates on the <mark type="ph" /> done elvitegravir (61:44) arm, they were very similar to the Quad. We actually had 9%, they had 88%. And interestingly enough, the superiority was entirely driven by fairly high discontinuation rates due to adverse events on the Atripla arm. Those discontinuation rates are twice as high as we have seen in our own study, and they're also twice as high as other competitors like Merck has seen in their studies.</p>
          <p>So that's just a common &#x2013; it's a peculiar result, why in their study the discontinuation rates on Atripla were so high. They were 10%. In our studies, they were 5%.</p>
          <p>I'll let Kevin answer the other part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="27" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Joel, I think we take all forms of competition very seriously.</p>
          <p>One thing to point out is that, with an expectation that the agent would be co-formulated with  Epsicom, Epsicom only gets right now 4% of naive patients. So it really is hardly used in the naive treatment setting. And even though it was elevated in the recent <mark type="ph" /> IX (63:02) guidelines, it's not associated with all the third agents, as is Truvada.</p>
          <p>So we do think that the preferred regimen for an integrase inhibitor is the Quad. The results are very good. The results are published. I'll go back to the point I made about hopefully early entry into treatment guidelines.</p>
          <p>And we don't exactly know the timelines of the competition, but we probably have about a year head-start on the market, and with an expanded field force, which is trained and ready for the PDUFA date, we're going to try to make the most of that.</p>
          <p>So we do think we have an excellent opportunity, coming out first with a single-tablet regimen of an integrase inhibitor.</p>
