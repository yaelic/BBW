          <p>Hi, thank you, Deanna. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.honeywell.com/investor.</p>
          <p>Note that elements of today's presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that light.</p>
          <p>This morning, we will review our financial results for the fourth quarter and 2010, as well as share with you our updated guidance for the first quarter and full year 2011; and of course, allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. We had a strong finish to 2010, capping just a great year for Honeywell. Our result this year reinforced that our strategy is working, having great positions in good industries, the power of One Honeywell, our consistent focus on improving every year in each of our five initiatives. It really does make a difference.</p>
          <p>I was extremely proud of this team delivering through the worst recession in 80 years and now delivering in the recovery with record segment margins and free cash flow. We've demonstrated we are a stronger and smarter company, with a very good start to achieving the five-year targets we outlined last February.</p>
          <p>Sales in the quarter were $9 billion, up 12% reported and 10% organic, with continued growth in new products, geographic expansion, and strong momentum across the portfolio. While we've seen the biggest improvement in our early cycle businesses, and that includes Turbo, which added approximately $3 billion of additional platform wins last year, our longer cycle businesses are really kicking in. Process Solutions increased backlog 26% last year and had double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Aerospace's commercial aftermarkets saw spares orders increase 25%, significantly outpacing flight hours. And we generated pro forma earnings of $0.87 a share, ahead of guidance.</p>
          <p>Segment margin rates expanded 50 basis points in the year, even as we covered the reinstatement of some labor related costs. We're focused on controlling our fixed costs with OEF, organization efficiency, which concentrates on having the best people organized the right way and motivated, while also decreasing every year our OEF costs as a percentage of sales. It's a simple, but effective strategy of increasing sales while controlling fixed costs. It works, and our key process initiatives, or enablers in effect, accelerated.</p>
          <p>Our growth continues ahead of our markets because of the seed planting we've done for new products and services and new geographies, while always staying focused on doing a great job for the customer every day.</p>
          <p>Our investments and focus in all the emerging regions are really paying off with a number of impressive customer wins in 2010. We've done very well in China, as evidenced by the sizable wins, and the backlog we're building in the region, including COMAC's selection to provide four systems on the C919 commercial aircraft, and that yields over $11 billion in lifetime value. Our successes in China will further enable accelerated sales growth in the region.</p>
          <p>UOP's recent Petrobras award is another great example of our emerging region growth. Petrobras selected UOP technology to produce high quality diesel fuel from Brazilian national crude oils at two new refineries, and also, selected UOP to be the front-end engineering design or feed contractor, strengthening our capabilities globally.</p>
          <p>Our emerging region opportunity is huge, and we'll continue to resource it. The seed planting we've done there will continue to accelerate our growth profile. And we now have over 44,000 employees in emerging regions.</p>
          <p>We've also been selected for a number of new and derivative high value commercial aircraft platforms. Customers continue to select Honeywell over a field of avionics competitors, citing the company's technology and product differentiation as the key deciding factor. In 2010, we won 50% of the business avionics contracts we pursued, making Honeywell the clear share winner.</p>
          <p>That competitive spirit is evident across all our businesses. I just spent three days with our top 300 leaders from around the world, where we concentrated almost exclusively on building on our strengths this year, 2012, and beyond. There is a lot of momentum coming out of 2010, with positive order rates across the entire company.</p>
          <p>The seed planting we have been doing for the past nine years has clearly been paying off, and we believe we're still in the beginning stages of seeing the benefits. Our key process initiatives, emerging region expansion, our disciplined acquisitions process, and new products and services are all seeds that we have planted and continue to plant to improve our growth, productivity, and cash flow.</p>
          <p>We have the right leadership team in place to deliver even better results. And I've asked all of our business leaders to remain flexible because you never know what can happen economically in times like these; but to also aim high. With the great positions we have in good industries, and the continued improvement we're seeing in the global economy, we are confident in our outlook for higher revenues, segment margin expansion, strong cash flow, and 20%-plus earnings growth in 2011.</p>
          <p>And today, I'm also pleased to have the opportunity to tell you we've entered into an agreement to sell the CPG business to Rank Group, a New Zealand-based private investment company with a track record of investing and building upon established franchises like CPG. This is a good outcome for both Honeywell and CPG, as we found a buyer that recognizes the value of CPG and is intent on further developing the already strong consumer car care platforms in the space. Dave will take you through more details in a moment, but we think the smart deployment of CPG sales proceeds into repositioning, share buyback, and pension contributions will deliver terrific long-term value to our customers and share owners. And in Transportation Systems, our strong advantages in cost, technology, and flawless launches will result in terrific future performance from those TS businesses.</p>
          <p>So in summary, another better than expected quarter, a strong finish to 2010, which gives us confidence to raise our earnings outlook for 2011 to $3.60 to $3.80 per share, up from $3.50 to $3.70 per share. Notably, our performance in 2010 and 2011 is tracking ahead of the five-year targets we laid out last February. While we like what we've done, we're even more excited about our prospects for the future.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me turn it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide number four, entitled Fourth Quarter 2010 Results. As you can see, and as we discussed, reported sales for the quarter were up 12% to $9 billion, 10% organic growth in the quarter. And to put that in context, it's a new quarterly organic growth record for Honeywell, so very impressive. We saw greater than expected organic growth in every region: the Americas and Europe, up 9% and 11%, respectively; China up over 20% in ACS, Turbo, and Specialty Materials. Acquisitions contributed on the reported side an additional 3%. Currency was a slight headwind of about 1% negative.</p>
          <p>Segment profit for the quarter was up 4%. Segment margins, at 14.2%, reflected good productivity in the quarter, overcoming approximately $160 million of labor related segment cost &#x2013; segment headwinds that resulted from actions that we took in '09 that did not repeat in '10. And as I take you through the business segment highlights, you'll see the impact of these policy related actions affecting the year-over-year margin comparisons in the fourth quarter, consistent with what we guided for the quarter. However, just to remind you, on a full-year basis, three of the four businesses had terrific good sales conversion, and expanded their margins in '10.</p>
          <p>Pro forma earnings for the quarter, EPS up 5%; of course, that excludes the impact of the fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment, which turned out to be about $0.40, so reported EPS of $0.47 in the quarter. And as you can see, the MTM adjustment is considerably lower than the estimate we gave you back in November, due primarily to higher asset returns and also, a higher discount rate at year-end versus the original assumptions that we shared with you in November, and then also included in our December guidance.</p>
          <p>The better-than-expected earnings performance was driven by higher sales, better productivity, with repositioning and other items flattish on a year-over-year basis. Free cash flow, which includes a $600 million cash contribution to the U.S. pension plan in the fourth quarter, was really solid. I'll take you through the full-year numbers on the next slide. But as Dave mentioned, we had another year of record free cash flow, reflecting higher cash earnings, and also, record working capital turns.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide five, entitled Full Year 2010 Results; the 2010 sales up 3% to 33.4 billion, reflecting again good organic growth, as well as margin expansion. Aerospace, which we're going to cover in a minute, absorbed over $100 million in payments to BGA OE customers in the year to offset pre-production costs on major platform wins. For the year, we had 7% organic growth, reflecting improving end market conditions, and terrific execution across each of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Segment profit for the year increased 13%, which really underscores the organization's ability to leverage our fixed cost base, as Dave referenced, by expanding our margins 50 basis points over '09, despite the labor inflation headwinds. Pro forma net income, that is excluding the impact of the pension mark-to-market, was up 15%, including funding $151 million of net repositioning in the year, and of course, all of this funded through operational performance, as well as gains, and that's going to provide terrific support to us throughout 2011 and 2012.</p>
          <p>Pro forma EPS increased 12% to $3.00. We generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow or 152% of net income, again reflecting the very high quality of those earnings.</p>
          <p>So let's now go through each of the segments. Let's start with Aero on slide six. Aero sales, as you can see, were up 6% in the quarter; higher commercial and defense sales volume; segment profit for Aero up 5%, with margins down 20 basis points to 18.4%. Now importantly, if you exclude the impact of pre-production payments to the BGA OE suppliers that I mentioned earlier, if you exclude those payments this year; that is in '10, as well as in '09, segment margins would have been approximately flat in the quarter. Aero margins were also negatively impacted by the absence of last year's labor cost actions not repeated this year, which offset sales growth and also, productivity actions.</p>
          <p>Now if we look at the components of Aerospace, total commercial sales; that is the sum of ATR and BGA were up 8% in the quarter, reflecting continued good recovery in commercial Aero. The OE sales were up 6%, driven by increased ATR and BGA deliveries, partially offset by the impacts, as I mentioned earlier, of BGA OE customer payments, pre-production payments, which were $46 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket sales were up 9% in the quarter, reflecting higher aircraft utilization rates and software upgrades. Let me just give you a couple highlights regarding again the commercial segment. Air transport and regional flight hours very positive, of course, for the year; flight hours, total global flight hours up 7% in the quarter, 6% for the full year, confirming the recovery that we saw initiated earlier in the year. 2010 flight hours, and to put it in perspective, 2010 flight hours of 64 million were above the peak level of 2008 of 62 million; obviously, partly as a function of robust delivery schedules, but importantly really reflecting increased utilization of existing fleets. Now, you'll recall we were estimating another 4% to 6% increase in global flying hours in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now commercial aftermarket shares were up 25% in the quarter off the depressed 2009 levels. Spares orders continue to outpace maintenance activity across the mechanical and electronics business of Aero. Initial indications of orders signal spares activity continuing to trend above flight hours in early 2011. And it's also important to note we had another quarter of double-digit growth in business and general aviation aftermarket sales, largely driven by increased software RMU [Radio Management Unit] sales of newly launched enhanced navigation and satellite communications packages. It's a high margin contributor. And with revenue per shop visit expanding, this bodes well for the segment in 2011.</p>
          <p>Defense and Space sales were up 4% in the quarter. We had good growth in the T55 helicopter engines, as well as government services. These increases were partially offset by the TIGER [Total InteGrated Engine Revitalization] program continued ramp down. So, a good finish for Aero as we prepare for further U.S. defense budgetary pressures and reprogramming, and we'll talk about that a little bit more as we progress and talk more about 2011's update.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to slide seven with some of the highlights for Automation and Control Solutions, ACS, for the fourth quarter, and the year; ACS sales fourth quarter 2010 up 15%, 9% organic, reflecting even better organic growth than we saw in the third quarter. Acquisitions of course, mainly Sperian, were also meaningful in terms of their contribution to sales, adding 8% growth versus the fourth quarter of 2009. ACS had good geographic growth, with 7% or higher organic growth in every region.</p>
          <p>Now, as guided, segment margin for ACS was down 160 basis points in the quarter to 13.1%, again reflecting the absence of 2009 labor cost actions that were not repeated in the recovery this year. It also reflected the margin rate for ACS in the quarter, reflected the dilutive impact of M&amp;A, as well as summary investment for growth across their portfolio, partially offset by strong volume and project sales, resulting in lower than normal sales conversion in the quarter; ACS segment margin for the full year 12.9%, up 30 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now a little color in terms of the makeup of products and solutions portions of ACS; the products businesses were up 19% in the quarter on a reported basis, 8% organic. Businesses linked to industrial production saw both orders and sales growth supported by increases in manufacturing production, and the favorable impact of increased safety regulations. China and India led growth in Asia-Pac, up 20% and 21%, respectively. And despite continued weakness in commercial construction end markets, we continue to see North American HVAC controls, fire and security systems, holding up well, with moderate growth in these businesses, given their focus on energy efficiency and also, the uptake of important new products.</p>
          <p>The Solutions businesses for ACS were up 8% in the quarter reported, 9% organic, reflecting double-digit growth in process solutions as they execute on their large global project wins. Building Solutions continues to build backlog, with retrofit activity across the commercial and institutional verticals still robust and leveraging ACS's premier energy efficiency and Smart Grid portfolio of technologies. In total, Solutions ended the year with backlog up approximately 20%, compared to the same level at year-end 2009.</p>
          <p>Now the key theme for ACS from our December guidance call remains unchanged for 2011. The business is poised for another terrific year, expecting to outgrow the softness in both commercial and residential markets in the developed regions, continue their impressive ramp-up in emerging regions. And further, ACS has a robust backlog of projects to execute with both Process Solutions and Building Solutions being big movers for 2011.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to slide eight and look at Transportation Systems, which had another terrific quarter, finishing a very strong year. Transportation Systems sales were up 18%, as you can see, including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, sales were up 22%, driven by volume increases, primarily at Turbo, but also a strong quarter at CPG.</p>
          <p>Sales for the full year for TS were up 24% reported, 26% on an organic basis, outperforming the industry rebound in '10, which saw 13% year-over-year growth in European light vehicle production and a six point increase in diesel penetration in Western Europe. Turbo's performance, of course, reflects their high win rate on attractive new gas and diesel platforms, as well as flawless execution of new launches globally, and we expect that theme to continue through 2011.</p>
          <p>CPG, the sales were up 14% in the quarter, driven by Prestone volume, pass-through impact of higher raw material pricing, and continued traction on growth initiatives. They had a record profitability year, reflecting the reinvigorated sales and Commercial Excellence plan, as well as execution and good execution on key operational productivity actions.</p>
          <p>Overall for TS, the segment profit was up 94% in the quarter or $68 million, taking segment margins to 12.2%. And of course, given the high contribution margin associated with the Turbo business, as well as the progress the Transportation Systems team has made on productivity initiatives, all of that is being reflected in terms of their sales conversion and volume leverage on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>For the full year, Transportation Systems segment margin was 11.2%, up 600 basis points from 2009.</p>
          <p>So now let's take just a moment on CPG just to add a little bit to the introductory comments of Dave prior to talking about the SM [Specialty Materials] highlights for the quarter, and the year. So, we're obviously pleased to announce today the sale of CPG to Rank Group for cash proceeds of approximately $950 million. CPG, of course, is a very solid business with leading brands and a talented management team. This is simply a good opportunity for them in terms of becoming an acquired company of the Rank Group.</p>
          <p>In 2010, CPG had sales of $1 billion roughly, margins of about 11%. We expect the deal to close in the third quarter. And once we receive regulatory approval, we expect to account for CPG as discontinued operations. And as we've done in the past, we expect to smartly redeploy the gains and proceeds to offset the ongoing loss of earnings. We expect to utilize approximately the gain, the after-tax gain of approximately $200 million, to fund both repositioning and other actions.</p>
          <p>We're also planning to efficiently and accretively to deploy the proceeds; first, to fund the U.S. pension plan with approximately $400 million, or to the extent that it offsets the cash taxes on the sale. This would bring our assumed 2011 cash pension contributions to approximately $1.4 billion, and the funded status globally of our plans to approximately 90%, which we think significantly closes the gap on any future funding obligations. And we'll have more to share with you at our March Investor Day; overall, very, very good news in terms of the cash opportunity, and the cash deployment.</p>
          <p>The remainder of the proceeds, approximately $550 million, is expected to be reinvested to offset further share count growth relative to where we ended the year in 2010, roughly 795 million fully diluted shares. Specifically, we plan to buy back in the range of 10 million to 15 million shares and end the year 2011 with an average fully diluted share count close to that 795 million. Moreover, we're planning to keep that share count flat on a prospective basis. Given the timing of the close, the share repurchases are expected to offset a portion of the loss of CPG earnings in the second half of the year, again, anticipating something between an August and a September close on the transaction.</p>
          <p>So in summary, a great transaction for Honeywell shareholders, Rank and CPG customers and employees, and also, we believe smart deployment of the anticipated sale, CPG sale proceeds, as well as the expected transaction gain.</p>
          <p>So with that highlights, let's go now to slide 10, Specialty Materials. As you can see, SM also had a strong finish to 2010, with continued strong demand in the Advanced Materials businesses and also, positive momentum building in UOP. Fourth quarter revenues were up 12%; segment margin was 14.8%. Segment margin in the quarter was negatively impacted by the labor policy actions we've highlighted throughout today's discussions. This was partially offset by higher sales, strong Commercial Excellence, and the continued cost discipline with fixed costs as a percentage of revenue down three points year-over-year for the segment. For the full year, Specialty Materials segment margin was an impressive 15.8%, up 120 basis points over 2009.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, sales at UOP were up 4%. Growth in projects revenues more than offset lower catalyst sales due to project mix and timing; so as we've said before, a transition year for UOP as we've seen markets stabilize in '10 and a healthy order book and growing pipeline of global energy projects. Importantly, UOP backlog ended the year 2010 at a record backlog $1.7 billion, up 27% from the level of 2009 year-end.</p>
          <p>Advanced Materials saw sales up 17%, with revenues across the group up double-digits. Resins and chemicals were up 28% on robust Asia sales, as well as tight industry supply dynamics. Fluorine products were up 12%, driven by Commercial Excellence and continued strong demand for refrigerants and industrial applications. Specialty products were up an impressive 13%, with above market growth led by penetration of new product introductions in specialty additives, advanced fibers, and also, industrial products. So, another great year for SM, and it's a credit to the team doing the deploying of Commercial Excellence, investing in innovation, and with a globalized sales force and reliable plant force all contributing.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to slide 11, the financial guidance summary for 2011. On top of slide 11, we've summarized our revised guidance reflected to the positive, as well as negative variances since our December 15th call. Let's walk through some of the specifics, starting with pension. Ongoing pension expense for 2011 is now expected to be about $110 million, down from our original estimate of about $200 million, primarily reflecting higher asset values at year-end 2010 and also, our $1 billion contribution to the plan that we've made in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Given the strength of the fourth quarter of 2010 and with global economic conditions more favorable, as Dave referenced, we're also increasingly confident in our sales outlook for the year of $35 billion to $36 billion, which excludes the impact of the discontinued operations accounting treatment that we anticipate for CPG later in the year. In our revised earnings guidance, we've also removed some of the FX contingency we were holding in segment profit, so we're now planning the euro in the range of $1.30 to $1.35, which is also contributing to our upside view.</p>
          <p>Lastly, given Secretary Gates' announcement on January 6th and further risk to the U.S. defense budgets due to budgetary pressures and reprogramming, some things will undoubtedly continue to shift. And as we get better clarity and budget firming, we'll continue to update you on our outlook. But Defense and Space sales for the year 2011 are now expected to be at the lower end, down approximately 4% of our original guidance of down 2% to 4%.</p>
          <p>So when you net the risks and opportunities, we are very confident in our revised 2011 EPS outlook, taking that outlook up $0.10 to $3.60 to $3.80; $3.60 to $3.80 even, including the loss of CPG earnings, which are expected in the latter part of the year.</p>
          <p>So with that background, let's take a high level look at the first quarter of 2011 on slide number 12. We're planning for total sales, as you can see in the takeaway on slide 12, in the first quarter to be up in the range of $8.5 billion to $8.7 billion, up 9% to 12% from prior year, reflecting continued good organic growth. We're expecting EPS for the first quarter of '11 to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, up 21% to 27% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>Now quickly on each of the segments, we anticipate Aero sales to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, reflecting continued commercial strength, including the rebound in air transport aftermarket and BGA OE, partially offset by lower sales in defense. For ACS, we expect sales in the range of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion, extending the positive momentum from the fourth quarter with continued organic growth across the portfolio.</p>
          <p>At Transportation Systems, sales are estimated to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion. While European light vehicle production has continued to be strong and diesel penetration rates are higher, the double-digit growth we're anticipating in the segment is primarily driven by the benefit of our new Turbo launches.</p>
          <p>At Specialty Materials, we anticipate sales in the quarter in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with growth driven by projects growth in UOP, which includes the large Petrobras win that Dave referenced earlier. We also anticipate healthy end markets in Advanced Materials, robust growth out of Asia in fluorines, and also, resins and chemicals.</p>
          <p>So in summary, anticipating a strong start to the year with sales and earnings tracking a normalized linearity profile consistent with what we've seen in normal recovery periods. Again, this includes a slight FX headwind based on our planning assumption of the euro in the range of $1.30 to $1.35.</p>
          <p>So now let's summarize on slide 13; 2010 obviously a terrific year for Honeywell. There's no question we built momentum through the year, which is reflected in the stronger than expected operating performance. What's even more impressive, of course, is that delivery was done while sustaining our growth investments or seed planting for the future.</p>
          <p>With the strength of the fourth quarter, and the improvement we're seeing in the global economy, that gives us confidence in our increased earnings outlook for 2011. We're expecting good organic growth, strong sales conversion, continued traction on commercial and R&amp;D effectiveness, all while still controlling our fixed costs through OEF, layering in approximately $200 million of additional benefits from repositioning actions that we took in '10 and prior periods.</p>
          <p>Putting this into perspective, we're targeting 20%-plus earnings growth in '11, underscoring the organization's ability to be a top tier performer with a balanced portfolio of short and long cycle businesses, delivering above average growth, and continued margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Finally, we're looking forward to our upcoming annual Investor Conference in New York City on March 9th. You'll hear more from Dave, of course, about how we've emerged from the downturn as a stronger, smarter company, well-positioned to capitalize on the megatrends of energy efficiency, safety, security, and productivity.</p>
          <p>Our playbook for the long-term value creation is very much intact. We intend to showcase key growth drivers, a robust technology pipeline, as well as our continued expansion in emerging markets. We also intend to demonstrate how the results of these investments are showing up in new technology wins, share gains, and profitable growth; or said differently or summarizing that, the fact that our strategies are working.</p>
          <p>We'll also update you on the momentum we've got towards our long-term targets. When you take 2010 and 2011's outlook into account, we're tracking down the middle of the revenue growth target of 6% to 8% that we established last year. And more importantly, looking at margins, we're outperforming the margin targets, achieving an average of 70 basis points of expansion per year since '09 versus the target of plus 60 basis points per year, so terrific execution across the Honeywell portfolio.</p>
          <p>The business leaders, Dave, and I all look forward to seeing a number of you in person at our annual Investor Conference.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me turn it over to Elena for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Hi, John.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Dave, the guidance, and the $0.10 raise, if you compare the financial summary that you provided with the December financial summary, the numbers all actually look the same. What's different is the below the line, the December 15th pluses and minuses. So, it looks like pension is $0.08 to $0.09 of positive, right, with the lower costs associated with it. Can you give us a little color on what are the other puts and takes? It's just not really apparent what else has changed to get to $0.10, including CPG dilution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's start with CPG dilution. Depending obviously on whether August and September, and that's our best judgment at this stage given the regulatory approval process, we would anticipate $0.04 to $0.05, John, of dilution -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; this year from the sale of CPG. Offsetting that, of course, on the positive side, as you've mentioned, is the lower guidance now relative to the ongoing pension expense, so that's about $90 million of difference or $0.08 to $0.09 of favorability. We're going to pick up some improvement, obviously, as a result of our change in foreign currency. And then overall, we feel that between the actions we'll take as a result of the deployment, if you will, of the after-tax gain on CPG, our revised plan relative to share count, and then just the continued strength that we see across our businesses, all of that gives us confidence to be able to more than offset that dilution and to be confident to take the guidance up by $0.10 and be in that $3.60 to $3.80 range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, given that you kept the revenue range intact, is there any one segment within the portfolio that's looking much better today versus when you provided the December guide? And if not, does it imply that we should just be thinking maybe toward the higher end of these ranges because the ranges are basically the same?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the ranges are the same for the revenue, and that's a good point. Obviously, when we pull out CPG on a discontinued-ops basis, we'll be recasting 2010. So, the $33.4 billion that we just reported for 2010 will be closer to $32.4 billion for 2010. And the guidance, the $35 to $36 billion revenue guidance for 2011 will be in the range of $34 billion to $35 billion. Same percent V is 5% to 8% on a reported basis, on a year-over-year basis, in terms of the guidance.</p>
          <p>The puts and takes, I mentioned defense. Now, we're looking at as a result of recent reprogramming and some of the intended budgetary changes, budgetary cost changes that Secretary Gates has announced. We would anticipate being at the lower end, as I mentioned, of that 2% to 4% down for Defense and Space in 2011, closer to the 4%. Offsetting that, of course, is the strength that we saw in the finish in both Transportation Systems and ACS as we finished 2010. And we see that continuing in terms of their positive performance into 2011. So, those are directional at this stage. It's very, very early in the year. A point change in the Defense and Space numbers is worth about $50 million. So, it's not really significant changes at this point in the year. Dave, anything you would want to add to that, in terms of how we're looking at the top line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that is the right way to look at it. And I do think you could point to the pension piece, I suppose, John. But the way I would look at it is we're selling CPG. We're getting the proceeds, and we're covering that. And for us to be taking up guidance at this point in the year is generally unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I agree. Can I ask you? Turbo had very strong results. And as you look ahead this year, how are you thinking about Europe? Because obviously you've got perhaps a little bit more of a punk auto star there versus rest of the world. How would you say provide a little color on Europe, Turbo this year versus rest of world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say Turbo Europe &#x2013; maybe, Dave, I'll just take a quick shot at that, and then hand it over to you. I'd say Turbo Europe, as I mentioned in my remarks, is going to be a good year for us in 2011. Ranges in terms of estimates of light vehicle production in Europe, somewhere in the 1% to 4% range; you see a broader range in that from some of the analysts, but we think consensus estimates converge in that 1% to 4% range. We think that's reasonable. We'd say that there's still some potential positive momentum on the diesel penetration. But the important point, and the important takeaway for us is the anticipation of continued nice growth in our European Turbo and global Turbo business as a result of new launches. It's really a new launch story, John, that's going to drive the growth. Dave, anything you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'd say as we look around the world, across China and India, Middle East, we're still expecting to will do well. We think the U.S. will do well. Europe, we're counting on it being a generally slower environment. To the extent that it's better than that, then those Turbo numbers will be better than what we have projected because, as Dave pointed out, we're really just counting on new launches at this point and diesel penetration within an existing market. So, actually, I love our Turbo platform. I think there's a lot of goodness to come there for a lot of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just lastly, raw materials, I noticed in the prepared remarks you didn't call out raw materials as an event or item for ACS. It's maybe the one business I'm thinking that could have an impact. The margins were a tad lighter this quarter. Obviously, it has been a source of focus for you guys to get the margins higher over time. How are you thinking about raws, either within ACS or the year, as it pertains to your guide?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just to comment very quickly on the ACS margins for the quarter; really influenced by both labor costs actions, which you're very familiar with, as well as, obviously, the dilutive impact of now Sperian; so on an adjusted basis actually, good margins for ACS in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Relative to commodity costs, John, a couple points; number one, no real change for us relative to what we assumed when we provided initial guidance for 2011 back in December on December 15th; there have been some puts and takes with some general inflationary pressure, but nothing that would change &#x2013; come to the surface in terms of any influence in terms of our margin expectations for ACS or other businesses for 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, importantly, you'll recall that about 75% of our commodity buy is we really have called it natural hedges. That is both through our customer contracts, as well as our supply agreements, we have provisions that really protect us in terms of any significant volatility in terms of commodity costs. So, we think we're smartly positioned. The only commodity that tends to move more on a mark-to-market basis is copper, and frankly, is embedded in most of our products. There isn't anything that's a significant swing there. We've also seen, as you know, just a little bit recently of relief on copper going from &#x2013; I think it has gone from $4.40 down to about $4.10 in the last six or seven trading days. So, we're comfortable with the commodity outlook, and the assumptions that we've used.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've also assumed that, John, even with the advent of the recession, and the crash in commodities prices, we assume they would come back up with the recovery, because there wasn't a lot done on the supply side. And as demand started to come back, we track these 10-year curves on commodities costs, so we had a pretty good sense for it. And we don't think this recovery in commodities prices is unusual, and it was very forecastable, which we did actually. We assumed it would be going back up, and we planned that way.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning. First on CPG, that sounds like a slow close for just a random business like that. Why is -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>[Laughter] A random business, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It just has to do with the regulatory approval process, John, and just our expectation of what the Rank Group will go through given their other holdings, what they will go through in terms of the necessary HSR [Hart-Scott-Rodino] process. I think that's a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But they have a lot of other auto assets, I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have some. They have some to warrant what we think will be a review of four, five to six months. We don't anticipate any issues whatsoever, but from a timing standpoint, we think that's prudent timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to explore a little bit how to think about operating leverage in Aero and ACS, now that we're starting to normalize on the labor and other swings. On Aero, I guess we're going to be in an aftermarket spike still for a half or so, but as we get into stronger OE schedules and maybe moderating aftermarket, just some thoughts on incremental margins there? And then the same thing on ACS now that maybe some of these unnatural swings are moderating.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're going to see nice margin progression in each of those businesses, Jeff, in 2011. As we've talked about before, we're going to see the benefit, obviously, in Aerospace of the continued growth in aftermarket business; more of a coupling in terms of that rate of growth with global flying hours, but continued nice progression there.</p>
          <p>The other thing for Aerospace and generally, obviously, across all of our businesses is we'll now be transitioning in terms of those labor cost headwinds that affected in particular, the second half of 2010 reported numbers, reflected our reported results in terms of margin rates. So, we'll see very nice conversion rates in Aerospace. Those will begin. You'll start seeing some of that in the first quarter, but it will really progress over the course of 2011, quarterly over the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>For ACS, also nice conversions, at or above their historic levels; and again, we'll see the benefit of strong Products businesses, the absence of conversion costs. And we'll also see more of the integration savings, and the live-through of the Sperian integration savings and cost synergies benefit as we progress through the year, and not mitigated by the cost to achieve those synergies. So, early on, as we go into aggressive restructuring and integration savings with our acquisitions, the cost to achieve masks the actual benefits. You'll see that flow through in the second half of 2011, and see very nice rates of progression in terms of conversion for ACS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I'd add that it's going to be true for SM and TS also.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margin rates are going to be improving in all four businesses as we pursue that. I know it's a simple strategy, but it sure works, and that's to grow sales faster than your markets, and then grow fixed costs slower than your sales, and you get unbelievable leverage from that. And that fixed cost focus we have with our OEF effort; again, it sounds simple, but it really works.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, listening to your answers to John and Jeff; again, it occurs to me that the guidance does sound a little conservative. You're entering '11 with a lot of momentum, and it sounds like you're going to get solid contribution margins. It sounds like we're all going to be a little bit more optimistic than you are. Is there a final comment there before we get on to something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one comment to make is I think we're looking at 20% to 25% -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>27%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; 27% growth in earnings on a year-over-year basis. I think if we said 15% to 18%, we'd certainly jump on the wagon with you in terms of the conservatism of our outlook. But we're starting, Bob, as you recall, with a very strong outlook. So, what we're really doing here is some fine-tuning at the front end of the year to give you our best judgment in terms of the upside that we see as a result of events as we know them. So, I would say we continue to look at an aggressive 2011, but one that we very much think is also achievable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We like our prospects, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. I bet you do. Could you flesh out the comment on the $0.04 to $0.05 dilution from the CPG? What's the gross number, and then what are some of the offsets? How does that $0.04 to $0.05 get put together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $0.04 to $0.05 gets put together just simply CPG is a little over $1 billion of revenues in '10, so just think of that in terms of continuation of that top line for '11; generating margins of about 11%. So, if you look at that on an EBIT basis, we're talking something in the $110 million range in terms of segment profit contribution. Obviously, we're going to lose that, four to five months of that, Bob, in the latter part of this year. So, that's the $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution that I mentioned, depending on the 8/1 to 9/1, which is our best judgment at this point in terms of a close.</p>
          <p>So offsetting that, as we've mentioned, is the smart redeployment of the approximately $200 million after-tax gain that we anticipate on the transaction; as well as the smart strategies, as Dave referenced, around the redeployment of the cash proceeds. So, we think between those two, it will help offset the $0.04 to $0.05 dilution in 2011, but importantly, will fully offset that dilution on an ongoing basis. So, 2012 and beyond, the run rate benefits that we'll see as a result of both the redeployment of the gain, and the smart redeployment of the after-tax cash proceeds on the transaction will really show up for shareholders. That's something you'll be able to track and see in our forward earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you put this into disc-op, you're not going to restate the first half in '10 for this business as a disc-op?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will. We'll restate revenues and segment profit, so we'll see the first eight months or nine months; again, depending on the timing of the close, also reduce our reported revenues and segment profit for the year by using the disc-ops. We'll see all of 2010 CPG will be deducted &#x2013; subtracted from 2010, so you'll have $1 billion of revenues coming out and $110 million to $115 million of segment profit coming out of 2010. So, on a comp basis, on a year-over-year basis, you really won't see the V percents changing. The absolutes will change, but the V percents won't change. And on an EPS basis, there will still be the live-through on a consolidated pro forma EPS basis. There will still be the live-through of that $0.04 to $0.05 of dilution in '11.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, so the guide on earnings, up $0.10, includes CPG as a disc-op for all the year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a comment on the investment in emerging markets; I think Dave mentioned that in the preview, but maybe just give us a little color on the where, and how much, and what's the impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Okay. This was again on &#x2013; sorry, can you repeat the question, Bob?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about some of the strength in the company as a function of expanding the footprint in emerging markets of China, India, and thereabouts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, yeah, let me talk a little bit about that. We saw very good growth, as I mentioned to you, in ACS, TS, and Specialty Materials in the quarter. We saw ACS revenues in the fourth quarter were up. I think it was 20% in China, 21% in India. We saw in Transportation Systems, 27% growth in emerging regions in the fourth quarter; and in Specialty Materials in China, notably up 23% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So, for the full year, ACS China, just to cite a number, up 20%; Transportation Systems up 28%; and Specialty Materials up 10%; so very good double-digit growth in those markets. And basically if we look at India, you'd be looking at very comparable kinds of numbers in terms of percent changes on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>And importantly, emerging regions just continue to increase as a percent of total Honeywell revenues, and we're marching smartly towards up to 20%. We're in the 17% range in 2011 in terms of emerging region as a percent of total revenues.</p>

          <p>Hi, Scott.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple things, and get some follow-ups from Jeff's question, because I think it's interesting to try and get a sense of &#x2013; in your guidance for Aerospace and ACS, you're talking about 25% incremental margins. The last couple quarters have come in far short of that. But can we talk a little bit about what &#x2013; in this quarter, what was the actual BGA OEM payment? I think you said for full year, it was $46 million. What was it this quarter? And can you talk about that number a little bit? Is that something that goes on into 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had &#x2013; about $46 million was the number actually for the BGA launches, the pre-production costs paid to OEMs in the quarter. We had over $100 million for the year. And we're looking at a lower number, Scott, in 2011. These things get a little bit lumpy year-over-year. So, we'll see some benefit in terms of reduction of launch contributions in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they're really more weighted to second and third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the bigger issue, Scott, to the question you're raising is the labor cost actions that we took last year that aren't repeated this year &#x2013; or I should say were done in '09 that were not repeated in 2010. And that's the biggest driver of that lower conversion you're talking about. The conversion is actually quite good in both businesses, and it's why we feel pretty darn good about 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yes, without us knowing the exact number, it's hard to figure out because if you take a look at spares, up 25%, and the conversion margin on the spares is normally pretty high, you would have expected, at least by my math, at least a 19% margin this quarter, and you're coming in at 18.4%, so I'm just trying to get a sense of that delta. And maybe another way to ask the question is, are there a lot of &#x2013; were there a fair amount of investments in more discretionary expenses that were pulled forward into 4Q that won't repeat in 2011 that gives you confidence in the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The biggest issue is those labor cost actions, really. For both businesses in the fourth quarter, if you go back to the fourth quarter of '09, we had the reversal of bonus accruals and we took a lot of furloughs. And that was just &#x2013; not only did we cover that in 2010 in the fourth quarter, but we increased margins on top of that. So, if you look at the margin rate increase excluding covering those labor cost actions, it was quite substantial.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. Switching to Transportation Systems, can we talk about Turbo? You picked up a fair amount of new business. Are you adding capacity around that? And will there be upfront expenses that hold back those incrementals when you think &#x2013; particularly when you're servicing the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about the Transportation Systems business now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, TS, Turbo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the capacity that we'll add over the next year is really going to be driven by launches. And smartly, what we'll do is add that capacity in emerging regions, which is really where a lot of the growth is, and to really serve those markets, so I don't see that as affecting incremental margins in that business. We're just going to continue to benefit from volume leverage and fixed cost leverage in the Turbo business. If that's your point, I don't see that as detracting from or mitigating the outlook for margin expansion in Turbo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that makes sense. And lastly, just the pension contribution, does that indicate that M&amp;A will slow a bit this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Okay, so you have full capacity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, Scott, maybe if we can just spend one moment on that, really the good news is &#x2013; I would say the good news is as follows: number one, very strong cash flow from operations, so very strong free cash flow. Number two, strengthening of the pension funded status. We would anticipate with the contribution we made in the first quarter and a use of a portion of proceeds from the CPG divestiture that we'd be looking at global pension funded status at 90%-plus in 2011, assuming an 8% return on assets and a 5.25% discount rate, the rates that we've used as our core assumptions, and where we ended the year in terms of discount rates; so strong free cash flow, very healthy pension funded status, which really mitigates significantly the need for future funding.</p>
          <p>Ongoing, as I mentioned, share buyback to mitigate and eliminate share accreting, and continued growth in terms of dividend, and acquisition capacity as a result of the strengthening of the balance sheet, and the significant diminution of the pension under-funded status; so it's actually a good news story in terms of the balance that it brings to our cash redeployment strategy, and the strengthening of the outlook for M&amp;A for Honeywell going forward.</p>

          <p>Going back to your question on the conversion, we do have the data. If you took a look at Aero in the fourth quarter, excluding those labor cost actions, the conversion rate is more like 45%.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to pick up on your operating leverage question, isn't this just a function of the fact that you didn't cut head count aggressively, so therefore, the cost flows back much quicker? But then once we get beyond this, your leverage should then hockey-stick higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might say the same thing just a little differently, and that is we've preserved our industrial base so that we'd be able to respond quickly to the recovery, which we figured would come. And we took out the furloughs that we did in the prior year, and the IC &#x2013; or the bonus reduction that we took the prior year we're not repeating this year. And so it's same thing you just said, but just maybe a little different.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, just a quick one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also, the key thing is it's covered in the year; so 2011, you still get the same margin expansion, in fact, we think better given everything we did to reset the company in the recession. But at the same time, you don't have that offset that you do for reinstatement of those labor costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, just a couple quick ones here. You sold consumables, part of your Sensing business, and now CPG. Are we now done, or are there some bits and pieces within TS, maybe Friction and ACS that we might care about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say there are always bits and pieces. It's a $35 billion company, so there's always stuff that you look at and say it might fit better somewhere else. Let's come up with a smart way of exiting. But by and large, the big stuff is done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then, Dave, maybe if you could just put a finer point on the impact of Sperian on ACS margins because the decline Q-to-Q, 3Q to 4Q, is somewhat unusual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at the fourth quarter, as we talked about and as Dave just mentioned, there really is a big contribution both from the labor cost headwinds and also, Sperian. So, I think it works out to be about 50:50 between those two in terms of the impact on the margin rate for the business. And as Dave said, you'd see attractive incrementals, but for those items in the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just I'm sure you're getting tired of answering the ACS and probably the Specialty margin question, but it's the first year-over-year decline in like nine quarters at ACS anyway. So, if you take that $160 million and you describe the conversion, given the conversion rates you just gave, the $160 million of labor action is not repeated then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you able to even give us a rough breakout across the four segments of that $160 million, and that would allow us to do the math ourselves?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't provide that level of detail. But I will tell you that ACS is an important component of that just because of the nature, Steve, of the business, as you know, in terms of just the number of people that we have in ACS, and the global nature of that business. So, it's an important piece of the total, but we don't provide that level of detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But head count is a reasonable way to think about it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Steve, I think a reasonable way to think about this is without those labor cost actions, having to cover that, fourth quarter margins would have gone up in every business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And as you think about 2011, and you talked about HBS, the Solutions business, HPS and HBS coming back pretty strongly, and it sounds like possibly more strongly than the product side, what kind of mix impact are you anticipating on the margin front there? And then if you could also answer the pricing question inside of HBS in terms of that has been something that I'll say has been improving over the years; is it still improving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just take the first part of it, and maybe we can just make sure we're clarifying the second question that you had. I guess it was regarding HBS pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But on the first part of it, we are anticipating good growth out of the Solutions businesses in 2011. But we don't see that in terms of a mix impact that's going to affect, negatively impact the margin progression for ACS, Steve, in 2011. The big headline for ACS for 2011 is going to be good growth across the Products, as well as the Solutions businesses, the absence as we progress through the year &#x2013; increasingly the absence of those labor cost headwinds; and as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of the live-through of the Sperian acquisition operating income. That's really what's going to drive it. Those are the things I think you should think about in terms of driving pretty attractive incrementals for ACS in 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said that Solutions was going to have good growth in 2011, but I don't think that the difference is that great between the Products, and the Solutions businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's not going to get close to the Products side of the business, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It won't do that. But the mix impact in terms of Products versus Solutions for 2011 for ACS is not going to be visible. It's really going to be &#x2013; the headlines are going to be the incrementals associated with the now full absence of labor cost headwinds, and the flow-through and benefits, the live-through of the incremental margins and profitability from Sperian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>All right, and then I guess I should follow it up. On the pricing &#x2013; you mentioned the material inflation headwinds in Specialty. Are you getting price there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Steve, that we have an important piece of that business that is formula-based pricing. So, that's one of the benefits that we have in terms of mitigating the inflationary impact of commodity costs. So, the answer would be &#x2013; in those businesses, the answer is, obviously, yes, but there's nothing that I would suggest in terms of the overall market conditions that would suggest there's any different in the outlook for 2011 for Specialty Materials versus 2010 relative to price realization.</p>

That will provide us with incremental earnings per share in terms of reduced ongoing pension expense, which will help offset then the full-year dilutive impact of the sale of CPG in 2012.</p>

          <p>But the $1 billion is already contemplated in the $110 million guidance that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so it's just the incremental $400 million. Okay, great. And then just on this labor inflation point, just remind me if there is any hangover into early 2011 in terms of the way things played out in early '10, and where your exit run rate was.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a little bit. We had some furlough action in the first quarter of 2010, and so there will be some headwind that will show up in the early part of the year. But beyond that -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing you're going to hear about.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, nothing significant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on UOP for next year, what were orders like in the quarter? And do you have any view into the lumpiness in '11 in terms of how the early part of the year or later part of the year might play out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>UOP is on a roll. Those guys are doing great. The fourth quarter revenues were up significantly. We had, as you know, we announced the Petrobras order, and that really significantly added to the orders, and the backlog. But even excluding the Petrobras order, orders were up over 36% in 2010's fourth quarter for UOP, compared to the prior period. So, as Dave said, the business is absolutely on a roll.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and as far as you know, now, fairly even loaded across the year? I know sometimes you can have a big quarter here and a weak quarter here. Do you have any visibility into that yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's always going to be some lumpiness in UOP, and you also see, obviously, the influence of mix as a result of royalties and license income. The important thing for you is to think about I think is that not only is the backlog good, but what we would anticipate in terms of that mix of business going forward, '11 &#x2013; '12 also looks very good, Shannon. So, UOP is poised very well here for the next 12 &#x2013; 24 months.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everybody.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a quick question. I just found that Aerospace &#x2013; and Dave, you mentioned that defense is now trending towards the lower end of the range of down 4%, so it's down a point or a point or two. But you indicated, I think, in your December outlook that growth was going to be up in a range of 1% to 5%. It sounds like though on the aftermarket side, and the commercial and business jet side, we're seeing the cycle is strengthening. Is that an offset here and we really have no change on the top line? How do we understand that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for Aero overall, I think that's probably a pretty good way to look at it. And as we said, Peter, we'll just stay tuned as the year unfolds relative to Defense. And the leadership team there is just doing a lot in terms of, as we talked about, in terms of resource allocation, opportunity to pursue international opportunities, et cetera. But I think it's a good way to think about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, on the margin front, related to that same question, I think you had hoped to see some margin gains, at least 70 basis points on the lower end. Is that still a fair assumption just given that the aftermarket strength can be a big driver here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is. That's still a good assumption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much, nice quarter.</p>

          <p>So a lot of good news for you overall today, the fourth quarter was strong with strong orders rates going into this new year. And that allowed us to be able to take guidance for 2011 up $0.10, even as we cover CPG's departure towards the second half; and that sale of CPG, and the deployment of the proceeds in a way that further strengthens the company, but also more than offsets the dilution. So, we think this is going to be &#x2013; just portends a terrific future for us. In addition, we continue to progress on all our strategies, and that's on every front. The seed planting that we've done and continue to do lays terrific groundwork for continued and ongoing performance.</p>
          <p>Now early last year at our Investor Conference, we laid out five-year sales and margin rate targets that some considered ambitious. And we're excited now about the prospect of actually overachieving here because in the first two years of that five-year plan, we're actually ahead of the plan that we showed last year. So, we think there's a lot more good news ahead for our investors, and we hope to see many of you at our Investor Conference in March. Bye-bye.</p>
