          <p>Good day everyone, and welcome to the Honeywell Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Murray Grainger, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Cecilia. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Dave Anderson.</p>
          <p>This call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website, www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we would ask that you interpret them in that way.</p>
          <p>This morning, we'll review our financial results for the second quarter and our expectations for the remainder of the year, and of course allow time for your questions.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote. Dave?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Murray. Good morning, everyone. We're executing very well; unfortunately it's in a very tough economic environment. With sales of 7.6 billion we were able to generate earnings per share of $0.60 and that includes 66 million or $0.06 in earnings of additional repositioning actions. We also generated over $1 billion of free cash flow, which really reinforces the quality of our earnings performance this quarter.</p>
          <p>While the top line environment continues to be very challenging, especially in business jets and Turbos, we were able to deliver these results because of the strong cost actions and controls that we have in place throughout Honeywell. These actions and controls as well as our conservative planning, particularly around where we plan our costs, are helping to offset what we anticipate to be continued challenging end-market conditions throughout the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>So despite this weak top line environment, we still expect to deliver our full-year EPS at the low-end of our previous guidance range or about 2.85. We continue to drive productivity across the organization and remain focused on flawlessly executing the repositioning projects that we've initiated across the company. These projects yielded over 130 million of gross savings in the second quarter and should yield almost 650 million in gross savings this year.</p>
          <p>This focus on fixed costs remains a priority for us. We also continue to take other aggressive cost actions across our businesses. For example, our focus on reducing our indirect spend is working and will save us more than 20% of spend this year. Actions such as plant shutdowns and furloughs are being taken where appropriate and will save more than $140 million this year while also maintaining our core workforce.</p>
          <p>These are all difficult actions but our team is executing well and responding quickly to market conditions that continue to be dynamic. Our key process initiatives such as the Honeywell Operating System, Velocity Product Development and Functional Transformation have been huge enablers of these savings.  With 75% of our manufacturing cost base now within HOS deployment and more than half of those at phase IV or better where we start seeing transformational results, we're seeing real momentum across the organization.</p>
          <p>Some of you visited our Life Safety site in Lincolnshire, Illinois for example, where as a phase IV HOS site, we were able to consolidate six sites into one, reducing our footprint by more than 40%, increasing our sales per employee by 60%, while reducing inventory by 40% and cycle times from weeks to just days, impressive results and just one example of what is happening across the company.</p>
          <p>VPD continues to be a significant driver and is yielding very real benefits for us today in places like ECC, where we continue to win market share with new products. And in places like Aerospace, where our development costs and cycle times has been materially reduced, VPD further increases our competitive advantage on future platforms.</p>
          <p>Functional Transformation is now on track to save $150 million this year, up from our previous estimate of 100 million.   And we continue to drive additional productivity through shared SAP infrastructure and applications as we near almost 60% completion of our company-wide ERP rollout.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to invest in these big process initiatives as well as other seed planting across the organization, repositioning actions that help reduce our fixed cost and that have attractive returns benefiting 2010 and beyond. We've executed on 110 million or $0.11 so far this year and these actions alone should provide approximately 200 million of gross benefits next year.</p>
          <p>Seed planting, like technology investments that increase our leadership in next-generation technologies and applications, like our win on the European Commission Single European Sky Air Traffic Management System, or as they refer to it SESAR. This win positions Honeywell as the only U.S. -based company involved in this initiative with a target to improve European air traffic capacity by three times, improving safety by 10 times, reducing ATM cost by half, and reducing environmental impact by 10%. This win solidifies our leadership position in Air Traffic Management.</p>
          <p>And finally seed planting investments like our acquisition of RMG that further strengthens our position in the attractive and rapidly growing gas segment. As you know, with more and more gas reserves being discovered around the world, gas is going to become a much bigger part of the energy cycle. And RMG plays whenever that gap needs to be moved, measured or stored. This will be another great acquisition for us.</p>
          <p>So in summary, a good and importantly high quality quarter in a tough environment. Honeywell continues to execute and we continue to invest for the future. As I said last quarter, we want to be your best investment, not just during these tough times, but also when better times return. And they will return.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me tell it over to Dave.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Dave, and good morning everyone. Let's head to slide four and go through the financial summary results for the quarter. Obviously as we all know in a very tough environment, Honeywell posted results that were in line with guidance that we provided you in April. Reported sales for the combined company down 22% or down 18% organically if we exclude the impact of foreign exchange and also acquisitions. We had reported declines across all regions, but importantly sequential growth in the emerging regions of China, India and the Middle East.</p>
          <p>Segment margins declined 90 basis points to 12.3%. However, we saw another good margin performance from ACS, which was up 70 basis points in the quarter, and by the way, marks ACS' third quarter in a row with margin expansion. And an impressive quarter from Specialty Materials, which was up 150 basis points. These gains were more than offset by the expected weakness at Transportation Systems, which was down 800 basis points, and also Aerospace which was down 160 basis points, and Aero of course continues to experience soft conditions in the commercial after market.</p>
          <p>Net income in the quarter was down 38%, EPS declined 37%, and in addition to higher pension expense, which was 30 million in the quarter and a slightly lower share count, there were a number of moving pieces that I want to take a minute just to take you through.</p>
          <p>First, we were able to take, as Dave said, an additional 66 million or approximately $0.06 of net repositioning actions, actually 84 million gross and then we have some favorability from reversals of prior accruals in the quarter. Those are going to provide approximately $30 million of benefit in 2009 toward the end of the year obviously and more than 100 million additional benefit in 2010.</p>
          <p>Second, we recognized impairment charges of 70 million or about $0.09 because of the mostly non-tax deductibility associated with this charge, 70 million or $0.09 primarily related to the write-down of shares and which &#x2013; were received as partial consideration for the sale of Aero's Consumable Solutions business.  You'll recall we sold that business in the third quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>And finally, we recognized a gain of 98 million or approximately $0.10 positive related to changes that we made to our post-employment benefits programs in the quarter. Therefore, on a net basis, these items were actually a headwind of approximately $0.05 to our reported EPS of $0.60.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow was obviously strong in the quarter over a billion of free cash flow despite more than 270 million decline in net income. Now working capital contributed more than 350 driven by product rate of 50 million, driven by progress on inventory and receivables, and CapEx also contributed down, more than 35% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from the sale of some long-term receivables, which contributed just around 140 million, which were partially offset by higher repositioning payments in the quarter. For the first half of 2009, the cash flow conversion of 147%, which really reinforces the quality of our earnings, is a direct result of core process improvement, again very positive performance.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to slide five and our market assumptions update. This is a format that you're obviously familiar with. We've used this same format several times. I want to highlight that in large part our assumptions remain intact, but the outlook has been tempered by continued delays in the spending patterns for many of our end markets.</p>
          <p>The red circles indicate where we continue to see the most pressure starting with the Air Transport &amp; Regional aftermarket and the continued phenomena of inventory destocking. Even though flight hours remain consistent at a decline of approximately 4% for the full year, we're continuing to see airlines aggressively manage their spares side and we're now anticipating that this phenomena will continue through the balance of the year. We'll get into the details of that when we go through Aero in just a moment.  However, we continue to see airlines purchase spares at a rate that is seven times lower than flight hours, a disparity that's much greater than the industry has experienced in the last downturn.</p>
          <p>At ACS we're seeing industrial customers delay both cap spending and operating spending across a number of businesses, driven by soft conditions, and in the case of our Process Solutions business, uncertainty around energy and commodity prices. The trend also applies to UOP where we continue to see catalyst reloads and some project decisions pushed to the right.</p>
          <p>And for Turbo, while the outlook for Western Europe auto sales has improved slightly, diesel penetration continues to decline and is now expected to be off seven points this year versus our previous estimate of down five points. This is driven by temporary government incentives toward smaller, cheaper gasoline cars in large part.  As you know, diesel cars are a significant part of our overall mix today and of course the overall turbo industry. However, our mix and our penetration in gas engines will really begin to accelerate on new platforms that are due for release in 2010 and beyond.</p>
          <p>So sort of in summary on this slide, while the overall assumptions remain consistent, customer behavior, spending delays continue to put pressure on the top line and we expect those trends to continue for the balance of the year. However, we're obviously, and as Dave reinforced, taking actions across the organization, aided by our conservative planning on the cost side, which will help mitigate the softness.</p>
          <p>Now let's go through each of the segments &#x2013; the highlights for each of the segments starting with Aerospace on slide number six. Reported Aero segment sales in the first quarter were down 17%, but excluding the impact of the Consumable Solutions divestiture, sales for Aero were down 14% on an organic basis, with segment profit down 25%, margins down 160 basis points to 16.7% on lower volumes, partially offset by reduced expenses.</p>
          <p>On an organic basis, total commercial sales, that is the sum of ATR and BGA, were down 23% in the quarter with declines across both the OE and Aftermarket segments. And to just give you a little more color on that, organic commercial OE sales were down 29%, the ATR or Air Transport &amp; Regional segment was down 15% as expected due to platform mix and also the timing of shipments to regional jet customers.  Business jet OE sales were down 42% in the quarter as a result of the significant customer reschedules that we discussed in the first quarter and that phenomenon just continues and we expect that to continue obviously for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Commercial aftermarket sales were down 19% in the second quarter; the ATR piece of that declined 3.6%, which was actually better than our estimate of 5% for the quarter.  Again, that was flight hours down 3.6%, better than our estimate of 5% down in flight hours for the quarter. However, our aftermarket sales were down 14% as airlines continued aggressive inventory initiatives and the utilization and also leveraged the utilization of parked aircraft for spares.</p>
          <p>Just to provide again some additional color, our Repair and Overhaul R&amp;O business was down in line with flight hours; however, spares were down more than 25% or seven times greater than the flight hour reduction. BGA aftermarket sales were down 31% in the quarter, in line with expectations and in line with the turbofan engines or TFE hours and maintenance events.</p>
          <p>Finally, Defense &amp; Space sales for Aero were down slightly in the quarter, mostly driven by tough comps; you'll recall the prior year was up 11%, primarily due to program timing. Our Defense &amp; Space portfolio continues to perform very well and remains well positioned for good growth in 2009.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we had continued tough market conditions in Aero, volume declines across the commercial portfolio, particularly in business jets. However, the Aero team continues to execute well; they've reacted quickly with additional cost actions across the businesses and they also continue to win, as Dave said, attractive new businesses. And in addition to the Air Traffic Management System for Europe, the SESAR program, Aerospace won a 10-year contract with the Marine Corps for Prepositioning and Logistics Support Services with a potential over its life, value of over $700 million.</p>
          <p>We're also having great success in gaining significant share with our APU retrofit program, which offers better fuel economy and lower maintenance versus the competition. Another example in the quarter was Aviation Capital, where we've won a fleet of new Airbus A320s with a contract valued at more than $40 million.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to slide number seven, and go through the highlights for ACS. Reported sales for ACS were down 17% in the quarter, down 13% on a local currency organic basis. The biggest declines were in Europe and in the Americas, partially offset by essentially flat comparisons across the emerging regions. Segment margins were a good story in the quarter, up an impressive 70 basis points to an 11.5% margin for ACS.</p>
          <p>Now, the Products businesses were down 16% organically with a continuation of the difficult trends we saw as we exited the first quarter. ECC and Life Safety, while both down in the quarter, continue to win in the marketplace and gain share with new products.</p>
          <p>On the Solutions business, while down 6% in the quarter, they actually continue to perform very well facing tough comps of 11% organic growth in the same period last year.  Demand for energy efficiency as well as the integration of climate, fire and security controls for critical infrastructure continue to drive growth at Building Solutions. At Process Solutions, particularly oil and gas production, that is upstream as well as the distribution projects, continue to be solid. However, refining remains weak, and as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing delays in both CapEx and OpEx across-the-board in this market segment.</p>
          <p>Orders in the second quarter in the Solutions business were down 7% organically, reflecting tough comps at Building Solutions and also order delay particularly across their solutions. The service bank however increased in both Buildings and Process, and we continue to see the benefit of our installed base of over 5 million buildings and 10,000 industrial sites.</p>
          <p>Building Solutions in fact had its second biggest order quarter ever in the Americas and Asia and were able to secure a contract for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to upgrade several buildings with energy efficient technology. As part of that contract, Honeywell will install utility monitoring and building control technology, such as heating, ventilation and HVAC, fire alarm and life safety, as well as security systems at Federal facilities in the U.S. and abroad.  And after a pause in stimulus activity at the start of the quarter, we've seen an uptick in bid and proposal and anticipate orders being awarded related to stimulus in the third and fourth quarters in our Building Solutions business.</p>
          <p>The ACS segment profit, as I said was down 11%, with segment profit dollars reflecting negative volume. However, we saw an impressive 70 basis points increase in margin to 11.5%, reflecting more than 50 million in reduced SG&amp;A costs in the quarter and the margin increases in our Solutions businesses. It was a great effort by the ACS team who continues to execute well on new product introductions, productivity actions as well as acquisition integration; all of these contributed positively to their performance in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide eight and talk about Transportation Systems. As you can see, overall TS sales on slide eight were down 41%.  That included a 6% foreign currency impact on volume.  We had declines primarily at Turbo as well as in Friction Materials in the quarter. Turbo saw again lower vehicle production rates at OEMs globally as consumers continue to shift towards cheaper, lower displacement gas engines.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, OEs also continued to significantly reduce their inventories, which we estimate to be down approximately 2 million vehicles in Western Europe alone and that's significant obviously in terms of the importance of that market for us. We would therefore expect OEs to start increasing their production in the fourth quarter, and for Honeywell to gain share as we benefit from a high win rate on new platforms into 2010. And another positive data point, and you have to look for positive data points in this environment, we saw our shipments increase week-over-week during the quarter, indicating that demand is actually picking up. So kind of starting to see if you will stabilization and some turn in this business.</p>
          <p>In the Consumer Products business, which was down 11% reported, but only 2% if you exclude foreign currency as well as the pass-through impact of lower raw material pricing, primarily ethylene glycol. We're seeing much improved business performance with CPG recording its second quarter of profit and margin growth.</p>
          <p>Overall, Transportation Systems profit down 83% in the quarter due primarily to lower volumes at Turbo; however the TS team also continues to make good progress with productivity and cost actions, with fixed costs down more than 14% in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's go now to slide number nine and go through the summer review of Specialty Materials. Now kind of as backdrop here when you look at these numbers, you may recall, I didn't, but you may recall that during the last downturn, I think I've put it out of my mind, Specialty Materials was only marginally profitable, with total segment profit over the combined 2001, 2002 period of less than $150 million. In this quarter alone, Specialty Materials generated 150 million of segment profit, expanding margins by 150 basis points on sales down 28%.  Clearly, this is a very different business and a credit to the work that the SM team is doing and the portfolio reshaping that's occurred here.</p>
          <p>Now as expected, sales at UOP were down 24% due to tough comps of catalyst sales; you'll recall those were down 33% in the quarter, but large shipments of catalysts in the first half of last year, up approximately 45% in the first half of 2008. So we've been anticipating these tough comps in the first half of the year for UOP.</p>
          <p>Overall UOP continues to see deferrals in its short cycle catalyst reload business and the timing we anticipate now between third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010 to be a little bit fluid, difficult to predict. We should have better visibility towards the end of this quarter in terms of the outlook for those catalyst reloads. Longer cycle projects continue to remain relatively stable, however we're seeing some delays due to weakness in CapEx spending in refining and petrochemical end markets.</p>
          <p>For Resins and Chemicals, sales were down 41% in the quarter, driven by the impact of lower material costs on pricing, despite higher export volumes to China and South America.</p>
          <p>Specialty Products declined 30% driven primarily by continued challenges in the semiconductor industry; however we are seeing sequential improvement in Electronic Materials as customers in that segment are signaling the improved business conditions.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, segment profit for SM at 150 million was down 19% this quarter.  However margins were up 150 basis points to 14.3% on terrific cost controls despite lower volumes and the negative mix impact of lower UOP catalyst sales, truly a great performance under these conditions.</p>
          <p>So with that review of the four segments, let's go to slide 10 and do a summary preview of the outlook for the third quarter. We're planning for total sales in the third quarter to be in the range of 7.7 to 8.1 billion, down approximately 12 to 16% from the prior year and we're forecasting EPS in the range of 70 to 75 cents, down approximately 23% to 28%. We anticipate Aero sales to be in the 2.7 to 2.8 billion range, down 8 to 12%, including the negative one point impact from the sale of the CS business.</p>
          <p>We expect sales to Air Transport OE customers to decline slightly due to platform mix and timing and we expect continued sharp declines in Business Aviation due to reduced delivery schedules to our OE customers. Now Business Aviation OE sales could down as much as 70 to 80%, which is indicative of the correction that's occurring in this industry. In the aftermarket, we expect ATR sales to decline more than flight hours, again that phenomena of buying behavior and inventory destocking, which we expect flight hours to be down in the range of 4%.</p>
          <p>And in business jets, we expect TFE hours to be down consistent with our expectation for decline for the full year, that is down about 15% in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>For ACS in the third, we expect sales in the 3.2 to 3.3 billion range, down 11 to 13% versus prior year, including a slight benefit from acquisitions. We expect similar trends that we saw in the second quarter with volume declines across all of the businesses offset by cost actions and the benefits from previously funded repositioning actions.</p>
          <p>At Transportation, we expect sales in the 0.8 to 0.9 billion range, 800 to 900 million, down a little more than 20%, again with similar trends that we saw in the second quarter. Still high, but declining inventories of passenger and commercial vehicles will continue to dampen production.  However, this activity should continue to pick up in preparation for the expected production increases in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, that sound, at Specialty Materials, we anticipate sales in the 1 to 1.1 billion range in the third quarter, down 17 to 24% due to raw material pass-through impacts at Resins and Chemicals, offset by a pickup in catalyst reload activity at UOP.</p>
          <p>So in summary, we're preparing ourselves for another tough quarter with continued challenging top line supported by aggressive cost actions. We expect to see top line declines moderating however, as we move into the second half of '09 as the businesses will still be below 2008 levels.</p>
          <p>So now let's turn to the sales assumptions for the remainder of the year on slide 11.  We thought this pictorial could be helpful for you in terms of just providing a perspective on what we're looking at for the second half of this year and how that has compared to the previous quarters including the first quarter of '09 and the first half if you will of '09 and the two halves of '08.</p>
          <p>The message we'd like to convey here is that while our forecast implied some sequential growth in the second half of the year, we're still planning for absolute levels of business activity to be below '08 and in some cases, although not shown in the chart, below 2007 levels.</p>
          <p>Let's start with TS on the lower left, since this shows the biggest difference between 2008 and 2009. Now as a reminder, in the second quarter of this year, sales were down 40% and we expect sales in the third quarter to be in the range of 800 to 900 million, with year-over-year declines moderating slightly.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we expect sales for TS to be essentially flat with the prior year, however still 30% below 2007 levels. So while we're looking at sequential increases 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, we're still only planning to reach depressed 2008 levels with the benefit of a tailwind of increased OE productions as a result of declining inventories and the benefit of new model launches. Overall for the year, we now expect Transportation sales to be in the range of 3.3 billion at our revised euro estimate of 1.36 for the year.</p>
          <p>Let's go to the top left now in the same chart and look at Aero where we expect overall year-to-year declines to moderate over the second half of the year with growth in Defense offsetting the declines we're expecting in business jet OE, as well as the continued inventory destocking that's occurring in the commercial after market. We now expect Aero sales for the full-year to be in the range of $11.2 billion.</p>
          <p>If you look at the upper right-hand side of the same chart and look at ACS, we see a similar trend, declines moderating throughout the year, and while still down year-over-year, we expect lower declines at Environmental Combustion, ECC, as well as the Life Safety as they continue to improve their market positions and grow share in the third and fourth quarters based upon recent contract wins and the success of new product introductions. We're also expecting organic growth in the fourth quarter in Building Solutions, calling moderate declines in the third quarter due to project timing. And we expect these factors primarily to be offset by a decline in Process Solutions due to customer spending delays that we discussed earlier.  Overall, we expect sales for the full-year for ACS to be in the range of $12.8 million.</p>
          <p>And finally on the lower right-hand side of the chart, we expect the second half for Specialty Materials to benefit from front planned catalyst reloads at UOP. Now as we discussed earlier, the timing of these can be variable within the third and fourth quarters and we may even see some pushed into '10, although our best estimate today is they should occur this year. We're also seeing more visibility as I said earlier toward the end of the third quarter. Our latest estimate for full year for Specialty Materials is revenues of $4.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look at EPS for the remainder of the year and how we've walked from the first half to our full-year estimate on slide 12. And you'll recall this format; Dave presented this in May at EPG, walking our first half actual results to our revived guidance now at approximately $2.85 to EPS, at the low end of our previous guidance range.</p>
          <p>So consistent with what we're already discussed for each of our businesses, we're planning for continued challenging market conditions to be offset by aggressive cost controls. As you can see, the business timing and seasonality component of this walk is now lower than what we communicated in May.  At that time Dave, I think at EPG you were north of $0.30, for that piece of it.  We're now at $0.18 and that's due to the continued customer spending delays that we discussed.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, the repositioning savings and cost control component of the walk with the bridge are higher.  Now anticipating $0.36 on a combined basis, reflecting savings from repositioning actions that we took in the second quarter. Business timing, for example Turbo and UOP, are still more heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter as are the repositioning savings which are expected to benefit the fourth quarter at a rate approximately twice that of the third quarter. Also note that the first half run rate of $1.14 includes $0.11 of repositioning charges or headwind from the first half.</p>
          <p>Now, turning for a moment to 2010, we just spent last week with each of you in our four businesses, so we are going now to the next slide, The 2010 Framework.  Now obviously while too early to talk specific guidance, we just want to verify some of the items on this chart again; this is the chart that Dave shared with you in May at EPG and the slide is titled "2010 Framework", slide number 13. Starting on the right-hand side of the table, obviously in terms of positives we expect continued growth in '10 from our Defense &amp; Space business with base budget defense spending expected to rise slightly and benefiting key programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and also ULBs under the current defense, anticipated defense budget.</p>
          <p>We'll also see continued year-over-year savings from repositioning actions that we funded across the organization. These projects including the actions that we initiated this quarter should be hitting full run rate in 2010 and are estimated to generate somewhere between 150 and 200 million in incremental savings versus 2009.</p>
          <p>We also expect our Turbocharger and Commercial Aerospace aftermarket business to rebound in '10 following depressed '09 levels again as well as the inventory destocking that we're seeing this year. Both of these businesses, the Turbo and Commercial Aero aftermarket businesses are very high margin contributors for Honeywell and we should see good benefits from any rebound in volumes.</p>
          <p>On the other hand as we've discussed, we anticipate that pension, if you look at the other side of the equation, to be a significant headwind in '10 and we're planning for Commercial Aerospace OE deliveries to turn down in '10 as well as non-residential construction.  However a higher mix of government-funded and energy efficiency projects including benefits from the stimulus funding should help mitigate some of this decline.</p>
          <p>Some items are obviously too early to call, such as the shorter-cycle ACS businesses, the refining and petrochemical businesses where OpEx and CapEx will be very much tied to stability and commodity pricing, all of those are clearly unknowns at this time. Foreign exchange is clearly too early to call as well as the timing and magnitude in any true rebound in the emerging markets,</p>
          <p>Now clearly not all of the items on the page carry equal weighting, but in all, our preliminary framework for 2010 remains well balanced between opportunities on risk on the operational side with a still number of unknowns, which we'll continue to monitor.</p>
          <p>So now, let's turn to slide 14 and summarize before turning it back to Murray and to you for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>We're obviously, as Dave said, pleased to be able to report a second quarter that's in line with guidance and this despite the continued very difficult economic conditions. We continued in the quarter to fund attractive repositioning projects.  Year-to-date, we have recognized an additional 110 million or approximately $0.11 of repositioning which we expect to contribute around 70 million of savings this year and approximately 200 million of gross savings next year.</p>
          <p>We've also been able to generate more than $1.2 billion of free cash year-to-date, which really reinforces the quality of our earnings stream as well as the focus we have around disciplined capital allocation and working capital.</p>
          <p>However, as we discussed earlier, end market conditions remain tough.  We continue to see topline pressure, particularly in Air Transport aftermarket, Business Jet OE and the Turbo business. And we continue to see risk as customers delay capital spending and operating spending decisions particularly in the industrial, refining and petrochemical segments.</p>
          <p>However the organization is staying on top of these shifts; it's responding quickly and effectively. We're executing on repositioning; we continue to aggressively implement functional transformation. And in addition, we've initiated cost actions across the organization, including plant shutdowns as appropriate, furloughs, changes to our benefit plans to further offset anticipated volume declines.</p>
          <p>We're preparing ourselves for continued tough conditions in the second half, but we remain confident in the cost actions that we put in place to support our full year 2009 EPS guidance of approximately $2.85.</p>
          <p>And finally, as we've highlighted throughout the review today, we continue to invest in new products and services. Our global footprint continues to strengthen in the key process initiatives that will help Honeywell outperform over the long-term. In the near term, we're focused on executing in this environment and we're planning for these conditions to continue through the rest of 2009 at a minimum.</p>
          <p>So, with that Murray, let's go back to you then for Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question today comes from Steven Whittiker of Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted to first get a better idea of, on the EPS side, the walk, these -- I guess there's a $0.19 difference between EPG and today and all that's you mentioned in business timing and seasonality. But could you maybe expand on that a little bit more sort of beyond just some of the customer deferrals?  Is that what's driving the reduction to the lower end or the move to the lower end of guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give kind of an overall perspectives and then I'll try to get more color commentary from Dave. But what we've tried to do in the guidance we provide is make sure that we also contemplate how tough market conditions could be. So as we went through the analysis over these last few months, every time we're looking at it and saying what do our end markets look like? And we've tried to contemplate, would they be better than we thought or worse than we thought and we've tried to put that into our guidance.</p>
          <p>And in this case we'd have to say that end market conditions have been tougher than we'd thought, if we were looking at what the high end of our range was. And it's just closer to where we were on the low side. So we tried to contemplate all the possible outcomes in the guidance we gave. And I'd say overall, it's just the case where these end market conditions are continuing to stay tougher. The destocking has continued and we think there is still the possibility of some more before we start to come out of it. And I'd say it's more a reflection of that than anything else.  It's not a case of being surprised or anything; it's more a case where we tried to contemplate all the possible outcomes. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that summarized it well. It's really, if you look at sort of a micro basis or a business-specific basis, the numbers are all within the range of what we have been using in terms of our overall guidance, Steve. And it's really now at the lower end on the Aero aftermarket, the lower end on the ACS products, and at the lower end on UOP catalyst. So again when you look at the high contribution margin businesses that are most impacted, so they've really moved to that lower end of the range and as we've talked about and as Dave said, we've just gone in and put in additional reinforcement in terms of our cost actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as I look at Q4, if Q3 hits the number that you're guiding to, that means we've got $1 EPS in Q4 and that would probably be the best quarter at least in three years on an EPS basis. Part of that I'm assuming is a pickup in the spare parts assumptions in Q4. Are you assuming that the airlines have a surge at all in restocking in Q4 or are you assuming that the destocking that started and going through Q3 is going to persist?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's more a reflection of the cumulative effect of the cost actions that we've been taking. We're really not counting on much market recovery except for stuff where it clearly is going to happen, like Turbos, where they were pretty much shut down in the fourth quarter of last year and you know the pain we took with that. And with the destocking that has already occurred and we think there is -- there will be a little bit more in the third quarter. It can't happen in the fourth quarter because you can only hold your breath so long on something like that. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really just as you said; it's really the cost actions and the distribution of -- I think referenced earlier Steve, that if you look at the net repositioning benefit as well as some of the other cost actions, it's really a one third, two third phenomenon when you think of the distribution through the rest of the year, that is the third quarter, fourth quarter distribution. So it's the size of those cost actions and it's the distribution on timing of those cost actions that creates that phenomena.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last quarter, Dave Anderson, you talked about pension headwind in 2010 being somewhere in that $0.50 range. And I think things have gotten maybe a little bit better since then. Can you mark-to-market that number for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say that's probably still a pretty good estimate. It's just one of those that's tough to call.  The return on plan assets is better. On the other hand, the discount rate is probably hovering about where it was at year-end. So net-net, I think for planning purposes, Scott, as a placeholder, as we think about next year and as you think about us for next year, I think I would just continue to use that $500 million number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Discount rate bounces around a fair amount, as you know, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, now I know. I'm asking you to forecast something that's tough to forecast. But anyways, on OPEB a little bit, maybe just to educate me on what happens here on the accounting side.  What changed in the plan that gave you the $0.10 gain? And is that just a one-time gain, does it relate to some of the head count reductions? Is it related to less benefits or is it more of a discretionary line item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is a one-time, largely a one-time gain, but there will be some small benefit on an annual basis going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Scott, really just -- the change really was the elimination of the subsidy for retiree-eligible, but pre-65 employees of pre-Medicare employees in the company resulting in a curtailment gain. And as Dave said, for planning purposes for the next five, six years or so, there will continue to be a positive sort of flow-through if you will of that change of that benefit plan change that will be about $20 million a year. So, from a run-rate, if you're thinking historically of about $100 million in terms of OPEB, you'd be thinking about $80 million for OPEB for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just for the record, Scott, anybody who retires before July 31, we gave employees about four or five months notice on this one, that anybody who retires before July 31, they still get the benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And lastly, you've -- you didn't really talk much about cash reinvestment from here. And I know Dave Cote you've talked about deals being expensive but yet you were able to get the RMG deal done at reasonably good price.  I mean is that &#x2013; was that kind of a one off opportunity?  Is there more stuff out there?   Any chance to buy back some shares here given how depressed your stock is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I would say the acquisition environment is still a case where we look at hundreds to get one done because of fit, pricing, whatever. In this case, it was just a &#x2013; we think a very good deal and you hear us talk maybe too much about the great positions in good industries. We think that whole natural gas area is just going to be a very good industry. And you can see it with just all of the gas finds that have been announced over the last couple of years, there is a substantial amount of natural gas being found. And we think that is very much going to be part of the solution when people look at how to mitigate global warming, how to become more energy-secure. So we just think it's a great spot and a great price, but as we've looked at, we'll probably look at 100 to be able to get ourselves down to that one. So it's still a tougher environment when it comes to overall acquisition environment.</p>
          <p>When it comes to cash deployment, we're still going to -- I mean our mantra really hasn't changed over the last six or seven years and it says that we're a good cash flow generator. We're going to continue to do that, I think it shows in this quarter. And we're going to be judicious in how we think about acquisitions, repurchases, dividends and maintaining that single A rating which we think is an important thing for us to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan of Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Shannon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on the Specialty margins, I mean we normally wouldn't see this kind of a margin unless UOP was having a really good quarter. So for that to happen with catalyst down that much, is there anything unusual going on there? I mean, are you positively surprised that they could deliver this kind of a quarter with a bad UOP quarter or what do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say it came as a surprise. We knew it was going to happen this way. But Dave, anything you want to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a really good question. It speaks to a couple things. Number one, obviously the reshaping, the significant reshaping of the, if you will, the legacy section of <mark type="inaudible" /> portfolios, it's just can't state that enough. That includes the partial immunization in the Resins and Chemicals business. As you know, Scott, this was a money loser in the last cycle and given the formula-based pricing as well as what we've done to continue to position ourselves as the low-cost global producer of Caprolactam.  We've seen actually pretty healthy demand.  I talked about the exports to for example China, as well as exports, mostly ammonium sulfates exports, to Brazil and Latin America during the quarter. We have, we think really positioned ourselves well in that business just as an example for the global marketplace. And that's a dramatic transformation, the before and after is dramatic.</p>
          <p>Flourine Products, despite end-market pressures, had a good quarter. They've done a very nice job in terms of managing commercially and operationally. And while we had some tough market conditions in Specialty Products, they also managed well in the quarter. All the businesses across SM like all the business across Honeywell have been very proactive in their cost actions. Significant reduction, I think it was a 21% reduction in indirect spend in Specialty Materials in the quarter over a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>So that's really indicative. Andreas is just all over, looking at every piece of it and not just the cost piece of it but really optimizing our sales force deployment, the operational improvement, plan containment and all those things really contributed to their performance in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Shannon, if I could reinforce Dave's choice of word, first time I've heard it, but I think it's pretty good, is that immunization. We talked a lot about this last time in the last recession but it was a baby in the bathwater kind of thing. As we took a look at Specialty Materials, there really was a bifurcated portfolio, and some of the stuff was very good and some of the stuff was not. On all the stuff that's not, we've really managed to shed ourselves of most of the troublesome stuff. And in Resins and Chemicals, really transformed that business, and we talked about it at the time, that the highs would not be as high, but the lows would also not be as low, as a result of what we were doing. And that's showing up a lot now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And you mentioned the stimulus activity into the second half, I mean are you guys getting a little more granularity?  I mean any ability to give a little color on the size and/or the timing of the impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe not so much on size, because we're still seeing orders flow, but clearly we're starting to see the benefit in orders and the impact will be felt more in the second half and going into '10. The stimulus funding had this really perverse effect of actually slowing things down initially as municipalities waited to see what the packet was going to look like before they completed projects that were already in process. And we're past that and it's really starting to pick up. But I wouldn't be prepared to put a number on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last one is just, you mentioned in some of the things that took your assumptions down for this year. I mean some of it's around aftermarket destocking there, Turbo, things you expect to get better in 2010. I mean to what extent are these items that are worse in 2009 changing your view of potentially how the delta could be better next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still planning for a difficult 2010. As you know, markets are still very &#x2013; very dynamic. And we just think the smart way to plan right now is to just assume 2010 is just as difficult as 2009. There'll be puts and takes, but we think the smart thing to do is plan for difficulty. If we get positively surprised, then great, but we're not going to plan that way. Dave anything you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, nothing to add to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just mean, I guess, do you have a feel for how much of what's going on, do you expect to extend this sort of an abnormal correction to the downside, things that have to come back a little bit, you mentioned the destocking in commercial aftermarket, other areas like that, anything that you feel like sort of have to snap back, because it's abnormally to the downside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you'd have to expect the whole destocking phenomenon which we've seen in Turbos, we've seen extensively in Aerospace, we've seen it in ACS, we've seen it some in Specialty Materials. You'd have to assume that can't keep going. But by the same token, you don't know exactly what happens to, we'll say Aerospace OEM schedules, you don't know what happens in non-residential construction or residential construction. So we just think it's just still too dynamic to be able to predict accurately. So there is puts and takes and we just don't know, so we're going to plan conservatively.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I've got to say, the Aerospace margins, given some of the trends you've seen in both OE and aftermarkets are pretty impressive. Now, mix becomes so I'm assuming, a friend to you in 2010. So would you go as so far to say that Aero margins in the 15 to 10% range are probably a good trough number?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so those segment margins that we -- you gave out earlier on, they're still good ranges?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Nigel there is some tweaks to those relative to what we had communicated in previous quarters just because of the dynamics of softer top line additional cost savings. And so I think that, I mean they are in the range, but there are tweaks, pluses and minuses.</p>

          <p>Okay. Okay.  And then on UOP, you mentioned that you'll have a better read-through by the end of this quarter. How much variability do you think there is in the backlog at this stage? And do you think that UOP can grow in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's still tough to know at this point, Nigel.  I mean similar to the last question, we have a lot of puts and takes in the portfolio. So far, backlog has held up well given the environment.  How that changes over the next year and half is just tough to know.  Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's still pretty dynamic both on the petrochemical side as well as on the refining side as we mentioned earlier. We had sort of a forecast for commodity costs and oil and crude and refining margins. I mean those are the kind as you know key assumptions Nigel, that are going to drive this as well as credit availability for the non-nationals and the non, if you will, global players. So there is a lot of things that are going to be in the mix here that are going to flow into the shape of the economic recovery. The leading indicators are looking positive right now, but some of these things are actually &#x2013; will lag that. So the shape and timing of the recovery, all those things are going to be influences. So we'll have a lot better visibility as we get towards the end of the year. And as usual we'll provide as much color as we can as we provide guidance for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The thing we do know, Nigel, is with any kind of economic recovery, you know the energy crisis is coming back.  There is nothing that has really been done over this past year and a half to change that equation.  So with recovery and more demand, we're going to be right back in that same profile.  There's still going to be the need for refining capacity, heavy crude.   I know there is an article today about that those facilities aren't being used as much but we're going to be right back in that box again without any kind -- with any kind of recovery. So how that plays through in '10 and how quickly that adds to the backlog, it's just tough to know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just finally some companies have been a bit more granular on their &#x2013; certainly have a stronger view on the inventory destock cycle, either calling for an end first or approach an end to that process. I mean, are you prepared to say that maybe there's another quarter or so of inventory headwind before you get to that neutral situation or do you just kind of want to go away from that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would like to think that they are right about that. At least in our -- the history that we've seen in the past is having a true understanding of what that end market inventory is that they're destocking from is not always the easiest thing to do. And we're -- again we're trying to plan conservatively and say this just keeps going for at least another couple of quarters because we think it's the smarter bet to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful, thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Citi Investment Research.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to get a nature, an idea of the nature of the restructuring you're doing now, and the reason I ask the question is, what you did here in the quarter seems to have very high and very rapid payback which would not have been my guess kind of two or three years into a fairly aggressive restructuring program. So can you give us a little color on actually what it is you're doing and there is kind of more of that kind of laying around in certain places that you continue to pick away at?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we just kind of keep these gems around waiting for a tougher time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Payback, that is quick. 130 million bucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, it's really most interest related, Jeff. And it's really just reflective of our end market conditions, what we're seeing.  It's also reflective of what the benefits that we're getting out of our initiatives, particularly HOS. We're freeing up and I think you've seen some examples of that freeing up, meaningfully both square feet and labor capacity if you will as a result of HOS, FT and the FT actions that we continue to promulgate, the ESSA enabled by the SAP and ERP roll out.  It sounds like sort of company buzz words, but substantially that's what's driving or enabling our ability to continue to take out census, and I think most of this is really referred to as structural in terms of the cost benefit that's going to endure, that's going to support us in terms of 2010, '11 and '12. I mean for the most part, these are costs, Jeff, costs that are not coming back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Cash flow clearly looked good, but the second biggest line after net income is other in the free cash flow statement. What is that, and will that continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, some of the other includes the non-cash pension expense that's in other and also some changes in accrued liabilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the movers there Jeff, are the long-term receivables which we mentioned on the call of about $140 million. But also there's the currency translation piece of the cash flow statement is also in other, so between those two items, there are about say 90 to about 140 each. That is I think the majority of the change in other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Partly Jeff, when you do the math and you look at the conversion adjusting for the those items, for example, just adjusting for the sale of the long-term receivables, about 140 million that Murray referenced and we talked about earlier, you're still looking at very high 180, 190% type of conversion to cash flow net income relationship in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then finally, just the timing on the DEEV shares and the stock's actually doubled since four in Q1, why now and how have they been marked? And do they get marked back up if the stock moves around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's really the arcane, other than temporarily impaired accounting treatment that's for equity instruments, financial instruments, investments. The SEC really and FASB really want you to mark-to-market at the end of a year if there is material change and if you will sustain change in their valuation. And in this case, values are down not quite 50% from the values at the time that we did the acquisition in which we originally recorded the value of the 6 million shares. So it's really at the one year mark. Again it's really driven more by the, if you will the regulatory relation or regulatory guidelines and the accounting.</p>
          <p>So we felt it was prudent to do it, the right thing to do. And obviously, it's going to represent it at the time that we determine the right time to monetize those assets, those 6 million shares. It's going to represent just that much more in terms of an upside for us in terms of the accounting gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that value will now not move around until you actually sell the shares.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the only &#x2013; the exception to that which we don't anticipate at all would be any further serious deterioration in their value and sustained deterioration over the next year. So you'd be looking at it again at the June 30, 2010 time period. We don't anticipate that; shares are already up from the time -- from the January &#x2013; or June 30, rather, valuation. So I think, reasonably, the expectation should be that this represents a future gain for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not saying it's logical Jeff.  It is the accounting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we have time for one more question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our final question today comes from Robert Stallard of Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just quickly on the destocking, this might be hard to do, but how much do you think commercial aerospace aftermarket inventories of the airlines have gone by?   Are we talking about months in reserves going down to weeks in reserves?  And when do you think this could come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's interesting to see.  When we do the comparison versus the last recession, the destocking went on quite a while, I'd say like 15, 18 months something like that. This time though, it is significantly more rapid than it was last time. So it's like last time while they were doing it in small increments every quarter, it has been very rapid this time. So we're seeing 4% decline in flight hours yielding 20 and 25% declines in spares, whereas last time that would have been more like in the 10 to 15% range.</p>
          <p>So if we had to guess, we'd say the destocking cycle is more like nine or 12 months rather than say 18 it went through last time. So if we had to say when it changes, we'd probably say sometime first half of 2010. But it's really just tough to peg as we were saying earlier because nobody really has a good handle on how much inventory is out there and the extent to which can cannibalization can occur on parked aircraft.  We just don't know; nobody does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of your assumptions for the full year, you've not built in any big reversion to the norm in your aftermarket forecast, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Grainger for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'd like to pass the call back to Dave for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's clearly a tough time and much tougher than it was in the last recession just six years ago. And as you recall, we didn't perform well or execute well during that last recession. We lost money two years in a row, our cash flow was sparse, and importantly coming out of the recession, our new product cupboard was bare. Investors weren't happy and neither were our employees. Going into this recession, investors had a lot of questions about whether this could be a reprise of what happened to us last time. And hopefully by now, we've been able to show it's not. We are a different company.</p>
          <p>We're performing and we're executing and most importantly, we continue to invest in our future. We continue to invest in our big process initiatives, specifically the Honeywell Operating System, Functional Transformation and Velocity Product Development.  We continue to invest geographically and our new product pipeline is very flow and that's in every business.</p>
          <p>This is very clearly a different company, the portfolio, the execution and the performance. We're showing it in this down cycle and more importantly we'll show it when the upswing happens. And that upswing will happen, and we intend to be your best investment, not just during this tough time, but also during the recovery. So thanks for listening.</p>
