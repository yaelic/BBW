        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Welcome. Thank you for coming to our Preliminary Results Presentation today.</p>
          <p>The agenda today is slightly different than usual. I will give the usual highlights to open. Then I will pass to Andy, who will cover all the financial information and the guidance. Then I will come back with Steve Pusey to illustrate the progress we made in the implementation of our strategy and in particular the growth areas, technology as an enabler of our SuperMobile strategy and challenges and opportunities in the year ahead, and then we will open to questions.</p>
          <p>So highlights. Group organic service revenue plus 2.1% in the year, in the quarter four plus 2.5%. I would say we have displaying today &#x2013; we are displaying today a strong commercial performance in most European and most emerging markets, exceeded guidance AOP at &#xA3;12.2 billion at the top end of the range and free cash flow at &#xA3;7.2 billion, again at the top end of the range.</p>
          <p>We have raised or we are in the process of raising &#xA3;14.2 billion from disposals with &#xA3;6.8 billion of those committed to share buybacks. And finally, we are recommending today an increase in our dividend per share of 7.1% to 6.05p leading to the total to 8.90p which again is 7.1%. And as we highlight to you later, I think we have made good progress on our strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to Andy who will cover results and guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, good morning and hopefully my voice will hold up, so just some key numbers on here. So &#xA3;45.9 billion total revenue for the period, 3% up year-on-year, EBITDA &#xA3;14.7 billion, and I will come to more detail on this in a bit, but that's basically sort of flat to slightly down on the last year. And &#xA3;11.8 billion published adjusted operating profit. The numbers that Vittorio had there were on the same FX rates as we guided at.</p>
          <p>And then two important numbers there on the lower slide here, a gain of &#xA3;5.3 billion and impairment charges of &#xA3;6.1 billion. So the gain of &#xA3;5.3 billion is the aggregate benefit we've had from the profit on disposal of the China Mobile interest, SoftBank and some tax provision releases. And on the impairment side, we took a charge if you remember at the half-year for Greece. We have now topped that up primarily for Spain, but also for Ireland, Portugal and Italy. And the total for the year is &#xA3;6.1 billion. That is driven in part by macroeconomic, particularly Southern Europe, but in larger part by interest rate rises and the impact that that has on discount rates. The adjusted earnings per share then was up 4% at 16.75p.</p>
          <p>So if I move then on to the service revenue, service revenue at &#xA3;42.7 billion, was up by 2.1% on an organic basis for the year. I will talk about the quarterly trends on the next slide but &#xA3;2.1 up for the full-year. Splitting that between the two regions, Europe was down very slightly minus 0.4% and AMAP was up by a very strong 9.5% and again I will give a bit more detail on those in a minute.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA margin was down 1.1 percentage points, so we had originally said that we would see a reduced level of margin erosion compared with the previous year. That is what has happened, again, more detail later but a lot of that driven by cost savings offsetting the extra investment in SuperMobile and like customers.</p>
          <p>Associated income &#xA3;5.1 billion, the biggest part of that is Verizon wireless &#xA3;4.6 billion and that is an 8.5% increase in contribution from the U.S. And free cash flow at just over &#xA3;7 billion is the second year running that we have had the free cash flow over the &#xA3;7 billion number some significant working capital in there but equally a continued focus on building out the network, which Steve will talk about later on.</p>
          <p>So if you look at this in terms of quarterly trends in gray you have got the quarterly trends going back five quarters on the service revenue so we were negative five quarters ago, if you go back eight quarters we were sort of minus 3% territory and we have come through to 2.5% for the second successive quarter as we have exited the year.</p>
          <p>And if anything that is, sort of, more commendable because as the red bar show to the numbers on an equivalent basis before the MTR cuts actually the impact of the MTR cuts was slightly more significant in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>In terms of the year-on-year walk we have added &#xA3;1 billion of revenues over the period &#xA3;41.7 billion in the previous year, &#xA3;42.7 billion last year. I think the most noticeable thing here is how for the first time the data revenue increase has now fully funded the reduction in the voice revenues. The voice revenues itself being very, very largely shifted by the MTR cuts, but data now &#xA3;5.1 billion for the full year, which is a 26% increase year-on-year and in fact the annualized rate in the last quarter was more about &#xA3;5.5 billion.</p>
          <p>So very strong performance on data and actually as you walk across this table in all other product areas: so messaging, fixed and wholesale, we have seen increases like-for-like on the revenue streams to come to the &#xA3;42.7 billion number for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now if I talk for a few minutes about operational performance, the European region as I've said earlier the revenues there are down 0.4% which is the gray bar on the right. What we have done here is shown the build of the various contributions from the different operating companies to get to that minus 0.4 number. The minus 0.4 itself was obviously MTR affected that would have been plus 2% but for the MTRs.</p>
          <p>So you can see a very, very significant contribution from Turkey, I'll talk to each of this just briefly in a minute, U.K., Netherlands Germany and held back by Italy, Greece and Spain and there are details on each of the operating companies in the appendices to the pack.</p>
          <p>So just very briefly then on Turkey, I mean, a really, really strong year 30% of revenue growth in the last quarter, similar actually to the full year run rate on revenue growth. They have taken 5.9 percentage points of service revenue market share in a 12% month period, ARPU up by 23% and overall business just performing really well. The mix of contract customers has also increased significantly about 16% a year ago now 28% and like our other businesses pushing very hard on the data front.</p>
          <p>U.K., again, a good really good period for the U.K. Nice to see it now taking the largest revenue growth in the market, 5.8% in the fourth quarter revenue growth there, big, big focus upon data with the revenue stream there growing by very nearly 30%. Churn now coming down to sort of low levels and adding about 1 million net contract customers per annum and has been doing that as a regular basis recently.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll not talk about Netherlands now, Vittorio has a couple of comments on that later on. So I will instead just move on to Germany. The numbers there most impacted by the impacts of the mobile termination rate cuts at the start of the quarter. So, if we had not had those the reported revenue growth of 0.2 would actually been a 4.4 percentage increase in the revenues.</p>
          <p>Again, big push on data, very strong growth there, 25.5% on the data revenues and also very, very big push on enterprise with about 3.2% increase in the revenues from our enterprise customers, and again, a business that has gained market share in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Moving then on to Italy, I think the best description here is a very, very strong performance against the main competitor, but a market that is now clearly more difficult. We had overall service revenue decline of 3% which was broadly the mobile going backwards by 5%, but the fixed going forwards, going upwards by double-digits. Data, again, a big push, 20% growth in data revenues and exited the period with 5.5 million smartphone customers.</p>
          <p>In Spain, we have reported 5.9% revenue decline for the fourth quarter. There were couple of accounting true-ups, so on an underlying basis it is more 7.7%, so pretty similar to the trends that we have seen in recent quarters, still quite a challenging environment, still pushing very hard on data and a number of pricing and distribution and advertising initiatives that have been pushed in the market even in recent weeks.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the areas that the European region was focused upon at the start of the year, top left here is the push to smartphones, so 18.7% of the base have now got smartphones, that is up about seven percentage points compared with the year previously. Top right, a big focus upon the enterprise base, that is now approaching &#xA3;9 billion of revenues and a lot of big customer wins there. In fact our Vodafone Global Enterprise business unit grew its revenues by 8% during the year.</p>
          <p>Repositioning key markets, bottom left, particularly the U.K. and Turkey clearly are gaining traction. And finally and I think particularly importantly, the focus that there has been on cost has resulted in the second successive year of the cost in Europe coming down by around 4%.</p>
          <p>So moving then on the AMAP region, I said earlier, 9.5% growth for the region overall. India has clearly been the biggest contributor there, but essentially all but one country have been in positive territory, the one country being Egypt. If we have cut this off at the end of December Egypt would have been in positive territory as well. So, clearly, down rest in the last quarter has just nudged that slightly the wrong side of the line for the moment. But nonetheless across the whole of the region I think a very, very strong performance.</p>
          <p>So if you just look again at the key markets here, India had service revenue growth in last quarter of 18.7%. We had record net customer adds in the last quarter at 10.3 million. We gained 1.8 percentage points of revenue market share during the period and continue to see market prices stabilizing. So I think the operational performance in India has been really, really strong.</p>
          <p>For the Vodacom Group and for South Africa as well, again, growth there has been good. We have seen in the South African market growth of about 6% and that has been both the push on voice where the minutes-of-use per customer is now rising quite nicely and also a big push on data; 37% growth <mark type="ph" /> in data and particularly mobile broadband that is helping (14:05) to drive that.</p>
          <p>So in terms of the AMAP region and its strategic priorities, the total customer base at the end of the period for the region is now 220 million customers. That is a 26% increase year-on-year. India is about 61% of that total base.</p>
          <p>On the top right I think a very important chart, the free cash flow, the operating free cash flow being generated by this region has gone up from essentially nothing up to over &#xA3;1.5 billion and now near &#xA3;2.5 billion over a three-year period; so a very, very significant increase there contributing nearly a quarter of the Group's operating free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Data on the bottom left also a good story. 40% increase in data revenues, so a total of &#xA3;1.2 billion, and so of the Group's &#xA3;5.1 billion, &#xA3;1.2 billion is coming from these markets. And then finally a lot of this being achieved by the push we had have on new devices and new innovative products to get really the brand name further extended into the market.</p>
          <p>So, I'll move now off the sort of operating performance of the countries and just talk a little bit about the financials. The EBITDA to margin, which I know a lot of people have an interest in, top left hand chart is showing the 1.1% reduction in the margin year-on-year at the group level. And it is showing that the vast majority of that reduction was Europe. AMAP was, in the overall scheme of things, fairly constant.</p>
          <p>The bottom left hand chart then is focused on Europe, which is showing really two key drivers there, one is the big focus on smartphones, acquiring new customers; the other is the initiatives we've had to get costs out of the business and to in part fund the customer growth. As I said earlier the growth in the customers has really started to pull through some percentage points more smartphone penetration in the base than we had a year ago.</p>
          <p>We now have 39% of our European customer base on contract compared to 37% year ago. The business churn is now down a percentage point compared with the year ago. So huge focus there and really I think starting to pull through a lot of costs initiatives, which have helped to fund some of that.</p>
          <p>AMAP I think important to note AMAP is now 27% of the group's EBITDA up from 22% a year ago. The margins there were up about 20 basis points year-on-year and certainly as we go forwards and look to the scale benefits we are very comfortable that we should see a good margin performance in the AMAP region over the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>Now on to the U.S., Verizon Wireless, as I said earlier another strong period here so just on the $60 billion of revenues, up by 5.8% took most of the total market contract net adds in the last quarter, churn down at very, very low levels and free cash flow generation very, very strong. A year ago about $22 billion of net debt, at end of March that was down to $9.6 billion, so basically down $1 billion a month or I think in the duration of this presentation about $2 million less debt by the end of it than the start of it.</p>
          <p>In terms of margin, the overall comparison of margins in the &#x2013; across the operators in the U.S. again Verizon Wireless compares very favorably there. Data has been a big part of that push, coincidently also a 26% increase in the data revenues. So similar to what we've got in Vodafone and smartphone penetration also being pushed, interestingly somewhat higher levels than we've so far achieved in Europe.</p>
          <p>And there has been a lot of focus on the LTE rollout. So as I am sure many of you all know that has now commenced, there will be by the end of this calendar year about 185 million of the population will be able to get LTE service. And there are today 500,000 4G devices in active use.</p>
          <p>And we are working ever more closely with Verizon on a number of initiatives, particularly on major customer accounts, where we've got common interest in those accounts. Also on the procurement side, we clearly spend huge amounts between the two businesses and also looking at the LTE roadmap which with our embarking upon that in Germany and other markets in due course, is clearly an area where there are joint learnings for both of us.</p>
          <p>So on to finance costs, the bottom line &#xA3;815 million is fairly similar to last year, but I think the key things is to observe that there are some non-recurring items that are included in these numbers. So the top part of this chart, you can see &#xA3;1.2 billion of financing cost.</p>
          <p>Underneath that there are three items which will not recur, one is we have been accreting the value of the SoftBank Financial instruments prior to the disposal in the financing cost line. Secondly, the benefit of the China Mobile dividends comes through here; and thirdly, we were capitalizing the cost of some of the borrowings to do the India 3G license, which obviously will not be a recurring feature, that only happens up until the launch of the 3G service.</p>
          <p>So basically we should be thinking that the &#xA3;1.2 billion number is sort of the underlying watermark there. That was about a 4% finance cost. I would expect that we will see the finance cost for the coming year start with the number 5. We have got rising interest rates. We are fixing more. We will actually have more cash on deposit for a period this year when we have the SFR proceeds in, etcetera.</p>
          <p>So on free cash flow; we were &#xA3;7.2 billion at the prior year. We've closed last year at &#xA3;7.0 billion. Important to note in here is that there is a significant working capital contribution. We have pushed very hard on working capital again. So the &#xA3;0.5 billion you can see here is the increase year-on-year. In reality we had about &#xA3;0.5 billion in the previous year. We have got about &#xA3;1 billion, so &#xA3;1 billion of the &#xA3;7 billion is actually working capital in the current year.</p>
          <p>Cap adds, interest, EBITDA all fairly similar; slightly higher cash and tax outflows just because of some tax benefits in the previous year; slightly higher minority dividend payments particularly in South Africa and Egypt; and the FX having a &#xA3;0.2 billion effect so overall the &#xA3;7 billion.</p>
          <p>Just put on the right here the &#x2013; just as a sort of guide going forward, we will not be generating &#xA3;1 billion a year of working capital, much as I'd like to be doing that. I don't think that is realistic; is not going to happen. So we sort of put that down implicitly to about &#xA3;0.3 billion next year. That will still be about &#xA3;2 billion of working capital though generated over a three-year period. And clearly next year we will not have the benefits of some of the cash streams coming in. So we will get the reduced SFR dividend as a consequence of the exit agreement and we will not have a China Mobile dividend. So on a, sort of, pro forma basis sort of &#xA3;6 billion is a core number, which I'll come back to when we come on to the guidance.</p>
          <p>Net debt at the start of the period was &#xA3;33 billion and net debt at the end of the period was just fractionally under &#xA3;30 billion. Some quite big moving parts in that, so the free cash flow, the &#xA3;7 billion we just talked about, &#xA3;4.5 billion of equity dividends paid out. The share buyback at the end of March was &#xA3;2.1 billion. Acquisitions and disposal, that is primarily the proceeds from the China Mobile disposal and the first tranche of the Softbank proceeds.</p>
          <p>Licenses and spectrum was the Indian and Germany spectrum auctions in the first half of the year. Tax related payments was primarily the first payment of the CFC resolution in the UK plus some tax on the disposal in China Mobile and then there were some FX movements and the total &#xA3;30 billion or &#xA3;29.9 billion at the end of the period. So I think that leaves us in good shape for the coming period as we go forwards.</p>
          <p>So turning on to sort of portfolio. I think if you step back, this has been a pretty significant year and we said a year ago that we had a number of non-controlled assets that we wanted to work our way through. We appreciate the patience that shareholders have shown so we are able to time these and get what we believe have been very good prices out of those assets.</p>
          <p>So, at a high level &#xA3;14.2 billion raised, that's net of very small tax charge, but not significant. About half of that is committed to share buybacks so &#xA3;6.8 billion and the rest we have retained in the knowledge we got spectrum auctions and tax cases around. So overall I think this is a right balance between returns and the management of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>You can see on the left-hand side in terms of return to shareholders, the combination over the last three years of the dividends plus the buybacks, is about &#xA3;16 billion that had been returned in cash by the end of March.</p>
          <p>We have still got the buyback commitment of the &#xA3;4 billion from the SFR disposal and the remainder of the first buyback programs still to complete, that is another &#xA3;5 billion. So, in total about &#xA3;21 billion of cash going back, that is about 25% of our market cap. In addition, we have committed to continuing with the 7% per annum dividend increase. So, I think, we're in good shape in balance sheet and returns perspectives.</p>
          <p>Now on to guidance. First of all, last year and how did that out turn? At this time last year we were saying we would be in the &#xA3;11.2 billion to &#xA3;12.0 billion range on the profit. We, in November, increased that to &#xA3;11.8 billion to &#xA3;12.2 billion and we have actually come out at &#xA3;12.2 billion, and actually we have absorbed the iPhone launch costs of Verizon Wireless in getting to the &#xA3;12.2 billion number. So in some senses that slightly understates the number.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow, we said we would be above &#xA3;6.5 billion. We've come in at a reported &#xA3;7 billion or on the same FX basis at &#xA3;7.2 billion. We said the margin reduction &#x2013; rate reduction would be significantly lower. We've half the rate reduction. And on the CapEx, we said the CapEx would be at similar levels to the previous year, which is what has happened.</p>
          <p>More importantly, moving on to the guidance for the year that has just started, first of all, just sort of some mathematical changes, clearly we're not going to have the profit contribution that will be coming in from the SFR disposal. We'll have a reduced cash flow coming in, as I mentioned earlier, because of the SFR disposal, China Mobile and the working capital. So, the sort of rebased numbers, if you like, are about &#xA3;11.3 billion on the profit and &#xA3;6 billion on free cash flow.</p>
          <p>What we've done is looking at the overall environment we're in, the strength of the performance in many markets, the continuing challenges in the Southern European markets, MTR cuts etcetera, is we have put the guidance for the current year at &#xA3;11.0 billion to &#xA3;11.8 billion and the free cash flow at &#xA3;6.0 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion.</p>
          <p>So implicitly within that we're saying sort of 1 to 4% revenue, service revenue growth range we've given for the medium-term. Realistically, whilst we are still coming out of recession, we still got the MTR cuts. I think we will see ourself in the lower part of that. And I think we'll see ourself in the lower part of that in the first quarter of next year, and then hopefully over time as we come through that we can pick up the pace there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the medium-term guidance, just one point on this, again, referring back to the loss of the cash streams from the two disposed asset, about &#xA3;0.5 billion comes out of the cash flow as a consequence of that. So roughly &#xA3;6 billion to &#xA3;7 billion becomes instead &#xA3;5.5 billion to &#xA3;6.5 billion. Clearly, with having done the share buybacks, we've also reduced the number of shares in count and therefore the dividend basically is reducing proportionately and we're reconfirming the 1 to 4% target on the revenue growth and the target of having margins stable by the end of the period. And the dividend commitment for 7% per annum growth continues.</p>
          <p>So in summary, before I hand back to Vittorio, I think a reasonably successful year, 2.1% of underlying growth, good control of costs, good control of CapEx and significant proceeds raised from disposals, with big commitments back to shareholders and the 7% increase in the dividend, underpinning all of that and maybe we will see where we go with the U.S. over time.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll hand back to Vittorio.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. What I would like to do now is to update you on the key elements of the growth strategy that we illustrated in November, last year highlighting, where we think we are doing well and also indicating where we think that either we or the industry should do better.</p>
          <p>I will not cover all the growth elements that we indicated last year. I am not covering today total communications. We have a good growth in fixed, 5%. We'll not cover new services like machine-to-machine, where we have been doing well with &#xA3;140 million, &#xA3;150 million of revenues, but I will really focus on the three important ones, which are data, enterprise and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>So let me start with data. Data clearly continues to be a good story for Vodafone, as you can see from the chart, we've moved our growth rate from 19% to 26%. Data is now 12% of revenue, mobile internet specifically is growing 54% and I have to say the story is still in the early days. Penetration bottom part of the chart, penetration of data users in Europe is 37%, up seven percentage points. But smartphone penetration, which is the blue bar is just at 19%.</p>
          <p>So there is lots more ground to cover. And I have to say, we are talking mostly so far about contracts, they are still pre-paid, pre-paid is about 10% penetration in Europe and of course in emerging markets. So data is and continues to be the focus. At Vodafone, we have taken deliberately a leadership position here. As you can see the share of shipments of the smartphones it's the grey part of the top chart, has gone up, has gone up by choice, 38% now. It's clearly &#x2013; there is an iPhone effect, but this is not just an iPhone effect.</p>
          <p>Last year some of you might remember, I said we want sub &#x20AC;100 smartphones. We have got them. Actually today we are showing a new one, which is the Smart &#x2013; the Vodafone Smart at &#x20AC;90. And we are convinced that the more we broaden our smartphone portfolio, the more we lower the enterprise; the better will be the economics of our data strategy.</p>
          <p>Now an important element, very important element of the data strategy is what is in the box which is integrated data pricing and tiering. Now, it's very important. For some &#x2013; we wanted to show you some case study or some practical examples, and for some reasons that I'm not sure I remember, we decided to pick the Netherlands, which are an interesting market.</p>
          <p>Now Netherlands, the top part of the chart indicates that our trends, this is the full year trend. I think on your papers it might be printed Q4, but it's really full year, the full year trend of our revenues in the Netherlands. And, of course, as you can see, yes there is voice erosion especially driven by MTR. In the last quarter, there is also some kind of underlying voice erosion. But the other elements of our revenues: data, messaging and everything else are actually up and as a result revenues are up.</p>
          <p>In the Netherlands we have a very good 77% attach rate. Attach rate is the amount of people who get a data pricing bundle together with a smartphone. And this has not happened, I would say, by its own. As you see in the bottom part of the chart, the proportion of our contract customers in the Netherlands who have an integrated voice data SMS plan, is now about half and it has come up a lot recently. This is very important, because when you ride the data wave, you also have to take into account customers' behavior, and customers' behavior is what drives at the end of the day what our revenues will be in the future.</p>
          <p>So if you look at what has happened in The Netherlands, next slide, you see that our billed ARPU, so the part of the ARPU that the customers pay actually has remained broadly stable. This is clearly allocation of different components. So allowances for voice, for data, for SMS might have changed, but again part of our job is exactly to manage this mix, so to mix the ingredients, so that the recipe remains a tasty recipe for us.</p>
          <p>The bottom part of the chart indicates what percentage of the total bill is actually contracted at the month, and this is again the second reason why it's very important to manage proactively pricing, because this reduces the risk that we have on our revenues for out of bundle usage. So customers within the bundle can move their usage on the communication platform that they prefer, but still we have a kind of higher proportion of our billed ARPU guaranteed.</p>
          <p>Then the third element, which is very important, is what we'd call the tier pricing. You can see it -- again, this is the Dutch example, of course, in the bars. Customers get in at &#x20AC;25. For &#x20AC;25 they get 250 megabytes. But we are not giving away the upside potential. So, if they want to use more, they can give us &#x20AC;5 more. If they want to use much more and they also want to use VoIP, they can &#x2013; for &#x20AC;40 kind of do what they want.</p>
          <p>So not only we are kind of mitigating the impact of changes in behaviors from the customers but we are also preserving the possibility of the upside. This is clearly something that has to be managed it's not something that comes automatically but we think is the right answer to the trends in the data world.</p>
          <p>Second element of the growth strategy that I illustrated in November was enterprise. Now enterprise is a very, very good area for Vodafone, it's today about 30% of our revenues in Europe, it's about 15% of our customers. In enterprise we had a 37% market share, which is good and it's a growth engine for Europe. In Europe we grew 0.5% in business in the total business area while consumer was down in the year.</p>
          <p>And this is happening both at the mid-end and low-end where we have products like One Net where we basically leverage on the trend to get integrated fixed and mobile services for those type of companies. But also at the high-end Andy mentioned, VGE [Vodafone Global Enterprise] multinational accounts 8% growth interesting information, which is first time we disclose, our new contract value, which is a little bit what has been contracted for the future has for the first time this year exceeded &#xA3;1 billion. It's very good not just for the blue blood names of customers that we get but also because, of course, this leverages on our strength.</p>
          <p>Now in enterprise we see some trends which are I think comforting for Vodafone because we are in the right position to exploit them. Let me mention three, first mobile proliferation of mobile devices in companies is basically exploding. I often meet CEOs or CIOs to ask what's &#x2013; what can we do for them, and the answer is always, please help us manage all these nice things that we all, I think more or less legally bring on the company's networks because we like to bring our own devices and we have iPods and tablets and PCs and MACs and everybody has his own taste. Companies are unable at this point to control this. But they need to control the impact of this which is the first request.</p>
          <p>The second request is clearly helping them manage the complexity that is deriving from this: fixed mobile services together, spending which goes across different devices. And again, this is a strong request for telecommunication services management coming mostly from the high-end, but more and more also from mid-end and then, of course, the multi-county management thing kind of, can I have the same service from Vodafone across the 5, 6 and 10, 20, 50 markets where we work.</p>
          <p>Now we at Vodafone have taken some actions, I think, early on, started probably two, three years ago. Let me mention a few of them. We have increased our sales force size, so it's the area of the company where we are hiring people. We have bought some companies with relevant assets, telecom expense management companies to help these companies manage &#x2013; I'll say vertical and horizontal complexity. We had added new services. Of course, telecommunication services like One Net, but also more general services: security, device management, authentication and other things that are necessary in the company space to keep this booming area under control.</p>
          <p>And finally, I want to mention cooperation with Verizon, not just Verizon Wireless, but Verizon more in general, which gives us ability to follow our customers more broadly and in more countries. So enterprise remains a strong area of focus for us.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, emerging markets. Now I'm happy here to talk about the kind of four recently acquired or more recently acquired operations. We have 12% growth across them. We grow, Andy already mentioned, the great number in Turkey, about 30%, growth, might not be very big, but also 21% in Ghana is remarkable. India keeps growing well and at this point also being cash flow positive is a good contributor to the Group. South Africa, despite of the very high &#x2013; the very high market share they continue to grow &#x2013; to grow well.</p>
          <p>At the core of this, two things: one, the brand. We have &#x2013; the power of our brand is recognized everywhere. I received last night an e-mail, again from Ghana, I guess, where we got awarded, I don't know what special award for brand and brand management. We are now red even in Africa -- in the whole of Africa and we have speech marked, not rebranded, but speech marked Vodacom with great success. So, brand clearly is part of our strategy and it's clearly paying-off and the other one is clearly network, and Steve will cover more. But we are seeing that our ability to bring good technology and low cost technology everywhere is becoming more and more important.</p>
          <p>And the result is in the market shares that you see at the bottom part of the chart. Andy has already mentioned some of the great results. But I would say, again, this is a proof that the recently acquired operations are well managed and Vodafone is able to manage both in mature and in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, 70% penetration in the emerging markets, Europe is at much higher levels. So there is a voice opportunity going ahead. But I would say, and I always repeat, the most important thing is the data opportunity. In places where there is no Internet, where there is little communication &#x2013; fixed communication, a penetration of 18% in India, indicates that there is a huge potential to go. We have doubled the number of active customers in India, but still we're talking about a very low number. And these are early days for 3G in most of these places, so emerging markets will continue to be a great area of focus.</p>
          <p>Let me now handover for five minute to Steve who will talk about technology and how technology both IT and network side are enabling our SuperMobile strategy.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Vittorio, and good morning. What I'd like to do this morning is share with you how our technical strategy is supporting our mobile data growth opportunity and to do that I will focus on four areas.</p>
          <p>Firstly our network performance, then how our coverage strategy is evolving, how we are managing the data growth and the capacity, and lastly how we are changing our investment mix towards what we call unmatched customer experience.</p>
          <p>Firstly network, we know from our customers that this really matters. It is the foundation of the customer experience and it's what our customers measure us by. To that end, we do annual tests. We use an independent company to do this, a German company in this case, called P3 and we just completed around the 13 primary European countries here which I will give you the reference to.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased that we came out in front of our competition in 11 of the 13 markets and particularly strong in the largest four European countries. To support this, we are also very pleased that we further stretched our lead against competition in the key two attributes that customers measure and see as they're experiencing downloading video or streaming a piece of music which is downlink and uplink.</p>
          <p>You can see from the charts that we've further stretched the experience difference against our competition. This really matters, and we will continue to focus on best network.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, our customer base is moving and our footprint of customers is changing. With the advent of the smartphone the opportunity is a lot more ubiquitous. We know that people want to use their smartphones everywhere, and it has a huge data component and data opportunity.</p>
          <p>So to match this, we have to evolve our coverage strategy, and simply put we aim to have data everywhere that we have voice. This metric would take us beyond the 90% coverage and to that end we just completed the build of 8,500 new sites in Europe. And we also introduced UMTS900 this is a re-farm spectrum, which has particularly beneficial coverage attributes.</p>
          <p>So this is a policy we will continue throughout next year and the year beyond. But at the same time we've introduced a floor, a floor expectation of service for the customer. We've looked forward at the chipsets that are going to be available in smartphones and tablets and other devices, and to meet this we've decided that our floor service would be 14.4 or the worst experience if you want to look at that way as we increase this coverage.</p>
          <p>Today 65% of our European infrastructure is already at 14.4 or better, or better. And along with this, we pioneered a new piece of technology called Single RAN and for those that don't follow us, this is 2G, 3G, 4G one box or LTE-ready, if you want to label it that way.</p>
          <p>And we are pioneering this, we will have about 14 or 15% of our footprint upgraded as we go through this year, but that will accelerate as we do our radio refreshes in all of our major markets through the next couple of years, until we complete the build of the entire footprint on Single RAN.</p>
          <p>This is the primary deliverer of LTE in Germany today. It also has some benefits on OpEx, which is a nice side effect that the modern technology can reduce energy consumption by up to 40% which is quite material for our OpEx drive.</p>
          <p>Now, as we look at our data growth we see that from the chart it has been growing quite healthily year-on-year. 66% growth, it's now 80% of our total traffic, up about 5.6 points from last year. But it's eased slightly as we got through Q4 and that is largely due to the traffic management technologies that we've installed in our infrastructure.</p>
          <p>I'll highlight a few of these. Firstly, video management, the video management technologies, the trans-coding, the just in time delivery, the compressing, etcetera; that is reducing video throughput by between 20 and 40% in our networks.</p>
          <p>Similar techniques and technologies for web management are reducing capacity by between 10 and 20%. I'd also draw your attention to Wi-Fi offload, which we pioneered mostly for our enterprise customers but also those residential customers that have our own infrastructure where we now measure on average a 10% Wi-Fi offload of the traffic through our devices.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we pushed significant efforts on cost saving activities in other areas. We are big fans of network sharing. Now in Europe, over 40% of our sites are shared today and we continue to press ahead. Most of our new build is a shared site. We've continued to self-build transmission. We are now over 80% of self-build transmission.</p>
          <p>And we've standardize a lot. We've used our scale particularly in our procurement. When we look at IT, this is maintenance agreements, this is software licenses. And you can see in the last 12 months we've used our scale to cut corporate wide deals on a number of major IT supply arrangements with major vendors that you can see on the chart.</p>
          <p>This has conspired to allow us to keep a consistent level investment on CapEx, but shift it to performance that our customers can touch and in our OpEx we've been able to maintain a flat OpEx, in fact, you can see slightly declining year-on-year in real terms whilst managing both the customer traffic growth and the new footprint increases. So, we're pretty proud of the performance there.</p>
          <p>Now the CapEx mix is evolving. We get asked lots of questions. If I first draw your attention to the pie chart, we're still investing about 24% of our CapEx in volume or capacity. That hasn't increased year-on-year. In fact, one might argue that every time we site split we're actually improving coverage as well, so it's difficult to know where to put the barometer on this.</p>
          <p>But if you look at the headroom, we're very comfortable with the headroom we've got. Still today two attributes that we shared with you, the amount of sites that are, what we call, very hot in a busy hour, 90% utilization in the busy hour, is still only 8% of the footprint, it's up 1% year-on-year. And the general floor, which is going to become more important as we look at smartphones and the more general coverage of smartphones, is still only at 30%. We have headroom on capacity and we're comfortable with this.</p>
          <p>So what this has allowed us to do is shift our investment focus. Unmatched customer experience is our ambition to support our best network experience on the touch points where our customers touch Vodafone. These are largely IT investments in online, where we put big investments in online and the experience of our customers in customer care, particularly people can take their bills online, they can get their inquires online, a 70% increase on the amount of customers getting their queries dealt with online, on call centers, on our retail estate and on billing and CRM so we can put more creative propositions and the tiered pricing is one example of that.</p>
          <p>This is set to evolve or continue as we go forward and we have the greater ambition to make a difference with IT and differentiator in our experience. At the same time, though not to be missed we've kept the innovation in the networks and we are now up to 1,500 sites built in Germany with LTE and of course about 5,500 3G sites in India where we are supporting the growth of data.</p>
          <p>So to look to the future, what are we focused on? Well, paramount is best network experience. We'll continue to do that. It's really important. New technologies will be employed in the network; caching, content delivery are all in there, incubation is right now. We will continue to evolve through the HSDPA estate and the coverage in the LTE rollouts.</p>
          <p>We will introduce new technologies. We finished the global IT infrastructure for Vodafone. We are virtualizing all our data centers to deliver the Vodafone Cloud right now. Our early cloud services like One Net are in the market and we will continue those, enterprise particularly, but perhaps moving to consumer cloud services as we go through 2011.</p>
          <p>On enhanced services, we know things like security, device management, enhanced online services, bundles, flexible charging, bolt-ons, maybe family plans, are all important. Third party billing is a capability that we are enabling through the infrastructure that we built last year. And lastly I will draw your attention to rich communication services. This is an industry-wide initiative that we are doing with our peer group, with our competitors and you can think of this as like an extension of how SMS works today. It just works anywhere in the world and you enjoy it. We're extending that protocol between competitors, so that video calling, webpage sharing, address book sharing, presence location and multimedia can be shared in a consistent quality fashion across operators. You will take this for granted in the future.</p>
          <p>And lastly, our collaboration with Verizon, we truly think this can make a difference. We're sharing R&amp;D and technology roadmaps. We're shaping the industry through the decisions we're making due to our scale together. We'll collaborate on LTE, on evolution of LTE and IMS services, content delivery and of course the portfolio of machine-to-machine.</p>
          <p>So in summary, the best network, it matters, will continue, coverage with a floor, a preferred experience for our customers, IT, investments to support the unmatched customer experience and collaboration with Vodafone to press ahead with innovation of Vodafone First.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll hand back to Vittorio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Getting to the conclusion, let me spend a few words on challenges and opportunities. First of all, challenges, we have some challenges, which are just, I would say business as usual type of challenges. Competitor behavior, not always what we would like to see, or regulations, which we wouldn't like to see at all, but sometimes we see it. And this is I would say more kind of normal life.</p>
          <p>Economic outlook is a bit more specific, especially in Southern Europe, we see the economic outlook as a challenge and of course the monetization of IP based communication apps is going to be very important in the coming 12 months.</p>
          <p>Now, there are some corresponding opportunities to these challenges. The first one is clearly as I indicated a healthy pricing environment for data which will actually be a match to the previous challenge.</p>
          <p>Enterprise, where I think Vodafone has demonstrated good strength recently. I believe that there is some room for commercial cost rationalization in some of the European markets and again this is a competitive thing, but there is an opportunity with economy, economies being under pressure to rationalize there.</p>
          <p>Voice and data in emerging market and as it was mentioned by Steve, Verizon collaboration. Why am I confident that Vodafone is well positioned for the next 12 months? Here I have two remarks, one is the way we work, our operating model. And the second is how we manage people and incentives.</p>
          <p>Now, I was warned by my IR people not to show the chart that I am about to show, because they told me that it clearly indicates that in my DNA, there is still some dominant consulting gene. And again, it's not a dominant gene, be reassured it's just something from the past.</p>
          <p>How do we work together, I really believe that we have got a good operating model. The grey part indicates what is really I would call it centralized or led by the center. And it's where we really get scale advantages and this is purchasing where we are getting continuously benchmarked as the best buyer. But not just purchasing, shared services now, Andy is completing the whole ERP migration into Hungary. But then we have service centers in Egypt. We have service centers in India, which are becoming bigger and bigger. So it's not just low quality &#x2013; sorry, low cost it's also high quality skills.</p>
          <p>Standardization of network, getting best technology, using platforms across country, so we are getting the scale advantage, but we are also have found and this is more the blue area. The way to remain close to the markets to retain pricing flexibility, commercial closeness to what is required, strategic flexibility to do if needed different things across markets, regional CEOs, local CEOs full in-charge. And then of course there is a middle area, which is where we need to coordinate but basically leave also some local flexibility.</p>
          <p>I was recently visiting two large accounts, a large automotive company and a large bank, and again we were talking with my colleague from global accounts about cross-country device management. But of course there was also a local guy talking about how can we do something together in our market for &#x2013; whatever, payments or for in car telematics which again proves that we've found a very good and the very, I think, solid way of getting both flexibility and scale.</p>
          <p>The second element is really incentives. Here, I have to say with guidance from the board and the lot of work with our remuneration committee, I think we have worked well. First, we introduced strong cash flow incentives, which have led to the &#xA3;20 billion cumulative cash flow of this year.</p>
          <p>Last year, we changed emphasis on competitive performance, and again today I think last quarter we have been better than the reference competitor in 12 markets out of 16 and worse only in two and the two are Australia and Greece, which are a kind of small things in the context of Vodafone.</p>
          <p>So again, we have worked well, and I mentioned what we're doing now again with our remuneration committee, two things, we are for this year slightly rebalancing a bit profit versus revenue. We want growth, but we want profitable growth. And most important we are extending share ownership guidance not just to my top team and myself, but also to the local CEOs and the local teams. Again, to make sure that people who make on a daily basis money allocation decisions, whether it's CapEx or OpEx doesn't really matter, they have interest aligned with long-term shareholders and ownership. And I think this is proving again probably one of the most powerful changes.</p>
          <p>We have also changed a number of people in the last two years of the top 250. 25% have left the company and another 25% have changed jobs. So we have basically one person in two who is in a kind of old job and one person in two who is new to the job, which is again I think is part of the rejuvenation and the flexibility that we need to have.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, going back to my messages of more valuable Vodafone I think we have increased and &#x2013; or held market share in most markets, good growth from data, enterprise and emerging markets. Displayed control over cost, Europe cost down 4% with, I would say, strong strategic guidance from the Board and I think wise execution from us. We have managed well our disposals and committed to share buybacks. And finally we are delivering free cash flow without cutting investment which I think is important.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. I would ask my colleagues and Michel in particular to join me for the Q&amp;A session now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks it's a Tim Boddy from Goldman. On slide 37 in your Netherlands section you show how I think some 61% of contract monthly fee ARPU or rather billed ARPU for consumers on contracts is bundled, effectively. Could you give us a sense of what that number's like across your other major European markets? The context being, if we know how much of the ARPU is bundled or fixed, that helps us get more comfort as you manage this transition of voice to data in the revenue.</p>
          <p>And then secondly building on that, we obviously saw Microsoft acquiring Skype for quite a nice fee, and clearly that's come into the Windows Phone platform. Google have just made Google Voice operate an Android over 3G networks. Could you just talk a bit about how you feel about these changes in some of your suppliers' behavior?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me give you a broad answer, maybe Michel you can be more specific. I think that across the large European &#x2013; it's not exactly what you ask, but it's kind of in the same space. Across the large European, of course, we have to-date about 20% of contract customers who are on bundled tariffs, which is the equivalent of the 50% that you have seen in the Netherlands. So we are going there. I don't know if you Michel have kind of the exactly the same answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, so let me address to precise what Vittorio has said, so that's slightly more than 20% of the customers in the countries in which we have started to push. You have to have in mind that we have now integrated tariffs in all our European countries, but it's a move which is still a little bit new. And that generates more or less 30% of our revenue today. That's, let's say, in the base and when I look at the sales that's more than 50% of the customers in those different countries which are now entering directly in those integrated tariffs. So which means that, let's say, of course, it's going to increase in the next coming months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the broader question, first of all, I think Microsoft buying Skype was among the many outcomes, it's one of the best &#x2013; for sure for the seller in terms of price.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; let me tell you how I feel in general. In general, there is &#x2013; we are not worried of the kind of integration of VoIP application into operating systems. Because today, WhatsUp, Viber are basically freely downloadable anyhow. What we are really keen is to push the integrated price, kind of tier pricing as part of our strategy. If you think about what these apps do, they do basically two big things, voice calls and video calls.</p>
          <p>Now video calls will be the heavier part of it for which having tiered pricing is very important and voice calls, quite frankly, when you pay &#xA3;35 or &#xA3;40 per month and you have already 1,000 minutes included, more or less you don't care whether it's a VoIP call or not. So that's why we display The Netherlands case study, because it indicates that there is a strategy vis-&#xE0;-vis VoIP.</p>
          <p>I mark down Nick, Robin and then Robert maybe. Yeah. Sorry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Nick Delfas from Morgan Stanley. Just a couple on Verizon Wireless and Verizon and Vodafone cooperation, given that Chinese vendors are not selling to any significant degree in the United States, would it be right to surmise that the bulk of that benefit will go to Verizon Wireless as you start to coordinate your capital spending, your capital purchasing?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on quality of networks in Europe, are you already seeing an impact in the U.K., for example, from re-farming which could be a significant benefit for Vodafone since you have 900 megahertz spectrum in most markets?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the procurement side we're still going through sort of lining up where the spend is, and clearly there are aspects in terms of nationality of provider which are different. There are differences between the technology sets which are different albeit over time may start to, sort of, normalize. So I think it's just a little bit early to say where the balance of benefit will come through from. But the sheer scale of the absolute spend, even if some of it is not something we can get to immediately, says there's got to be real opportunities sitting out there and that's where we're going to go after.</p>

          <p>Yeah. If I may just to support Andy and add to that, don't forget the significant procurement in IT where it's completely standard both ways in core routing, and core infrastructure. You &#x2013; certainly, if you focus at the radio equipment that would be true, but we both buy from Ericsson as well, so there is quite a lot commonality there to consider.</p>
          <p>Secondly on the 900 question, we're quite new in the U.K. on 900 so certainly we're seeing the early benefits as we start to roll that out, a little more mature as we've been rolling it out in rural Italy and Spain. But we are definitely seeing the benefits of 900. We farmed it as at least a 3db gain, which increases the footprint coverage quite significantly.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. It's Robin Bienenstock from Sanford Bernstein. I have two questions, if I may. It looks really like over the long run Europe is looking like a zero sum game in terms of top line growth. And you are currently getting the better view of competitors, which is a nice change, but given that there are new value chain threats on the horizon I guess I'm asking, do you think you need consolidation? Some of your competitors are suggesting that you do, and are there any circumstances under which you'd participate in that?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you talk about the increasing complexity that a lot of your enterprise customers are noting in terms of smartphone, tablets, want some proliferation devices that's also starting to get down into the retail segment as well. So how do you think about your retail skills, how important is that going forward and is that going to lead to rising OpEx in European environment in particular? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'd say consolidation would be a good thing. There are a number of situations where I can see consolidation being beneficial to all. Clearly, the way it is going to go in the U.S. is going to be important because it indicates whether certain boundaries that maybe were set in force actually are not there. I'm not sure when you say, 'you' whether you mean you, the sector or you Vodafone. You, me, me, okay. That's very clear. And we would consider -- honestly, we would consider and you might remember in '08, made kind of statement was we will be a supporter of consolidation either passively or actively, I never ruled out active. You also have to see what our market share is. In some markets, we have market shares which probably would not allow us to go much more beyond, in other markets maybe we would consider. But I wouldn't rule out and for sure, we would not try to create problems to others if they want to consolidate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on retail, so as you clearly pointed out that for sure, that data is coming also in the retail space with multi-devices and we really want to position ourselves as we did data enable. So we've started a journey of transformation of our retail stake. For this, we're increasing the CapEx and OpEx within the retail, but by shifting some resources from other space within the company. So as you've seen the past two years we've decreased our OpEx and we continue to work in OpEx reductions. But we want to shift that, I guess that Steve mentioned what we are doing in IT in order to have the same type of system in retail but also online in customer care. We're let's say, moving to data experts in all our shops in order to provide advice to our customers, live devices, which will be presented in all the shops. So, you will &#x2013; you can expect a real change of our retail experience in the next coming quarters in all the countries we're driving that with marketing window.</p>

          <p>James Britton from Nomura. I've two questions please. Firstly, would you see the pre-paid segment as a more price sensitive segment has been at greater risk of cannibalization moving usage towards messaging away from voice and text and then how do protect against that shift in the pre-paid segment?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on network quality. We had &#x2013; we held- we were at an event last week where one of the peer operators referenced a YouGov survey in the U.K. on network quality in mobile broadband and that supposedly showed 3 as, I think, the best &#x2013; ranking the best in 11 of 12 categories on mobile broadband and Vodafone actually showing the worst in the majority of categories, can you just help us understand how that is &#x2013; how that is so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure, Steve will justify himself.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; let me take the first one, the pre-paid is by definition more price sensitive, not necessarily in the direction you were indicating, i.e., move away from voice into data, but in general is more price sensitive. We have been re-strengthening our presence in prepaid. Sometimes the decision, quite frankly is, are we better off working with a third-party, an MVNO type of operator, which in some cases has worked very well, because of distribution efficiencies and things like that. In other cases it's our own operation. But I would say it's more a general price sensitivity rather than more inclined necessarily to go &#x2013; to go to data and that's more or less the direction we are working on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just &#x2013; it's more of a market phenomenon, for your existing prepaid base, how do you stop them to moving their traffic on to instant messaging, obviously they've got to buy their own smartphone. But what's &#x2013; how can you stop the youth segment today just not spending money with you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say same as for postpaid, meaning that we are moving also in integrated tariffs into prepaid, that's much more recent, because up to now there were not so many smartphones. So we want to &#x2013; Vittorio has said previously, with smartphones now coming at lower price points, lower than &#x20AC;100, you will see in all the markets in which we do operate, we have started to implement top-up and get mechanism where you can get allowance of voice, text and data together. So which means that &#x2013; so let's say it's bundled or we are bundle -- or let's say that you can buy while you buy a few minutes, a few datas and a few texts. So the same type of principle that we applied in the consumer contract in order just to make sure that we sell bundle of stuff.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the second question, we look to those as well. It measures a whole range of things from broadband access in your home to mobility as well. We would like to think our testing is more extensive. We've used a standard test, a totally independent German company through 16 countries with extensive eight city majority testing, freely tested not provisioned on certain sites that might steer it one way or the other. So my only answer is we found what we found and largely some of our competitors have seen the same thing. So we will be looking into their methodology and how and what they do. We use regularly industry standard recognized testing methods in all these countries that you will find in other independent tests like the Connect test in Germany, etcetera.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from a commercial point of view and then probably Steve will add on from a technology, so we have already started to roll out 1,500 sites. We have now 10,000 customers up and running in Germany. We are getting more than 1,000 per week and so we see a quite great experience from our customers. I guess that some of us, Vittorio could has been able test it and so the quality is quite compelling. And we see it as a nice substitution tool, for example, in Germany where we are paying a lot of DSL lines to the Deutsche Telekom that let's say might be nice way to improve the profitability of our fixed business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the answer is, yes. We are very comfortable what we see. Shall we go back? Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Mark James from Liberum. Coming back to sort of smartphone economics, you are, in Europe, investing more on your customer base than you're extracting in terms of cost savings. Going against that, presumably contract lines are lengthening. Customer lifetime values, could you give us any indication as to whether you think they are going down or going up in terms of the net present value of the customer to you or payback period or some sort of measure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So customer lifetime value is increasing for different reasons. First, of course, the ARPU is increasing when we migrate from non-smartphone to smartphone. Second, we have leveraged this migration to smartphone in order to extend the duration of our contract. That has been the case, for example, in the U.K., but that's also the case in Netherlands. That's also the case in Spain where we are introducing also the ability to move up to 24 months. That's also the case in Italy where we go even slightly below 24 up to 30 month. And the third is that we see an input churn, let's say, on those type of customers, of course that's still early days. So we have to look at it very carefully into the next coming quarters. So for those different reasons we are quite comfortable with the allocation of commercial resources that we are putting right now. And I guess that Vittorio said earlier on, that's really a choice to have decided to push up on smartphones assuming that of course for each smartphone sold we sell as well a data attachment plan with the ability to monetize data with those types of devices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to be clear the potential is exactly where you pointed. So with more Android, with more RIM, we will see what happens with Microsoft and Nokia. With more choice and better economics for us, a very proactive management of this equation of the three elements we have for the commercial customer, lifetime can really yield very good results also because in Europe we start from low prices. I mean, so there is a natural upside, it has to be hard work. I have to be honest. Every time I go into shops I always ask the question, do we make more money on this one or on that one? What do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I push you for any quantification on that? If you think it's gone up, has it gone up 5% or 25%?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we will not give, let's say, precise figure on this one. Again, I get that what Vittorio mentioned and I think it's more qualitative answers. We are really &#x2013; and there is now complete shift in the mindset of our countries on data economics and the ability to really manage ARPU uplift which is generated by those integrated plans and also the ability to monetize the extra data, for example, we monitor how much our customers reach the cap in the bundles and how much of those customers are turning to extra data in order to really uplift the ARPU. And then we have, let's say, precise models in terms of device selections and price plan selections. So I think we'll come back probably with some additional figures.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. It's James Ratzer from New Street Research. I have two questions please. The first one was regarding your strategies for dealing with some of the weakness in Southern Europe. It seems as if in Spain you are cutting your pricing quite aggressively. There's quite a sharp drop in average pricing in the recent quarter and again you reduced prices in April whereas in Italy you seem to be holding your pricing versus the competitors' much higher. Why the kind of different strategy on pricing between the two markets please, and do you think it's sustainable in Italy to hold your average pricing above the competitors, if the economy remains weak?</p>
          <p>And the second question Vittorio on your slide about challenges ahead, you mentioned regulation. Clearly the MTR threat is well documented. What are the regulatory threats you actually see at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me quickly go through the second one, which is easy, the clear, the other one is data roaming. It's not big for us in economic terms. We have introduced price plans in December which should take care of this. As of June 1st, every British customer going abroad will be notified of what they, he or she should do in order to get these new tariffs. So we are proactively pushing this. That's another area, even if it's not big, but I would say, mainly MTR under regulation.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on the first one I will really give you a kind of directional. Every market is different. Spain had high prices and high commercial costs and Italy has lower prices and lower commercial costs. So the sustainability of the commercial formula is very different.</p>
          <p>And in Spain I think, Michel and (1:13:24) Shamid <mark type="ph" /> are doing the right thing in bringing prices down and trying to rationalize commercial costs. Because in a time of recession, you really want to lower prices and reduce your infrastructure, your commercial infrastructure. And of course this is a market thing that has to be more -- if you want my opinion, comparing countries. Spain is an over-invested market, as simple as that.</p>
          <p>Now in Italy, we have, you say we are more expensive, I think we are. It depends on what you look at. I think we are very competitive and it's in the numbers. I don't know if there is anything more you want to add?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's a starting point of competitive perception in Spain and Italy was probably different. And so that's why we have to rebalance this perception in Spain. And that's what we're doing right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. There was another one, yes another one down there and then we come back. Andrew?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a two questions. The first question is on the Indian wireless market. Essar has now exercised their put option. Could you just give us a quick update on what you have to do in terms of complying with foreign ownership rules there? And whether this might encourage you maybe to look at perhaps looking at a merger with a local Indian partner and how you view consolidation in the Indian wireless space?</p>
          <p>And second question is a boring old tax question for Andy, but on the tax side, you've reported cash taxes this year of &#xA3;2.6 billion, can you just say whether this does include any back tax payment from the CFC and also from the European deferred tax liabilities you reported a few years ago. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me pass both question the boring one and the fun, exciting one on India to Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So second one was no, and the first one was yes. Let me take them in order. The rules on the foreign ownership are fairly complicated, but the simple answer is that for a very small percentage of our stake, probably 2%, 3% maybe, we would probably look to find a local partner. But it would not be more than that.</p>
          <p>And secondly the 2.6 billion is our ongoing taxes. It is not the exceptional settlements in U.K or any other things.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Andrew Beale from Arete Research. Couple of Verizon questions, you would be disappointed if you didn't hear them, I guess. The Verizon Wireless cash balance at the first quarter was about $7 billion in round numbers. I guess, even dealing with all the maturities in May and November, it's probably going to end the year nearer $12 billion. I guess the first question is, what do you think of that balance sheet and whether it makes any sense?</p>
          <p>And secondly just on the cooperation with Verizon, I guess the chipsets, I guess are starting to come available in terms of multi-standard, able to do CDMA, LTE, HSPA, and so on. Is there anything that you're thinking of doing or you're doing with your vendors in terms of pushing sort of multi-standard handsets into at least the high-end smartphones such that you could traffic steer in a different way to improve the financials of Verizon, and perhaps buy in bulk much more efficiently for both of you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Andy and Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So you're right Andrew that the net debt figure in the Verizon Wireless business is masking, there is some long-dated debt that is not economic to prepay and therefore cash balances will accumulate. Some of the debt does need repaying, some of it actually quite imminently, but once that is done we should start to see the cash balance starting to build. All I can say is clearly over the course of the year, and as we go into next year with the cash balance building that we'll be not earning huge amount of interest, then obviously we would hope that there will be further discussions about what we can do to actually make sure the shareholders are getting greater value from that. But that's a discussion that will happen in due course.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And yes, chipsets offer us an opportunity for us both to work together, obviously in the short-term for LTE, Verizon needs to get the CDMA, LTE mix out. But similarly, as they evolve there, particularly the handset strategy having the opportunity to operate with HSDPA is attractive and that they are of course working with us on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>It's Will Draper, Espirito Santo. I was just reading the Sunday Telegraph last week and there was a big article on mobile health and some recommendations at the EU level which may come into force. What does Vodafone's research show on the issue of impacts on health? What do you need to do on this issue to be a socially responsible corporate? Do you take it seriously for example what can you do about it? And should investors be worried about this whole issue which appears to be just breaking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll give you kind of the broader answer. Maybe Steven you want to add. First of all it is a topic that at the Board level of course and throughout the year we follow continuously. We continuously track also with Verizon. This is another area that of course as you would imagine we compare notes a lot about. We access whatever the results on independent research. We keep reading. We keep looking. And so far we are comforted that there is no evidence, no scientific evidence of a connection between illnesses and use of mobile phones.</p>
          <p>So the best thing that we can do is to help independent research and researchers continue to research and research as much as they can. But so far we are comforted that there is no apparent risk in the use of mobile phones. And I think that the only think we can do is really to rely on independent research because this is the most reassuring thing for the customers. It is not our research saying something. It's independent research.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Maurice Patrick from Barclays. Question on CapEx. Some of your or some of the companies are increasing CapEx more in emerging markets. You stressed the network advantage you have at the moment. I wonder why you didn't consider increasing it yourselves and what &#x2013; is it that you didn't want to or you attempted to because at the recent management offsite you hinted towards thinking about not being ready to increasing it? So just your thoughts on could it go up &#x2013; would it go up, what will stop you in the future? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we pace our CapEx with the opportunity on returns. We have a model where we measure very accurate returns every base station, every IT investment and we are investing in CapEx at a pace that we've feel comfortable to get us the returns we would expect.</p>
          <p>In some cases you push out a network earlier like India where you expect returns to come over a prolonged period, but basically the answer is we are comfortable with the pace versus the return and opportunity that we see, and that and keeping that advantage that we feel is important.</p>

          <p>Just quickly on the traffic growth, it slowed towards end of the year as you did more optimization techniques, is that the delaying of inevitable growth or is that a structural shift in consumer behavior?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. If I might make a comment on that, because it's important, the vast majority, unlike other areas of the world, the vast majority of European traffic is mobile broadband. It's not smartphones today. And a small, very small percentage of high mobile broadband users capture a large part of the network usage, a part of these pay for it, which is very good, a part of this, kind of abuse. And there as part of our strategy of yield management to say, if you're on the motorway, take out the truck which goes very slow to free up for seven cars that pay the full ticket and go fast. So this is a little bit what is happening. We have not restrained any smartphone user. We have not got any complaint of any kind. I think it's a convergence if you want of traffic and revenue growth rates, which in the end is healthy.</p>
          <p>Yes, here, here, there and then we go back there. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. It's Stephen Howard here at HSBC. Just returning to the Netherlands and following on from the point that you have just made, Vittorio. If you look at the tariff structure there, customers who are spending more than &#x20AC;40 are permitted to use VoIP services. Those who are not spending that much are not permitted to use the VoIP service. I guess certain regulators might regard that as restraining customers' ability to use the service. Have you run into any net neutrality style regulatory issues on this? How do you tell if the customer actually is using VoIP, presumably that involves deep packet inspection, and that in turn may also raise some regulatory issues? So that's my first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, just looking at your stats on the lead that your great historic track record investment has given you in terms of the ability to offer faster broadband speeds than your competitors, I note that the comparison you are making there is with your leading competitor and given that we may now be getting into a world where historic under investment is beginning to tell, I was just wondering how the gap would look if you were comparing it not with the number two, but with the number three and number four, are those guys beginning to feel the pain? Is that forcing them to sell the data at a sensible price? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Michel will take the first one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on Voice over IP in Netherlands as in all other countries, I guess that we are fully transparent and compliant, meaning that we give the choice to the customer to be able to use Voice over IP. In that case, he has to subscribe to the right plans in order to do so. And you are right to say that in Netherlands it's for the plans above &#x20AC;40 and then he has to pay &#x20AC;5 per month on top of it to be able to use Voice over IP.</p>
          <p>There is no discrimination in between service providers. That's just, let's say, not discrimination, but that's, let's say, tariffs which is based on applications. And so that's completely compliable and compliant with the European regulation. Then, of course, we have mechanism in order to enforce it and to make sure that customers respect what he has signed for in the contractual terms with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me also take a little bit the political side of it, because there was a little bit of a political context that you are describing. In Europe, we have lower prices in general, or lower spending per customer in general than in places like the U.S. In Europe, we need investment. We need investment in fixed infrastructure, we need investment in broad infrastructure, and in Europe we need employment. I mean, this is the political context.</p>
          <p>So I have prices which are going down 11%, 12%, 13%. I think this quarter is the first quarter where India is &#x2013; the Indian price decline is lower than Italy or Spain, for example. So this is the context where we are. So for those of you who are journalists in the audience we shouldn't forget this. I mean, we are in a price deflationary 10%, 12%, 13%, 15% environment, in an investment hungry and an employment hungry environment.</p>
          <p>I think the European regulators are taking a sensible approach in this space where they say this is a transition phase moving from a certain world to the world of data. We need to have solid economics. And debate on net neutrality in Europe I think has been much healthier and more investment friendly and business friendly than, for example, in the U.S. Now will it stay like that? We work hard to make stay like that. But, let's, keep in mind lower prices, declining prices and data pricing which is clearly lower than, for example, in the U.S. Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just very quickly we do measure against all competitors. And it's not the case in all countries but we have seen a differentiated performance gap year-on-year. So one would only assume they are making choices and particularly the consistency of the record of data performance, so someone can make an investment in one city, but not consistently across 10 etcetera. So that's where you see the evidence, the consistency of data experience.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's me. Three questions on my side. The first one I'd basically start from the answer you just gave on the political question. It is true that price are coming down and capital going up or capital remain stable, therefore I think we have to look at how to basically plan for the investments going forward. But how do you reply to the regulator that will look at Vodafone, in general any incumbent mobile operator and see probably the most profitable industry at the moment with 40% plus EBITDA margins in number of markets. Now like 10% CapEx to sales that you are guiding to remain stable. So there is abundance of cash already to invest and probably is the case that price for voice at the moment is very well above costs. The costs probably data show you where the real cost of running a network?</p>
          <p>The second one is on Netherlands, it looks to be a quite focus on that and look on the headline numbers and revenues and EBITDA looked to be down 7%, in the text, specifically its 44 million over 612 million. So roughly it's 9.2% back on the envelope. In the text you say that's actually going up, so I'd be grateful if you can just give me the adjustments you make?</p>
          <p>The third one is on depreciation, in the past we had quite moving piece in that one because it's very important for your guidance, could just stress your depreciation assumptions for next year?</p>
          <p>And the fourth and I don't want to continue that one, so I'd....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, four is really outside the rules.</p>
          <p>You want to take Netherlands?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second one &#x2013; so &#x2013; on Netherland, there is an impact in Q4 of MTRs, so if you correct by MTR in fact, it was plus 3%, which is quite comparable with the previous quarter, which was around plus 8%. So we're &#x2013; by the way we only operated to be in a positive territory. And if you look at our EBITDA margin in Netherland this year, it has improved. Thanks to a strong OpEx management, minus 6% and of course, which has allowed us to finance commercial resources in order to push smartphones as it is one of the countries that you've seen in previous slides where we have really been able to equip many customers in smartphones and to unlock additional revenue.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not specifically guiding forwards on depreciation, but I'd say, it is running just a little bit low below the CapEx level and that is thematically where I would expect it to continue to trend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the answer to the regulators, it's very simple. If you need investment and if you need employment, you need to preserve margins. It is wrong to look at margin before investments, before the risk associated with investment. So that's what basically we say. What the other say, I don't know, but it's our position and disciplined deployment of capital is going to be I think they rule in our sector more and more. Yes, you have been -- no.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions please. Firstly on EBITDA margin, your guidance calls for margins to decline a bit less in 2012, clearly there was quite a strong stabilization in the second half, should we think -- how should we think about 2012 margins relative to the H2 trend, particularly thinking in terms of may be lesser operating leverage benefit and also obviously the stiffer MTR headwind that we'll see next year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly in terms of CapEx, Everything Everywhere has become the latest offer to embark on a fairly aggressive base station swap out program. I just wonder -- from Steve how you are sort of Single RAN approach is different to that and why you wouldn't accelerate it to get some of those cost savings through a bit quicker?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

          <p>Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, accurately forecasting exactly where the margin is going to be is always quite tricky. You're absolutely right that the erosion in the first half of last year was higher than in the second half. We've said for this year coming year that we expect to see further improvement. So, directionally, we are in the same sort of zone as we were in for the second half of last year. Some of that is going to come from the smartphone launches, we had quite a lot of those in the early part of last year, obviously that is now more sort of normal course and speed. Part of it is that the smartphone device cost is itself starting to decrease, the range is wider. Part of it is the revenue pull through from the early smartphones offers and part of it is the cost initiatives that we're undertaking. So, exactly where we are going, I don't know, but it's certainly heading in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Yeah, there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, did you want the CapEx...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll go through a couple of boring numbers questions, maybe a slightly less boring one, outside numbers. First on the operating profit guidance, just point of clarification, the 11 to 11.8%, does that bake in all Verizon &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; iPhone cost from Verizon Wireless or is it just currency adjusted? That's point one.</p>
          <p>Secondly on working capital, it seems that the guidance implies sort of ongoing &#xA3;300 million benefit from working capital. Can you just give us an idea how you get that? Is it just &#x2013; is there no end to the pain your suppliers go through or is there any trade debtors' improvement that you can realize?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on the U.K. spectrum for next year, now that you are refarming the 900, are you comfortable that you've got enough one &#x2013; sub 1-gigahertz spectrum for your needs, or do you think you'll try to pick up some more spectrum? Thanks &#x2013; in the auctions, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So, let me take the first two. So, the 11 to 11.8 is taking our best view of everything we can see including the Verizon Wireless iPhone effect. Obviously that is still early days and volumes are not the easiest things to project accurately, but hopefully that would be well accommodated within the breadth of that range.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the working capital, we have said for the year we are now in, expect that fine print, there is still some working capital benefit. I am not saying that necessarily after this coming year we are still living with even further working capital benefits. I think there is a point, to your question, where you can get to and thereafter it does become a lot tougher. So some further working capital in the year that we are now in, but I'd be thinking thereafter a pretty negligible level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are very comfortable with our spectrum holding. Right now, we're only 38% through our second carrier on 2.1. But you're buying spectrum for the future, so it's a future consideration, not a current one. It's always nice to have more spectrum for the future, but we don't comment on current spectrum auctions.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. One that you were asked earlier, but didn't choose to elaborate on at the time too much was your ambition for becoming larger in India and whether or not changes in the consolidation rules there would give you an opportunity to step-up?</p>
          <p>And I also wanted to ask again on the theme of the Southern European markets and the pressure you're seeing there, is there a risk, perhaps a growing impending risk that we see quite a material rebasing downwards of profitability in the larger European &#x2013; Southern European markets, if we see continuation of the current revenue trends, based on your experience in Greece, in particular I'd be interested to hear what you thought about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. You want to say a few words about India?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean just in terms of India performance, I would say that generally, we are very pleased. 18.7% service revenue growth, so we've gone out the fiscal year with a good degree of momentum. Is this working? Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So good degree of momentum, I would say brand is working well, distribution is working well, we're expanding the network, obviously we've got plans for 3G, so we've done about 5,500 sites. We're aiming to do 12,000 exit by the end of this fiscal year. So my view is, we've got good momentum in terms of consolidation clearly we wait for the outcome of the new telecom policy 2011. We hope it's more in line with 2009, which we took a slight deviation since then, but if it's along those lines, I think it could be encouraging in which case it's natural that there will be consolidation whether we're passive or active we will have to see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it depends quite frankly as Nick said it &#x2013; it depends on the rules, if the rules came out in certain ways, we might be looking at partial things circle-by-circle or nothing or theoretically bigger things. Clearly the important thing for us is now to go through this new phase of writing the new rules, that will determine really the strategy and the possible ambitions.</p>
          <p>On Southern Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Southern Europe, I guess that in Italy and Portugal we've been quite resilient from margin point of view, meaning that we've been able to address the cost structure to the pressure that we have experienced on the revenue. So of course, it will depend on let's say how the competitive situation will evolve, but which is some let's say maybe slight improvement in those two countries.</p>
          <p>In Spain, that's slightly more difficult, and as you've seen our EBITDA margin has been under pressure, due to the revenue reduction and as Vittorio has pointed out earlier one, we're slightly changing the model in Spain meaning rebasing the our tariffs, and improving our commercial spend. So we might expect to have still some pressure in Spain, during this transition phase of model, which would align this country more on some other type of countries.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Lawrence Sugarman from RBS. Cost developments have obviously been good in Western Europe. And we're now seeing inflationary pressures rising. Some of that I assume will be offset through some of the efficiencies, particularly around the energy issues that you've already raised, but do you see that is something that presents a problem?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with respect to the inflationary pressures in the emerging markets, some of the operators are talking about how those inflationary pressures are impacting on consumer spending, therefore potentially hurting revenue trends. Do you see that as something that we should be concern about as well as the year progresses?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in Europe, as we have already pointed out, I guess that in the past two years, we have decreased in absolute terms our OpEx by 4% each year. So which means more or less &#xA3;500 million decrease of our cost structure. So now it's really in the DNA of the company to really mange those costs in a very efficient manner and to try to continue to push them down in order to offset of course the pressure that you're mentioning in such inflationary, but also traffic driven by the shift to data.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we have a slight shift, as Vittorio has already explained, meaning that in order to manage our cost structure, we need to tackle probably slightly more in the next coming 12 months, our commercial spend in order really to make sure that so &#x2013; let's say our A&amp;R are allocated in a way, which will drive data profitability.</p>
          <p>So remaining focus on OpEx as a whole and we have well delivered. And shifting on commercial spend in order to make sure that we do it in a profitable manner.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so in terms of pressure, inflationary pressure, if I put Egypt to one side, which is obviously going through some structural changes, I would say generally across India and across Africa. No, we're not seeing trends in terms of down, minutes of use are up. Demand is there for mobile services, penetration, still a long way to go and we're really seeing uplift in data. Data as a percent of service revenue is really starting to move up as you saw with India with 66% growth in the fourth quarter. So my view is at the moment, no, we're not seeing any drag factor there.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Morten Singleton, Investec. Just picking up on the debate we were talking about earlier with regards to the EU adopting a bit more of a grown up approach towards your ability to generate revenues and profits in a data world where voice is declining. One of the potential opportunities in that space that we've heard talked more and more about is the idea of two sided markets. And we've heard you talking a bit about that in particular. Can you give us an update on whether you're in any active discussions with any of the major content providers, whether we could see any deals towards the end of this year? And whether you think that this could end up being a major material element of your revenue profile going forward? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Yeah. I am not so sure. I'm not sure we really want to -- of course we are in discussions. We are discussing models, different models. I cannot say that we are kind of firming down contracts or things like that. I guess keep in mind that this is essential for fixed line providers. It's a little bit less so for us. I am keen to see the consumer side of the story well established, so the integrated pricing, the differentiated quality of service and the tiered pricing first, and then there is a discussion on how to handle the other part of the story.</p>
          <p>I would say that probably the world will end up divided into camps. There will be people who will say no, thank you very much, no way and YouTube and Google might end up in that camp, because this is kind of less premium type of content and real premium content players, who actually could see distribution costs as more efficient than physical cost.</p>
          <p>The important thing from my strategic and also from regulatory point of view perspective is to preserve two principles, one is choice, so not try to force a different system, but give choice of different systems, and second non-discrimination, so same type of services treated the same way.</p>
          <p>These are the two I think principles when I am in discussion with Europe, you said grown up, I would say, yeah, it's grown up, but it's also because I think we are taking reasonable positions. And it's very important for me &#x2013; to preserve reasonable positions. Otherwise the political pushback could be very strong. But these are the two principles, non-discrimination and free choice.</p>
