          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen.  And welcome to the Ford Motor Company First Quarter Earning Conference Call.  My name is Katina and I'll be your coordinator for today.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Bill Agne, Director of Investor Relations .  Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Katina, and good morning ladies and gentlemen.  Welcome to all of you who are joining either by phone or webcast.  On behalf of the entire Ford management team I'd like to thank you for spending time with us this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Alan Mulally, President and CEO; and Lewis Booth, Chief Financial Officer.  Also in the room are Peter Daniel, Senior Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss Vice President and Treasurer; Mark Cosman, Director of Accounting; and K.R. Kent, Ford Credit CFO.  Before we being I'd like to review a couple of items.</p>
          <p>Copies of this morning's earnings release and the slides that we will be using today have been posted on Ford's Investor and Media websites for your reference.  The financial results discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis.  Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q on the first quarter.  Additionally the financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis, and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis.  The non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this call are reconciled to our GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide deck.</p>
          <p>Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future performance.  Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here.  Additional information on the factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation.  These risk factors are also detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Alan Mulally, Ford's President and CEO.</p>

          <p>Very good.  Thank you, Bill, and good morning to everyone.  As you all know, demand for autos across most markets remain very weak in the first quarter due to the persistent global economic slowdown and still anemic credit markets.  Although policy makers around the world are making significant and important moves to jumpstart the economy, consumer confidence remains low.</p>
          <p>We estimate that the first quarter 2009 industry volumes for the major markets that we track are down about 20% from a year ago levels.  While the difficult market conditions had a significant impact on our first quarter results, we made strong progress on our plan to transform Ford into a lean, globally integrated company poised for long term profitable growth.  Despite much lower revenues, we slowed our operating cash flow outflow significantly compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, and expect improvements to continue throughout the year as we continue to reduce costs aggressively.</p>
          <p>Strong new high-quality, fuel efficient vehicles such as the Fusion and the Fiesta helped Ford achieve strong retail market share performance in the first quarter in our two largest markets, the U.S. and Europe, as well as in a number of other market while limiting incentives.  And we took further action to improve our cost structure and balance sheet by reaching new agreements with the UAW and completed a successful debt reduction initiative, both of which will pay off down the road and increase our fundamental competitiveness.</p>
          <p>In these challenging times, we remain focused on our four point plan: aggressively restructure the business, accelerate development of the vehicles customers want and value, finance our plan and improve our balance sheet, and work together as one team leveraging our global assets.  Even in the worst of auto-industry times, customers are recognizing that Ford is making progress and charting its own path.  We are positioning forward to survive the current downturn and capitalize as auto sales recover down the road.</p>
          <p>I will start off today by providing you with an overview of our first-quarter results and business and product highlights.  Lewis Booth will then take us through the first quarter financial results in greater detail.  Finally, I'll summarize our plan going forward, including our outlook for the rest of this year.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide three, I'll begin by reviewing the key financial results.  As shown at the top of the slide, vehicle wholesales in the first quarter were at 973,000 units, down 558,000 from the same period in 2008.  First-quarter revenue was 24.8 billion, a 14.4 billion decrease from a year ago.  The decrease is primarily explained by lower volume and unfavorable exchange, partly offset by higher net pricing.  Our first quarter pre-tax operating loss, excluding special items, was about two billion, over a 2.6 billion decline from a year ago when we were profitable.  This decline included 2.5 billion at Automotive, and 126 million at Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter net loss, attributable to Ford, was 1.4 billion, including a pre-tax special charge gain of 362 million.  We ended the quarter with 21.3 billion of cash, down about 7.4 billion from a year ago.  This will be discussed in more detail later.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, financial results at all operations were worse than a year ago because of the lower industry volumes beginning in the second half of 2008 and continuing into the first quarter of 2009.  First quarter U.S. industry volumes were down 37% from a year ago, and our other major markets were down 7% and 18%.  Cost reductions provided a significant offset to these declines.  Overall results, however, were significantly improved compared with fourth quarter of 2008, even though we took further decisive action to reduce dealer stocks to align these stocks with the current lower demand.  We reduced our automotive structural costs by 1.9 billion compared to 2008, with about 1.3 billion of that improvement coming from North America.</p>
          <p>Ford North America had an operating loss of 637 million, a 592 million decline from a year ago.  Ford South America earned an operating profit of 63 million, a 194 million decline from a year ago.  Ford Europe had a 550 million operating loss, about a 1.3 billion decline from a year ago.  Volvo had a 255 million operating loss, a 104 million decline from a year ago.</p>
          <p>Ford Asia Pacific and Africa had an operating loss of 96 million, a 97 million decline from a year ago.  And Financial Services had an operating loss of 62 million, a 126 million decline from a</p>
          <p>year ago.</p>
          <p>Slide five details some of our key business highlights this quarter.  In February, we modified our collective bargaining agreement with the UAW lowering our annual U.S. labor costs by $500 million.  In addition, we launched a new buyout program for U.S. hourly employees.  We reached agreement in principal with the UAW, subject to court and other approvals, to allow Ford to settle up to half of our cash VEBA obligations with Ford common stock.  We executed actions to reduce our automotive debt obligations by 10.1 billion and lower our annual cash interest payments by more than 500 million.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., retail market share remained steady in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2008.  Dealer inventories decreased by 27% from a year ago, bringing days supply to very competitive levels.</p>
          <p>We launched the Ford Advantage Plan in the U.S., offering customers who lose their jobs payment protection for up to 12 months.  Ford Europe's first quarter market share rose to 9.4%, the highest level in nearly 10 years.  Ford also strengthened its hold as Europe's number two selling brand.</p>
          <p>Initial quality of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles in the United States improved by 5% as compared to last year, surpassing Honda and tying Toyota for the overall lead, according to the latest Global Quality Research Systems study of U.S. vehicle quality. And customer satisfaction with vehicle quality is improving in North America, Europe and Asia, and it reached its highest level ever in North America.  And we started discussion with interested parties regarding the sale of Volvo.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six.  During the first quarter we had a number of new product introductions and sales accomplishments as we continue to implement our product transformation plan.  In Europe, the Ford Fiesta became Europe's best selling vehicle for March, with sales of 52,800 vehicles.  In March, the Ford Ka posted its best sales month since October of 2004.  We launched the Ford Focus RS, Ford Europe's fastest ever production model, and unveiled the iosis-MAX concept at the Geneva auto show, signaling Ford's design intent for multi-activity vehicles.</p>
          <p>In North America, we introduced the 2010 Ford Taurus, our new flagship sedan at the Detroit Auto Show.  Taurus hits the streets this summer along with a high performance Taurus SHO.  We introduced the 2010 Ford Transit Connect fin North America, a fuel-efficient alternative to larger commercial vehicles, which also goes on sale this summer.  Next year, a battery electric version of the Transit Connect will reach the market.  We just launched the new 2010 Ford Fusion, the Mercury Milan and the Lincoln MKZ along with the Fusion and Milan hybrids.  Both the gas and the hybrid versions of Fusion and Milan lead their segments in fuel economy.</p>
          <p>The new 2010 Ford Mustang is entering showrooms now.  It is America's number one muscle car with a new interior and exterior, more horsepower and updated technology.  The high performance Shelby GT500 enters the marketplace with 40 additional horsepower and improved highway fuel economy.  And production is underway for our first new EcoBoost engine, a key part of our strategy to improve fuel economy and lower CO2 emissions across our entire product line.  The 3.5-liter V6 EcoBoost will be available on 2010 models for the Lincoln MKS, the Lincoln MKT and the Ford Flex and standard on the Ford Taurus SHO.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Asia-Pacific and Africa, production of the Fiesta began in Nanjing, China.  Customer demand for the Fiesta in the Asia-Pacific region has been very strong as it marks successful launches in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Lewis to provide more details on our first quarter financial results. Lewis?</p>

          <p>Thanks, Alan.  Let's move on to slide eight, which provides more information on our financial results.  Starting at the lower left, our net loss attributable to Ford for the first quarter was $1.4 billion and this excludes and income from non-controlling interests.  This net loss includes a $204 million of tax benefits, more than explained by our recovery of prior period taxes.  Excluding this recovery, we incurred a tax liability in jurisdictions where we remain profitable.  Adjusting for these items leaves a first quarter pre-tax loss of $1.6 billion.  These results include a pre-tax special gain of $362 million, which we'll cover on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Excluding these special items, we recorded a first quarter pre-tax operating loss of about $2 billion.  Most of the remaining slides will focus on these pre-tax operating results.</p>
          <p>Slide nine covers special items, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $362 million in the first quarter.  In North America, we recorded a charge of $171 million largely related to personnel reduction programs in the U.S.  We recorded a gain for job security benefits of $292 million, which primarily relates to the elimination of the jobs bank, which part of the modified agreement reached with the UAW.</p>
          <p>We recognized an $81 million dealer-related charge, which primarily reflects investment write offs related to the proposed sale of dealerships in the dealer development program.  This initiative provides an opportunity for qualified operators to become private capital owners of the dealership.</p>
          <p>We also recorded a charge of $178 million for retiree healthcare and other related costs, which is primarily related to the UAW retiree healthcare VEBA agreement.  We recognized a $1.3 billion gain primarily associated with the repurchase of $2.2 billion of our term loan debt and $234 million of unsecured notes.  This reflected the difference between the book value of the debt and the market price at which the debt was repurchased.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we expect to realize about a $3.4 billion gain on the debt restructuring completed in early April.  Our debt restructuring actions will be covered in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>At the end of the first quarter, based on the status of our strategic review of Volvo, we concluded that the criteria for held-for-sale status have been met, triggering an impairment test that resulted in an impairment charge of around $700 million.  This amount reflects the difference between the book value and the estimated fair market value of Volvo as held-for-sale, net of estimated disposal costs.</p>
          <p>And finally, we recorded an impairment of our equity investment and diversified financial operations partnership of non-core lease assets.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, as previously announced, we completed debt-restructuring initiatives that have reduced automotive debt by $10.1 billion at par value and will lower annual interest payments by more than $500 million.  Ford and Ford Credit utilized $2.6 billion in cash plus 468 million shares of Ford common stock to complete the debt restructuring.</p>
          <p>The term loan was completed on March 27 and will be reflected in our first quarter financial statements.  The other major components of the debt restructuring were completed on April 8 and will be reflected in our second quarter financial statements.  This successful debt restructuring, coupled with previously announced agreements with the UAW, will substantially strengthen Ford's balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now onto slide 11, which shows our pre-tax operating results by sector.  The first quarter pre-tax operating results were a loss of about $2 billion.  These results included a loss of $1.9 billion for the Automotive sector and a loss of $62 million for Financial Services.  As Alan mentioned on slide four, as shown in the memo below the chart, total company results have improved substantially compared to the fourth quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 12, which shows pre-tax operating results for each of our automotive operating segments and Other Automotive, we'll focus here on Other Automotive and then cover the operations in detail on the next slides.  In the first quarter, Other Automotive was a loss of $445 million, of which net interest expense represented $452 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows the change in first-quarter results compared with a year ago, a decline of $2.5 billion.  Volume in mix was about $3.5 billion unfavorable, primarily due to the decline in industry volumes, and the impact of actions to reduce dealer stocks across all of the automotive operations.  Share overall was about unchanged, with improvements in retail share, offset by reductions in Daily Rental, another fleet business.  Net pricing was about $700 million favorable, primarily due to higher pricing in the U.S., reflecting pricing for new features and content, and limiting new incentives.  Cost changes were over $1 billion favorable, reflecting structural cost reductions, partly offset by higher material costs, which included a non-recurrence of about $350 million of favorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, we'll focus on our structural cost reduction initiatives.  Exchange is about $100 million unfavorable, primarily explained by unfavorable exchange in South America and in Europe, partly offset by favorable exchange at Volvo.  Net interest and fair market value adjustments were $200 million unfavorable, primarily due to the non-recurrence of fair market value gains and higher interest expense associated with drawing the revolver.  Finally, included in the Other decline of $400 million, our lowest subsidiary in Parts profits largely related to the decline in industry volume.</p>
          <p>Now to slide 14, which explains our automotive structural cost reductions of $1.9 billion compared to a year ago.  Manufacturing and engineering costs were over $800 million lower, largely reflecting the continued benefit of our restructuring actions in North America, in Europe and in Volvo.  Spending-related costs improved by about $200 million, primarily reflecting lower depreciation expense.  And pension and retiree healthcare expenses were $300 million lower, primarily reflecting the effect of the UAW Retiree Healthcare VEBA agreement.  Overhead costs were over $300 million lower, including salaried personnel reductions and other restructuring actions.  And advertising and sales promotions were about $300 million lower than a year ago.</p>
          <p>For the next section of slides we'll cover each of the automotive operations, starting with North America on slide 15.  In the first quarter wholesales were 354,000 units, down 350,000 units from a year ago, primarily reflecting the 37% decline in U.S. industry SAAR from 15.6 million units in the first quarter to 9.8 million units in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter we reduced U.S. dealer stocks by 32,000 units to keep these stocks aligned with lower industry volumes.  In comparison, during the first quarter of 2008 we had increased dealer stocks by 32,000 units.</p>
          <p>First quarter U.S. total market share for Ford and Lincoln Mercury was 13.9%, down 1.1 points from last year because of lower fleet sales.  And first quarter revenue was $10.2 billion, a $6.9 billion decrease from a year ago, primarily explained by low volumes and partially offset by improvements in net pricing.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, Ford North America reports a pre-tax loss of $637 million, a $592 million decline from a year ago.  We'll cover this decline on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 16 provides an explanation of the change in North American results compared with a year ago.  Volume mix was $2 billion unfavorable primarily reflecting the decline in U.S. industry volumes, lower dealer stocks and lower fleet market share.</p>
          <p>Net pricing was $600 million favorable primarily reflecting pricing for new features and content and a disciplined approach that has limited our new incentives in an increasingly competitive environment.</p>
          <p>Costs decreased by $800 million, more than explained by low structural costs including lower manufacturing and engineering, pensions and overhead and spending related costs.  These structural cost reductions were partly offset by higher material costs reflecting higher product content and the non-recurrence of favorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges.</p>
          <p>Slide 17 provides an explanation of the improvement in North America first quarter 2009 results compared with the fourth quarter 2008.  Volume and mix was $300 million unfavorable, more than explained by a decline in U.S. industry volumes and lower market share, partly offset by favorable product mix.  Net pricing was $100 million favorable, primarily reflecting higher pricing in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Costs decreased by about $1.6 billion, primarily reflecting lower structural costs including lower manufacturing and engineering and advertising, lower commodity costs consistent with lower prices for steel and precious metals, and favorable warranty reserve adjustments.  Exchange was $300 million unfavorable, and Other was $200 million favorable.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the U.S. market share for Ford and Lincoln Mercury.  In the first quarter, our market share was 13.9% including 10.1% for retail and 3.8% for fleet.  As shown below the chart, our preliminary share of the U.S. retail market during the first quarter was about equal to the first quarter of 2008.  Variable share performance, primarily related to the Fusion and the new F-150, were offset my mix shifts that were unfavorable to Ford, primarily lower Full-Sized Pickup segmentation.</p>
          <p>In addition, it's important to note that we were able to achieve this favorable retail share performance while limiting incentives in an increasingly competitive environment.  The fleet share decline, compared to last year, was largely consistent with our planned reductions and daily rental volumes.</p>
          <p>Now onto South America on slide 19.  In the first quarter, wholesales were 93,000 units, up 1,000 from a year ago, reflecting market share improvements from 9.5% to 11% largely offset by the decline in industry SAAR from 4.4 million units in the first quarter 2008 to 4.1 million units in first quarter 2009.  First quarter revenue was $1.4 billion, a $400 million decrease from a year ago, primarily reflecting weaker Brazilian currency.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, Ford South America earned a pre tax profit of $63 million, a $194 million decrease from a year ago.  This decrease was more than explained by unfavorable exchange and higher commodity costs, partly offset by favorable net pricing.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 covers Ford Europe.  In the first quarter, wholesales were 343,000 units down 157,000 or 31% from a year ago.  This reduction includes the impact of reducing production by 61,000 units to align dealer stocks with lower industry volumes.  First quarter industry SAAR for the 19 markets that we track was 14.8 million units down 3.2 million units or 18% from a year ago.   This is about half of the U.S. industry decline, due in part to the favorable effect of government scrappage programs in major European markets.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Russian industry SAAR was 1.9 million units, down 1.3 million units or 41% from a year ago.  First quarter market share was 9.4% up five-tenths of a point from last year, the highest level in nearly 10 years, reflecting the relative strength of our product portfolio.</p>
          <p>First quarter revenues were $6 billion, a $4.2 billion decrease from a year ago more than explained by lower volume, unfavorable exchange and unfavorable product mix.  For the first quarter, Ford Europe reported a pre-tax loss of $550 million, a $1.3 billion decline from a year ago.  We'll cover this decline on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 21 provides an explanation of the change in Ford Europe results compared to a year ago.  Volume and mix was about $1 billion unfavorable, primarily reflecting the decline in industry volume and dealer stocks, partially offset by improved market share.  Industry volume decline included a significant decline in commercial vehicle volumes, primarily reflecting the economic weakening in most major European markets.  Results during the first quarter were reduced by $300 million because of the impact of reducing production to align dealer stocks with lower industry volumes.</p>
          <p>Net pricing was $100 million favorable compared to a year ago, and this reflects favorable vehicle pricing, primarily in Britain and Russia, in part to offset unfavorable currency exchange effects.</p>
          <p>Underlying structural cost reductions were $300 million as we progressed actions to align capacity with demand.  This was more than offset, however, by increased distressed supplier costs, the non- recurrence of favorable mark-to-market adjustments on commodity hedges, IF product content and non-recurrence of warranty reserve changes.</p>
          <p>Exchange was about $100 million unfavorable, mainly due to the weakening of the British Pound and the Russian Ruble compared with the Euro.  Other was $200 million unfavorable, explained by lower earnings at our joint ventures due to lower industry volumes.</p>
          <p>Slide 22 covers Volvo.  In the first quarter wholesales were 69,000 units, down 37,000 units or 35% from a year ago.  This reduction is explained by lower industry volumes and market share, primarily in the U.S. and Europe, and lower dealer stocks.  First quarter revenue was $2.6 billion, a $1.6 billion decrease from a year ago, more than explained by lower volumes, unfavorable exchange and unfavorable net pricing.  For the first quarter Volvo reports a pre-tax loss of $255 million, a $104 decline from a year ago.  I will cover this decline on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 provides an explanation of the change in Volvo results compared to a year ago.  Volume and mix was $400 million unfavorable primarily reflecting lower industry volumes, lower market share and lower dealer stock reductions.</p>
          <p>Net pricing was about $100 million unfavorable compared to a year ago primarily reflecting increased incentive spending in Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>Costs decreased by $300 million, reflecting actions taken to reduce structural costs.  And exchange was about $100 million favorable, primarily associated with the weakening of the Swedish Kroner compared to the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>While not shown on this slide, losses in the first quarter 2009 were reduced nearly $500 million compared with the fourth quarter 2008, despite the lower volumes.  This primarily is a result of structural cost reductions and favorable exchange.</p>
          <p>Slide 24 covers Asia Pacific and Africa.  In the first quarter, wholesales were 114,000 units, down 15,000 units from a year ago, primarily reflecting lower industry volume.</p>
          <p>First quarter industry SAAR was 20.6 million units, down 2.8 million units or 12% from a year ago.  While the Chinese industry was down only slightly, industry volumes in many of our other key markets were down 20 to 30%.</p>
          <p>The first quarter market share was 1.8%, down one-tenth of a point from last year.  The first quarter revenue, which excludes sales of our joint ventures in China, was at $1.2 billion, a $500 million decrease from a year ago, more than explained by lower volumes and unfavorable exchange.</p>
          <p>And for the first quarter Asia Pacific and Africa reports a pre-tax loss of $96 million, a $97 million decline from a year ago.  The decline reflects lower industry volumes and unfavorable exchange, partly offset by structural cost reductions and net pricing actions.</p>
          <p>Slide 25 shows Automotive cash and cash flow.  We ended the first quarter with $21.3 billion in gross cash, up $7.9 billion from the fourth quarter of 2008.  Our Automotive operating related to cash flow was $3.7 billion negative in the first quarter reflecting an Automotive pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion.  Capital spending during the first quarter though was about $300 million higher than depreciation and amortization.</p>
          <p>Changes in working capital resulted in over $1 billion of positive cash flow due to higher payables, lower inventories and lower receivables.  This improvement, however, was more than offset by timing differences in marketing, warranty, retiree health care payments and in-transit receivables.</p>
          <p>And finally, payments of $500 million to Ford Credit reflecting our change to up-front payments of pension.  Excluding the impact of the change to up-fronts and pension payments, our Automotive operating related cash flow was $3.2 billion negative.  This outflow in the first quarter is less than half of the outflow during each of the third and fourth quarters of 2008, despite a further decline in volume, in part related to actions taken to reduce dealer stocks.  The improvement achieved primarily to improve working capital, lower automotive pre-tax losses and lower net spending.</p>
          <p>Other changes in gross cash in total more than offset the operating-related gross cash flow included personnel reduction programs of $300 million, pension contributions of $400 million, the net impact of the $2 billion related to the conversion of the assets in the temporary asset account set aside for the VEBA healthcare trust into a new Ford note as discussed in January, and finally, accessing our revolving line of credit of $10.1 billion as we also discussed in January.  Including all of these impacts, the total increase in gross cash during the first quarter was $7.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to slide 26 and Financial Services.  For the first quarter the Financial Services sector reported a pre-tax loss of $62 million, a $126 million decline from a year ago.  Other Financial Services reports a loss of $26 million in the first quarter, a $58 million decline from a year ago.  This decline primarily reflects normal occurrence of gains related to real estate transactions, and we'll cover Ford Credit in more detail on the next slide.</p>
          <p>Slide 27 explains the change in Ford Credit's pre-tax results for the first quarter compared with a year ago.  For the first quarter, the pre-tax loss was $36 million, a $68 million decline from a year ago.  The decrease in earnings primarily reflected lower volume and a higher provision for credit losses, partly offset by lower depreciation expense for leased vehicles and lower net losses related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives.</p>
          <p>Volume was lower compared to a year ago reflecting declining managed receivables.  As shown in the memo in the lower left of the slide, Ford Credit's March 31, 2009 managed receivables were at $106 billion, about $42 billion lower than a year ago.  This decline primarily reflected lower industry volumes, lower dealer stocks, changes in currency exchange rates and the impact of divestitures and alternative business arrangements.</p>
          <p>The increase in the provision for credit losses is more than explained by higher fleet possessions, higher severity, lower recoveries and higher dealer-related losses in the U.S. and higher credit losses in Europe.  Residual losses declined in the first quarter of 2009 compared with last year.  This decline primarily reflected lower residual losses on vehicles returned in the first quarter of 2009 and lower depreciation expense.  Ford Credit's first quarter at auction values improved compared with the fourth quarter 2008, but we expect it to remain volatile.</p>
          <p>Slide 28, which covers the liquidity and funding outlook for Ford Credit.  The left box shows Ford Credit's committed liquidity programs in cash and the utilization of liquidity sources at the end of the first quarter.  Ford Credit's liquidity exceeded utilization by about $17 billion.  Ford Credit's funding strategy remains focused on maintaining liquidity to meet short-term funding obligations, including holding a substantial cash balance.  Ford Credit is maintaining its funding program and securitization structures, plans to renew committed capacity consistent with the size of its balance sheet, and will utilize appropriate government-sponsored programs for which it is eligible.</p>
          <p>In the near term, utilization of government-sponsored programs in the U.S. and around the world will be an important component of Ford Credit's funding plans.  As utilized the U.S. commercial paper funding facility, and European Central Bank liquidity facility, and in March completed a $3 billion term asset-backed securities loan facility, TARP as we know it, eligible auto-loan securitization transaction.  Gaining approval of our application for an industrial loan corporation is a component of Ford Credit's funding plan, as it will provide access to lower cost diversified funding, with FDIC insured deposits.  Ford Credit will continue to explore and execute terms of business and funding arrangements in those locations where it lacks diverse funding capacity, sorry capability.</p>
          <p>At the end of the first quarter, Ford Credit's managed leverage was 10-to-1, and Ford Credit's equity was $9.3 billion.  In the first quarter of 2009, Ford Credit completed a cash tender offer for a portion of Ford's senior-secured term loan of about $1.1 billion in cash, including transaction fees.  Ford Credit distributed this debt to its parent, where it was subsequently forgiven.</p>
          <p>Finally, Ford Credit will continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet in 2009, primarily reflecting lower industry volumes in Jaguar, Land Rover and Mazda's transition to other finance providers.  By the end of 2009, Ford Credit's managed receivables will be in the range of 85 to $95 billion.</p>
          <p>Slide 29 shows our 2009 second quarter production plans.  In North America, the second quarter production schedule is 435,000 units, down 250,000 units from 2008 but 10,000 units higher than our prior guidance.  Ford Europe we expect second quarter production of 385,000 units, down 180,000 units from a year ago.</p>
          <p>And at Volvo we expect second quarter production of 82,000 units, down 30,000 units from a year ago.  Overall, production is down compared to 2008 as we respond to the decline in global industry volumes.  These second quarter levels, however, are expected to be about 20% higher than the first quarter production.</p>
          <p>And now I'd like to turn it back to Alan to summarize our plan going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good.  Thank you, Lewis.  Slide 31 provides an overview of the business environment.  We expect weak volumes this year across most markets with worldwide sales down around 15%, a record decline globally according to our data.  In part this reflects that much of the 2008 weakness outside of the U.S. occurred late in the year.</p>
          <p>Significant government policy stimulus has been implemented in most markets.  This is expected to improve the environment for sales later this year.  Financial markets remained under significant stress and central banks continue to provide liquidity and take actions to stabilize the banks.</p>
          <p>Our suppliers and dealers also have been weakened by the global economic downturn and financial crisis.  The decline in oil, fuel and other raw material prices will provide a partial offset to the weak demand conditions.  Currencies remain volatile, which poses some risk.</p>
          <p>On slide 32 Ford is continuing to take decisive restructuring actions.  For example, we reached new agreement with the UAW to lower labor costs by about 500 million annually and subject to court and other approvals, agreement in principle to allow Ford to settle up to half of its cash VEBA obligations with Ford common stock.  And we executed actions to reduce Automotive debt obligations by 10.1 billion and lower annual cash interest payments by more than 500 million.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are continuing to reduce collaterally our dealer levels with a 14% reduction since 2005.  Working collaboratively to consolidate and realign our suppliers and continuing to reduce salary personnel related costs and other overhead costs.</p>
          <p>Our progress in fixing the fundamentals of the business is evidenced by the 1.9 billion of Automotive structural cost reductions in the first quarter and our revised plan to reduce full year structural costs by more than four billion.  Overall we are identifying and addressing issues and finding and delivering offsets.  As a result, based on our current planning assumptions, we remain on track to meet or beat our financial targets, including the target for an overall and North American automotive pre-tax results to be break-even or better in 2011, excluding special items.</p>
          <p>Now on to slide 33, which shows the status of our 2009 first quarter planning assumptions and operational metrics.  Total industry volume during the first quarter was equal to a SAAR of 9.8 million units in the U.S. and 14.8 million units in the 19 markets we track in Europe.  We expect the full year U.S. industry volume to be at the lower end of the range, previously debt-defined, based on the present economic environment with potential upside in the second half of the year from government fiscal stimulus programs and the potential for a fleet modernization program.</p>
          <p>As a result of the implementation of government stimulus programs focused on replacing older vehicles with more efficient ones, European industry volume now is expected to be higher than our plan, in the range of 13.5 to 14.5 million units.</p>
          <p>On the operational metrics, initial quality of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brand vehicles improved in the U.S. by 5% as compared to last year, surpassing Honda and essentially tying Toyota for the overall lead according to the latest Global Quality Research Systems study of the U.S. vehicle quality.</p>
          <p>International operations show improvements in the latest GQRS initial quality results, with the exception of Europe, where we have experienced some near-term issues that we are working to address.</p>
          <p>Customer satisfaction with vehicle quality is improving in North America, Europe and Asia, reaching its highest level ever in North America.  Automotive structural costs were reduced by 1.9 billion, which is on track to exceed our plan.</p>
          <p>U.S. market share was 13.9% and retail share, our retail market was 12.7%, which are both consistent with our plan.  Europe market share was 9.4%, on track with our plan.</p>
          <p>Automotive operating related cash flow was 3.7 billion negative, on track with our plan, and capital expenditures were 1.4 billion, also consistent with our plan.</p>
          <p>Slide 34 summarizes the key aspects of our plan.  These have not changed.  While times are tough and the external and competitive environment continues to evolve, we remain focused on implementing our transformation plan.  We believe there is clear evidence that we have taken appropriate, decisive actions to respond to the significant challenges presented by the continuing global downturn and are making progress towards our goal to deliver longer term, profitable growth.  We have taken the necessary steps to secure the capital for our continued restructuring, invest in the great new vehicles that will continue our success in the marketplace and provide us a cushion against uncertain global economies.</p>
          <p>Based on our planning assumptions, we do not expect to require a bridge loan from the U.S. government, barring as we have said previously, a significantly deeper economic downturn or significant industry event, such as the uncontrolled bankruptcy of a major competitor or major suppliers that causes disruption to our supply base, our dealers and creditors and cannot be funded by other forms of capital.</p>
          <p>We have maintained a laser focus on our Ford brand by divesting non-core assets.  We have sold Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover and Hertz and reduced our ownership in Mazda.  We are evaluating a potential sale of Volvo and have maintained Ford Credit as a strategic asset by substantially reducing the size by exiting brands and markets.</p>
          <p>In addition we've brought back Visteon plants that were important to our business and formed ACH to better manage the Visteon spin off.  We also continue to enhance a complete family of world class vehicles small, medium and large cars, utilities, crossovers and trucks that are best in class quality, green, safe, smart and deliver the very best value to our customers.  We've planned to serve global markets with our high volume products allowing our team to leverage our global assets for our customers.</p>
          <p>Going forward our balance portfolio of best in class vehicles produced and sold globally will provide us the flexibility to adapt more easily and quickly to changes in our environment.  This will help facilitate our goal to grow profitably as the global economy rebounds.</p>
          <p>In summary, these continue to be challenging days for the auto industry, yet I remain convinced that Ford has the right plan.  Now we'd like to take your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions.  First if we look at slide 17, and look at the volume and mix impact from the fourth quarter of '08 to the first quarter of '09, really kind of a negligible impact considering that volumes were down from 484,000 in the fourth quarter and 349,000 in the first quarter.  How big a part did the F-150 and mix play in that?  And as we look at the recovery in volumes going forward to 435,000 in the second quarter, should we see some extreme positives there in that volume and mix as the volume really ramps up?  Or was mix a big part of this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are consulting on the mix.  On the mix going forward we're seeing pretty steady on the F series, an increase on the crossovers, and on your specific question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, John.  First over fourth mix was positive.  So we don't expect to see a huge -- significant mix shift going forward.  So, I wouldn't be expecting to see that as you think of our forward few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we're looking at this first quarter to the second quarter, up 90,000 roughly units, a little bit more than that, that volume and mix bar should theoretically be positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All else equal, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All of the things being equal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Good summary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  The second question, if we look at the balance sheet, you've made big strides there.  Is there any further restructuring of the balance sheet that you might do, particularly on this $13.1 billion of notes to the UAW going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We've done our deal, and I think got a very good agreement with the UAW.  We've made no secret that we're going to continue to look very closely at our balance sheet, because we have too much debt on it.  But we don't have anything specific in mind at the moment, and I'm literally just drawing our breath from the last transaction.  So, it's on our mind, we recognize we have to continue to improve the balance sheet, but we've got other things to think about as well at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then clearly I'm sure you have war rooms on GM and Chrysler and dealing with that process, but it sounds like GM is having some large issues with Delphi.  It seems like it's giving them air cover to cut production as opposed to really causing issues.  But is there any contagion that you're seeing in a supply base from that pressure specifically?  Or what we might see with the GM and Chrysler filing that would create any problems in your supply base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  No.  I understand completely John, and we are not to date.  But clearly the health of the supply base is probably the most critical issue as the government helps GM and Chrysler restructure.  And we're so interdependent, as you well know, that from our staying close to the task force we actually believe that they understand the importance of the supply base. In general, the interdependencies and some of the actions they've taken on the backstopping, as you know, I think they'll continue to pay the highest priority as they restructure to the supply base to make sure it stays intact for all of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just lastly a product question.  Alan, I mean the EcoBoost sounds like it's coming out of a sort of high performance addition to some of your product line ups.  When are we going to see that trickle down the value chain into some of your more mass market products and really be focused as a fuel saving technology as opposed to a performance enhancer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet and starting in 2010, John, and the way you described it is exactly the plan because one of the really neat things about turbo charging and direct fuel injection, and that 20% improvement in fuel efficiency and that 15% reduction in CO2, is with the volume that we have across all of our product lines and the affordability of it, we can make a significant improvement very dramatically across the entire product line.  So that will really start to pick up with the 2010 models.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Let me just start by saying it was a significant amount of cost reduction.  I'm just turning to my notes.  I think there were over $300 million of cost improvements first over fourth.  And there's maybe somewhere between 150 and $200 million of currency.  Finally, seeing a bit of benefit of currency where they've struggled so much up to now and we also got some revenue improvements quarter-over-quarter offset by volume and mix.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The end of line story, Brian, is Volvo really is doing a fine job on cost reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sounds like that.  And on commodities, are you at the point now where between inventory hedges, contracts, the commodities are getting close to the newer lower market rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  We'll see that coming through in the second half.  We've still got a bit to go, but we're not seeing anymore -- anything else on our hedges.  But we've still got to work some out of inventory.  So we'll see that in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.  And for Allen, with the lower CapEx budget and just the tough times, what are you doing with the overall engineering effort?  And in particular with the product pipeline for 2011, 2012?  How would you compare it to the downturn in the aerospace industry when you were there?  And how should we be thinking about the product pipeline early next decade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh sure, Brian.  There's a lot of similarities there because, as you well know, the fundamental of our plan is that we take the aggressive action to size ourselves to the current low demand and the changing model mix, so we get back to profitability and we can keep investing.  And the second part of that plan is during the toughest of times we want to keep investing in the new products that people really do want and value so we come out the other side as a turbo machine. Same thing we did at Boeing with the 67, the 777 and the A7.</p>
          <p>And with respect to Ford, one really neat thing about going to the markets two and a half years ago is that we put the financing in place not only for the restructuring to work the quality and the productivity improvement, but also to continue to invest in a complete product line.  Small, medium and large cars, utilities and trucks, and through this whole thing we have not backed off one bit on that product line.  And starting with enabling technology like we just talked about the EcoBoost, the lightweight materials, the integrated avionics, the aerodynamics that we have arguably, most third party people will say, we probably have the finest car line-up now across the world that's coming on line.  The Ka, the Fiesta, the Fusion, the Taurus, the Mustang in addition to the crossovers and trucks.</p>
          <p>And so our plan is every year forever, consistency of purpose, that we'll improve the quality, the fuel efficiency and the safety and the value of each one of those vehicles.  And especially it really picks up steam, of course, with the vehicles over the next few years as we move to the global platforms and we get the volume per platform up and then get the scale with our suppliers being aligned. I think the pipeline, we could not be more pleased in the pipeline we have going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the truck side, it's at least, some in the pickup truck markets are looking at GMC and wondering about the commitment of the two government-funded competitors to that market.  How are you thinking about the pickup truck market and in particular about getting a pickup truck line-up that could meet tougher CapA requirements if we gravitate towards the California carb standards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you bet.  Well, on the, since you gave me an opening here, maybe I could just finish on that product line a little bit more.  But just going up to the utilities and the crossovers, of course, we're in terrific shape with the new Escape and the Escape hybrid.  Then we move up to the Edge and the Flex, and they're doing great, people movers.  And of course the Lincoln and Mercury counterparts too.  And then moving into the trucks and the vans, as you know, we're introducing around the world our new Ranger, which is a terrific smaller pickup.</p>
          <p>Then we move into the F-Series.  The response we've gotten for the latest F-Series that we introduced last year is incredible.  We really made an improvement in fuel efficiency in addition to the capability and the quality where it is clearly in a class by itself, the number one vehicle in the United States.  And we're going to continue that commitment on the F-Series, 34 years of industry leadership, it's going to be a significant market.  And those customers appreciate the quality, the fuel efficiency and the safety improvement as much as the smaller vehicles.  And then so you add that to what I think is the most exciting part of our alignment going forward is the introduction of the transit vans.</p>
          <p>We've got the great E-Series Van, but over time the transit van family is going to be terrific.  And we're introducing the new Trans Connect this year and all of the versions of the larger, more capable transits, and with that design, just a substantial improvement in fuel efficiency.  So again, the Ford strategy is to have a vehicle in every one of the major segments to support all the customers' wants and needs and to be best in class in those segments.  But I think I feel really good about this line-up going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I wanted to go back to the North American walk on slide 16.  Volume mix was two billion negative.  Your wholesale shipments were down 350,000 units.  So it looks like your decremental margin was only $5,700 per vehicle.  And I think the last couple of quarters it was running in the eight to $10,000 per vehicle range.  What is that?  Is that entirely F-150?  Or is it fleet sales reduction?  And should we think of that 5,700 number as being more sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Lewis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we had both some positive mix in the volume mix change, and we also had some improved revenues.  So as it goes forward, I know I haven't laid it out just quite that way Himanshu, but I think we are seeing as we launch our new products, some very positive improvements in series mix as we specify the H -- the series and the vehicle line better, and customers recognize the value they get, they are buying higher series mix.  And that's something we're very successful on in Europe, I think we've talked to you about that before, and it's something that North America is really working hard at.  And that's one of the underlying reasons we're getting some pricing as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then if we think about Chrysler scenarios, if there was a liquidation there, any thoughts on the near-term cash flow impact for Ford in terms of what sort of supplier costs you would need to put up and what sort of pricing pressure you think the business would have to suffer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  We haven't, and we won't speculate on that.  Clearly, the supply issues are a concern to us.  We've been working very hard on identifying areas of concern.  We're working with individual suppliers where they have concerns.  Exactly what happens, I think it's not for us to speculate, frankly, in terms of in the marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the cash flow, slide 25, it looks like working capital and other payment timing differences are combined were negative one billion.  I think in the press release you said the pure working capital portion was actually positive, which implies the payment timing difference was about a two billion negative.  What was that?  Was that incentive accruals?  Or warranty accruals?  What was moving around on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, incentives, warranty and also a bit of healthcare.  And the incentives and warranty over time, as our volumes, particularly on the incentives as our volumes start picking up quarter-over-quarter, we can expect to see that flip-flop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warranty is a reflection that our quality's continuing to get better on our new vehicles, and therefore we'll probably see that time of difference for some time, we hope for some time, because as our new vehicles continue to improve quality, we have to accrue a little bit less, but our payment is on our older vehicles.  So that timing difference will stay.  But I view that as slightly negative on cash, but it's great for customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lewis, any way to quantify how much the warranty accrual was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of it was a warranty accrual adjustment; it's about six-tenths.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then lastly, you know in Europe with the scrappage programs in place now, what are you guys seeing on used car prices over there?  Have there been any material reductions in used vehicles that are sort of one to five years old?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It varies tremendously by market, frankly.  For example, in Germany the program includes one-year old cars.  So there aren't any one-year old cars left in Germany.  But it's too early to see any long-term effect on residual values.</p>

          <p>Good morning.  A couple things, just a follow-up on this mix question on the year-over-year basis, could you quantify what the mix improvement was versus the first quarter of last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hold on.  Are you talking North America or are you talking South?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>North America.  It's about $100 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right, that's helpful.  And any comments on just the working capital going forward as the production goes up?  Should we anticipate just a normal working capital improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  And the other thing that -- we feel that based on our expectations of the year that this is probably the worst quarter for operating cash.  We're expecting to see it, the cash outflows reduced sequentially during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just broadly speaking, obviously there's a lot of capacity being taken out, and it probably, I would think that it would accelerate as a result of what your domestic competitors are about to go through.  Do you think that, is it your view that pricing in the North American market is going to get better structurally?  Or how do you sort of see this playing out over the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the real story on pricing in the next year or two is going to be around the products, not necessarily around removing of capacity.  I think if you have well-specified, well-accepted products, there'll be some pricing opportunities, and we know that's what we're expecting.  And I think that's going to be the most important story, as products get fresher the pricing opportunities will be there.  And we've, even in these very difficult times, the North American team's beginning to demonstrate that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just flipping to capital structure.  You struck a deal with UAW with payments starting in December of this year.  And obviously part of that was stock with a strike price of $2.  If the stock stays where it is now, $5 or more, should we be assuming that settling this for stock is off the table?  That you'd be looking at other capital structure alternatives.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the agreement with the UAW is that we can settle it in stock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we don't have to. So, we'll obviously be studying that very closely as we get towards the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Just lastly, any thoughts on the Ford Credit side -- on losses going forward?  Obviously severity is difficult to project.  You talked about how the used market is likely to be volatile.  But can you just talk about your thoughts on frequency and how you see that going based on your expectations for unemployment and other factors including the changes to the lending criteria that you made recently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Let me ask K.R. Kent to give you a comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  No problem.  As far as like things like the frequency, the repossessions, they are up.  For the first quarter we had about a 3% repossession ratio.  That's up versus last year and up versus the fourth quarter.  In all likelihood, it will trend with unemployment as unemployment increases over the next, call it six or nine months.  So, we'll see that continue to increase.  You can also see it in the over 60 day delinquencies, which were about 29 basis points in the first quarter, which was up from 22 the same time last year.  And as you mentioned, the good news is the auction market has come back for now.</p>
          <p>And severity has dropped pretty dramatically.  We were about 10,700 severity last year in the fourth quarter and we hit about 9,300 in the first quarter of 2009.  And even within that 9,300 in the first quarter, by the end of the first quarter, the last month, it was all the way down to $8,800 a unit.  So the repossessions will probably increase.  But severity right now is having a really good offset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>K.R., does this frequency go up linearly with unemployment?  And do you have a view on where that, just based on your unemployment expectations and where that's going to peak, do you have a view on what the trajectory of that is going to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.  I don't want to give a projection on where it's going to go.  It should go up a little bit, but like I said, a lot of it's tied to unemployment.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I guess the first question just on slide 16, obviously the pricing performance was pretty strong this quarter.  Wanted to just get your thoughts about the sustainability of that kind of a year-on-year increase throughout the rest of the year.  I understand that there's a lot of new product, and that's certainly a positive, but while capacity utilization is low, you know there's a lot of competition, a lot of discounting out there, and I just wanted to see if there was you know a chance that &#x2013; or if it was likely that that was going to get sort of sustained for the following subsequent quarters this year, and just overall how you see maybe pricing trending for the industry thereafter would be interesting to hear as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's probably &#x2013; well it's just hard for us to have sort of clarity on that because there's both a mixture of what we do on new products and how competitive we are on new products, and then what happens in incentive spending across the &#x2013; across us and our competitors.  We're encouraged that most people's dealer stocks seem pretty well under control, and as dealer stocks stay under control I think that will be good for pricing opportunity.  And as Alan took you through the product range we feel pretty comfortable that we've got a lot of product activity coming, and I think it's not just the individual products themselves, but it's the content within those products that make us feel there's opportunities.  But, in terms of spending, that does remain a concern because it is high, but as we see people bring their stocks down, I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That'll help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean there's obviously some destocking going on.  That ought to help over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and I guess just a further question, if I may.  There have been some out there who are concerned about the level of competitiveness down the road for Ford given some of the significant restructurings that are taking place at some of your major competitors, some of which may even go through bankruptcy to restructure; and I was just &#x2013; A, wanted to get your general thoughts on that, and B, maybe more specifically should GM or Chrysler get additional concessions?  And I don't want to be necessarily specific as to what they are, but generally speaking on compensation and other areas.  Do you expect that even though you're not &#x2013; you're potentially not going to go through bankruptcy, would you expect that you'd be able to get parity with those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand completely.  I think I would back us up to what the President and our task force has been charged to do, and the reason we went back to support our competitors for the good of the industry, is this is a really important industry for a lot of reasons, especially the contribution to the economy, and we want to be part of the solution with the turnaround.  And they have stated very clearly that it's about a viable industry going forward.  And of course the Ford plan, we've been very clear about it.</p>
          <p>We started these actions a few years ago to create a viable, exciting, profitably growing company.  We've included all the stakeholders.  I think we have a pretty clear track record now of working with all the stakeholders to improve the competitiveness of Ford going forward, and will continue to do that as we go forward.  I mean our goal is to continue to increase our competitiveness and be there for our customers, so I don't think we're going to be disadvantaged.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess said another way, then even though you went to the unions and renegotiated, equitizing some of the VEBA and some aspects of the labor contract, it wouldn't be a foregone conclusion that you wouldn't be able to do that again, to sort of match things that were done at some of the other auto companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  And then last question, just more of on a housekeeping guidance, can you give us a sense just of what we should be thinking about in terms of Other, the Other expense now that the tender offer is presumably going to have a pretty big impact on that?  I guess it's been running 400 million, three to 400 million, but I guess I would expect it to go, to be lower.  But can you help us with that?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are, as we've said, going to see about a $500 million reduction in the interest expense because of the debt restructuring.  But that's going to be mostly offset by the fact that we did draw the revolver, so we're paying those.  So it's going to be flattish as an effect.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was part of the adjusted number we showed.  And in terms of guidance, that was mostly one off good news.  In terms of going forward, we expect to see some small amounts of tax paid because we are making money in some jurisdictions.  And we will pay tax on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>In past Lidex, and I didn't catch it in this one, there was a more detailed walk on the cost performance and the expectation of where you would land for the year versus how you did in the quarter.  I didn't see that here, and I'm interested to know on both the manufacturing and engineering side, as well as the material cost side, how you see things progressing through the balance of the year and what your expectation is for the full year on those items?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In total structural costs we gave you, we started the year with guidance and we would expect to achieve about $4 billion.  And based on the strong start in the first quarter, we expect to exceed that $4 billion target.  In terms of material costs, I don't have that in front of me, it's going to be, it's probably going to be a bit good, flat to a little bit good.  Oh, sorry.  flat to slightly bad during the full year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Hello.  I wanted to ask just a detail.  Why are you increasing production slightly in North America?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we believe with the decisive action we've taken over the last few quarters we have the dealer stocks well in line and with what we see with the reception of the new products we believe we can go up a little bit more to support the real demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question, I may have missed it but did you talk about what warranty cost did over the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we didn't explicitly.  We had a bit of a discussion about the timing differences on warranty but our warranty costs are under control.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thanks.  Alan, you say you don't need a U.S. bridge loan but can you give us an update of the status of securing government funding from like Europe, other places in the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet.  Starting with the United States, we are very actively involved in closing in on the 136, the Department of Energy initiative that went with the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act on enabling technology for fuel-efficient vehicles, and we're very gratified that our enabling technology in our product lineup lines up very well with the intent of that legislation.  And so we're getting very close there and we're continuing to work, as you pointed out, with the equivalent agencies in Europe.  I think our plan's going to line up very well with that money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Alan, one additional thing on the supplier, suppliers are getting paid with this federal government program. But because of the health of it and some of the charges that the federal government program has put on it, would you like to see the government go back and perhaps change that program, making it easier for suppliers to get in instead of having to pay 2%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that to your point the government really understands the criticality of the suppliers and I think as you pointed out the guarantees were a great first step.  And I think they'll continue to look at ways to just ensure that we're able to keep moving on this restructuring and keep the fundamental supply base intact.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, you bet.  It's across all the disciplines led by, of course, manufacturing engineering but just every element of the plan, the quality, the productivity, the shortened cycle time, the less inventory, the improvement in working capital plus all the other functions too, sales and marketing.  Everybody is &#x2013; everybody has a continuous improvement quality and productivity plan.  And as you can see that we had a target for four billion for the year and we're off to a very good start so we believe that, that we'll be able to exceed that target for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you've mentioned dealers a couple times during the presentation.  It seems like that's the one area left that you're still working on where there hasn't been an actual piece of the puzzle put in place for reductions or concessions.  What's the status of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we really have, Brent, over the last few years we've been working very closely with our dynamite dealers to just rationalize our distribution system.  And as we've pointed out, there are just a few areas where we need to deal with, especially in the big metropolitan areas where we just want to make sure that we increase the through put and the profitability of our dealers.  So, we've been consolidating in a very thoughtful way, working with them.  But I'd just to like say again that Ford has a tremendous dealer network in most of the communities around the United States and we only have a few areas where we need to continue to consolidate for the good of the dealers themselves.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Alan or Lewis, I was wondering if you could quantify this production increase that you're setting out for the second quarter?  I noticed it says up 19.5% to 902,000 units in the &#x2013; is that for the worldwide?  Or is that North America only?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the presentation and also in the press release, we separated out North America and also Ford of Europe.  And in North America we're increasing to 435,000, which is a 25% increase in production, and in Ford of Europe we're increasing it to 385,000 units, which is a 13% improvement.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, one other question.  Is your pension fund fully funded at this point?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  I wanted to ask, you had a salary job cut that you finished up in January, but I think sales look like they're going to be lower this year than what you thought at the time that you planned that job cut.  Do you need to go back and look at salaried head count again in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're in pretty good shape right now, Amy.  It's a little bit lower now in the first two quarters, and we anticipated that the absolute level would be a little bit less than 2008.  But, it's starting to pick up again in the third and the fourth quarter.  So, we've completed that part of the restructuring, and we'll continue to work our fundamental productivity, but watch very carefully the market mixture that we're matching our production capability to the demand.  But we look pretty good for now.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Another question on the structural cost improvement, if you don't mind?  You're very optimistic about the gains you expect to make.  Can you identify the single area where you see the most promise?  Is it in the manufacturing side?  Is it on advertising and sales promotions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a single one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, all of the above.  It really is an important question because we've been working the entire production system.  And I'll just give you an example.  As we move to our global platforms, you can imagine the efficiency they were able to gain in engineering and manufacturing.  And as we simplify the products, you've had a chance to see what we're doing to take the complexity out of the products and align our suppliers and consolidate, that it just gives us a tremendous improvement in fundamental productivity where we can do more with a lot less resources.</p>
          <p>And that, I would characterize that as across all the professional skills against the development system for the vehicles is also the production system of the vehicles and to continue improvement in quality, reduce the costs.  And so, the fundamental plan is to be able to provide the vehicles that people want and use less time and less resources in total.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll conclude with one final question from the analyst community.  Your final question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli representing Citi.  Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thank you.  Wanted to dig in a little bit more on the 2011 updated forecast, particularly in North America.  Looks like you're gaining some more confidence there.  I remember the original target had said about a 15 plus SAAR.  Is your confidence level now that that could be achieved under a lower selling rate?  And also if you could touch upon how much cost savings you expect between now and then there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You bet.  Absolutely.  I think with the progress we're making I think we can do that with a somewhat lower SAAR.  And we're going to continue to work on it because the most important thing is that each quarter and each year that we continue to improve our quality and productivity.  So it just moves us along faster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  And is there a way to quantify order of magnitude how much the cost savings, the way you show it in your slide what you'd be thinking about between now and then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the most important thing that we have shared is that four billion for 2009, that was a very significant target for us.  And everybody's really pulled together and we're making progress as we talk about across the corporation.  And to be able to deliver that 1.9 in the first quarter just gets us off to a really good start and gives us a lot of confidence that we can continue to remove the waste from the system and improve our productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.  And then just quickly on South America.  How should we be thinking about margins there the rest of the year?  It came in a little bit lighter than what we were thinking in Q1.  Any help you can shed on the cadence there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to very much depend on what happens to the, both currency and the industry.  In South America where you have some dollar-based commodities, when the currency weakens you end up with a material cost problem, and obviously the industry's quite strong at the moment because it's getting some encouragement from government activity.  So, that's an area we're watching very closely, and the big hit in South America this quarter was currency, both internal currency and obviously some transaction currency effects as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and then lastly maybe one for K.R.  With Ford Credit reducing the size of its balance sheet how should we think about just the overall earnings power in the next few years?  And I know there isn't an official 2011 target for Ford Motor Credit, but anything you can kind of shed at how we should be just thinking about it the way you're targeting it internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I don't particularly want to give the forecast for where the earnings are going.  The way I think about it is that, for the most part, we have our margins under control.  We are underwriting appropriately going forward; picking up what we think will be the right credit losses. What really adds a ton of volatility into our earnings for the last year and a half has been the auction market. And so that'll be dampened a bit going over time as we reduce the level of leasing that we're doing this year, and that'll slowly build into the portfolio as the lease portfolio comes down.  So I think that'll take a lot of the volatility out.  The other big thing that we've been focusing on is getting our operating costs under &#x2013; getting our operating costs down to match where the lower balance sheet will end up at, and so that'll be a nice profit improvement for us.</p>
