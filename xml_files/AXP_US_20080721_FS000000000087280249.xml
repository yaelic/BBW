          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the American Express 2008 second quarter earnings conference call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Stovall.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom , and welcome to everyone.  We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion. As usual, it's my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, would, should, could, likely and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements including the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter 2008 earnings release supplement and presentation slides, which are now posted on our website at ir.americaexpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that describes the company's managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information, and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors.  We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.</p>
          <p>Ken Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of American Express, will provide some brief opening comments addressing today's announcement and the current environment.  Then Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will review the key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides provided and then conclude with summary remarks.  Once Dan completes his remarks, we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q&amp;A period, where both Ken and Dan will be available to respond to your questions.  Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions.  While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time.  Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q&amp;A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Ken.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ron.  My comments will be brief.  Over the past month or so, we have seen clear signs that the U.S. economy is weakening.  Unemployment rates as we know took the largest jump in over 20 years.  Home prices declined at the fastest rate in decades and consumer confidence is at one of its all-time low points.  Now, Cardmember spending, particularly among consumers, slowed sharply during the latter part of the quarter.  Credit indicators, as we signaled a few weeks ago, deteriorated beyond our expectations, and by almost any measure the U.S. economy and business environment are much weaker than the assumptions we first spoke to you about back in January and the conditions that existed in early June.</p>
          <p>Now this fallout was evident across all consumer segments, even our longer-term superprime Cardmembers.  While we are obviously disappointed with the bottom line results, adding to our reserves this quarter translates into coverage levels that are substantially higher than at any point during the last two years.  Yet despite this challenging environment, our revenue growth for the quarter was solid, and our business metrics, such as billings and card growth, were strong.  As you've seen from several of the earnings releases within financial services this quarter, we've been able to generate substantial returns relative to other companies, but having said that, we do not expect to meet or exceed our long-term financial targets until we see improvements in the economy.</p>
          <p>Now given the environment, we'll continue to scale back some card acquisition efforts and reduce credit lines selectively in the U.S.  At the same time, however, we also plan to take advantage of growth opportunities, particularly in international and in the business-to-business markets.  Our goal is to stay focused on gaining profitable market share, and I believe we have the strength and resources to do just that.  We obviously do not know the extent of the current downturn, but the position of our company today is financially sound and competitively strong.  We've lowered our risk profile by divesting a number of businesses in recent years, and we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that balances our short, medium and long-term objectives.</p>
          <p>Now as usual, Dan is going to review the major items and trends during the quarter.  He will also offer some additional summary and outlook comments.  And in light of the business and economic environment, as Ron said, I'm going to join him for the follow-up discussion, and we will be glad to take any of your questions.  With that, let me turn it over to Dan.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ken.  As Ron indicated, we're using slides today to facilitate the review of results, so if you don't have those, you can find them at the company's IR website.  So let me start with Slide 2, a summary of financial performance.  You can see that revenues grew 8%.  In a few slides I'll talk about what that is on a managed business.  Income came in at 655 million and EPS at $0.56.  This reflects strong performance in the international consumer, global commercial card and network and merchant services businesses, offset in part by higher credit losses in U.S. card services.  And I'll speak about that more as we proceed.  Despite the higher credit losses, we earned in excess of $600 million and ROE remained strong.</p>
          <p>Looking at Slide 3, we've identified the significant items.  First is the addition to the lending credit reserves, 374 million after-tax or 600 million pre-tax.  This is a result of higher write-offs and deterioration in roll rates that we saw in June, and reflects the inherent risk in the portfolio and higher anticipated write-offs in the balance of the year.  Second is an adjustment to the interest-only strip.  The interest-only strip relates to our securitized loans.  The 85 million after-tax or 136 million pre-tax is a write-down in the value also related to the higher credit losses we're experiencing.  The tax benefit relates to the settlement of prior year items with both the IRS and certain states.</p>
          <p>Looking now at Slide 4, capital generation, you can see that we generated $756 million.  That's a combination of income in the period as well as funds received related to either option or RSA activity.  You can see that we had no share repurchases in the quarter.  That's a decision that we made early in the second quarter given the economic uncertainty.  Going forward, we'll make decisions about share repurchases based on the economic conditions and company performance quarter by quarter.  We are committed to maintaining a strong capital position.</p>
          <p>Slide 5, metric performance.  Metrics are a key measure of the health of the business.  The second quarter metrics performed very well and excellent compared to our competitors.  Billed business grew 12% or 10% on an FX-adjusted basis, down only 100 basis points from the first quarter.  Cards-in-force increased by 10%, reflecting investments in our proprietary business and growth in GNS [Global Network Services] cards.</p>
          <p>Loan growth moderated to 12%, down from 19% in the first quarter, based on a slowdown in consumer spending.  And travel sales remained very positive.</p>
          <p>Slide 6, revenue performance.  As I mentioned, revenues grew at 8% on a GAAP basis.  As you can see, interest and securitization income actually decreased by 7%, which reflects the higher credit losses.  On a managed basis, revenues increased 12%.  Card fee growth was very strong and reflects our customers' recognition of the value proposition of our products.  Other revenue reflects in part the purchase of the GE commercial portfolio which helped that growth rate by about 600 basis points.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the segments.  If you look at Slide 7, U.S. consumer services.  U.S. consumer services billed business grew 6%, down from 8% in the first quarter.  Small business or opened held up very well at 11%.  However, consumer continued to decline as we proceeded through the quarter.  Cards-in-force growth are down slightly as we shifted some investment to the international consumer segment.  Average spend was flat, reflecting the economy and its impact on spending.  Loan growth, again, slowed in this segment, linked to the slowdown in spending.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 8, here's a little bit more detail on the U.S. consumer services billed business.  It shows you the monthly trend.  You'll recall that we saw a drop in spending in December.  March's results are depressed and April's numbers are inflated based on where Easter fell in each respective year.  Easter in '07 was in April and in '08 it was in March.  You can clearly see the drop in May and again in June, driven by the slowdown in the U.S. economy.</p>
          <p>Moving now to Slide 9, international consumer services.  On the other hand, international consumer services billed business held up very well, increasing 20%, or 10% on an FX-adjusted basis &#x2013; the same growth as we saw in the first quarter.  Card acquisition focused on the premier sector.  As you can see, that average spend grew by 17%.  Cardmember loans grew with volume and travel sales were strong.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 10, global commercial services had a very strong quarter.  Billed business grew at 14%, or 10% on an FX-adjusted basis &#x2013; again, the same growth rate that we saw in the first quarter.  Cards-in-force and average spend growth is also very solid in this segment.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 11, global network and merchant services, we see strong billed business growth outside the U.S. and I'll also note that the U.S. retail and everyday spending grew at 9%, and that category represents 69% of our U.S. billings.  The discount rate held up very well, only down 1% year over year, and GNS billed business and cards-in-force growth continues to be very impressive.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 12, expense and provision performance.  Total expense increased 6% and was very well controlled.  Marketing and promotion spending was comparable with the second quarter of 2007.  Rewards expense grew with volumes.  HR and other included increased investment in our merchant sales force.  Now charge card provision grew modestly, which reflects the lower U.S. consumer spending as well as credit actions.  The lending provision increased significantly, and I'll address that over the next few slides.  The tax rate of 14% includes the $101 million significant item that I mentioned earlier.  Without that, the tax rate would have been approximately 28%.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 13, focusing first on charge card net loss ratios, you can see that international consumer and the global commercial services remained very stable, and I assure you that we're monitoring this very closely.  The U.S. consumer services group in the first quarter reflects a seasonal event largely and also to a larger extent the impact of 2008 slowing billings.  So this calculation is the write-offs in the quarter which relate to accounts that went past due in the third quarter of '07, when billings were very strong.  And at that time, we set up appropriate reserves for those past dues, and therefore their write-offs are not having a significant impact in the second quarter of '08.  That's divided by average billings for the past three months &#x2013; April, May and June &#x2013; where we had weaker billings.  So the 44 basis points you see there in part has to do with the seasonal effect, but more than that with the time that we actually set up reserves related to accounts that went past due in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to Slide 14, charge card 90 days past due.  Again, you can see that international consumer and global commercial services are very stable, and U.S. consumer services are actually improving, which is common on a seasonal basis and is also based on the credit actions we're taking.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Slide 15, and our lending managed net write-off rate, and this is where we're seeing the significant negative impact in the P&amp;L.  So let me start by reminding you that the way we report write-offs is different than the rest of the industry.  The rest of the industry includes in write-offs principal only.  We include principal, interest and fees.  So for the U.S. consumer services, we've reflected on the dotted lines what our reported write-off rate is, and then we've also noted what it is excluding interest and fees.  It's our intent in either the third or fourth quarter to move to the industry standard.  If you're doing comparisons between our write-off rates and the industry, the 3.5% is the correct number to use.  Let me just mention for a moment, as you can see, international consumer continues to be very stable and down from 2007.</p>
          <p>In June, write-offs increased beyond our expectations, and you can see that on the next slide,, Slide 16.  Here what we've done is provided monthly write-off rates.  We've provided both the reported numbers and the numbers that are comparable to our competitors.  As we indicated in the first quarter, March was higher than the average for the quarter and at the end of the first quarter call, we also indicated that second quarter write-offs were going to be higher than first quarter.  April and May was in line or slightly above our forecast, but June increased well above our expectations.</p>
          <p>Turning to Slide 17, we see lending managed 30 days past dues.  You can see that international is stable.  The U.S. number is also consistent with the first quarter.  However, roll rates deteriorated significantly in the second quarter, in particular in June.  Roll rates are the amount that move from either current to 30 or 30 to 60, and when roll rates increase, it's an indicator of what's going to take place in the future and why we're anticipating higher write-offs in the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>If you move to Slide 18, here we've included monthly information on our roll rates.  The top chart is roll rates current to 30 days past due and the bottom chart is 30 days past due to write-off.  In the first quarter, if you look at the bottom chart, the 30 days to write-off, you can see that while the first quarter is higher than the fourth quarter, February and March were below January levels.  If you look at the current to 30, you can see that it was improving in February and March.  In you move to the second quarter, the 30 day to write-off number, while it increased in April, it improved in May and again if you go to the top chart and look at current to 30, you can see that April and May was improving.  So for these reasons, we felt we were on track through May.  However, that changed in June.  You can see in the top chart that the current to 30 increased and that the 30 day to write-off increased sharply.  As a result, in the second quarter the 30 to write-off percentage increased by over 200 basis points compared to the first quarter.  These higher roll rates will lead to higher write-offs in the third and fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>If we move to Slide 19, this is U.S. consumer services managed 30 days past due by tenure.  Now, as you can see from this chart, the 24 to 36 and the 36 to 48 buckets are growing at a faster rate than the overall portfolio.  However, all tenures are increasing, including the 48+ group.  So here we believe that the economy is affecting all tenures, not just the recent accounts that we've put on the books.</p>
          <p>If you move to Slide 20 now, and let me take a little time to explain this chart.  On the right, you see the origination year, which means the year a Cardmember joined the American Express franchise.  The time period or months across the bottom break Cardmember history with us into 12-month time periods.  The respective plots are the write-off rates for each year of origination as the group's season through the normal curve.  If you follow 2001, which is the red line, write-offs increased in the 13 to 24-month and 25 to 36-month buckets, but then improved.  Now for all years 2003 and newer, the last two plot points are impacted by 2008 credit deterioration.  For Cardmembers that joined us in 2003 in January through June, they would be in the 61-month and greater bucket.  Cardmembers that joined July through December would be in the 48 to 60-month bucket.  So as you can see for all years, 2003 through 2007 have been impacted by the 2008 economy.  So if you follow the chart across, first, you have blue, which is '03.  You can see the last two plot points increased.  The orange is 2004.  The plots &#x2013; the last two plot points increased, and that's true for 2005 and 2006 as well.  So the higher than normal last two plot points for 2006 and 2007 are due to the economy.  All tenures are being impacted.  For recent vintages, even if we experience higher write-off for two years, these investments still have very strong economic returns.</p>
          <p>Now let's go to Slide 21.  We've shown this chart to you before, and it shows that FICO scores have not deteriorated.  Now we don't use FICO scores to do our acquisitions.  We use our proprietary models.  But this is an indicator that we have not dropped our credit quality over the past several years.</p>
          <p>Let me now make a few summary comments.  Despite the significant impact that the weakening U.S. economy &#x2013; economic environment had had on our credit performance and bottom line this quarter, most of the key business metrics that serve as a long-term indicator of our competitive strength &#x2013; indicative of our competitive strength, has performed well.  We see that the overall billed business and cards-in-force growth rates where the gap between our performance and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years.  Once again, we benefit from the strong performance within our international consumer, global commercial services and global network and merchant services segments.  The performance of these parts of the franchise reflect the benefits of the diversity of our business activities and the balance they provide within our results.  Unfortunately, the revenue growth from these relatively strong results were more than offset by credit deterioration within the U.S.</p>
          <p>The severe decline in home prices and the marked rise in oil prices have had a fundamental impact on consumer budgets and behavior, not just as it relates to mortgages and home-related spending, but also across the full spectrum of the consumer economy.  We saw the first signs of weakness in our credit indicators at the end of last year, and communicated this to you in January when we reported our fourth quarter results.  At that time, we took a credit-related charge in order to recognize the deterioration by strengthening our lending and charge card reserves, coverage ratios and levels.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, U.S. lending write-off rates rose further, and at that time we indicated that the second quarter loan loss rate would be higher than the first quarter, which has proven to be the case.  In April and May, U.S. lending write-off rates were generally consistent with the 4 to 6% EPS growth plan that we discussed with you in early June.  However, as I showed you on the slide package, we saw credit deteriorate in June beyond our expectations, as the write-offs rates rose and roll rates within the portfolio deteriorated versus prior months.  In other words, more and more consumers who are falling behind in their payments are remaining delinquent.  This causes us to assume that a greater percentage of past due loans will not be repaid.</p>
          <p>In light of the magnitude of the negative economic trends and our experience, we now believe the economic weakness in the U.S. will likely worsen throughout the remainder of the year and negatively impact credit and business trends.  Therefore, it was appropriate for us to further strengthen our lending reserves and reduce the fair value of our IO strip.  This quarter reserve addition results in a coverage ratio of 135% of past due owned loans, which is substantially above the coverage levels over the last three years.  We believe this elevated coverage is appropriate in light of the continued economic uncertainty before us, the inherent risk in our portfolio, and the higher write-off levels we expect.</p>
          <p>As we discussed in the beginning of June, our 4 to 6% EPS growth forecast assumed an economic environment consistent with what we experienced throughout the first five months of the year.  We indicated then that if the environment weakened further, achieving these results would be difficult.  The environment has clearly weakened significantly since then.  Given the credit deterioration we experienced in June and the continued moderation in U.S. volume growth as well as our outlook for continued weakness in the economy, we are no longer tracking to this forecast.  In addition, we now expect that our lending write-off rate in the third and fourth quarter will be higher than June levels.</p>
          <p>As we move forward, we will continue to be guided by our long-term on average and over time financial objectives.  Since we set our targets in 1993, we have generally performed consistent with those goals and in fact, have outperformed them in recent years.  The ultimate goal is to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging conditions in the best position possible, relative to our payment competitors and relative to the overall industry.  Growth opportunities continue to exist in the marketplace, but over the coming quarters, we will be even more selective with our investment dollars, moving them to areas of current opportunities as we work to prudently balance near-term performance against long-term profitability and growth.</p>
          <p>Throughout this decade, reengineering has resulted in a well-controlled operating expense base, but in light of our desire to maximize our ability to invest in the business, we are further intensifying our reengineering efforts with an eye toward reducing cost structure and staffing levels.  While we have not yet quantified the impact of these activities, they will likely result in restructuring charges during the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The antitrust settlement we have reached with VISA and MasterCard also provides us with multi-year source of funds that can help to lessen the impact of the environment and when conditions improve give us the ability to step up investments in the business.  Collectively, we believe these factors will position us to maximize our ability to invest for the long-term.  However, these investments, coupled with the economic environment, will challenge our ability to meet our financial targets until we see improvement in the economy.</p>
          <p>While we are obviously disappointed with the impact that the current economic turmoil is having on our results, the position of the company today is financially sound and competitively strong.  We divested certain businesses, such as our international bank, and have grown others, such as B-to-B, in order to lower our overall risk profile.  Our business model has generated particularly attractive returns that provide capital flexibility and strength.  Even with the substantial credit-related charges during the quarter we generated in excess of $600 million of earnings.  We have shown our ability to adjust to the environment conditions, whether it be to implement defensive measures or take advantage of competitive opportunities.  Our balance sheet is appropriately positioned.  We have access to diversified sources of funding, and our cash position and liquidity profile provide us additional protection in these volatile times.  Across all our businesses we have instilled a strong focus on the customer, someone we need to stay close to regardless of the environment.  And lastly, our competitive position is stronger than it has been for decades.</p>
          <p>We will be impacted by the environment, but given the products, customers, geographic breadth of our franchise, we believe we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance our short, medium and long-term business and financial goals.  Thanks for listening, and we are now ready to take your questions.</p>

          <p>And Kenneth, it's so great to have you on the call.  Thank you.  I had a general question, which is you had talked about how all segments of the market were impacted from an economic standpoint.  You had talked at the investor day in January about how certain regions at the time were more impacted than others.  Today, could you talk about the derivative impact of line reductions?  I know you guys had reduced lines in the high problem real estate areas, the high problem house price depreciation areas.  I assume that others did as well.  What type of impact did that have on consumers?  Was there any one catalyst aside from spending that you can attribute the real material increase in charge-offs?  I'm just looking for anything behaviorally that can help us understand what the sudden change was.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think clearly the reduction in line size impacts spending, and that has a negative impact on spending.  I think what we are certainly trying to do on a geographic basis is to be very, very targeted, because what you don't want to do in this situation is to apply a blunt instrument across the board, because we have a number of relationships across tenures and across products that we want to preserve and grow.  So what we've been able to do is to be very, very surgical against those customers that we believe, based on our modeling, have a higher risk, and that's important both not only in setting up the models, but making sure we have the right operational controls in place as far as our credit management is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it too soon to tell when your competitors will cut lines to the same customers that you have?  I'm really interested in those derivative impacts and the strain that multiple line reductions cause and the sort of linear results in terms of higher defaults.  Is it too soon to draw those conclusions yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we &#x2013; we're continuing to learn as we go through this slowdown.  Every slowdown is differently  This is certainly one that's been different than what we've seen in the past, and we look to incorporate our learnings as we make credit decisions.  We continue to see the greatest significance in geographies where housing prices have fallen the greatest, but recently, we've actually started to see greater impacts in customers who are in that middle FICO band.  Generally it's customers with low FICOs where you see the greatest impact, and we're certainly seeing it there.  But now we're seeing it creep into FICO scores with people who are between 650 and 750.  The other new thing that we're seeing is historically if someone had multiple mortgages, that was actually a positive factor, but in recent months we're starting to see people with multiple mortgages are actually having greater difficulty.</p>
          <p>Now to your point about what competitors are doing, we are keeping a close eye, and if we identify customers that we have a significantly higher open to buy than our competitors, that's another spot where we're seeing added risk, and we're reacting to that.  So we continue to integrate new learnings into our decisioning, but at the same time, I want to emphasize that we're also being very focused on our care programs.  Some customers who are having temporary difficulties will be terrific long-term customers for the franchise, and we want to make sure we balance the credit actions we're taking to reduce near-term credit losses with the overall economics of the customer and a customer who can be of great value to us in the future.</p>

And that's where we're really using our modeling and different techniques is to make sure we are focused on targeting those people that we think are highest risk, and those customers that we can project out, we can manage better over a lifecycle.  We obviously want to continue to retain their business and loyalty.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks and good afternoon.  Can you talk at all about the roll rates in the charge card business?  Because I was a little bit surprise that you didn't build provisions there.  Are you not seeing the same trends in the charge card business?  And then also if you could comment on roll rates, particularly late stage roll rates, in the month of July &#x2013; do you have any early read on July?  Is it as bad as June?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  In the charge card business, a lot of the provisioning takes place when the account goes past due.  And so the people who actually wrote off in the second quarter went past due in the third quarter last year, and that's when the bulk of the provision was set up.  We're actually seeing that the percentage of customers that are going past due in the second quarter seasonally is always low, but we're also in the second quarter of '08 seeing the impact of lower spending as well as our credit actioning.  So because we don't see the customers going past due in the second quarter, we're not seeing a big tick-up in the provision, and therefore provision for charge card increased modestly only 3%.  So we're very comfortable with how we're handling charge card and where that provision is at this time.</p>
          <p>In terms of roll rates, you can see what we showed you on the charts in terms of what took place in June.  Before that, when you combined what we were seeing in the current to 30 roll rates with what we were seeing in the 30 day to write-off, we were comfortable.  But when both of them moved up in June, which we hadn't expected, that caused us to be much more cautious about our outlook in the future and in terms of evaluating the inherent risk in our portfolio to set up the reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any early read on July for those kinds of roll rates and also for spending?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one final question, on the lending provision, I mean on the lending growth, you mentioned that the lending slowdown in balance growth was due to lower volumes.  Anything on the marketing side that you've done to slow down the lending growth as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the marketing side, marketing is spent obviously for acquisitions, which wouldn't have a quick near-term impact on AR growth.  It takes a little bit of time for customers to get their card and to spend and move into revolve.  We still are marketing at a healthy level across the company.  You can see that we spent about the same that we did last year.  Although, I will say that we have shifted dollars to international, and that's helping our spending levels there, which are very good.  But to the extent we spend less on marketing in the U.S., that will have something of effect in terms of growth in the U.S. in addition to what's taking place in the economy.  But we want to shift our investment dollars to the place that has the best current opportunity.  We still have very good opportunities in the U.S. as well, except we're doing those on a more surgical basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we've got to be, and we are being, more targeted in the U.S.  But I would just emphasize the overall opportunities we have in international and in B-to-B, GNS provide very strong growth opportunities, and I think it demonstrates the broadness and attractiveness of our business portfolio that we have areas in our business mix that, in fact, have a more conducive profile to some of the economic issues that we're facing, and we clearly are reallocating some investments there.  And then to Dan's point, we're being very targeted and surgical about the investments we're making in the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good afternoon.  Ken, a question on market position and strategy of American Express, saying that you're in a better position than you have been in the history of the company.  Just, one area that is clearly going to continue to gain market share, not only in the U.S. but globally, is the debit card product, and I just wondered if your thinking is that &#x2013; I know you've done 30 or 40 projects on debit cards or so over the years.  I mean, you're just in a position where you're going to be relegated to have a slower growth rate than the peers, the MasterCard and VISA that are large obviously in those products globally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, the way I would answer that is I think one, you've got to look at what the overall strategic objective is for us in payment, and that's obviously to get a greater share of plastic spend against cash and checks, and we have a variety of products to do that.  As I've said a number of times, without direct access to a demand deposit account, it makes us &#x2013; makes it difficult for us to offer a debit card.  However, when one looks at the economics of our charge card products and in fact, some of our lending products, we believe that we can meet the functional pay-in-full spending needs of those customers and prospects through our variety of card products at frankly more attractive economics than we can get with debit.</p>
          <p>The other key point of where I think we are driving increased penetration is through our business-to-business products, corporate card, our middle market products, but also GNS.  And GNS allows us, obviously with a very different risk profile, and without having credit risk, to go after that spending.  And so I think what you've got to look at is the range of products.  And what I would emphasize is that, despite a very challenging economic environment, from a market share standpoint, the trends are encouraging relative to our growth overall in the U.S.  And certainly when you then add international to that, I think we have some very attractive growth prospects.</p>
          <p>So the point is the credit situation in the U.S. is disappointing, but what I would emphasize is as I look at our top line metrics, and I think what we've got to understand is we're managing this company, on average and over time, to achieve some financial objectives that we think are ambitious, and we have been able to do that historically.  This is obviously a tough period right now in the U.S., but I'm confident because of our market-leading position and the way we have performed even this quarter from a metrics standpoint, that the prospects for our card business in the future are, in fact, strong.  And obviously we need to see some improvement in the economic cycle in the U.S.  But when I look at international, B-to-B and the opportunities and history of our business in the U.S. going through different cycles, I do think we're at a, the strongest competitive position that we've been in a number of years.  However, we're dealing in a very challenging economic environment in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just a quick follow-up on GNS, you have spending growth of 42% but revenue growth of 12% and higher provisions maybe in that segment than we would expect over the last couple quarters.  I just wondered if the revenue growth and spending growth kind of converge over time, and why the provisions are as high as they are in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so GNS growth at 42% is just a piece of that segment, the global network and merchant services segment.  That includes both GNS as well as our proprietary business that's flowing through this segment.  So I think that certainly the growth rates that we've seen in GNS which have been absolutely terrific, to think that any business could continue at 42% would be difficult, but they have done a very nice job in terms of continuing to grow at a very high rate.  The 12% that you referred to is really all of the billed business, both proprietary and GNS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the provisions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the provisions within GNS, I think any time you have a slowdown, that while they are much less impacted by credit losses, there is reserves that we've set up within this segment either related to small merchants who could potentially go out of business or large merchant reserves that we've set up that's required under FIN 45, and so in this quarter, we actually saw an impact as we increased that reserve during the quarter, primarily to reflect some of the difficulties that we see in the airline industry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you provide a little more color on, or contrast the differences in spending behavior, discretionary spending, between U.S. charge card customers and credit card customers?  And then how about, the slide on &#x2013; Slide 20, the vintage loss curves, and how do the last few years of charge card customers compare to what you see in U.S. lending and how does small business compare to that in terms of loss development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So we don't provide a breakout between charge card and lending products.  What we provided you with is the &#x2013; what's taking place on spending within the U.S. consumer segment, which includes small business as well as consumer charge and lending products.  I think as you can see from the chart, small business growth in the quarter was 11% compared to 3% on the consumer side.  So small business is holding up better, but on the consumer side, we're seeing a greater impact, and we're seeing it both on the charge card side and in spending on our lending products, so we're seeing that against, across both those spectrums.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're saying that consumer charge card spending has fallen off the way consumer lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think both consumer lending and charge card are being impacted by the economy, and are both seeing the impact of the economy and resulting in slower spending by our Cardmembers &#x2013; both Cardmembers who have lower FICO scores and Cardmembers who have high FICO scores, both in Cardmembers who carry a Blue Card and people who carry a Centurion Card.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because the reality, David, is that affluent people, in fact, in some cases are cutting back on discretionary spending, so they're not in the same situation as other segments, but the reality is we are seeing very affluent people who have had historically very, very strong spending history with us, are cutting back on nondiscretionary, that they deem, items.  They are still very loyal to our product.  They're still putting a good percentage of their spending on our products, so we don't believe we're losing share to other products based on our relative billings growth rate, but we are seeing affluent customers change some of their spending behavior.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is the 2% year-over-year growth rate in billed business for USCF kind of a run rate going into the third quarter, do you think, or is there something funny in June and July like there was in March and April with Easter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't think there's an impact like Easter in the numbers.  As I mentioned, I think there was a downward slope in the quarter.  The average was 3% for the quarter, but 2% in June.  So we'll have to see whether that continues or not.  We'll have to see what happens in the third quarter before we know that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and could you just clarify the impact of the GE portfolio?  Were there cards that were converted in the quarter?  Was there billed business that you recognized from the GE acquisition?  I think the other income you referred to was about $60 million of that 150 increase, but I'm not sure if there's something else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're very pleased with the progress we have made in terms of GE customers, our contacts with them.  We've begun to sign those customers.  Until we actually sign them and move them over onto our platform, the revenues that we generate from them are included in other revenues, and I was just commenting that of the 15% growth on that line, about 600 basis points related to the GE acquisition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so you haven't even converted the GE employee card yet?  So there's no billed business effect this quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  I'm just trying to get my arms around the trajectory of the lending charge-off rates and U.S. billed business on a go-forward basis.  I think on the lending side, you guys mentioned that third and fourth quarter rates will be above the June levels, but how should we think about it related to seasoning versus cyclical?  There will be some kind of abatement from the seasoning pressure kind of at the end of the year?</p>
          <p>And on billed business, could you just talk about what caused such a pronounced slowdown in May and June?  Is it partly related to line reductions or largely related to line reductions?  And then finally on lending reserves, should we assume that coverage to delinquencies will remain as long as credit remains under pressure?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'm not sure whether that was one question or five questions, Sanjay, but...  So I think there is, the seasoning that takes place really takes place in months 12 through 36 in large measure.  So I don't think in the near-term we're going to see any radical change in the seasoning impact, because we've been fortunate in that we've been able to add significant new customers to the franchise, which is what our intent is, as we strive to drive spend and take share in the marketplace.  And so, and even today, based on the investments that we're making in the business, we're continuing to bring on Cardmembers.  So I don't think we'll see the seasoning impact have any quick change in the next 6 to 12 months.  As you know, we're having more of an impact of that seasoning on our business than our competitors are, because they haven't grown at the same rate that we have.</p>
          <p>In terms of billed business and the impact that we saw in May and June, we think it's the impact of the economy.  We look across all products.  We look across all tenures.  We look across all FICO scores, and as Ken was saying, what we're seeing is people with very good FICO scores who have been long tenured customers are being more cautious in this environment, and so we're seeing a slowdown in spend, really across the board.  And that is really what causes us to think that it's the economy.  Plus I think you've seen from all of our competitors, they've been impacted in the same &#x2013; in the same manner in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to your last question in terms of what we put up for reserves, reserves is, that we've set up is a combination of what we're seeing in write-off rates, what we're seeing in roll rates, what we're also sensing is happening in the economy, and certainly in June we saw unemployment jump dramatically, consumer confidence is down.  So setting reserve really contemplates all those things in assessing the inherent risk in the portfolio, so I think we'll continue to keep what we consider to be appropriate levels of reserves as long as we continue to see a slowdown in the economy.  If the economy were to get worse from here, we'd see additions to reserves, and when the economy improves, we'll take those reserves down in a prudent fashion.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just a point of clarification on the chart on page 20, is that using the old method of computing the write-off rate including accrued interest and fees, or is that the new method you're talking about excluding those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think that's the old method including interest and fees, Brad.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So in terms of thinking about the magnitude of the impact that you're experiencing relative to your industry peers, I think you just acknowledged that you are seeing a faster acceleration in loss dollar amount and loss rates relative to your much higher growth versus peers over the last couple of years, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I wouldn't call it acceleration, Brad.  I think we are being impacted the same way everybody's being impacted.  Certainly if we decided to bring on fewer customers historically, then loss rates in those periods and loss rates in these periods would be lower.  The way we view it is the life of the customer.  So to the extent we can bring on customers that have good economics over their life with us, we want to bring those customers onto the books.  To the extent there's a slowdown, to the extent we have more customers, we're going to have higher write-offs and provision in the short-term, but our focus isn't the short-term.  Our focus is the medium to long-term, and we think that those investments to bring in those customers were a good decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think, Brad, what's important is, and it's obviously understandable given the economic environment and the credit situation, if we were managing the business just for '08, there'd be a different set of strategies and tactics that you would put in place.  But I think what we've been able to demonstrate is as I look at our overall book of business, I think we've got the best in class customers on our books, and I believe that positions us very well from a multiyear standpoint.  And we take the current economic environment very, very seriously, but what I would emphasize is that we're balancing those risks against what we see as very strong opportunities from a multiyear basis.  And as we look through history and we look at the last two downturns, and that's why I've made this point, that competitively I think we are far stronger and I think the quality of our customer base is very strong, and as I said is best in class, I think we are positioning ourselves so that we have multiple year growth with attractive economics going forward, and I think that's the point.  We could, in fact, limit the credit exposure by not growing at all, and what I would submit is that the economic tradeoffs that we've made have been good tradeoffs over a multiple year period, and that's really been the philosophy that we've used to manage our business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

So I think that's an important point that I would emphasize.  Clearly, we have grown, but we haven't grown as a result of lowering the quality of our accounts.  In fact, the quality of accounts is as strong as our traditional Cardmembers.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have just a question on how you model future credit losses and the degree of confidence in your modeling.  Given just the changes we're seeing in consumer behavior and the fact that we are seeing, for example, a nationwide decline in home values and we don't know what that means for consumer behavior, how confident are you in your modeling?  Can you talk about how often you review it and the feedback mechanism and how often would you incorporate that into new assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so as you know, we're using historical data to inform our view of the future, and we look at both the absolute level of performance today as well as the trend over the last several months, and we look at what we're seeing in roll rates once things are in delinquency to assess what percentage will ultimately go to write-off, which helps inform us in terms of where our reserve should be.  What we've assumed is that the roll rates that we see today were worsened somewhat over the balance of the year, and so I have high confidence in our ability to model what will happen assuming that that is exactly what happens.  It's slightly worse.</p>
          <p>Now as you know if you know, next month or over the next few months things get significantly worse, then we'll build that into the model, but it will cause write-offs to be higher in the balance of the year.  But quite frankly, the inverse is true.  If customer behavior improves, then it will be better.  So we use all the information at our disposal and we look at not only what's happening in write-offs and roll rates, but what's happening in spend to help inform our view of what's going to happen over the balance of the year.  So I feel good about our ability to forecast the next six months.  You know, once you get beyond that, it becomes a lot more difficult.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just really cover just one example that you used, which is multiple mortgages, that that's just an example of where we've been able to incorporate a change from what we saw historically.  And the reality is that we're looking at a whole set of drivers where we have a constant feedback loop to understand what's a change in causing the credit performance, and that's something that we are very, very focused on and it really is a constant feedback loop that we have, and we've demonstrated that we can act on that, I think, very, very quickly and feed that into our overall system.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just looking at your slide on page 18 on the roll rates, the dip in May in both the top and bottom slide, is it fair to assume that maybe some of that was attributable to the tax rebate checks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know it's hard to say definitively.  That certainly could have an impact.  You know, I would say that sometimes there's movement month to month, and we try not to react too dramatically just to a week's information or a month's information, because as you can see from these charts, it can bounce back, but May could have been impacted by the rebate checks.  It's hard to assess.  Our focus was that it looked like at least for the 30 day past due to write-off may seem to be something of an aberration compared to the trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I would just say the tax rebates, to Dan's point, is we don't really have any evidence on credit or spending that we're seeing an impact, and if you look at the overall profile of our customer base, my own personal view would be I don't think there was much impact.  But I can't say that for certain.  But when I look at the profile of our customer base, I don't think that would have much of an impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just on your comment on the multiple mortgages attribute, could you maybe clarify, why would that have been a positive attribute in the past and how quickly have you made that change in your underwriting model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, it is, the comment is just based on historical performance.  Historically, folks that had multiple mortgages appeared to be people who had the capacity to handle those mortgages, continue to be financially balanced, and continue to spend and make payments on our products.  That's just a historical fact.  What we've started to see is that in this environment, probably heavily impacted by the drop in housing prices, that the inverse is starting to happen, that as a group, people who have multiple mortgages are starting to perform less well than folks who do not have multiple mortgages.  So as we started to see that, we've started to build that into our credit decisioning, so that our models are as up to date as possible and help to us make the best decisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think on the multiple mortgage issue, the reality is, as an example, you have a, you had historically a highly creditworthy customer who had very good credit scores.  The issue is from a multiple mortgage if they have a sharp valuation decline, some of them are caught in the middle, and that &#x2013; so you may not &#x2013; you wouldn't see that upfront in modeling that someone's credit score was different.  This was a group that I would say intuitively would stand to reason that in a range of environments, highly creditworthy, they have multiple mortgages and then that they had a price decline on one or two of those properties, that's going to have an impact.  And by any modeling that you've done, they looked like and acted and performed and paid as very, very good customers.  And so that's why I point to the example, but I think the logic of it which borne out by their performance over a multiple year period, was that these were highly creditworthy people who, in fact, performed well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Just to get back to the roll rate analysis, I mean, the roll rate obviously has been an important tool in determining the number of current people going bad that will ultimately go through default, but do you have a view about incremental incidence of loss which won't be reflected there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean &#x2013; this is historical data, so if is the question is how many people who are in current today will ultimately go past due and then ultimately write off, you know, we use the historical data that we have and as I said, we increased it above the current level to reflect our view of the economy, but how many, whether that's going to worsen or improve, I think will be very much driven by the economy that we see in the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  So just to be clear, Dan, there isn't &#x2013; I guess I'm trying to determine whether there is an expectation that things will or will not get worse, and whether that's baked into this future loss expectation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our reserve anticipates higher write-offs in the third and fourth quarter and anticipates that the roll rates will get somewhat worse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and if I can just ask a follow-up on Slide 20, the &#x2013; I mean, do you have any commentary on the slope of the recent vintages and how much that differential versus some of the older vintages relates to this seasoning issue versus changing in underwriting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean that's clearly a key question, and I think the reason that we included these multiple years is that from the very early origination years of '01 and '02, you can see the normal seasoning take place, but as you can see, it's having an impact on the '03, '04, '05 vintages, which are very strong vintages, so it causes us to conclude that the impact that we're seeing in '07 and '06 is being driven by the economy as opposed to that that group was less creditworthy than the groups in the earlier years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess, Dan, I'm having difficulty reconciling that though with the severity of the slope on the '06 and '07.  It would seem to suggest that they're following the same pattern but seem to be more fully-loaded curves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the folks in the 12 to 36-month are probably the most vulnerable group, because they're in the height of the curve, and so to think that the height of the curve is where you're going to have the greatest impact, to me, is a very logical assumption to make.  But I think you're seeing some of the other curves move up by 100 basis points or more on each plot point, and I think you have to look at all the data that we have available.  If you look at Slide 21, here clearly you can see that using FICO scores as a indicator that we not only didn't drop FICO scores, but we actually increased the quality of customers just looking at FICO scores.  So I think the plot points you're seeing for '06 is reflecting the fact that they are in the height of the curve, and therefore they're being more impacted, but we still think there'll be a large group of customers within that origination year will be terrific customers long-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other point, and again, as we keep on emphasizing, we don't use the FICO scores from a modeling standpoint, but to categorize where we've come out.  And I've given this example in our Blue Card portfolio, which is the largest, 12% in '01 were 750 and above FICO scores.  At the end of 2006, 46% were 750 and above.  So just go back to the quality of customer that we've been bringing in, obviously, there's an impact from a seasoning standpoint and an impact on the economic environment overall, but I do not believe it is an issue that we have lowered the criteria for new customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And last thing, point I'd make is that when you look at the earlier curves, for customers who came in '01 through '04, they were going through that difficult seasoning period when the economy was very strong, and so naturally, you would expect them to be lower than the current curves.</p>

          <p>Next question is from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just wondering, Dan, given your comment that the reserves are kind of anticipating a deterioration in losses, I noticed then, and you expressed them as a percentage of the delinquencies, your ratio of charge-offs to delinquencies kind of doubled over the last year.  It went from 135 or 137% up to 175%, and if you kind of look at the global kind of owned charge-offs, they're running in the second quarter kind of 30% at an annual rate ahead of the reserve, and you're saying you're expecting them to go up.  So I guess I wanted to understand how anticipatory that is and what we should expect for the reserve if, in fact, charge-offs increase in the third and fourth quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So usually, I mean, we show owned and managed statistics, and generally we'd look more often to the managed statistics when we think of the health of the overall franchise.  Over recent &#x2013; last three years when the economy was strong, the coverage ratio of delinquencies has been kind of in the 95 to 100 range.  We've taken them up to 135% on an owned basis, 144% on a managed basis, which are, I think, at levels we had when we were back in the last slowdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually feel very comfortable that we have an appropriate level of reserves based on what we've seen to date and anticipating that it will be somewhat worse going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How many months of charge-offs do you expect to keep in the reserve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't use months coverage of write-offs.  It's one of the statistics that we obviously look at, so currently, we would have over 12 months of write-off coverage in our book, and even assuming that write-offs increased the way that our models say, even after that, if you looked out to December, we would have over 10 months of coverage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm having trouble with that, since the current annualized charge-off rate is in excess of the reserve on both an owned and a managed basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what, I'm not sure exactly what the rate you're referring to is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>827 million of write-offs on the owned worldwide portfolio and 2.6 billion of reserves, so 800 times 4 is 3.2 billion, 3.3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, so if you do months coverage, first again, I would recommend that we do it on a managed basis, and you'd have to go back, and that number is write-offs in one month, well I guess that's a quarter, so you'd actually have to track back over the last three quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening.  Thanks for taking my question.  Just a question on the discount rate, historically, you've put a caveat out that due to everyday spend categories, there's pressure, slow but modest pressure over time on the discount rate, and I was wondering given the comments regarding moving away from discretionary and more towards nondiscretionary spend, if you expect the discount rate pressure to accelerate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think without any pricing actions on our part, based on the growth in everyday spend, we would expect the discount rate could drop by 2 or 3 basis points a year.  However, we have been very successful with certain categories of merchants to go back to them and demonstrate the value that we bring to them and actually have been able to increase price.  And as a result of that, we've either &#x2013; last year, I think we stayed pretty flat.  This year, we've seen a very modest reduction in discount rate, so we will continue, I think, to see growth in everyday spend which will put pressure on the discount rate, but I think we'll also continue to look at, when it's appropriate based on the value we bring, to increase certain categories.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would also say that given some of the reward programs and marketing programs that we have created, the reality is there are a number of merchants in a range of categories who want to build business, and the point is while we have seen declines, as I talked about, of some of our more affluent customers, their loyalty to our product and the use of the product has continued.  And so I think that what is incumbent upon us, which we've been successful in this over the last several years, is to continue to increase the value that we can provide merchants and to use what is clearly a very challenging economic time to reinforce our value and to bring more business to merchants.  And so while no one likes being in this situation, I think that it is an opportunity for us to continue to demonstrate the value that we're providing merchants and to have that Cardmember insistence and loyalty, which I think is still continuing despite the fact that people are lowering their level of spending.  When they are spending, we want them obviously using our products and services.</p>
