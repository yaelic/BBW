          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Andy Clark. Mr. Clark, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wendy , and welcome, everyone, to the review of the fourth quarter 2009 financial results for BNY Mellon. This conference call webcast will be recorded and will consist of copyrighted material. You may not record or rebroadcast these materials without BNY Mellon's consent.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks may include forward-looking statements. The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. These factors include those identified in the cautionary statement on page 15 of our press release and those identified in our documents filed with the SEC that are available on our website, bnymellon.com. Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, January 20, 2010, and we will not update forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>This morning's press release provides the highlights of our results. We also have the Quarterly Earnings Review document available on our website, and we will be using the Quarterly Earnings Review to discuss our results.</p>
          <p>This morning's call will include comments from Bob Kelly, our Chairman and CEO, and Todd Gibbons, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, several of our executive management team members are available to address questions about the performance of our businesses.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Andy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our earnings per share were $0.59 or $712 million, and on an operating basis they were $0.55 or $667 million.</p>
          <p>In Q4, our balance sheet remained strong, as evidenced by the fact that we had a much lower provision, and we actually had a small securities gain. This is the first time we've had a securities gain in a quarterly result since the second quarter of '07. So it is welcome to finally see that bit of a turnaround and a pretty solid indication of how differently we should view the securities markets versus a year ago or two years ago.</p>
          <p>Several of our core businesses are showing some improvement, with a particularly strong quarter in Asset Management. However, the persistently low interest rate environment around the world continues to challenge our net interest revenue. It also impacts fee revenue due to fee waivers that are pretty substantial in our company. Todd is going to talk a little bit more about that a little later on.</p>
          <p>Fee revenue was actually up 2% versus the prior quarter excluding the net impact of third-quarter asset sales. We had excellent growth in assets and wealth management fees. They were up 13%. We had net long-term asset flows of $14 billion, which was the biggest increase since 2006, and performance fees were up $58 million.</p>
          <p>Our securities servicing fees excluding sec lending revenue was actually up 1%, led by core fees in asset servicing as well as in issuer services. Securities lending spreads and FX volatility remain soft. NII was up slightly, mostly due to our small increase in our balance sheet size.</p>
          <p>Expenses were a little higher than recent levels on an operating basis. They were down 1% year-over-year, but up 6% sequentially. This sequential increase was largely driven by a seasonal increase in business development, the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments, higher legal and FDIC expenses &#x2013; in other words, you shouldn't view it as a run rate and they were unusually high. We do want to point out that on a full-year basis, incentive expense was actually down 20% versus 2008.</p>
          <p>We took a restructuring charge of 139 million to allow us to continue to drive efficiencies in future quarters, and it was more than offset by a one-time tax gain in our financials. During the quarter, we also completed the previously announced restructuring of our investment portfolio to reduce risk. That has helped put our biggest securities issues behind us, and going forward, they should be modest in size, if at all. We also declared victory on our merger integration, outperforming our original goals handily.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to win new business and pipelines are actually good. In addition to strong new flows in Asset Management and Asset Servicing, we won $400 billion in new assets under custody. In Wealth Management, we had our 16th consecutive quarter of net positive client asset flows. In DRs and Corporate Trust, we continue to win business away from our competitors. In fact, we won two more DR &#x2013; two more DRs moved their established program from competitors to us during the quarter. In Broker-Dealer Services, we continue to gain market share both internationally and domestically. And in Pershing, we've had great success in converting business opportunities, and 2010 should be another good a year.</p>
          <p>We continue to love our business model. We are well-positioned for improving stock and debt markets, for increased global capital flows and for new issuance levels, and of course, any increase in short-term interest rates will greatly increase our fees and net interest income.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect a better year in 2010 versus 2009. So at this point, let's hand it off to Todd to go deeper into the numbers, and then we'll come back for questions. Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob indicated, our core businesses are showing signs of improvement and our Asset Management results were particularly strong. As I get into the numbers, my comments will follow the Quarterly Earnings Review, beginning on page 3. You can see our continuing EPS was $0.59 on a reported basis, and that includes a benefit of $0.04 related to a discrete tax item and the securities gains Bob just mentioned. It was partially offset by a charge related to our reengineering initiatives and M&amp;I expenses. That gets us to an operating EPS of $0.55 for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating earnings benefited approximately five to $0.06 from a lower effective tax rate, which was driven by a higher proportion of foreign earnings. Operating earnings were negatively impacted two to $0.03 by adjustments to benefits expenses and the seasonal increase in certain expense items. Thus, I view our core operating earnings in the 0.51 to $0.53 range.</p>
          <p>Net interest revenue was up 1%, fee revenue decreased 1%, but if you exclude asset sales that we made in the third quarter, fee revenue increased 2% sequentially and provision for credit losses declined 82 million.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page five of the Review, you can see the assets under management and assets under custody rose for the quarter and securities on loan declined. The decline of securities lending assets was probably a yearend event. We expect the decline to be temporary. Assets under management was up 15%, largely driven by the Insight acquisition. However, we're pleased to see a $14 billion increase in long-term flows.</p>
          <p>Turning to page six of the Earnings Review, which shows fee growth. Securities servicing fees, if you exclude securities lending revenue, were at 1% quarter-over-quarter and essentially flat from last year. In Asset Servicing, core fees were up 4% sequentially, reflecting higher market values and net new business, as assets under custody were up 1%.</p>
          <p>Securities lending fees were off $14 million sequentially and 138 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. Both declines reflect lower spreads and lower volumes. Spreads were off 33% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Average volumes were off 4% sequentially. Spreads are now at historically low levels, and we expect them to improve as interest rates move. During the quarter, we won an incremental $400 billion in new business in Asset Servicing, and the pipeline remains strong.</p>
          <p>Issuer services fees were up 3% sequentially, primarily reflecting higher DR revenue, and that was offset somewhat by lower money market related distribution fees in Corporate Trust. Clearing fees declined 6% over the prior quarter and 20% over the prior year, once again resulting from lower money market related distribution fees, as well as lower trading volumes.</p>
          <p>One of the key drivers of our total performance was a strong quarter in Asset Management. Asset and wealth management fees were up 13% sequentially and 5% over last year. Both increases reflect the impact of the acquisition of Insight in the fourth quarter, stronger investment performance and improved market values, which was partially offset by a reduction in money market related fees due to outflows in money market products and higher fee waivers due to the impact of lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Assets under management increased 15% over the prior quarter, while outpacing the rate of growth in the equity markets. If we look at the asset management business, AUM here reached 1.04 trillion in the quarter. Assets under management benefited from the Insight acquisition, as mentioned, in the net long-term benefits of 14 billion in the quarter, primarily reflecting the benefit from the strength in global equity and fixed income products. Assets under management were negatively impacted by short-term outflows. Note that the Insight acquisition closed on November 2, so we're not yet seeing a full quarter impact on our earnings.</p>
          <p>Finally, as mentioned above, the near zero rate environment continues to impact money market distribution fees in several of our businesses. Fee waivers are currently costing us about $0.04 per quarter and are unlikely to change until the central banks increase rates.</p>
          <p>FX and other trading revenue was flat sequentially and down 52% compared to the record fourth quarter of 2008. The sequential results reflect higher FX revenue and lower fixed income trading revenue. The decrease year-over-year reflects lower FX revenue driven by reduced volatility as well as a lower valuation of credit derivatives to hedge the loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to net interest revenue, which is detailed on page seven of the Earnings Review, NIR and the related margin continue to be impacted by persistently low short-term interest rates globally and our strategy to invest in high quality, relatively short duration assets. NIR increased 1% sequentially, primarily reflecting a higher level of interest earning assets. The net interest margin was 177 compared with 185 in the prior quarter. The decrease in the margin reflects an increase in interest earning assets driven by deposit growth. In the current rate environment, we cannot invest new deposits at historical spreads, thus the net interest margin will vary slightly with the overall size of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>In the quarter there was modest accretion of the restructured assets, which was largely offset by lower hedging gains. In 2010, we expect the portfolio restructuring to contribute approximately $200 million to net interest income, and that's slightly better than the high-end of our original estimates.</p>
          <p>Turning to non-interest expense on page eight, you can see that operating expenses were up 6% sequentially, and this was primarily reflecting seasonally higher business development expenses including branding costs, the impact of the Insight acquisition, employee benefit adjustments and higher legal and FDIC expenses.</p>
          <p>On page nine of the Earnings Review, we provide detail on our securities portfolio. The first table details activity in fourth quarter of '09 and the second is our traditional table showing amortized cost, fair value and ratings.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the investment portfolio restructuring. The net impact of that was a $15 million pre-tax securities gain. First of all, what we did is we moved $5 billion in fair value of our investment securities portfolio into a Grantor Trust. As you can see from the schedule, the Grantor Trust contains Alt-A, prime and subprime RMBS, which have been previously written down to fair value as part of the third quarter efforts. As a result of this transaction, we received $771 million in cash for a Class A senior tranche that was sold to third parties and we retained the Class B certificates with a fair value of $4.2 billion, as you can see in the table.</p>
          <p>The securities held in the Grantor Trust have been marked down to approximately $0.60 on the dollar, so the likelihood of future impairments is low. In fact, we expect to recover a significant amount of the write-down over time. The Grantor Trust resulted in a $39 million net loss in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In addition to completing the Grantor Trust, we sold an additional $2.9 billion fair value of securities, and most of that was from the watch list, and that was for a gain of $54 million. The following table represents the fourth quarter 2009 activity related to restructuring as well as the investments we made in the quarter. And as you can see from the table, the watch list declined 38% in the quarter and it's now down over 50% from the peak. Although it's been painful, we are pleased with the restructuring's execution and comfortable with the level of risk in the portfolio.</p>
          <p>In December, we recorded a pre-tax restructuring charge of $139 million. The charge was comprised of 102 million for severance costs along with $37 million of asset write-offs. The severance costs are related to the execution of our global location strategy, which will involve migrating positions to global growth centers and eliminating certain positions. Since there will be additional costs as well as some benefits related to these initiatives in 2010, we will not actually start to see the net benefit until the beginning of 2011.</p>
          <p>Our regulatory capital ratios remain strong. Tier 1 increased 60 basis points to 12% and Tier 1 common increased 60 basis points to 10.5%. TCE remained stable at 5.2, as the acquisition of Insight absorbed approximately 15 basis points, and our tangible assets were higher due to lower levels of cash with central banks and an increase in deposits.</p>
          <p>In terms of our loan portfolio on page 11, the provision for credit losses declined from 147 million to 65 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting improved credit migration over the period. Going forward, we expect the quarterly provision to be roughly in the same range we've seen in this quarter. During the quarter, the total reserve for credit increased 30 million &#x2013; $32 million, and net charge-offs totaled $33 million.</p>
          <p>Our results for the quarter include a net income tax benefit of $41 million, which consists primarily of a $51 million benefit from proportionally higher foreign earnings and a $133 million benefit from a discrete tax item, which is related to a tax loss on mortgages. The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter on an operating basis was 22%, and that included the $51 million benefit I noted earlier. We would expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 32% in 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to page 19, during December, we declared victory on our merger. Year-to-date, we achieved $251 million in annualized revenue synergies, well above our full year target, and we also realized $206 million in expense synergies during the quarter, an incremental increase of $10 million from the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2010, we are pleased to see revenue momentum in our core asset management and securities servicing businesses, though our revenue continues to be impacted by the persistently low interest rate environment. In fact, we estimate that a 100 basis point increase in overnight rate should add about $500 million of pre-tax earnings to our annual run rate, and that assumes no change in client deposit and money market activities. So once interest rates start to rise, we will benefit greatly. In the meantime, we're focused on improving our performance by increasing revenues, controlling costs, and reducing earnings volatility.</p>
          <p>Let me provide a little color on each. I'll start on the revenue front. Here we are actively identifying opportunities to consolidate market share and enhance our global capabilities to create more growth. There are also natural ties that exist between many of our product capabilities. We're working to more effectively package various services for certain client segments, which will enable us to offer more comprehensive solutions that our competitors simply can't match.</p>
          <p>Our second initiative is to grow margins by improving our operating models. Across the company, we're looking at which jobs really need to be performed in major metropolitan areas and which could be done equally well in one of our growth centers. The expense benefits from our 2010 moves will begin to show up in 2011. Parallel to this, we are continuing our ongoing re-engineering and process automation efforts, looking across the company as a whole.</p>
          <p>Third is to continue to limit the risk on our balance sheet, something you saw with the previously announced securities portfolio restructuring that we completed in fourth quarter. We've also nearly completed rightsizing our largest credit exposures, which will also reduce earnings volatility. And on Friday, we closed on the sale of our Florida bank. Together, these three initiatives will improve our performance and the consistency of our earnings going forward.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well thanks. Let's open it up for questions now.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question today is from Mike Mayo [Calyon Securities]. You may ask your question and please state your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give a little more color on the pipelines? I mean, you mentioned a lot of different areas where you see business momentum, but it's hard for us to put that in context. I mean, maybe as a percentage of revenues or at least compared to last quarter or last year, kind of the percentage increase &#x2013; just some sort of context to that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Mike, why don't I start with Ron O'Hanley, and, because that's where we obviously are seeing the most &#x2013; the most momentum is in Asset Management. Ron?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The overall pipeline is up significantly &#x2013; early 2010 versus early 2009. As you might expect, activity levels were just simply down last year. The rough estimate for the industry is down, in the institutional areas, by about two-thirds. So, we're seeing a dramatic increase in our pipeline, even more of an increase outside the U.S. than in, as much reflecting the fact that our non-U.S. revenues are growing. But it's a very robust pipeline. I would liken it back to kind of the mid part of the last &#x2013; of this last decade kind of levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully, it's a bit of a new run rate for us, and it's great to see the performance in the funds as well. Karen, anything you'd say about your various businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. No, very similarly, and actually Todd referenced some large deals in Depository Receipts, Art's Broker-Dealer business, Treasury and Corporate Trust, our pipelines are strong. So, we're quite positive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and, Jim, how about the Custody?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the pipelines are basically flat versus a year ago. About a quarter of our pipeline is in the large outsourcing deals from investment management firms. As a matter of fact, we just recently won a very large mandate in Europe that we'll be able to announce publicly shortly and looking forward to doing that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Rich?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob, I'd say that we have the strongest pipeline going into the year that we've had in a good long time. We've got verbals and letters of intent on 50 million in new revenue and about 100 billion in assets in Pershing. So we feel good about that, and we're very close to getting a few more marquis key names across the goal line. So the strongest sign going into the year we've seen in awhile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess the way I'd kind of summarize it, Mike, if that was helpful is, obviously very strong in Asset Management and Wealth Management, generally strong in Karen's various businesses. Obviously, we like to see a lot more issuance of corporate paper and have the securitization market come back at some point. What we see in Pershing is great pipelines and activity, and in Jim and Tim's world, in the custody business, it's going to have to take the economy to continue to turn around and for eventually, for interest rates to pick up. We are highly levered, as you know, to an improving capital markets and eventually higher interest rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, well, that was comprehensive. One more slice at it. Non-U.S. relative to U.S. growth this quarter, I mean, is it growing a little faster, twice as fast, any metric for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say that, actually we were pleased with the growth that we saw outside of the U.S. Of the top of my head, I don't want to put it &#x2013; I don't have a precise number on that. I'd have to look at my &#x2013; to the various businesses. Jim, do you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mike, our business in the last quarter, more than half of it came from outside the U.S. And to give you some perspective in the Asset Servicing side, our revenues have moved from a year ago at 37% outside the U.S. to now 41%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think Asset Management was particularly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for the last couple of years, about two thirds of the growth has been non-U.S. versus one third in the U.S. It was even more for the last quarter, simply because of the acquisition of Insight. But I think you will see non-U.S. business continuing to grow, and in fact, Asset Management, now 50% of the revenues are from non-U.S. clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're pretty optimistic that we can continue to gain share in &#x2013; outside of the U.S.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. The core balance sheet seemed to grow nicely this quarter. I'm curious on your thoughts on whether we've hit an inflection point here, or if there's still some lumpiness and frictional issues that we need to work through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the driver of the balance sheet was really deposit-driven, Howard. And there are some lumpy deposits in there, but I would say you're seeing just a reasonably good trend, and I would expect the balance sheet to grow with our businesses &#x2013; probably not quite as fast as revenue growth, but certainly correlated to revenue growth. It seems to be a lot more normalization of it, though, I would say, a couple of lumpy deposits, but it's starting to get back to normal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks, Todd. And then Todd, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned this $500 million benefit from a 100 basis point rise in rates. I was curious, could you flesh that out a little bit, because I know there's a bunch of moving parts between NII, money market fee waivers, sec lending spreads, a bunch of other impacts. So curious if you could help bucket that and kind of walk through what timeframe it takes to get the full benefit of all that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. It's probably about equally split between fee waivers and net interest income. And so if we look at fee waivers, we start to recover probably in the vicinity of 60% of the fee waivers from a mere 25 basis point move. So, of that 500 figure, there's 250 or so to be generated &#x2013; to be generated there. So when I indicated 100 basis points, so that's if rates moved instantaneously, and that would be the next one year run rate. So at 100 basis points, we recover just about all of the waivers &#x2013; the fee waivers that we're currently waiving.</p>
          <p>In terms of net interest income, the real benefit there is from the lack of compression on some of the low rates, so we'll pay for deposits, for example, fed funds minus 50 basis points, which as you can see, is impossible to do. So they're interest sensitive deposits, but we'll recover that as soon as we do see a move in rates. So that $500 million was the run rate given an immediate 100 basis point move in the overnight central bank rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Howard, the way I'd also say it is, so most of the benefit is in the first 100 basis point rise, of which the first 25 basis points is most important. If we had a rise above 100 basis points, the benefit would probably be half what it would have been for the first 100 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on that, just the sec lending spreads, is that, given how much of, you generate in that, is that somewhat de minimus relative &#x2013;  obviously it's smaller than the money market fee waivers, the NII benefit, but how would you think about that? Is that within that 500 million as well, Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is not. We didn't include the sec lending. It was very simple what we included in that 500 million, and that's net interest income and the fee waivers that we mentioned. The sec lending spreads are really being hit, a little bit of an interest rate move would help, but they're really being hit by a very light TED spread, the difference between the demand for Treasuries and kind of the risk-free rate and the overnight rate. There is really no spread there. And this is as narrow as we've ever seen it historically. That would probably ease if you just saw an overall movement in rates. And it would also change if there was some move back to risk premiums. So you've kind of got the worst combination, no rate &#x2013; no core interest rate and no risk premium in the market right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, makes sense to me. And then final one from me. Capital ratios remain very strong. Bob, could you just give us an update on the M&amp;A landscape, which you've been pretty open about, and any evolution of thinking between doing strategic acquisitions versus dividends and other forms of capital deployment? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, what I would say, Howard, is that we are seeing a little bit of activity on the M&amp;A front. As you know, we look at lot of things, but don't necessarily do them, and, because we have pretty tough financial hurdles. We're, as you know, again, we're a very specialized model &#x2013; asset management and securities servicing, so we'll tend to focus on those spaces, and we'll do it globally. But again, our hurdles are tough and we'll be disciplined. We'll also be very careful of our capital ratios. We don't want to run them down far either. But when I think about our relative priorities, I'm getting the sense from yourselves, from analysts and shareholders that you want us to invest in our businesses so we can grow them over time, particularly right now, given where we are hopefully at more of a secular low in the securities markets, or close to it.</p>
          <p>I don't get the impression that there is going to be a lot of dividend increases in the short-term in the U.S., that might be something that we'll look at in the second half, and frankly, that it would be a higher priority for us versus buying back stock. We would expect, given the quality of our balance sheet now and our core earnings capabilities, that we'll be generating a lot of capital in due course, but that will be &#x2013; those will be issues that we'll be thinking about more in the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck from J.P. Morgan Stanley (sic) [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. From Morgan Stanley, how are you guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Betsy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How are you? Couple of questions. One is on the reinvestment that you announced today. I'm sorry if I missed it, but could you just go through what the total reinvestment dollars are expected to be in this program, and the size and the pace of the benefit and when that comes, the timing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Betsy. We &#x2013; it's not reinvestment, we're -- a restructuring, a bit of a restructuring charge that we took. It was a total of $139 million; 102 of that was related to severance and 37 million of it was related to asset right-offs. There we'll actually, we will commence that, it's probably a little more heavily weighted toward the second half of 2010, and there will be operating expenses associated with that. The operating expenses will basically eat up the initial benefits, and we'll really see it in our 2011 run rate. We expect about &#x2013; when we take these actions &#x2013; about an 18 month period to recover the charge-off. So this is really investing in our 2011, making us more efficient and continuing to grow in our growth centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the investment that you're making today, what kind of dollar return do you anticipate coming from that once it's all baked into your run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you think of it, it's 1.5 times that number. We will recover it in 1.5 years, so it's about &#x2013; well, you can do the arithmetic, which I haven't done over...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IRR is extremely high.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The IRR will be super high, because you're recovering it in 1.5 years, so your run rate is going down by about 75% of it per annum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Betsy, if I could, it's Bob. We see a huge number of opportunities to drive efficiencies in our various processing businesses over the next three to five years. And it's -- part of the theme for our company is a core competency of each one of our businesses that in each one of our executives will be their ability to continually re-engineer their operations to make them not only more efficient, but actually increase the quality of service to our clients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I'm thinking about the operating leverage in the business, obviously the first lever is going to be rising rates, which, depending on when you think that occurs, will start to flow in potentially at the end of 2010. Do you see this as a second wave of operating leverage benefit as you move into 2011, 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so, if you're assuming that the restructuring is going to reduce your expense base in '11 and '12 by about $100 million, that's going to give you another point or two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, just kind of a nit picky question on the tax that was suggested by the President, I think it was last week. I realize that it's early stages and you have to go through Congress and all of that. But I just wanted to make sure I understood what the potential impact would be on you and your business model, given that it's a tax on essentially uninsured deposits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Obviously, we have a perspective on that tax. I'll let Bob talk to that. But in terms of the impact to us, basically the tax is a percentage of assets, and you take out Tier 1, you take out your insurable, FDIC deposits. So, assuming that we do nothing with the rest of our balance sheet, it's probably in the 175, $200 million range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Annually, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It appears it will be tax deductible, although that's not absolutely certain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yeah that's what we've heard as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, Betsy, we've thought about this a lot, and we &#x2013; you just have to conclude it's bad policy for the country. I always worry about the unintended consequences of really material actions, and things that may result from that, and, of course, you always worry about how it would impact jobs. If you can't pass on costs, I know shareholders are going to want the industry to reduce costs, and the most obvious place to do that is against the workforce.</p>
          <p>And also think it impairs the ability for less healthy banks to be able to lend, which, of course, has been one of key stories the banks have been trying to deal with over the last two years. It also really &#x2013; because it's essentially a tax on balance sheet size, it's also going to really encourage the banks to reduce their, the size of their balance sheets, and ultimately, it's going to encourage people to reduce liquidity to reduce the fee. And that's not a very good thing to do in the early phases of a fragile economic recovery.</p>
          <p>And, there're other things too. I worry a lot about it creating an un-level playing field with non-US banks, because it essentially makes U.S. banks competitive (sic) [uncompetitive] in raising foreign deposits. And, we're in a global industry, and if our competitors in Europe don't have to pay the fee, and we're trying to raise deposits in Europe, it's very expensive and we're uncompetitive. Level playing field is extremely important in our industry. And lastly, it actually discourages acquisitions, because I don't know if you've really worked, thought it through, but you end up paying the fee on goodwill and intangibles. So, there's a lot of things that really need to be thought through here that I don't think are good for our industry or for the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's something that if it were to go through, you think that you would manage to try off offset through either other expenses cuts or through passing on to the customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're all trying to &#x2013; it's very early days on this, but obviously, we want to mitigate whatever the cost would be, and I'm sure everyone is thinking about that now, including our foreign competitors.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two quick questions. First of all, Todd, the accretion benefit of 200 million for this year, can you talk about it in two ways? First of all, does it come in fairly ratably over the course of the year? And then, if, just kind of give us an outlook of does that start to tail off as you get into 2011 and beyond?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will stay with us for awhile, Ken. The way we look at this is, we'll look at the performance of the underlying assets, and so we may adjust it based on performance. But we think we've taken a pretty conservative view on it, and I'd look at it as probably as kind of a three year before it starts to tail out completely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, so pretty ratable over three years or so. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would expect it to be pretty ratable over the three-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and my second question is just about &#x2013; well, it's kind of a 1A. Can you just give us a sense &#x2013; Bob made the point earlier that you actually had net securities gains this quarter. With the watch list down, with the markets underlying improving, that helps the unrealized, but can you just give us a broad sense of I guess some type of magnitude of loss content you might see coming through over time in the OTTI site?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We've done a lot of work, and actually, we're very pleased with what we're able to do in this quarter as well. For example, we sold out our complete portfolio of HELOCs, and did that above where we had marked at the end of Q3. We're very pleased with actually the execution in the market. I'd say the market bids are stronger than what we had anticipated, so we've been able to sell the stuff that we thought had a higher probability of impairments. So I think impairments should be relatively small. That's not to say we might see an issue here or there that deteriorates further than we had expected it, but it should be manageable to our earnings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And my last question, just keeping on the credit theme. Obviously, we saw some stability in the NPAs, you mentioned that downgrades were less and the provision did re-set back to that kind of first half level. Any thoughts going forward as far as provision expectations and the movement as, through the credit cycle on credit?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As Todd actually covered in his prepared remarks, we're seeing the run rate in 2010 similar to the fourth quarter. We see some potential for improvement in 2010 from that run rate. But as always, we're subject to a single name event risk on a particular credit.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, which bucket? I'm just looking, and as Ken mentioned, the &#x2013; obviously, the marks have gone up with the improvement in the market. I don't think there has been much migration on the credit front. But I'm curious where the sales came from and if that's right on the credit migration front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Glenn. We've put a table together on page nine of the earnings review.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm looking at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you can see the sales that we made. Some of these we had announced, because we made them pretty close to the end of the third quarter, but there are some additional that we made in the fourth quarter. So you can see we sold &#x2013; if you go to the third column from the right, the proceeds from sales, we sold a fair amount of the floating rate notes. We sold commercial MBSs. We sold Alt-As. We sold subprime. We sold 100% of our home equity HELOCs. So there was 2.6 billion right out of the watch list that we sold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; but that's inclusive of what was previously announced, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is. There were several hundred million additional to that in this quarter, and we've actually sold a little bit more in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we do say &#x2013; I would say it would be a theme that over time here, we're going to look, depending upon prices and opportunities, we're going to look at selling more of the watch list securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this will be a dynamic process. If there is something that we don't like and we think there is a pretty good bid for it, we'll hit it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. So bottom line then, in reading into this answer and last one is of the one point almost 2 billion of unrealized loss, there might be a little bleed in, but you still think that there is a decent liquidity component to the marks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely. We've actually seen, just since yearend, a pretty significant further recovery here, I'd say over $400 million in market value. A lot of that coming, some of that interest rate benefit, but a lot of that coming from the credit product as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just switching gears to one asset management question. The money market outflows and the long-term inflows, just curious if there is any capture in there, meaning money markets trans -- staying within family and switching into some of the longer days, or are those &#x2013; are those reasonably mutually exclusive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's Ron, Glenn. Yeah, for the most part, they're mutually exclusive, because a lot of what you're seeing in the money market funds are really big institutional flows or where we're sub-advising for somebody else. What we are seeing though, interestingly, is the stabilization of the outflows. Most of the quarterly outflows actually occurred in October and early November, and we saw remarkably little at yearend, and I think that's just probably because interest rates are stable, and anyone that was going to move, did move. But for the most part, these are independent, to get to your core question.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I appreciate. And last one is just, if you could, a reminder, Ron, on are the bulk of the assets fourth quarter payable on performance fees, or do you have a certain percentage that's in the first quarter as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, the bulk are fourth quarter payables, so there's some, and as high water marks are achieved, you'll start to see some in '10 and '11, outside the fourth quarter, but even so, it's 80-plus% are fourth quarter payable.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excellent. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Bedell of ISI Group. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, folks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you could, just a follow-up question on the TARP tax, it does seem to unfairly penalize both custodian-related deposits and other processing-related deposits. What do you think the chances are of you effectively fighting that? Supposedly the Treasury is open to consulting with the financial companies, and do you have any sort of read of your success at being able to exclude those types of deposits from the tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brian, I don't really have a sense for it yet. It's all so new that we're trying to work through it, and obviously we'd like to have some influence on that, just because of our business model is so different from traditional banks, but it's just too early to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay, and then just some questions on the seasonality in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about to what degree seasonality influenced the balance sheet size and also revenues in Issuer Services?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, why don't I take the balance sheet side, I wouldn't say there is a whole lot of seasonality, kind of unusual. There wasn't a lot of window dressing or anything that took place. Maybe we saw a little bit of that in the sec lending, but that's not a balance sheet, a balance sheet item. So it looked to be &#x2013; it looked to have limited seasonality to it, if any at all. In terms of Issuer Services, Karen, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing we've seen is less seasonality than historically in Corporate Trust. So we wouldn't expect too much fluctuation quarter-on-quarter in Corporate Trust. But Depositary Receipts, first quarter tends to be not as strong as fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, right. Okay, so a little reversion back in 1Q there, but not so much on Corporate Trust.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. And then just on the fee waivers, we've read about a $0.04 run rate, I think we were around $0.03 last quarter. What was the &#x2013; in which area did you see the incremental impact this quarter versus last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's consistent. It's across the board, Brian, and what it has ended up happening is the, basically the overnight funds rate continued to creep down closer and closer to zero. We kind of thought the target was closer to 25 basis points, and that's when we're at the $0.03, but it's not, it's inside of that. So that's effectively what's driven it down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and so you think you're at a full run rate there now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're going to go negative at this point, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's hope not. And then just lastly on acquisitions, obviously international is a focus, also asset management, what about more asset servicing type businesses in the mutual fund area and within the U.S., are those areas of interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're not implying anything, are you, Brian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I might have an idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's &#x2013; we've stated in the past that we love both spaces, both asset management and asset servicing. We completed two transactions last year in Ron and Jon Little's world, and we're looking at asset servicing. There's been a number of things pop up in Europe over the last year, and I would expect to see more, and clearly that's a space where we can continue to grow, not just organically, but if we can hit the right financials, we'd be interested in acquisitions there. In the U.S. it's a slightly different dynamic in that it would have to be a space where we have a strategic product disadvantage, so that's really all I can say at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any you'd prefer &#x2013; you would prefer to do acquisitions over share buybacks at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Depending upon the financials, because if you can get &#x2013; I know buybacks is an instantaneous return of whatever you want to view as being the return on fair cost of capital, 11 or 12%. If we can find acquisitions that make sense financially in terms of accretion and provide an internal rate of return using conservative assumptions that are materially higher than that, and if it's in our space, we'd probably look seriously at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks so much.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. I wonder if you could comment on the hedge fund administration business and where you guys stand from a market share perspective in the assets under administration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Tom. It's Art Certosimo here. Over the last year, we've been very successful at grabbing market share and moving up from say a year ago, of eighth in the charts, to now fourth. So we expect to continue that, both in the U.S. and in Europe. Most of our market share has been grabbed, has come from the United States, and we feel that over the next probably 18 months, we'll focus both on the U.S. and ion Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Art, does that include some type of prime brokerage capability that you're also marketing to win share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it doesn't, actually. It's really just the pure administration services related to the accounting and valuation. We do partner up with Pershing and their prime brokerage services for some joint solutions to the hedge funds, but the numbers that I mentioned were specifically on hedge fund administration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you starting to see any kind of new hedge fund creation right now, now that things are starting to recover and there's more of a focus on distressed debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we saw that, actually, in early 2008 when it seemed that the hedge funds pretty much at the same time around April or so started opening up distressed debt funds, and we saw a big influx of that type of security. And then around the end of the summer, we started seeing long equities really materialize as the hedge funds thought that U.S. global valuations were starting to recover.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I'd just add that this is a space that we've had tremendous growth in. We're very optimistic about the future of that business. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Hi, Nancy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Quick question on a business that you haven't talked a lot about in a long time, and I heard you mention at this morning, which is the DR business. I think there is a fair amount of confusion, and I admit to being confused, about the ongoing prospects for that business. Could you just talk about it and talk about volumes and pricing and that sort of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Nancy, it's Karen Peetz. DRs did experience a pretty big deflation, if you will, with kind of the issuance and cancellation. You actually make a fair amount of money on cancellations, but of course, that's not a good long-term position to be in. So we're quite thrilled to see that for the last nine months, we've seen net issuance every month for the last nine months, and we're back up to about 1.2 billion DRs outstanding with very good indications in large markets like China, India and Taiwan and DR programs really accelerating. So we're much more positive about DRs having come through a tough year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You know, it is interesting, Nancy, it's an emerging market product, of course, and people always talk about the eventual demise of it. But the fact is it's &#x2013; that's not going to happen. And we've been saying it for decades now, and we still see good prospects in that business, and clearly, we have huge market share around the world in it, and...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it is quite profitable.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from John Stilmar of SunTrust. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you for taking my question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one comes &#x2013; I believe last quarter we talked about, in the Asset Management, the net flows you were seeing clearly the movement away from lower risk product. But you particularly highlighted that flows were still coming out of your alternative asset management function. Can you please update us on where those flows are in the alternative space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, John, it's Ron O'Hanley. The outflows from alternatives have stabilized. So we certainly saw a lot of that as clients really rethought their alternative programs. But we've seen for the most part pretty good performance in our alternatives in 2009. That's not gone unnoticed by clients. So I would say that has stabilized. And that really does reflect into the numbers that you saw for the fourth quarter, because as we've been reporting for most of 2009, we were seeing long-term inflows on the retail side, and outflows on the institutional side. That reversed, well, the institutional part reversed in the fourth quarter. We saw positive long-term flows in both institutional and retail. And what you're seeing I think is a return to the market of institutions, us getting at least if not more than our share, and some pretty sophisticated clients looking at their programs in a holistic way, which means that the inflows ought to be coming to us in pretty sizable chunks as we go through 2010 and 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you. And then shifting gears to a more tactical question on clearing services, as we take a step back, and it seems like you're talking about a pretty robust pipeline, is it fair for us to start to call a bottom in terms of where the servicing fees might be, given that there is probably some fee waivers that are pressuring those? It seems like with alternative asset management starting to show a little bit more robustness, and your presence in the hedge fund community, it seems like clearing services might be an area of potential growth from at least where we are today. Can you give me some sort of -- your sense of where we sit today as of the fourth quarter and what we should be starting to expect for servicing fee waivers or servicing fees in clearing services outside of just the normal fee waiver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Rich Brueckner. The big lumpy item of course is the waivers on the money market funds. So, that won't turn around until we get an interest rate increase. Otherwise, though, I think we have turned the corner, and I think the new business pipeline is an indication of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the trends we're seeing, John, is for our largest financial institutions around the world, they are increasingly looking at ways in which they can add shareholder value, and one of those ways is to outsource middle office and back office processes, including in the clearing business. And we're seeing more banks and financial institutions coming to us on that. And as you know, there is this ongoing migration to more and more financial advisors and registered investment advisors starting their own shops, and that's a space where obviously we can compete very, very effectively to help them be more successful. So, thank you.</p>
