          <p>Good morning.  My name is Tina and I will be your conference facilitator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Incorporated Third Quarter 2009 Earnings Teleconference.  Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer Ann Marie Petach; and General Counsel Robert P. Connolly.  All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.  After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Connolly, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  This is Bob Connolly.  I'm General Counsel of BlackRock.  Before Larry and Ann Marie and Su Wagner, our Chief Operating Officer make their remarks, I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements.  We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements.</p>
          <p>As you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports, which lists some of the factors which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements.  Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Ann Marie, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  As usual I'll be discussing primarily as adjusted results.  Third quarter as adjusted net income was 293 million or $2.10 per share.  This includes $1.86 per share of operating earnings and $0.24 per share of non-operating earnings.  Net income improved 23% compared to second quarter and 28% compared to a year ago.  Note that the third quarter GAAP results included a 45 million deferred tax benefit related to a tax law change.  We've excluded this benefit from our as adjusted results because it is past law related; the as adjusted tax rate was 35%.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we continued to see substantial improvements in equity and fixed income markets, with equity markets up 15% or more since June 30.  These improvements and market tone positively affected long-dated asset close, as investors continued to seek higher returns and reduced cash assets.  While equity markets are still about 10% below year ago levels, assets under management actually reached a new peak at 1.435 trillion at September 30.  These improvements positively affected the revenue, operating income and non-operating income results.  We have maintained cost discipline and continue to benefit from our diversified business model.  Our $42 billion pipeline includes 36 billion in long-dated assets.  Revenues of 1.140 billion improved by 11% compared to the second quarter. The improvement in revenues reflected 14 billion of positive long-dated asset flows and 78 billion in positive market effects on AUM.</p>
          <p>The revenue declined by 13% compared to a year ago, this is despite net new business in long-dated assets of 18 billion and new advisory AUM of 116 billion.  This is explained by the effect of equity and alternative market declines on average AUM.  As to the revenue trend, it is worth pointing out that long-dated assets of 981 billion at September 30 are actually up 6% compared to a year ago and that includes an 11% increase in equity and balanced assets compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions and advisory revenues remained strong at 127 million. This reflects a continued appetite for analytic and Aladdin services to our traditional business, as well as continued advisory assignments.  BRS continues to have a strong pipeline of financial market advisory, Aladdin and rich recording opportunities.  As adjusted operating income of 400 million improved 32% compared to the second quarter and decreased 7% compared to the third quarter of 2008.  The revenue changes I mentioned earlier were a key driver to the operating income results.  The operating margin as adjusted of 40.1% reflects the combination of improved revenues and continued cost discipline.  Excluding hedge changes in deferred comps, compensation changes were driven by changes in incentive comp, that's compared to both periods, and reduced staffing levels as compared to a year ago.  We have continued to increase the bonus accrual to reflect improvements in income.</p>
          <p>Third quarter G&amp;A expense included a three million benefit associated with balance sheet foreign currency effects, whereas prior periods included more material effects.  There was 18 million of expense in the second quarter and a 30 million benefit in the third quarter of 2008.  The absence of these effects in the present period explains a material portion of the period-over-period change in G&amp;A expense.  Excluding these effects G&amp;A expense relative to prior periods reflects strong cost discipline. Just note that the GAAP G&amp;A expense also included 16 million of expense related to BGI integration.</p>
          <p>We expect to close the BGI transaction on December 1.  We continue to estimate total BGI integration costs in the range of 300 to 350 million.  The key cost drivers will include transaction costs, professional fees, restructuring costs, technology synchronization, re-branding and marketing expense.</p>
          <p>As we've discussed before, BlackRock co-invests with our clients.  The majority of these co-investments and seed investments are mark-to-market through the income statement in non-operating income.  As adjusted non-operating income totaled 52 million in the third quarter, this reflects improving spreads on distressed debt, particularly really some mortgage related products and positive movements in the private equity markets.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet exposure remains at levels reduced greatly from a year ago.  The total value of the investment portfolio stands at about 850 million or about 750 million, excluding investments, which represents hedges or those investments which are hedged.</p>
          <p>Third quarter results and business trends reflect strong net new business, robust pipeline, improved markets and cost discipline.  This positive momentum is continuing as we begin the fourth quarter.  The momentum and opportunities for the business should continue and expand as we close the transaction with BGI.  We are very encouraged with opportunities as our businesses come together in the very near term.</p>
          <p>With that I'll turn it over to Larry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ann Marie.  Good morning everyone.  I'd like to just make &#x2013; give a perspective and a review of the markets over the last 12 months as I guess every day there is a new book on comment &#x2013; commenting about the credit crisis and everyone has new and revisionist theories about everything.  Let me give you my perspective. So, as we review our third quarter results we need to reflect on the results in the context of the past 12 months and how we've positioned ourselves for the future.  As the market began falling in the third quarter, collapsing in the fourth quarter and first quarter this year investors worldwide needed to reassess their portfolios and began to mitigate the risk as necessary.</p>
          <p>The result of these actions, we've seen a huge hoarding of cash, which pushed down equity markets, credit spreads and a collapse of confidence as people ran to the doors and put most of their holdings in cash.</p>
          <p>The Federal Reserve's aggressive response, lowering rates to near zero, the Treasury and the FDIC aggressive demands on our banks to raise equity began to stabilize our capital markets and gave confidence to the system whereby people were no longer frightened of Armageddon and started to focus on their own issues and focused on how best they can respond to the market's new realities.</p>
          <p>Beginning in the second quarter, clients would begin to look for opportunities to earn more than zero.  Depending on the institution's needs and risk appetites some investors went as &#x2013; only took risk out to the two year earning 96 basis points, which is certainly better than earning zero.  Many other investors started to look at opportunities in credit, looked at opportunities in emerging markets and other equity markets worldwide. And just beginning now, which I'll talk about shortly we began to see clients starting to refocus on alternatives. And so a whole beginning of re-stabilization happened at the beginning of the second quarter and certainly has now responded in the third quarter, where clients continue to look for investment opportunities.</p>
          <p>More than ever before, they are assessing their risk management and their tools around risk management.  With clients doing this worldwide, markets responded strongly as Ann Marie discussed, significant increase in equity markets and the markets continue to rally.  Obviously from the low points of March 8, the markets are up beyond 50%; much of the market improvement was more related to the dropping that fear of Armageddon and getting re-stabilized.</p>
          <p>And now much of the rally in the most recent few months is a continuation of clients looking to put money to work out from cash into other elongated strategies and also importantly clients are starting to reassess their portfolio mix on a global platform.  Many clients are looking at their dollar weightings in terms of out of dollar assets, they are looking at international opportunities.  So, we're starting to see a much greater vision by our clients in terms of trying to respond to the opportunities in the future.</p>
          <p>I don't want to say we're back to normal, but we're clearly involved in more conversations than ever with our clients in trying to assess their portfolio needs.  In addition clients are reassessing their liabilities, trying to understand best how can they position their portfolios.  So clients are looking to respond to these issues, but importantly because of BlackRock's platform, because our mix of products, because of our mix in geographic opportunities, we are seeing more opportunities with clients than ever before. We're involved with more and more commentary with our clients and trying to have them assess their issues and I'll talk about what this all means as we finish our merger with BGI in a minute.</p>
          <p>Let me just go over some specifics, I'll be somewhat redundant from what Ann Marie has said, but I am particularly proud of our third quarter's results of two-ten on an adjusted basis.  Importantly our operating income is up 32% from the second quarter of $1.86 and also importantly to reflect on with a huge equity down draft from last year, our operating earnings are only down 7% from a year ago and that reflects of the quality of some of the long-dated flows we're seeing and the mix of business that we're beginning &#x2013; we're beginning to see.</p>
          <p>The other thing I think is important to note Ann Marie suggested this, is our operating margins of 40.1.  Our operating margins is a reflection of many things, but I think overall management's presence in terms of making sure we have the right mix of people worldwide and as a result we have been able to withstand the severity of the markets from last year early into this year and so our margins do reflect the attention that management paid in terms of cost containment.</p>
          <p>AUM $1.4 trillion, up 4% in the quarter.  This is the largest amount of assets of any repeating &#x2013; reporting period in our history, another reflection on the robust platform of BlackRock and the globalness of our presence.  In terms of asset flows, in the second quarter it's basically consistent stories with my summary of the last year.  Clients are starting to move out of cash into alternative investments.  We never expected to receive dollar for dollar of outflows out of cash into longer dated flows.  We are pleased with the mix of our business in the &#x2013; in the third quarter.  But I don't want to suggest that we are not trying to stem and stabilize some of the outflows that we are seeing in our liquidity funds.</p>
          <p>Liquidity funds are seeing outflows world &#x2013; industry wide, which I'll talk about.  Much of it has to do with banks offering FDIC insurance rates at returns above zero.  As I said, if you could earn 96 basis points as a bank and if you could attract deposits at 25 basis points or something close to that, a, that's FDIC insured and its more attractive than close to zero for a lot of people.  So, in many cases, we are seeing the outflows most in like &#x2013; in the retail spaces, where clients are aggressively moving into these FDIC products.  I think this is going to continue for a while.  This is an industry issue and I think we're &#x2013; we're going to have that drag for sometime, but we are also having great dialogue with our clients when the opportunity arises in terms of helping them really look at what they're going to do with that cash and in many cases helping them reinvest in some other long-dated items.</p>
          <p>What is &#x2013; what we are particularly attracted to in terms of the third quarter is our continual growth in equities, which I'll discuss in a minute and especially in &#x2013; in our international equity platform in the retail space.  Our pipeline continues to be robust about 42-odd billion dollars and we are very close in winning some very, very large assignments, consistant with this fiduciary type of work we're doing with clients and having these very complete dialogues with our clients.</p>
          <p>In fixed income, we continue to have a very strong active and absolute returns, 18 out of 19 of our products are above the index.  This is digging us out of our hole from last year in terms of our underperformance and we are continue to be pushing ahead in terms of rebuilding what &#x2013; a very strong fixed income platform.</p>
          <p>The other thing that I'm particularly pleased with in our fixed income area, the majority of our hedge funds are near or above their high water marks of last year.  And so if we continue to this rate, we will start beginning to see obviously performance base, performance fees in some of these products.  In some of the products already we are earning performance fees and one of our other large products we're pretty near that point.</p>
          <p>And in the fixed income side, we have in the pipeline about $33 billion of our &#x2013; of our long pipeline is in the fixed income area.  I discussed substantially our liquidity and cash management side. The one thing I would like to highlight despite our &#x2013; despite our flows, our flows are consistent with the industry.  The industry showed about 11% decline in assets and that's where we are.  As I said earlier, our flows have been particularly hampered and harmed because of FDIC insured products, as a competitive product versus money market funds.</p>
          <p>Equities, obviously a lot because of Beta.  Equities are up $61 billion this year &#x2013; this quarter, but also we had $12 billion of net flows.  We've had great performance in our international equities, moderate to little below average in some of our domestic fixed &#x2013; domestic equity products.  Some of the noted products that are doing very well though, our global allocation fund received another $3.4 billion of inflows.  Dennis Stattman and team now manages over $50 billion in the global allocation products.</p>
          <p>Our European equity platform that is continuing to grow and we're continuing to see one of the largest net inflows, mutual fund platforms in European equities is up $1.1 billion.  Our old mining products are up $600 million.  Our U.K. income products are in the top decile, in some cases close to the top centile.  And so our flows continue, month to date in October and our European mutual fund platform we're up $1.2 billion month to date in equity flows.  So, we are seeing a continuation, if not an acceleration in terms of flows into equities because of our global platforms and importantly because of our performance in those global products.</p>
          <p>Probably the biggest change that we witnessed in the latter part of the third quarter is in our alternative space.  Our alternative space saw nothing but outflows from the failures of Lehman Brothers to the underperformance in some of our products of last year, we saw significant outflows.  In our fund of funds product we're having significant out performance this year, overcoming the underperformance of last year.  And we're beginning to see some very large mandates from large scale international clients in our fund of funds of hedged funds.  In the last 4, 5 weeks we've see $1.5 billion of net flows in our fund of funds of hedge funds, some of it is because as I said clients are returning to more risk assets, but importantly a return to very good performance and consistent performance.</p>
          <p>On the real estate side this has continued to be a drag for us. Assets were down about $1.2 billion.  I don't think we're going to see real stability in our commercial real estate multi-family real estate platform until mid next year.  And so this is an area we're committed to.  We believe long-term it's going to be a great business and yet the headwinds remain to be strong.  I think the tonality of the headwinds is probably reduced a little bit.  I also believe the world already knows that the commercial real estate market in the United States is problematic and generally when you know about a problem, the problem generally doesn't occur as severe as the fears are.</p>
          <p>Problems occur when we don't expect the problems to happen and when they happen they happen in a much larger way.  And so the commercial area is something that we are watching or monitoring and we're doing a great job in terms of communicating to our clients about the problems in their portfolios, but our portfolios have performed like the industry, unfortunately poorly.  And but it is an area that we continue to believe in and continue to focus on.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions continues to go from strength to strength, continues to strongly differentiate the BlackRock platinum versus any other asset manager in the world.  Through this platform we're able to provide with our global product mix an integrated multi product approach to clients that interfaces risk management and asset management.  And this truly does allow us to have a more complete dialogue as clients are trying to determine how they are going to manage their balance sheets, their portfolios, their liabilities and how best should they reassess their risk management tools.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter we had 13 new assignments in our platform, we have a very strong pipeline going into the fourth quarter.  I should just put a cautionary note on our BlackRock Solutions business: BlackRock Solutions is going to be the technology product provider for BlackRock in our merger with BGI.  This is obviously the largest money management merger and so they have their arms full, on top of all these new assignments with clients they certainly have a big job ahead of us in terms of making sure we have that robust one BlackRock technology platform.</p>
          <p>Let me just touch on two other things real briefly.  Our Financial Institutions Group continues to see large opportunities; we are seeing huge, huge opportunities in terms of fiduciary outsourcing with insurance companies in the United States and overseas. And we continue to believe this will be a big area for us in the future.  In U.S. institutional we still see institutions moving from fixed income into equities and so we have some of those headwinds in the U.S. space as clients are starting to assess their risk and are looking to take on more risk.</p>
          <p>I should cite that if our pension funds are going to achieve their necessary results to have assets equivalent or greater than their liabilities they are going to have to have a higher component of equities and probably even a higher component of international equity to achieve the returns that's necessary and/or if they don't do that they are going to have to just go back to their clients and lower their payment streams which to-date I have not seen any pension plan do that or any state fund do that.  As I suggested in our retail space this continues to go from strengths, it's even a stronger position, U.S. long-dated flows about $2.4 billion in the quarter that was offset as I said earlier by some of the outflows that we've seen in the liquidity business.  Our international and retail business grew by $8.7 billion year-to-date flows, and so it continues to go from strength, the performance is there.</p>
          <p>Our brand recognition outside of the United States continues just to really help us in terms of our business flows.  So, overall I would say in a marketplace that extreme &#x2013; exhibited extreme volatility from extreme depression to sometimes euphoria in the third quarter, we are &#x2013; we have faired very well.  Probably the most important characteristic that I would like to just cite we performed very well in working with our clients on top of this largest merger integration in the history of the asset management business.</p>
          <p>As Ann Marie said we are closing on December 1 a little ahead of plan as we were unsure about how quickly we could get through the regulatory reviews and how quickly we could go through our proxy solicitation process.  I should say we are not done with these processes yet; we still have much to do to accomplish this, but at this moment we are very confident that we can close on December 1.</p>
          <p>I spoke to you twice publicly related to the opportunities related to the integration of BGI and BlackRock.  We see as much opportunity if not more opportunity today than we did before. We are very excited about the integration of our all new partners.  The BGI team is full of great intellect, great enthusiasm and a great respect for their clients.  This is why we believe the cultural fit with BlackRock is so &#x2013; is going to be so good.  The opportunities together are large, we are seeing more smiles today than frowns with both employees because this represents change.  The opportunities we have going to clients discussing Beta opportunities alongside Alpha opportunities with an overlay of risk management is tremendous.</p>
          <p>Earlier this week &#x2013; excuse me, late last week I'm trying to think what date today is.  Late last week I had the head of one of the largest endowments in our office yesterday and they asked us to make a proposal to them in how can we overlay more Beta strategies for this endowment.  And this is the type of dialogue that we're going to be able to have through the integration of our &#x2013; the index business of BGI and the very strong position of iShares in terms of offering products to our clients that can solve solutions, can add risk in a very quick, in a very short way through ETS, I should should say add risk in a very transparent and a very low cost way.  And so we are beginning these types of dialogues. The enthusiasm we have with our business leaders institutionally in retail of the dialogues of bringing Beta products and Alpha products is really gratifying.  We're just now beginning to have those conversations with our institutions.</p>
          <p>As I said repeatedly over the last ten years as a public company, it is very important as we do these integrations, as we grow globally, as we expand our footprint, as we expand products, the one essential characteristic to this firm is that we have a one BlackRock platform, one technology platform with one overlying tech &#x2013; culture worldwide.  We are on our way to doing this, but I don't want to say we are complete on this.  This is a two-year process, very similar to what it took us to do in the MLIM transaction.</p>
          <p>It took us two years and we accomplished a lot.  But &#x2013; so, I don't want to just say this is done yet, because it's far from done. It's going to take a lot of work, a lot of energy from a lot of people, bringing everyone together. The one thing that we did announce between quarters that we went</p>
          <p>public on, originally we said we were going to change the overall name to BlackRock Global Investors.  After a survey with employees at BGI and BlackRock, after a survey with consultants and clients we heard back from everyone that the branded name should remain BlackRock for the overall company and that's what it will be; and then two, obviously we will retain in the ETS space the iShares brand which has a very unique position in the ETS space.  And so we are going to be have &#x2013; we're going to have two strong branded names, the iShares platform and the BlackRock platform.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, as I said, we just finished up our ten-year anniversary as being a public firm.  I do believe the model of being public is a great model for investment managements firms.  We have shown over the last ten years that we can manage ourselves on a quarter-to-quarter basis, on a year-by-year basis, and now over a decade we do believe the business is going to change as evidence of another merger announced last night.  We think scale becomes more important than ever before.  Clients are looking for a more complete relationship.  Clients are looking for a larger product mix.  Clients are going to be demanding a higher level of fiduciary responsibility.  Clients are going to be demanding for more transparency.  And I believe scale being public are the &#x2013; is a way in which we can achieve those &#x2013; that connectivity with our clients.</p>
          <p>I would like to just offer a real large thanks to all the employees at BlackRock, at BGI.  I know mergers are not fun.  They are stressful.  They take a lot of time.  But on top of all that time and stress we've been very resilient in working with our clients and the behavior on both sides in terms of the merger has been very positive and the outlook is a very strong one for the combined firm on December 1.</p>
          <p>Thank you, everyone.  Why don't I open it up for questions,</p>

          <p>Thanks very much.  My first question really is on the RFPs that you are talking about and you said it's a much more robust business.  Should we think about that happening right now in the third quarter and fourth quarter or does that really &#x2013; does the activity really start &#x2013; the discussions really start today and then the transfers of the money kind of really accelerate in 2010?</p>

          <p>Hi, Roger.  It's a great question.  I mean the RFP pipeline represents switches and opportunities that are in process across an entire spectrum.  So, we &#x2013; I guess I would say is we will sum that on average a probably between one and two quarters lag from the time that something enters the pipeline to the time that a decision is made.  But there is really &#x2013; that's really an average with sort of fat tails.  We don't really have data that tells us if that's something you can rely on.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would also say Roger when you're working with clients on like fiduciary outsourcing, that's multi products, the RFP process could be six months.  It is a very long process in which working with the management team, sometimes their outside boards, and so it really depends on the type of client in this RFP process.</p>

          <p>What they are transitioning from. The other thing I will say though is that the pipeline that we report on AUM, those are completed.  So, those are actually wins that have either funded or are yet to fund and the turnover in that part of the pipeline is probably &#x2013; there is probably less than a quarter of that that extends beyond one quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, okay.  And then when I look at sort of the retail flow data that's going on these days, there is a lot of money going into the fixed income world and particularly it looks like it's global and then shorter-term money.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now is there a difference between what the institutional investors are doing right now sort of compared to the retail or should we think about that the same way?  And then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said earlier institutional investors in the U.S. are moving out of fixed income into equities as they've started to re-look and so we saw some rebalancing out of fixed into equities. We won some of that, did not win some. But we have seen that and I think we are going to continue to see that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you've seen flows as you suggested into retail and that continues and I would just say our U.S. retail fixed income funds were not as robust in terms of our presence in the marketplace as some of our competitors and this is something I discussed about a year ago, we are putting a huge effort in it, we are putting a huge effort at it. We are beginning to see more and more flows on our retail side, but clearly I would say we did not get the flows that some other firms have gotten because our presence in fixed income mutual funds were not as strong as some of our peers and we did not emphasize it as much up until about a year ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then is it fair to say that the flows that are going into the short-term bond funds would be more of a cash type of product where or temporary product and not necessarily a sustainable <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are talking about retail.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think some of it is just holding pens, yeah. I can't tell you, it may be very sustainable.  We're seeing overall even though clients are adding more risk, I think retail institutions worldwide have a higher degree of desire of having a larger component of their portfolio in some form of liquid assets.  So, I think if you had to cite the biggest lesson that was learned in the credit crisis was an under appreciation of having liquidity.  And so overall I think there is going to be a larger component of investors continuing to be in some type of short fixed income product as a basis for liquidity.</p>

          <p>Okay.  No, that's fair.  And then you're saying it's very important to sort of stay in front of the clients and work with them to meet their needs, how do you do that on the retail side of the business?</p>

As I said, we've added net new &#x2013; net new wholesalers this year and consultants.  We are trying to continue to build our presence with our distribution partners.</p>
          <p>We're having more and more seminars.  We are just trying to spend more time with our distribution partners and trying to educate them on the world and products.  I'm personally spending more time as is Rob Kapito in terms of giving speeches at seminars for large pools of FAs, I think I have one again tomorrow or Thursday where we're going to meet hundreds of people to try to just get the BlackRock name out, and our products.</p>

          <p>Great, and then just the last question.  When you talked about the two years it's going to take to sort of put one platform together, is that &#x2013; is there any change from the time you sort of announced the deal or <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I said it's &#x2013; two years is going to be the &#x2013; we're going to have a lot of this done in the first six months and some of that harder ones could take another 12 months.  But I would say very similar to the BGI transaction in the first six months after closing a high percentage of the businesses will be integrated onto one common platform and then it's just the other areas that could linger on and take more time as we develop it.  So, I would say we're &#x2013; it feels very similar to the path that we did with BG &#x2013; with MLIM.  So, this is not a negative statement at all.  It's &#x2013; we're really right online in terms of much of the integration processes that we expected when we announced the transaction.</p>

          <p>Hi, Bill.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Good morning.  Thank you everyone.  I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about free cash flow.  I know you had sort of addressed it at the initial time of the acquisition with BGI, but now you are a little bit further along.  How you are thinking about that as you get into the completion of the transaction?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  As you know Bill, this is a very positive cash flow generating business.  So, we would expect as we get into a combined firm that we are going to be generating very strong operating cash flows.  As we described as part of the transaction, part of our objective in the first year is going to be pay down about a billion, billion plus of short-term debt.  And then we will leave the long-term debt structure we talked about earlier in place.  But, clearly there is going to be many opportunities that we'll have to consider including how to appropriately have shareholders participating in really success with the firm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the cash flow generation out a year, Ann Marie it will be what, as much as a billion and a half a year.  It could be large.  And so obviously that's a year out, we have lot to do between now and then, but there is no question right now we need to work on, Ann Marie said it close to two.  Right now, we need to focus on the integration and getting it done, how we address cash and cash flow out a year, Bill that's probably a conversation we could have maybe in June of next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And the second question I have is just a little more tactical.  Looking at your comp this quarter you mentioned that you sort of increased bonus accruals a bit. It's running about 38% of revenue, a little bit on the higher end of where you've been on that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ratio.  How should we think that both on a exante or existing business, base of business and then sort of on a combined basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; on a combined basis I can't &#x2013; I don't know if I'm ready to talk about that.  We believe there is a great competition right now for top flight people in the business.  Obviously Wall Street is in some cases experiencing some record profits in their trading division, especially in fixed income and derivatives.  And, so we just need to be aware that there is a rapid change in comp.  The investment and management industry is facing obviously more headwinds than most industries because our trailing 12 months because of the asset declines in third and fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, it's started &#x2013; we started I would say in a deep hole.</p>
          <p>And we're building ourselves out of that and our key thing is our employees. That's what everyone says; we needed to be very mindful and the Board and our Compensation Committee spent a great deal of time recently in our Board meetings of making sure that we're going to &#x2013; we adequately reward for performance where performance is being delivered. So I would say if we continue to drive strong results in the fourth quarter, my instincts would be we're going to have a high level of comp ratios in the fourth quarter.  But that does not give &#x2013; that does not mean &#x2013; that should not give you any indication pro forma of the new company.</p>

          <p>Hello, Mike.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Thanks.  One other question on just what you're seeing from clients.  When you look on the institutional side and maybe look at non-U.S. versus U.S., based on what happened over the last 18 months what are you seeing from like an allocation standpoint and when had the discussions worried about kind of the capital structure and leverage still in the U.S. versus trying to obtain the long-term goals of what they need to return on the assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, one: we're still seeing clients investing in dollar based assets.  Obviously, we've had a weakness in the dollar recently.  We're not to the lows that we had &#x2013; what we saw in I guess '08 &#x2013; early '08.  But we're still continuing to see flows in dollar based assets from our clients.  We're seeing I would say pretty aggressive investments from sovereign wealth funds recently in terms of investing.  So, it really depends on the clients. And we still see some clients who are still very bruised and have severe losses because of credit problems and/or excessive equity positions.  And so they are still trying to reassess how they want to go forward.  I don't think there is one pattern and that's good.</p>
          <p>What we are seeing from clients continuously they are asking us to work with them on their liabilities.  They are asking us to give them our macro views on different products.  And so we are, depending on the circumstances around the clients, we're seeing some clients becoming more aggressive.  And I think that's indicative of some of the huge flows we saw in our fund of funds business in the last six weeks.  And yet we continue to see clients who remain to be repositioning themselves to have better liquidity.  Some the endowments in the U.S today are still reeling with too large of commitments in some of their private equity and other types of illiquid products and are wishing still to have more liquidity.  So, it really depends on the individual client circumstances as to what the trend in terms of where they're going be positioned and where we see our growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess when you look at your -- the institutional flows into the equity products, alternatives in the fixed income.  Do you think that your &#x2013; what you're seeing at BlackRock is a pretty good barometer or &#x2013; ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The long-term. Okay it is okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually think because of our scale now I should say, I didn't say this now.  But if you just &#x2013; I'm not going to give anyone an absolute number because a lot of this is information I can't provide.  But one should assume now just because of Beta, the combined firm on December 1 will be at least $3 trillion.  And so, we see huge flows.  We have a lot of inquiry. And so, I think what we're going to see in the future is somewhat reflective of global flows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just maybe two for Ann Marie.  In terms of the integrated, once you have BlackRock BGI together, will we see any financials before the fourth quarter report meaning once it closes on December 1?  And then I guess the second is just on the compensation was there any true up for say the first and second quarter of being at a lower run rate this quarter and so maybe it's a little bit elevated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, what are &#x2013; first of all with respect to the when are you going to see some pro forma combined financials, I can't give you an exact date on that. But I think in an ideal case we would like to have something available in the December timeframe there and that's what our objective would be. We'll have to see if we meet that objective, but we want to meet that objective for a number of reasons including to be able to approach the long-term debt market.  With respect to the compensation, I mean I think it is fair to think that when we think about our bonus accruals, we do think about that bonus accrual rate as well as the absolute results of the company and during distressed periods we allowed our accrual rate to come down and during improving period we're allowing it to come back up to a sort of more normalized level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I guess I wanted to ask you first on management fees.  It looks like it was pretty much flat quarter to quarter 2Q to 3Q, I guess just given the dynamics with equity flows having been stronger and obviously the equity market performance why that wouldn't have on a blended basis migrated upwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, management fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just repeat it again because I missed the beginning of your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure.  So, and maybe we're just calculating wrong &#x2013; we got investment &#x2013; investment advisory base fees a percent of AUM was about 29.5 basis points in the third quarter, it was 29.3 in the second quarter.  We thought that would have increased just given the dynamic of equities outperforming fixed income in terms of both close and end-market performance, I'm just curious why that didn't move higher?  Is there any kind of sort of product mix issue we need to think about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there is really not a product mix issue that you need to worry about.  So, I can talk to you more about that offline, but I have really looked at the fee rates and I mean it really probably has to do with more of the calculation of average AUM than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think some of the wins have been indexed products too in the equity, so a combination of index, but I think as Ann Marie suggested Roger it's &#x2013; it is when we took the wins and had the wins, so a lot of it is timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>What's &#x2013; is that just a more of a sort of macro sort of Beta play or is it because of fee sensitivity?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This big endowment is probably going to use fewer and fewer active managers and they are going to sit down and have &#x2013; and do much more Beta plays. Obviously if you are more correct in the Beta and you have total liquidity now in Beta plays and your transaction costs are so small now through ETFs, I think you are going to see more institutions and endowments who are going to be looking at Beta as a mechanism for performance.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it, and actually speaking of endowments, can you remind us how your institutional business is weighted pensions versus endowments because it seems like you mentioned...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't have that in front of me, but I am sure Ann Marie can give that to you offline, I mean we have that in a big book, but I &#x2013; it would take me a few minutes to dig that up.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but it sounds like I mean pensions are clearly the better opportunity from an alternative standpoint than endowments right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Okay. And then I wanted to just ask a question, a more generic question around flows and sort of your positioning. If you kind of look at your bond flows excluding I think the one large client outflow, your net inflows were up about 1.8% in the quarter, right.  If you looked at mutual fund data it's up 7%.  I think it sounds like the differential is more institutional focus and maybe some under performance on retail funds.</p>

          <p>In the U.S. retail mutual fund.  And we're spending a lot of time in building that and...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But &#x2013; yeah.  But I guess then if you kind of look at equities too there as you point out, you outperformed 3.7% of the industry and mutual fund flows is up 0.7%.  I mean that outperformance is a bit less than the under performance on the fixed income side.  I guess I'm just wondering, if you kind of look at flows right now and your institutional versus retail focus, fixed income versus equities.  It feels like you're a little sub-optimally positioned given where flows are going right now. Is that an unfair characterization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On retail, I think that has been a fact with the flows &#x2013; huge flows in mutual funds in fixed income.  I think in &#x2013; but in Europe, we're clearly one of the true leaders there in the mutual fund flows as evidenced by just had inflows of another 1.1 billion in October.  Most of that is &#x2013; about 700 million of that is in equities and 400 is fixed  So, we are still seeing some large flows, but I would say to you our bond flows are starting to pick up over the last three months as &#x2013; historically we saw very little in terms of bond mutual fund flows and I cited this many times as an area that we needed to focus and it takes a couple years.  We will benefit though on December 1 when we have the iShares platform with their superior position in bond ETF flows.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, hey Larry.  Question for you on the liquidity business and all of the cash sort of on the sidelines from institutions, where do you think we are in the process of institutions reallocating away from cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think -- I've told Washington repeatedly because they've asked me these types of questions and I said repeatedly that if we can have at best a stable equity market going into the first quarter next year we're going to see more and more allocation to more risk based assets.  So, I don't know where we are, we're probably &#x2013; I still believe, as I said earlier people will appreciate to have a greater component of liquidity.  So, I don't think you are going to see a total outflow of liquidity.</p>
          <p>But I think you could continue to see some large flows into longer dated assets and into more risky assets next year. And if we could go into this year with a stable equity market, and obviously if it continues to rally then we'll just &#x2013; maybe some of that money is going to be going into it this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the retail side clearly you are seeing people migrate out of money market funds, because of the fees into FDIC insured products because of the guarantee and the banks, because of the yield curve are able to offer some return on their demand deposits or savings accounts and so that's going to be a threat to the money market business for some time.  And when and if the Federal Reserve starts raising rates that's when you'll start &#x2013; in my mind start seeing more flows back into money market funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and then just in terms of institutions looking for Beta to leverage themselves to either tact &#x2013; I guess tactically to higher markets, where you are seeing more search for Alpha, is it in active international equities, I guess alternatives is a part of it, but could you just comment maybe on where you're seeing the most demand for active equity management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely most of it is in non-U.S. equities.  As I said a global allocation fund, our European equities, sector funds like where our strength in oil and gas and mining funds.  I think if you just look at the different sectors you're seeing, you're seeing more and more flows, and so it's consistent with the, I guess with the indexes worldwide.  Our Latin America fund continues to grow, obviously that's a big area of ETF growth.</p>
          <p>And, so clearly as I said earlier, if U.S. pension plans are going to properly meet their liabilities and if you think the U.S. economy is only going to grow 2%-ish for the next few years, which would then probably slowly put a feeling on how much U.S. equities will grow over a considerable period of time, to get those types of returns on the assets is going to require a far larger allocation to non-U.S. It just has to, because global growth will be greater than the U.S. and so this is one thing how we are positioning ourself to try to really build our platforms in non-dollar based equities.  And, so we think that's where the trends will be certainly into next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then just on the fiduciary outsourcing mandates, can you give us a sense of what the fees are like on those types of mandates and then how the growth of that business has tracked recently and maybe what you're seeing in terms of insurance companies outsourcing general accounts and how that could play into growth in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends on the complexities of the assets and the requirement of the client's business.  It could be as low as six basis points and as probably as large as 18 basis points and then on some specialties could be 40 basis points on some of those very unusual products.  So, they generally are very large scale, you know large blocks of assets.  They generally are traditionally lower fees than our average fees, but because they're, in many cases such a concentrated amount of business with one client, the margins of that &#x2013; of those businesses despite the low fees remain to be very strong.</p>
          <p>And so we do look at it to a &#x2013; in terms of &#x2013; as a contribution.  So the fees are looked on, but we are still trying to remain the same type of contribution margins.  So it is really dependent on how many people do we need to allocate to a client.  I mean it's one large outsourcing; we have tens of people working on this one as we prepare for closing.  This is one of the large assignments that's in the pipeline with tens and tens of people working on it, as we get prepared for the closing of that. And it's multi product and the fees do range depending on the complexity of the product, but overall the fees are larger.</p>
          <p>As I said we are very close in winning another very large fiduciary outsourcing and the fees are in that range too.  And on top of that we've had dialogues with institutions who are seeking to outsource large components of their balance sheet that are &#x2013; that require us a little special intention.  And, so we are mindful of our fees, we are mindful of our margins but in some cases fiduciary outsourcing business in terms of average asset fees could lower them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one question on the margins, obviously it's been a unique period here but as you move forward at what point do you start reinvesting, become more aggressive to spend to bring assets in the door, et cetera?  Just trying to see if there is going to be some permanent efficiencies gained here and how you think of margins going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's very interesting because as we go through a time right now, as a just BlackRock historic I would say this is the high side of where we would be on margins but we do want to continue to reinvest in the business.  We are now going to be bringing two firms together and I think traditionally the &#x2013; what we've seen in the historic results that the index business may have an opportunity to have a higher return than the asset business.</p>
          <p>So I really think that's something we'll get into more next year but I would say very clearly is we're going to balance appropriately balancing investing in the business to continue to have revenue growth with margins. We're not only about optimizing margins by any means till this business does have the opportunity to have a very healthy margin on a continued basis.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Craig.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey Larry, good morning everyone.  First I am just wondering if you can talk about the conversations you've been holding with clients over the last three months especially ones that may feel they're over allocated to the combined BlackRock BGI managers and I am wondering if passive is part or a big part of that mix, is that really less of a risk of an outflow there because they are mainly focused on active management risk and does any of this in your mind represent a level of risk or flows over the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we &#x2013; when we announced the transaction Craig we did assume a large block of assets will be at risk when we announced the transaction.  I think as I said in our last quarterly update that we were surprised at the response of the clients in terms of having a dialog with us.  Clients are &#x2013; we are still at risk with the number of clients. But overall clients are beginning to see the positive nature of scale, they are also looking at passive as you suggested a little different than active and they are raising questions with us, with their consultants, with their investment committees should they separate the passive component with the active component because they are very different.</p>
          <p>Obviously having even passive and active though with any client, they do have risks with the enterprise BlackRock and so one of the strengths of our firm and the scale and being public and I think our fiduciary reputation, our market cap does give our clients more and more comfort.  So I would say overall the dialogs have been very positive, I would say from our views of potential outflows due to scale with our clients I believe we're going to see less outflows today than we originally budgeted at the time of the transaction.  But I don't want to suggest that we're not at risk with some clients, because we certainly are.</p>
          <p>But overall, the dialogues are good and in some cases we had couple of dialogues with clients who were too concerned with our scaling it.  They have offered &#x2013; they have given us more business after the dialogue.  And so it really depends on the client, on the nature of a client, the risks that they associate with us and so I don't think there is any one way of measuring it.  But I would say clearly the dialogues have been more positive than we ever dreamed that they could have been at the time we announced the transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  And then second question I'm just wondering if you can kind of remind us what the derivative exposure is to the Peter Cooper Village, Stuy Town investment from the real estate business on the balance sheet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really as far as the balance sheet we really as of last year took that down to really nothing.  So, we don't have balance sheet exposure to that particular investment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Most of my big picture questions have been asked and answered.  So, I just have a technical tax question, what do you think the tax rate will be going forward particularly if your non-U.S. business is growing and following the BGI deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well are you asking that question &#x2013; I wouldn't tell you anything different with respect to this year.  And I think as far as conversation as next year goes I'd rather talk more fulsomely about that later, because there would be some effect to our tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also have to wait and see where the Obama administration is in terms of what ultimately happens in terms of taxation of foreign revenues.  I think there is a lot of uncertainty as to what our overall tax rate will be.  Clearly one can say if we have more and more non U.S. clients and we're doing that business more and more outside the United States either in London or Hong Kong or Tokyo, one can presume that our overall tax rate should be lower; that's just a function of tax rates in the various jurisdictions, but it really depends on how we repatriate some of that money and then we pay the U.S. tax, and it's a function of the business mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just I mean to be clear the other thing I would mention is there will be what I'll call tax noise associated with the actual closing of the transaction.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think like just say an average over the last three or four years excluding the tax benefit this quarter is just a good starting point or should we be thinking something like just a marginal tax rate in the U.S?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say is the BGI business certainly does have a very meaningful U.S. component that's important.  And so...</p>
