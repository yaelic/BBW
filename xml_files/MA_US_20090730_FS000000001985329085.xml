          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2009 MasterCard Earnings Conference Call. My name is Francine and I will be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Barbara Gasper, head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Francine. Good morning to everyone, and thank you for joining us today, either by phone or webcast, for a discussion about our second quarter 2009 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Bob Selander, Chief Executive Officer; Martina Hund-Mejean, our Chief Financial Officer; and Melissa Ballenger, our corporate Controller. Following comments by Bob and Martina, highlighting some key points about the quarter, we will open up the call for your questions.</p>
          <p>This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The earnings release and the slide deck have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of the call will be posted on our website for one week, until August 7.</p>
          <p>Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release, as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.</p>
          <p>With that, I will now turn the call over to Bob Selander. Bob?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start out by saying that I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter financial performance. We saw net revenue growth of 2.7% on an as-reported basis, and on a constant currency basis, net revenue growth was 7%. We have continued to follow an aggressive and thoughtful approach to cost management, with total operating expenses declining 13% this quarter, excluding the impact of last year's litigation settlement. And we've delivered a 10.2 percentage-point operating margin improvement over the same quarter last year. I'm equally pleased that net income grew 26.4% on the same, adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Though we have been cutting back where we can, we continue to prioritize our resources in support of the best opportunities, making sure we appropriately invest for the future. We continue to see the economic downturn affect consumer and business spending. Our volumes during the quarter were impacted by significant headwinds versus last year, such as an appreciating U.S. dollar, lower gas prices, and slower cross-border travel. As evidenced by our processed transaction growth of almost 8%, we are benefiting from the secular shift of cash and check to electronic payments. Our business model and global diversification continue to provide a good degree of resilience in this environment.</p>
          <p>Turning first to the regulatory and legislative front, we are working closely with our customers, policy makers, regulators, and government bodies around the globe to proactively address the issues in local markets. As most of the questions we have gotten from you have been around what's happening on Capital Hill, let me focus on interchange-related legislation in the U.S.</p>
          <p>While legislation has been introduced, there's been no movement on that legislation in either the House or Senate, as it is in its earliest stages. We saw during the last Congress that this legislation is controversial, and its proponents face significant political and policy challenges in moving it through both chambers, and rightfully so.</p>
          <p>One of the key points that frequently gets lost in this debate is the extraordinary value merchants receive when they accept payment cards. In addition to the increased revenues that come from card acceptance, our network enables merchants to make sales on credit while shifting all of the credit risk to the financial institutions that issue our cards. This point is driven home by the recent escalation of bank charge-off rates, which now range from 7 to 12% of outstanding balances. More to the point however, the sheer magnitude of this single benefit is clear when you consider that the average consumer credit charge-off rate as a percentage of point-of-sale transaction volume is multiples higher than the average consumer credit interchange rate in our system.</p>
          <p>For example, looking back to 2008, the average interchange rate for MasterCard consumer credit cards was about 1.85%, while credit losses from point-of sale transactions, according to information that we gathered, were in excess of 4%, a staggering differential. In fact, over the past three years, point-of-sale related credit losses have doubled while average interchange rates have been virtually flat. Again, each and every one of these transactions where a credit loss occurred was a sale for the retailer.</p>
          <p>One of the most troubling aspects of the legislation and one of the reasons it is so controversial is that the result would be that merchants, by no longer paying their fair share of the benefits they received, would shift these costs to consumers. U.S. consumers would lose, just like consumers in Australia did when the Reserve Bank of Australia arbitrarily lowered interchange rates there. Australian consumers now pay more for payments cards and receive fewer benefits, with no evidence of lower retail prices to consumers.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our thoughts on the economy and the current business trends we're seeing, our assumptions remain unchanged, and we don't expect the economic slowdown across the world will improve until sometime next year. The most recent unemployment figures for both Europe and the U.S. are at 9.5%, and economists expect unemployment to rise for the foreseeable future. Consumer confidence remains at a low level, probably held down from concerns around unemployment.</p>
          <p>We are looking for further stabilization of the U.S. housing sector as one leading indicator that helps consumers feel comfortable about increasing their spending. And there are some encouraging signs. This week, the Commerce Department released statistics that showed new U.S. home sales rose more than expected in June, helped by a 17% year-over-year fall in housing prices. The Conference Board's Index of Leading Economic Indicators gained 0.7% in June, exceeding economists' forecast. This is the third straight month of increases, suggesting the recession could be drawing to a close.</p>
          <p>Turning to the latest MasterCard SpendingPulse data for the U.S. retail sector in June, the results are fairly consistent with May, indicating generally stable conditions and point to a more stable environment for the second half of this year. The high-ticket consumer durable sector, such as luxury retailers and department stores, are still showing year-over-year sales declines in the 10 to 20% range. However, retail sales, excluding autos and gas, fell in June versus the prior year by 2.3%, which is similar to what we've seen in prior months.</p>
          <p>When we look at our MasterCard processed volumes and transactions through the first four weeks of July, we saw the following: Our cross-border volumes continue to stabilize across most regions. While still slightly negative on a worldwide basis, the rate of decline slowed from the 2.1% decline we saw for the second quarter, primarily due to Americans traveling aboard. In Europe, we saw a continued moderation in growth, but it remained positive. U.S. processed volume saw a lower rate of decline through the first four weeks of July relative to what we saw in the second quarter, which also signals potential signs of stabilization. Processed volumes for the rest of the world are still growing in line with second quarter. Processed transactions continue to grow in the 8% range, similar to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on page three of the deck, where we're focus on the non-GAAP columns, which exclude all special items.</p>
          <p>As Bob mentioned, we are very pleased to have delivered another solid quarter in spite of continuing headwinds. Second quarter net revenues grew 2.7%, to 1.3 billion, over the comparable period last year. Adjusting for the headwinds from exchange fluctuations of the euro and the Brazilian real against the dollar, net revenue grew 7% for the quarter on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by pricing changes of approximately 8 percentage points, an increase in the number of processed transactions by 7.9%, and lower rebates and incentives of 5.8%. These positive factors were somewhat offset by the impact of lower gross dollar volumes in the quarter.</p>
          <p>We have continued to effectively manage operating expenses, which decreased 13% for the quarter. Foreign exchange contributed 3.2 percentage points to the decline.</p>
          <p>Our operating income was 558 million for the quarter. While the economic slowdown across the global economy continues to impact our top-line growth, we're generating strong results from our cost containment initiatives, and achieved a quarterly operating margin of 43.6%. This represents a 10.2 percentage point improvement over last year's second quarter.</p>
          <p>MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35% in the second quarter of 2009, pretty much on par with the year-ago quarter. During the second quarter of 2009, we delivered net income of 349 million, or $2.67 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>Turning to page four, during the second quarter, the global diversification of our business continued to help us weather the cyclical downturn in the U.S., where the year-over-year decline in the number of our business drivers is most evident. Our business continued to generate healthy transactions and volumes on a local currency basis from economies outside of the United States, and the secular shift from cash to electronic payment forms continues to provide significant growth opportunities, as we see strong growth in worldwide processed transactions.</p>
          <p>Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was slightly down, at 0.6%, on a local currency basis in the second quarter, and declined 9.3% on a U.S.-dollar converted basis, to 595 billion. The deceleration in the overall local currency growth rate can be attributed to the U.S. The GDV growth declined 9.7%, due to a double-digit decline in credit volume growth. Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow by 6.8% on a local currency basis, albeit at a much slower pace than what we have seen either last year or last quarter. Translated into U.S. dollars, the 6.8% growth becomes a 9% decline due to the strength of the dollar against most other currencies during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Worldwide debit GDV grew 11.1% for the quarter on a local currency basis. This compares to about 19% growth in the second quarter of last year, and is somewhat higher than the first quarter of this year. In the U.S., debit GDV grew at 4.1%. Debit growth for the rest of the world was almost 22%, primarily driven by several countries in the APMEA region.</p>
          <p>On a local currency basis, worldwide purchase volume was also slightly down, at 0.7%. Similar to the GDV trend, U.S. purchase volume declined 8.8% for the quarter, driven by a decline in credit volumes. The decline in gas prices on a year-over-year basis accounted for approximately a third of the decline in U.S. purchased volume.</p>
          <p>Cross-border volumes declined 2.1% on a local currency basis, or approximately 14% on a U.S. dollar converted basis in the second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to Americans spending less on purchases abroad and decreased travel to and from Mexico. We continue to see more Europeans traveling within Europe, and fewer crossing the Atlantic to the United States. Globally, cross-border transactions continue to grow in the high single-digits for the quarter on both a year-over-year and a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>When we looked at processed transaction in the second quarter, they increased 7.9% compared with the year-ago quarter, to 5.6 billion. In APMEA and the Latin American and Caribbean regions, processed transactions grew at double-digit rates, but all other regions grew at mid-to high single-digit rates on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. The number of MasterCard-branded cards worldwide grew 1.2%, to 959 million, in the quarter, and excluding the U.S., the rest of the world card issuance grew 10%. The majority of this growth was principally driven by issuance of MasterCard debit and prepaid cards. As of June 30, 2009, there were approximately 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to page five. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue grew 2.7% on an as-reported basis, and on a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7% for the second quarter. Domestic assessments decreased 2.2% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of converting local currency volumes to the strengthening functional currencies which are used to calculate revenues.</p>
          <p>Let's talk about an example: The euro strengthening against the pound sterling in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Therefore, when we convert the pound sterling volumes to the euro equivalence to bill our customers, this results in lower revenue than it would have a year ago. This pound sterling/euro relationship is not considered in our constant currency calculation of net revenue, which only adjusts for the euro and the Brazilian real translation effect versus the U.S. dollar. This was evidenced by GDV growth being slightly down on a local currency basis, but declining 9.3% on a U.S.-dollar basis compared to the prior year's period. New pricing introduced in Europe in October 2008 partially offset the decrease.</p>
          <p>Cross-border volume fees decreased by 9.4% versus Q2 '08. While cross-border volumes decreased 2.1% on a local currency basis, they declined approximately 14% on a U.S. dollar basis. Increased European pricing partially offset the decrease.</p>
          <p>Transaction processing fees increased 14.6% compared to the prior period, due to an increased number of processed transactions and pricing introduced in April in the U.S. On a constant currency basis, the growth for this revenue line item was 19.7%, with approximately half of the growth due to new pricing, and the other half from underlying processed transaction growth and increases in services such as <mark type="inaudible" />. Other revenues decreased 1.6% on an as-reported basis, but grew 2% on a constant currency basis. Rebates and incentive payments decreased 5.8%, largely due to lower volumes which had a tempering effect on the performance of our customer business agreements. As a reminder, our rebates and incentives can vary from quarter to quarter as we sign new or renewed agreements.</p>
          <p>Just a quick comment on pricing: Of the overall 8 percentage point contribution from pricing this quarter, roughly one-third of it came from European pricing that we repealed effective July 1 as a result of our interim agreement with the European Commission. Therefore, we expect the impact from pricing to moderate over the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>Now we'll turn to page six for some detail on expenses. As part of our commitment to deliver a lower expense structure this year, we have continued to implement a number of expense management measures. Excluding special items, total operating expenses decreased 13% during the second quarter. Currency fluctuations of 3.2 percentage points contributed to the decline. Without the impact of severance in both this quarter and the year-ago quarter, total operating expenses declined 18%. The decrease was mainly driven by the following: General and administrative expenses decreased 2.9%, with currency fluctuations essentially accounting for the full amount of the decline. But let's look at the categories within G&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Professional fees declined by approximately 34%, or $19 million during the quarter, due to a significant reduction consulting expense and legal cost. Travel expenses decreased approximately 62%, or $18 million, on a year-over-year basis, as a result of continuing cost reduction initiatives. And personnel costs for the quarter increased 8.2% due to the $51 million severance charge. This charge reflects a $0.25 impact on our reported diluted EPS. Excluding severance charges, personnel costs declined 3.3%. We will continue to monitor our business performance and may need to consider additional actions.</p>
          <p>Advertising and marketing spend decreased by 35.8% versus the year-ago period, as we scaled back our spend in several categories in response to current market conditions and in keeping with our overall cost containment efforts. Approximately 3.3 percentage points of the decline related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.</p>
          <p>Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on page seven. We generated 362 million in cash from operations, and ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and current investment of 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we agreed to prepay the remainder of our obligation under the June 2003 settlement agreement in the merchant case action lawsuit. The company will make a prepayment at a discounted amount of 335 million on September 30 of this year, subject to court approval and finalization of the agreement. Until that time, we continue to classify this obligation in both current and non-current liability. We believe this settlement is an effective use of our cash and offers good returns, and allows us to put the remaining financial piece of this legacy litigation behind us. While it depends on the timing of the court's approval, we expect this event to have a positive 7 to $0.08 impact on our EPS in the second half of this year, split roughly equally between the third and the fourth quarters.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call back to Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to page eight, the economic slowdown around the world continues to prove challenging for consumers, our customers, and for us. We see no reason to change our view that the global economy will not begin to improve until 2010.</p>
          <p>As mentioned on last quarter's call, this year we expect to fall below our minimum average annual net revenue growth objective of 12% on a constant currency basis. We've continued our heightened focus on managing expenses, and as a result, we now expect them to be down on a year-over-year basis, including the impact of all severance charges, which are largely behind us for those actions we've already identified.</p>
          <p>With respect to our advertising and marketing spending, we continue to expect full-year 2009 to be lower than full-year 2008, on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. However I caution you about using recent spend levels as a run-rate for the balance of this year, as our current forecast calls for significantly higher spending in the second half of 2009 than the approximate 300 million we've recorded in the first half. To date, we've scaled back our core marketing activities in response to current market conditions, and we are keeping a close watch to ensure that we're maintaining brand performance, particularly in high growth and emerging markets.</p>
          <p>Our views around net income have not changed since our Investor Meeting in mid-May. In order to achieve at least 20% net income growth for 2009, we would need to see revenue growth of low single-digits on a constant currency basis, given our expectations for total operating expenses and excluding any impact of severance charges.</p>
          <p>The last six months have presented challenges for many businesses, including ours, but as you can see from our performance, we are very focused on achieving solid bottom-line results this year.</p>
          <p>Looking out over the longer term, let me comment on our three-year performance objectives for 2009 through 2011. At our Investor Meeting in May, we pointed out that we'd identified risks around our revenue performance objective. As we continue to work through our planning process, we currently think it is unlikely that we will be able to make up this year's revenue growth shortfall over the next two years in order to achieve average net revenue growth of 12 to 15% for the 2009 to 2011 period.</p>
          <p>We have not changed our view that the continued secular movement globally towards electronic payments and the resilience of our business model will allow us to deliver better top-line growth than what we will see in the near term, given the current economic environment. We continue to expect 3 to 5 percentage points of annual operating margin improvement, and 20 to 30% average net income growth over the 2009 to 2011 period.</p>
          <p>As I've said many times before, we will always evaluate whether to make further adjustments to our expense structure, keeping in mind our intention to invest wisely to protect future growth opportunities. So while our top line is affected by the global economic climate, we remain committed to our performance objectives over the longer term and do not intend to jeopardize them in order to deliver short-term results.</p>
          <p>Now before taking your questions, let me spend a couple of minutes on some business highlights. A look first at debit. As of June 30, 2009, we had nearly 900 million debit MasterCard and Maestro cards issued globally. As you know, we offer a world class debit solution that leverages our global Maestro PIN offering and our debit MasterCard signature and PIN product. While we have a strong global platform, we recognize that debit is inherently a local business. As a result, we are focused on driving growth with country-specific solutions.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., we signed an agreement with Bank of the West that extends our debit relationship, and we also strengthened our relationship with First Hawaiian Bank with a multi-year debit expansion. In Europe, we continue to execute on agreements. In Finland, the conversion of local debit cards to debit MasterCard is underway. Debit MasterCard is also being introduced in Poland, with the first cards in the market being launched by Alior, and in Portugal, the Millennium Bank migration continues, and new debit deals have been signed with Caixa Geral de Dep&#xF3;sitos and Banco Santander Totta. Additionally, we've begun to open the French and Italian tollway system to all Maestro cards, and are beginning to see more cross-border transactions as a result.</p>
          <p>While looking at the 17 countries that represent our opportunity around SEPA, our progress continues. Our processing of domestic transactions in these countries grew by approximately 30% versus the same quarter last year, with single digit growth in the number of Maestro cards issued over the same period.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, we launched the Banamex -- I'm sorry, we launched with Banamex the first Platinum debit MasterCard targeting the affluent segment in Mexico. Here the focus is to drive usage from the ATM to the point of sale.</p>
          <p>Beyond debit, we continue to work with our customers and partners to deliver payments innovations. For example, Barclaycard in the U.S. has moved the rest of the US Airways Dividend Miles credit card accounts to MasterCard World and World Elite-branded cards.</p>
          <p>Our MoneySend platform is available in 17 countries, including the U.S., Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, India, and the Philippines. The platform encompasses both person-to-person, or P2P, payments such as social payments and global remittances. In May, we launched our first P2P mobile payment service in the U.S., called Mobile MoneySend, with our partner Obopay. Through this service, consumers can send and receive funds via text message, mobile web browser, or an Internet connection using a PC. Users have the option of utilizing a MasterCard prepaid card issued by the Bancorp Bank for use in ATMs and at physical points of sale. We really see the mobile application as being viral in nature, allowing consumers who sign up for the service to send money from one mobile phone to any of their friends and families' mobile phones or MasterCard accounts.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call back over to Barbara so we can begin taking your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob.</p>
          <p>We're now ready to begin the question-and-answer period, and as usual, in order to get to as many people as possible in our allotted timeframe, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question with one follow-up, and then queue back in for additional questions.</p>
          <p>Francine, can we please start the Q&amp;A?</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA [Calyon Securities].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. My first question is surrounding your willingness to acquire local merchant acquiring, quite possibly in the SEPA territory, to facilitate much of that conversion and to possibly get better economics on those transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Craig, let me try and just interpret your question a bit. Are we willing to begin to directly acquire from merchants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, to clarify, what I mean is, should the opportunity to purchase something like Carte Bancaire show up &#x2013; I'm not asking for direct guidance on possible acquisitions, but is that something that you've possibly planned for, should opportunities present themselves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, as you know, we have generally drawn pretty bright lines with regards to competing with our customers in terms of issuing or acquiring. We feel we've had enough space to operate in, in terms of our areas of the value chain.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we are looking at all times at opportunities to expand our presence, and we've shared with you in the past that we currently only process roughly about four out of 10 transactions that are done with our brands around the world. And the ones that we don't process are generally those domestic transactions that are handled by either bank-formed consortiums, or other domestic processing entities. So you can see in the past, where we've been involved with, for example, acquisitions in Brazil, deals in the UK, the acquisition of Europay France a year ago, to better position ourselves to compete in those domestic markets. We will continue to look at opportunities like that, whether it's in Europe or other parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one follow-up, if you could just clarify, was there any impact in the rebates and incentives line from the Washington Mutual de-conversion, or loss of that contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this point in time, we have not seen any impact from the loss of that contract, Craig. That comes a little later in the year, and really next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is there any &#x2013; can you provide any guidance on the offset that that might have toward &#x2013; versus increasing rebates or incentives, or just the overall impact that have on the line?</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Martina, I realize that pricing growth decelerates in the second half of the year. Can you talk about the long-term pricing environment? Do you still feel comfortable with 200 basis points, or 2 percentage points, of revenue growth from pricing over the long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Andrew, I mean, we've been saying this now for quite a few quarters. I mean obviously, given the economic environment and what our customers are going through, you always have to look at that very critically and to make judgment, what you can or cannot do. But at this point in time, we still feel reasonably comfortable with that at least 200 basis points on a per-year basis. But it is very much tied to what kind of value proportion we would offer our customers and acquirers around the world.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And as a quick follow-up for Bob. You make a compelling argument on interchange. From your point of view, given how close you are, how well do you think legislators understand the nuance of what is a less explicit argument, than maybe late fees on credit cards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that would vary from literally one office &#x2013; legislator's office to another and one country to another. Just focusing here on the U.S., there has been a heightened degree of industry focus on educating, whether it's the staffers or people in Congress and the various regulators, on the reason behind, and the way that interchange operates. I've corresponded with Senator Durbin. MasterCard's put together a white paper on this subject.</p>
          <p>I think it's a positive that, as a result of some of the recent regulation that was done with regards to &#x2013; particular to the issuer practices, that there's a GAO study that will be undertaken. Because I think that's going to throw some light, and at least create a common framework of understanding, and I hope, as a result of that, we'll see people more fluent with the reality of all the positive things and benefits that flow from the four-party system and the interchange on which that depends.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I wonder if you could just provide a little more detail on your thoughts about advertising and marketing spending? I mean, the decline in the first half was, as you said, huge, and I'm just wondering what will change in the second half, what kinds of things you're spending money on, and what &#x2013; realistically, what kind of year-over-year decline should we expect? I mean there's obviously not 36%, but 10, 15?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a couple of observations. My comment was, please don't use the run-rate of the first half, which was about 300 million, because our current expectations are to spend significantly more than that in the second half.</p>
          <p>We traditionally do spend more, as you probably know, in the third and fourth quarters than we do in the first and second. So that's part of the seasonality in our business, where we see heightened volumes of activity in the fourth quarter, even when the economy is not as robust as we might like it to be.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; from a comparison standpoint, in the second quarter, you need to also recall that the second quarter of last year included heightened spending around the Euro 2008 football soccer championships that were being played in Europe, which tended to increase last year's second quarter a little bit.</p>
          <p>The other thing is, there are a couple of variables that we don't fully control, some of which we benefit from, so that media rates, for example, in most of the developed economies around the world are lower. So to get the same bang for your spending, you obviously don't have to spend as much. I would caution you, though, that there are some markets where those rates are up. Russia, Brazil, and a few others, there continues be higher media rates than we've seen in the past. We put all those things together, and that's why we suggest you don't use that first half run-rate. It'll be significantly higher in the second half.</p>
          <p>We also obviously are hoping that we'll see improvements in the economy, and those are opportunities for us to begin to spend, to drive usage and to partner with our customers as they begin to look a little bit more forward in various markets around the world.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and maybe a follow-up. Yesterday Visa talked about having signed a number of new contracts that tied up business for several years. I just wondered if that has any  implications for you, or if you're in a similar situation. You had &#x2013; obviously you didn't have any signings this quarter, big ones. But is that a challenge, in terms of trying to gain profitable business, or is it a reflection of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> Every day it's a street fight. But I must tell you that we are signing business. I'm sure they are signing business. From the standpoint of the marketplace, there are a lot of other competitors other than the one you mentioned, whether it's in the processing space or other areas, advisory services, et cetera. So on probably any given day, somewhere in the world, there's some deal that we are signing. And to your point, it may not be the biggest deal ever signed, but as you accumulate those over time, and those are multi-year deals, that secures an increasing proportion of our business as we look forward, and I think that that proportion is as high as it has been over the last year or two, and I believe the last time looked at it, it was nearly three-quarters of our business was subject to multi-year agreements.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Nice work on the expenses. I wanted to ask a couple quick ones. The &#x2013; just wanted to make sure, are there any other large contract decisions that are still outstanding? I just want to make sure that everything was contemplated in the net income guidance for the next couple years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there are lots of large contracts that are outstanding at any point in time, Tien-Tsin. I at this point we can't predict what future mergers or other consolidations might take place. As you know, when those things happen, you tend to get jump balls earlier than you might have otherwise in terms of a renegotiation or reopening of agreements. But from my perspective, there are several that will be coming up over the next year. We're working hard on those. What I can't predict is the sort of unpredictable events that could precipitate others. Early, if you looked back 18 months ago, I don't think we would have expected some of the things we've seen happen. You wouldn't have expected probably Lloyds/HBOS to get together in the UK, you wouldn't have expected Wachovia to be part of Wells Fargo, you can go on and on around the world. So, in this environment, you just need to be flexible and adaptable, and you need to be serving your customers well, so that if you do come up to a point where the contract is opened earlier than you might have anticipated, they're happy to continue to do business with you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess, just to clarify, actually, Bob, just in &#x2013; related to sort of the known client consolidations, have those major decisions been made? I think you mentioned a couple, obviously.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To the best of my knowledge, they have been, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Terrific. That's great news. The &#x2013;  a couple more &#x2013; I'm going to cheat and ask one additional. Severance? I heard, Bob, you say that you were close to the end, and also I think, Martina, you mentioned that you may need to take additional actions. So what do you need to see in order to take such actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tien-Tsin, I mean obviously, for the actions that we identified for this year, we took marginally all of the severance charges, so on those actions, we have some outstanding implementation, et cetera, which will happen over the rest of the year. But we have pretty much largely recognized the charges related to that in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>In terms of the future, I do believe it really depends on what the business environment will bring. I think we're very focused on what the top-line brings. I think we're very focused in terms of what we need to do in the business and the investments that we need to do. So I don't think we will ever say we're not going to do any actions ever. I think this is as normal. You have to be keyed into the current environment, and you have to make sure that you're nimble enough and flexible enough in order to course-correct on the expense line if need be. So that's why we made that comment.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on U.S. credit a little bit. It was &#x2013; it got a little bit worse this quarter, year-over-year trend, and specifically on credit into July. I'm not sure that &#x2013; if I missed the comments on the trends on U.S. credit, if you see that starting to &#x2013; any signs of any improvement on &#x2013; in that line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well for the quarter, U.S. credit on the purchase volume was down in the mid-teens, 15, 16%. I don't have, and I'm not sure, Martina, if you have, a breakdown of the spending levels through the first four weeks of July, but we continue to see aggregate MasterCard volumes at around the same level that we saw coming out of the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I was hoping &#x2013; you gave a little more color on the movement in SEPA. I don't know if you can quantify a little bit, or try to put any &#x2013; I mean, you mentioned that transactions processed were up 30%. Just hoping you could give a little more color on the opportunity that you see, now we've been moving through this for a couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the point I made was, I believe it was domestic transactions were up 30%, because as you probably will recall, there are a lot of domestic brands, and frequently &#x2013;  let's use Maestro as the example &#x2013; Maestro will be on the card in addition to a domestic brand. And as a result, when it's used in the country, which it is 96, 97, whatever percent of the time, we would not necessarily process that transaction. As our customers move to a Maestro-only branded card, or as we begin to position ourselves to be able to process transactions domestically, we'll beginning to see an increase in the numbers of those domestic transactions.</p>
          <p>I did mention that globally, out of 100 transactions done with our cards, we're still only processing about 40 out of those 100. But that reflects the fact that we process virtually all the transactions in the UK, U.S., Brazil, Canada, and I think also Australia, which means that, at least in the rest of the SEPA zone, we're processing significantly less than the 40%. So that continues to be a significant opportunity for us, and we continue to work hard on trying to find ways to provide our customers with everything that they've got today, plus the cross-border and other benefits that Maestro brings.</p>

          <p>Great. First of all, in terms of the commentary on the longer-term guidance, just to &#x2013; can you rehash the 12 to 15% comment in terms of longer-term revenue growth, and what &#x2013; I think I &#x2013; just, can you just rehash? So I'm just trying to understand &#x2013; make sure I understand what the direction of the numbers would be. It sounds like, on a reported basis, you're not expecting the numbers to be in that 12 to 15% range longer term. Is that correct?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>&#x2013; currently talking about, maybe low-single digit revenue growth for the year. And what we wanted to do, and what I'd tried to do, was just to connect the dots, if it hadn't already happened, to make it clear that, assuming we come out in the low-single digit area in 2009, we don't currently see a way to make up in 2010 and 2011, in order to get to that 12 to 15% average for the three-year, '09, '10, '11, period.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Julio, let me just jump in. All of our guidance was at constant currency, so whatever the currency does would have been on top of it or on the bottom of it, depending which way it goes. So currency is not an issue here in this. It's just, when we look at our trajectory for 2009 ,and we haven't really put out a rate for 2009, but when we look at the trajectory, when we add to what you could possibly get, even in a fantastic environment in 2010 and 2011, you can just do the averages yourself, it would be very, very hard to get into that 12 to 15% bucket.</p>
          <p>But, having said, that we did look very much at what could happen from a bottom-line perspective, and we feel absolutely comfortable that our bottom-line performance objective that we have out there, both for operating margin, as well as for the net income growth, are appropriate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Great. And just to go back to &#x2013; just thinking about longer-term expectations, is it feasible to think at this point, with the CARD Act and constraint to the credit system, that the U.S. credit volumes at this point are probably flat, maybe even sustained down for the next 12 months or so? Or can you actually see a scenario where credit card payment volumes would actually be positive at all in 2010?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We're still working our way through a variety of scenarios for next year, with regards to what happens with U.S. credit volumes. I guess, just off the top of my head, I would say to you, I think it's going to be hard to see growth even in a recovering economy. The best forecast I've seen for the U.S. next year is 2% growth. I think that was the IMF, a few weeks ago, put that number out. I would at this point not want to bet on any improvement to that level of growth in credit card spending.</p>

          <p>Thanks, and good morning, guys. So regarding the three-year target, I totally agree. I don't think there's any surprise here, that that 12 to 15% is obviously going to be a stretch. It's just how the math works. In terms of the right corridor, though, understanding that it's impossible to really see out a full two and a half years beyond where we are now, just order of magnitude-wise, I mean, should we think of this as more like, I don't know, 8, 9, 10% as sort of a reasonable kind of range?

          <p>Well let me &#x2013; Jason, at this point in time, we really have not put our budget together for next year and for the following year. I mean, as we've said, from a longer-term perspective, we definitely believe that the ranges that we put out in the past are the right ZIP code, but for the next two years, you're going to have to give us a little bit more time. We're only halfway into 2009. There a lot of &#x2013; lots of things happening in the economy. We don't really know whether we're coming to an end in the recession and what might be happening next year.

          <p>Understood. Just switching gears. Bob, wanted to pick up on some of the comments you made regarding the status of the whole interchange debate, and wanted to just get your views on how important do you think that the pending GAO study that was mandated, how important will that be, in terms of determining the future of the U.S. interchange system and kind of shaping the debate there? Understanding that obviously the political environment that we're in now is very different than when previous GAO studies were done?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm cautiously optimistic that that GAO study will shed light on the issue where there's currently darkness, and I think the combination of that, plus ongoing education of individuals, will be very beneficial. But that's the challenge that the industry faces, and we have to make sure that that happens. I just wanted to point that out. That's the thing we get a lot of questions about, which is why I opened the call, or at least my section of the call, with those comments.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One of the things I noticed was your &#x2013;  the card &#x2013; U.S. card area saw a decline in cards, versus some of the other product areas as well as regions, and I was wondering, is there any way to quantify how much of a volume loss was related to that? Or was it negligible?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's pretty hard to do that. A lot of our customers are, for want of a better description, cleaning up their files as they work their way through a very challenging credit environment. And inactive accounts, for example, obviously to the degree there are charge-offs or high levels of delinquency, which virtually all issuers have accounts are being closed as a result of those activities as well.</p>
          <p>So you are accurate. We saw a little over a 10%, I believe it was, decrease in the number of MasterCard accounts at the end of this quarter versus the same period a year ago, while outside of the U.S., we continue to see positive growth of about 10% going the other direction.</p>

          <p>Okay. And maybe just one follow-up, on capital management. Obviously there were some actions taken this quarter, and you guys still have a fair amount of cash on hand. I mean, are there any opportunities for a share repurchase or any other types of capital management activities? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our position is very similar to where we were in the last quarter. We think at this time, having a strong balance sheet and a good cash position gives us a level of flexibility that we may want to have for various opportunities that come along. Clearly, the one that Martina highlighted, which you're familiar with, which is our early repayment, or prepayment, of the legacy merchant litigation outstanding, that will have a positive impact, assuming we do get the court approval going forward in this year. We think that's a good use of the cash. There may be other opportunities that come along.</p>
          <p>So for the time being, I think our attitude is, we're keeping the powder dry. When we feel like we're in a period where it's unlikely we have any possible use, or we feel a lot more comfortable about the environment and the degree of flexibility that we need to maintain, then we'll obviously take a look at things like share buyback.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Just wondering, on the severance, I guess how many positions were eliminated in the second quarter, and what kind of &#x2013; what magnitude of savings can we expect in personnel in the back half from these actions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Chris, so for the 51 million of severance, about 130 positions were &#x2013;  or are being eliminated. When you take the first quarter and the second quarter severance numbers together, that's about 70 million, and when we look at when positions are eliminated, some of which are latter part of this year, some are actually early part of next year, you're going to get a payback of roughly just shy of two years, and the annualized savings for &#x2013; we look at this as one program. The annualized savings for this &#x2013; for these kind of actions are roughly in the $40 million range, going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's helpful, I guess. And then, as a follow-up, or I guess switching gears, during the Analyst Day, I think Chris McWilton made the comment about the significant debit business potentially out for bid in the U.S. this year. Have your views changed on that at all, given &#x2013;  or is Visa's &#x2013; has Visa's strong customer signing in the second half, did that preclude any of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think Chris's observation at that point in time was a reflection of what was going on with the consolidations, as well as some deals coming up. Those deals that have come up are continued to be worked on. As a result of the consolidations, we'll see the degree to which there are deals that come up as a result of that.</p>
          <p>As you can imagine, banks that are managing through consolidations have a lot of priorities. They've been &#x2013; gotten another set of systems and operations challenges for their credit card business as a result of the regulatory environment and new standards and expectations that they'll have to meet early next year. So at this juncture, I guess I would say it's &#x2013; there's probably less significant business op than what we had seen back earlier in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Good morning. One clarification first. You mentioned that  sequential improvement in cross-border revenues, the volumes were flattish, I think it's negative 14 including currency, but the revenues improved a little bit., I think you mentioned European pricing. Is that different from the European pricing that's rolling off July 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have &#x2013; in all of the line items that we have for revenues, there is &#x2013;  well, in almost all of them there's actually European pricing in there. Also in the cross-border. But what we actually said is that the cross-border volume fees decreased by 9.4%, and when you look at the cross-border volume decline, on a U.S. dollar basis, it's probably the most &#x2013; the best number that you can use to compare to that 9.4% is 14%, and the differential is pretty much made up by the pricing that we have back in &#x2013; that we put back in October of 2008 in Europe, and most of that will be repealed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so &#x2013;  but the sequential change from first quarter to second quarter, where you went negative 14, produced negative 11% cross-border revenue growth last quarter, now it's negative 9. That incremental pick-up was not Europe, it sounds like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013;  that's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Any comment on cross-border trends in July? Any &#x2013; do you have any insight there? I know Bob already tried on volume in general, but just cross-border -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, as Bob said on cross-border, we actually saw a lower decline than what we saw in the second quarter. So it's stabilizing more, Chris.</p>

          <p>Operator &#x2013;  Francine, I think this is going to have to be our last question.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Bruce Harting of Barclays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bob, understand what you say about the averaging of the 12 to 15% revenue growth, but is that still the guidance on a stand-alone &#x2013; for 2010-2011 standalone? 12 to 15%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well yeah, we've tried not to &#x2013; as you know, Bruce &#x2013; talk about annual or individual year guidance. So when we get a better view of the longer-term perspective and we converge on it, having gone through the planning cycle, as Martina mentioned, then we'd be in a position to start to talk about what we see happening on 2010-2011.</p>
          <p>If you could confirm for me we're going to have 5% or better global economic growth and happy confident consumers, then we'll probably start stepping up to those things sooner. But until we start to see something, it's hard for us to make that call, and rather than make a call that we have to change the next month or the next quarter, we're just going to wait and see how this data and the economy and consumers unfold.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, it seems like your stock is closing the gap somewhat today, but in terms of one of the things we've noticed, or what we hear from investors, is concern over your debit share. But it would appear as though your strength overseas is very strong, and maybe understated by not having that Maestro data. Question would be, any progress on showing that data on a real-time basis, or my understanding is, there might be one or two countries that don't get that data aggregated, but it seems that the outlook for next year would be pretty straightforward, that, as you've all said, that going into this downturn, average ticket might decrease, and people will just pull out their cards more, and that's evident in the transaction volume growth you've put up, which is great. And in fact, by just my math, debit transaction growth, 14% year-over-year, credit transaction growth only 3%.</p>
          <p>But the other thing is, it seems like transaction processing revenues have continued to grow nicely, to the point now they're 85%, as big as assessment revenues. So, it just seems like next year, you'll be on all cylinders, even if &#x2013; even without a big increase in global consumer spending, because you'll continue to drive transaction processing fees higher, as you did this year, and then the currency effect on assessments will hopefully make that cylinder run as well.</p>
          <p>I mean, is &#x2013;  a) is &#x2013; the first question, is there &#x2013;  what's wrong with that view of how things will all sort of pull in, kick together next year? And second, just any comment on that Maestro data that might help us make the case more convincingly for your strength overseas?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bruce, without making any further comments on what we might be seeing for next year or for 2011, I think your observations, in terms of our debit businesses, are totally right. We have a terrific debit business around the world, especially outside of the United States, but also in the United States, so we feel very comfortable about it.</p>
          <p>We have been taking your input, as well as others' input, in terms of figuring out how we might be able to take better business driver data, i.e., Maestro data, out there, which would allow you to probably gauge our progress on our international debit business a little bit better. It's still work in progress. I'm not going to make any promises when we will be able to put it out, but let me tell you, we're working on it hard, because we do believe that that would be a very good data point for our investors.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me just in summary say, we're very pleased with the strong second quarter performance, particularly in light of the challenging economic environment. We remain focused on those things within our control as a way to mitigate those that we can't. It is the actions we've taken to realign our resources that allowed us to deliver an operating margin of 43.6% and an adjusted net income growth of 26.4% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our focus remains on ensuring that MasterCard is well positioned for long-term growth. We will continue to invest in the future so that we are solidly positioned once the economic tide begins to turn. We operate a global, flexible, and resilient business that will continue to benefit from the ongoing shift toward electronic payments, which consumers, businesses, and governments find more efficient, secure, and easier to manage.</p>
          <p>Let me assure you that we remain committed delivering long-term value for our shareholders, and thank you all for joining us on this morning's call.</p>
