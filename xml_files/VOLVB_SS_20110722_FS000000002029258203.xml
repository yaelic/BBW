          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Volvo Q2 Report 2011. Speakers today are Leif Johansson, CEO and the Volvo Group.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to Leif Johansson. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good good morning, and good afternoon to all of you, and welcome to this Volvo second quarter 2011 conference call. I have in the room here, aside from our IR people, we have our incoming CEO, Olof Persson; we have Mikael Bratt, our CFO; and we have business area leaders, and we will take you through a number of slides that you can get on our web page. And I will, beginning with Slide 2, with the one that says Group Highlights.</p>
          <p>We had a very decent quarter, the operating income amounted to SEK 7.6 billion and sales were just close to SEK 80 billion, operating margin at 9.2% and a cash flow of SEK 5.2 billion. If you look at business environment, Europe, we have put altogether here, has improved and what's happening here is that Northern Europe and Central Europe, notably Germany perhaps, is doing reasonably well even though they are still between 10% and 20% below where the peak was in Q2, 2008.</p>
          <p>Then Southern Europe is doing very &#x2013; it's very weak of &#x2013; you can say it's still two-thirds down compared to their peaks. But at least we can say they are probably from these very low levels, probably now slowly improving with more of an emphasis on slowly than on improving. But then we have Greater Europe, you can say Poland, Russia, Turkey and Eastern Europe, that seems to be coming on quite nicely. And altogether then that provides for a improved total characterization of the European market.</p>
          <p>In Asia and in China I think we have said a number of quarters there will probably be good if there was a slight pause in the hectic growth that we've had in China. We think that's what's happening now; we see no reason to think that the market in China will be less important for us, or as a market, as we move forward, but that there is a plateauing in the Chinese market. And I think Pat Olney will speak more to that vis-&#xE0;-vis Construction Equipment especially.</p>
          <p>In Japan, we are obviously in the quarter we have had significant impact with about SEK 300 million in operating result effect on Construction Equipment, and SEK 100 on the truck side, SEK 400 altogether. Most of that seems now to be behind us, and we are looking at Japan as a country with recovery from Q2 levels, but also with a slightly higher expectation of demand as Japan comes in to a buildup phase after the earthquake events in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In India, you can see a reduction in growth rates, but still solid growth there. In many ways you can say South America is the same here.  We'll look a little more into some detail in Brazil here, but South America remains a strong market for us.</p>
          <p>Interestingly to note, you can see that North America now is coming up, if you look at order intake, quite well, the more long-haulage and the more industrial production the better, the more construction or even home construction, the worse the market, but still, as you will see in the presentation, North America is now bouncing back quite nicely.</p>
          <p>If you look at Slide 3, the one that says Volvo Group there you see us clucking in &#x2013; clocking in sales then that where 15% higher in sales between Q2 '10 and Q2 '11, that actually translates into 29% if you clear that for foreign exchange changes so 29%, real growth there.</p>
          <p>And if you look at it in operating income there traveling at a speed closer to 10% than to 9%.</p>
          <p>If you look at the pie chart, you can see that if the whole of the Group grew by 29%, it's almost stable between on the one half North America and Western Europe and on the other hand, <mark type="ph" /> you see (5:05) Europe, South America, Asia and Other markets, which means that we are actually in a situation where the whole world grows reasonably equally, and quite well. And of course in the case of North America and Western Europe off of very, very low levels. But a good geographic footprint there as we see it.</p>
          <p>Interesting to note also you see that we have noted here on the plus side increased sales of new products. You remember that we took a fairly heavy investment in R&amp;D for future products during the crisis. That seems to be paying off quite nicely now as we have introduced a number of new product, both on the Truck side and also on the Construction Equipment side, efficient, more productive, but also in some cases architecturally from a Group point of view better product. And they seem to be doing well in the marketplace, and with that we have an overall impression that we are gaining share in the different world markets, and across the different business areas, where we are operating.</p>
          <p>And obviously, the operating income benefits from that increased volume both in terms of new product and from the market demand in itself. We have 100,000 people plus who have contributed to good improved productivity, with the number of people coming in for assembly lines much lower than the actual production output. And we have said as before that we are focused on making sure that the cost decreases that we announced and made during the crisis would be held on to, and we think we can tick that off and say that's been done.</p>
          <p>With that, let me hand over to our CFO, Mikael Bratt and Slide 4, the one that says Cash Conversion Cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. I'm happy to report here that we have managed to shave off one more day from our cash conversion cycle. I would say despite some inventory build up, as you have seen in our &#x2013; mentioned in our report. The work, of course, continue here, and we should get below the 20 days within some timeframe here. So the goal remains here as we move forward.</p>
          <p>Moving on down to Page 5 and the net financial position. We have during the quarter seen a change in the net financial position, with a negative SEK 1 billion coming from <mark type="ph" /> positive (7:46) cash flow, but also that we actually have paid out a dividend to the shareholders here of SEK 5.1 billion in the quarter, and some currency headwinds here. I would say that also in the quarter here we had "an extra payment day" here as our payment cycle ended up in connection with the end of June here. So we got some negative effects from that also. But I would say that this of course repaired by itself over time here, but that of course impacted in the quarter of course. So we have <mark type="ph" /> cycled (8:28) back then above the fourth tier, which is a temporary thing. So we should get back below the fourth again within short here. And as you can see it's, of course, not a straight line here, but we are moving in the right direction overall.</p>
          <p>Going forward then to Page 6, here we have the currency details for you here. I will not dwell on this. You have seen it before, but I think you could summarize the currency impact in just two sentences here.</p>
          <p>First of all, it is really related to our flows in the quarter. You see the spot rate here stands for 1.7 out of &#x2013; of the total here. We have also seen very limited impact between Q1 and Q2. So sequentially it has been stable. And as we mentioned before also here, VC is taking about 50% of the effect here, and I would say in absolute demand I would say of magnitude the rest is really the Truck segment even though in some of the other business areas you have, for the size of the business area, significant impacts of course. But from a Group perspective you could &#x2013; could &#x2013; place it like that.</p>
          <p>So I will keep myself fairly short today here. And I will stop by that. Thank you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let's go to Slide 7 then, and the Truck slide. There you can see we actually got SEK 50 billion sales in the quarter, good progress there with 32% up, FX adjusted. Much of what I said earlier on the market, certainly is correct also to say for trucks with improved market conditions. We have &#x2013; we are increasing the order book, and we have an operating margin above 10% on the truck side, which obviously is something that we've been striving for.</p>
          <p>If you look at what we have in focus here, we are now seeing, with the order intake in the U.S. and now also in Japan, we are in the midst of production ramp-ups there. And in quarter three, let me just remind you there, that when you bring a lot of people in, like new shifts for example in the U.S., takes a couple of weeks there before they are really productive in terms of getting to the same efficiencies that we have the older, more mature, workforce there.</p>
          <p>Strict cost control, and we have, again, benefiting from, but also product introductions ahead of us, which we are quite happy with. We have, for example, the Condor range coming in Japan with the new medium-duty engine, the first application of our new medium-duty engine generation. And also hybrids in France with Renault, and also environmentally sound trucks, DME Volvo and also Methane-Diesel coming from Volvo. So new product introduction that will give our customers the benefit of, for example, burning natural gas or biogas, and also be able to operate on efficiently &#x2013; on good efficient fuel efficiency levels.</p>
          <p>If you go to Slide 8, there you see the Net Order Intake. And as you can see we have good news there also. And of course, these are real data, so we all read the same newspapers on what might happen in the future, but these are the real data that you can see in our order books as they flow in.</p>
          <p>Change Q-on-Q here progressive over the year, then a yearly comparison with 34% up, and there you really see now the strength of North America. As you can see, North America and South America, now even though South America has grown quite nicely is beginning to be looking more like it should, but the North American market is considerably bigger than the South American market, which was not the case in the midst of the crisis there.</p>
          <p>But 129% up in North America; Europe as you see almost 30%, South America at 30%, and Asia then, which is really a consequence of Japan in the main, 3%; other markets still doing very well.</p>
          <p>If you look at Q1 to Q2, we have a normal seasonality, so we were expecting a slower Q2 order intake. And we still see we think quite reasonable numbers there, stable numbers with Europe and North America in plus territory, South America and Asia in some minuses. And you see other markets actually doing quite well there, and all of that combines in to a curve that is pointing towards the upper right corner there on the slide at the total levels.</p>
          <p>If you look at the heavy-duty truck market in Europe, on the next slide, there we are basically saying, let's leave that as it is. That's EU members plus Switzerland and Norway, and we also have noted earlier in the day that even outside of the U.S. and to the East &#x2013; of the EU and to the East of the EU, we also see some strength in the market, but unchanged when it comes to EU members and Switzerland and Norway.</p>
          <p>And Heavy-duty truck market in North America, which is Slide 10, the same point to be made there. We think that we have about the right in 230 thousand trucks, 240 thousand trucks. We obviously had a couple of months here that's been higher than that. Would argue and hope that it doesn't run away in the type of cycles that we had in '05, and '06 here. And there is no reason to think that of course, because there we had a pre-buy effect in '05 and '06. But it would be good if we could see a more stable development in North America, coming above then historical trend lines, but to do that in a slightly less cyclical way.</p>
          <p>I see some speculation now and then about the new emission rules in terms of fuel efficiency that could again create, you can say pre-buy effect. We don't think that that will be the case. The old emission rules, and the ones that were impacting our sales in '06, were really from a customer point of view costly exercises to get our engines more clean. While we think that's good, nothing like that is going to happen for the future. There we actually see energy efficiency driven by, in some case, regulations and labeling, but those energy efficiencies will be translating in to fuel efficiency for our customers, and therefore we don't think we will see much of a abnormal pre-buy effect in the next couple of years. More based then on real replacement cycle and the economic cycle, as we run through the next couple of quarters here in North America.</p>
          <p>With that let me switch over to Construction Equipment. We have Pat Olney, our new leader of Construction Equipment, and Slide 11.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Let me start then by saying that Volvo Construction Equipment had another strong quarter in Q2 delivering just under SEK 1.9 billion of operating income on SEK18 billion in revenue for an operating margin of 10.8%.</p>
          <p>This was fueled by continued strong growth year-over-year, 32% growth in the top line adjusted for currency. And that growth was really supported by both growth in the markets, worldwide you could say, as all the major markets were increased year-over-year, but also the continued development and reinforcement of our market share position in China, where we maintained the number one position, which was established in Q1.</p>
          <p>We could say the operating margin of 10.8% did suffer from some headwinds as we did have the impact from the Japan crisis affecting us for SEK 300 million negative on the bottom line, and also as Mikael mentioned earlier, significant impact due to the strong krona in the second quarter affected the top line and the bottom line as well.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, we continue to rollout the Tier 4I Stage III B product offering and we are pleased to be leading the industry in that rollout, and we have many machines already launched in Q1 out in the field and meeting customers' expectations.</p>
          <p>If we go ahead to the next slide, we show here our position in China. Number one again in the second quarter with an 11.8% market share year-to-date, and on a rolling 12-month-basis then achieving together with Volvo branded products and SDLG just under 50,000 units in sales, which is a historic high position for us in the very important Chinese market.</p>
          <p>Then, as Leif mentioned earlier, the Chinese market we've seen a softening in the last couple of months due to the government's efforts to curb inflation. We expect these effects to be temporary, and see that the fundamentals in terms of fixed asset investment and construction demand, which underlie the market, are still quite sound looking ahead. So we still have a very good outlook for the Chinese market, both in the medium and the long-term.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would just like to comment that we, after a two year hiatus, we again held the Volvo Days Event in Eskilstuna, in which we showcased the full range of our new products and our full offering, with over 50 new models on display. We had over 10,000 customers, which is a record level of interest for us, and now of course, in focus will be to take that tremendous interest from our customers and convert that during the next quarter into firm orders.</p>
          <p>So by that, I think I conclude the comments on Volvo CE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, Pat. Good. Let's go to Slide 13. There we have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, our President, CEO of Buses, H&#xE5;kan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Despite the weak market on the city side in North America and Europe, we had strong deliveries and improved profitability during the quarter. The global bus market recovering a slow pace, with good demands in South America, Asia and Middle East. The city bus segment in North America suffer from the budget discussions, and could be down as much as 20%, 2011 compared to 2010. In Europe, the total market is in the same level as 2010, but we have a slight lower demand on the city bus segment up to today.</p>
          <p>We had good order intake during the second quarter and in line with last year, and we have an order book up 17% compared to last year. Strong deliveries, mainly in North and South America and International, up 36%. And then the result, SEK 275 million, close to 5% margin, and still in a negative currency situation.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we made some important product launches. In Brazil, we launched for the first time a new front engine bus, which we have developed together with Volvo Trucks in Brazil. Front engine buses is a fairly big segment that we haven't participate in, in the past, in the range of 10,000 units to 12,000 units yearly. We have got a good launch and the market is very positive to the new vehicles there.</p>
          <p>In Europe, we continue to introduce the new city range. We are with our product intercity 8900 in serial production, and the 7900, a real city bus vehicle, will be launched in a couple of months. And the third one is the global hybrid rollout, because after the success in Europe, we have now introduced our hybrid concept in South America, and we'll also launch it in China. And today we have received almost 350 orders on our hybrid buses so far. And the first one outside Europe is in South America with 60 Hybrids, and it has been followed in Mexico then for another 10. So once again a successful introduction and launch of our hybrid vehicles out there.</p>
          <p>To manage the slow recovery in the market, we have to focus then naturally on the order intake in North America and Europe, and continue to improve cost and capital efficiency to improve our margins going forward.</p>
          <p>So that was all from Buses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Let's go to Slide 14 on Volvo Penta and G&#xF6;ran Gummeson, who is the President-CEO there cannot be with us. So let me do that. We have good development there, and what is happening here is that we have a very weak marine market, and that's even so that in the U.S. it's almost at historically very low levels, and a weak return of the market on the marine side also in Europe.</p>
          <p>What is really good news from Volvo Penta is that the break in into the industrial engines, which is to take the groups power train engines and do application engineering for them in to different segments of industrial engines is now beginning to pay off very nicely, both in terms of sales and in terms of operating income.</p>
          <p>And we actually see strengths in market shares in both Marine, which is again then a weak market, but industrial also, and Industrial is actually growing and doing more in line with what you see for example at Construction Equipment from total market point of view.</p>
          <p>If we look at what that meant, it translated into good double-digit margins for Volvo Penta, and we now see them in focus as we move forward, the real focus during the season here is to make sure in the Mediterranean and Scandinavia that we have a good service level for our European boat customers, and to continue to increase Marine market shares there. We are introducing, as you know, a lot of new technology. We spoke about electronics last time, a new 400 horsepower D6s, and also then the continuing success of IPS.</p>
          <p>But also to remember, and perhaps over time see as more important for Volvo Penta, a really good momentum now for growth in Industrial Engines. And we hope that with that growth in Industrial Engines, Volvo Penta will be more two legged than one legged for the future, and that that will return a good and stable operating income and growth for us, as it did this quarter.</p>
          <p>With that let's go to Volvo Aero. We have Staffan Zackrisson, our CEO of Volvo Aero and Slide 15.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. First, about sales. It's down to SEK 1.6 billion, but adjusted for divestment of Volvo Aero Services last year and the dollar impact, our underlying growth is 8%. The industry had a tremendous order boom placing aircrafts, and especially the Paris Air Show was very successfully, so plus 200%, building a backlog up to 7,300 aircraft.</p>
          <p>And a huge success during the air show was the new Airbus 320neo, and that aircraft has currently got 1,000 aircrafts on order or commitments right now. This is driven by the growth of traffic, it's 7% growth, this is above the long-term trend that is close to 5%.</p>
          <p>Of course the fuel prices affects the airline profits, which are expected to be half what was announced by the international organization prior this year, but the orders are up, and that's because of the fuel efficiencies that the airlines wants to get.</p>
          <p>If you look on Volvo Aero's profit, it has improved from quarter one, but is still very weak. Operating income for Volvo Aero, it's affected by the dollar mostly, and we also have supplier issues on new product introduction. It's a &#x2013; they're both on the quality and the volume side, their ability to deliver.</p>
          <p>We have signed an important contract for the Pratt 1100 engines that will give us bigger revenue over the last &#x2013; next 50 years, over $40 billion, and it's a nice addition to our portfolio of engine programs. This engine will power the Airbus 320neo. Of course what the engine delivers is better fuel consumption and noise also with the new technology with the geared turbofan.</p>
          <p>What's in focus for us is supply management initiative. We work with our suppliers to get their process stability improved, and also their raw materials situation. It's a long-term commitment from us. We have inside our shops a productivity improvement program that is running, to get cost out of the system as well, and to meet the challenge of the dollar for us. And thirdly, the execution of this new program that's just entered, the detailed designed is of course vital for our future.</p>
          <p>And that ends the report from Volvo Aero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good, we have Financial Services on Slide 16, and it's technology works Marty Weissburg, our President of Financial Services will speak to that slide. Marty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. With our Financial Services operation, positive trends continued in the second quarter, and with a more reasonable results for the quarter. New financing volume for Volvo Group customers was SEK 12 billion in the quarter, and this is the best quarter of new business for Financial Services since the fourth quarter of 2007, and is approximately a 50% increase in new volume adjusted for currencies when compared to the second quarter of last year. This is of course driven by very strong Group deliveries along with good VFS share or penetration in financing those Group products.</p>
          <p>Operating income improved some again with a result of SEK 250 million in Q2. Growth income improved in absolute terms and also on a percentage basis, and this is indicative of improved portfolio fundamentals and some reasonable growth in the portfolio. We had significant improvements in credit provision expense, which really drives the result, and a benefit from a Brazilian syndication, which I'll speak about shortly.</p>
          <p>Some of the highlights, and further to what is helping profitability is, in the quarter, all VFS regions were profitable. This is two quarters in a row now. Also, as previously mentioned, we syndicated or sold approximately SEK 4 billion of our Brazilian retail credit portfolio, and this was for global portfolio balancing purposes. And this syndication had a positive impact on operating income in the period of SEK 45 million. This syndication or sale is similar to one that we completed in the second quarter of last year, and VFS retains account servicing and customer relationships in all of these cases, and I would add that our Brazilian business continues to perform and grow quite well. Also in highlights, portfolio growth in all region &#x2013; all regions, and done so within our risks management and segmentation strategies.</p>
          <p>In focus, strong focus, and I would say good success, in building skilled global financial services teams in our growth markets, Brazil, Russia, China, and others. We're well established in these markets for many years yet organizational buildup remains very much in focus.</p>
          <p>Syndication opportunities, as with Brazil in this past quarter, will continue to be in focus, as we will continue to syndicate small portions of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. This is in-keeping with our portfolio management practices, and is a key element in properly managing risk over the business cycle.</p>
          <p>So I'd say organizational development and syndications are just two of the many topics in focus within business cycle management, as we continue to prudently mange growth in this up cycle, and continue to be well prepared for all parts of the business cycle.</p>
          <p>So, Leif, that's the report from Financial Services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, good. Let's conclude the on Slide 17, and the one that says Group Summary there. You see earnings per share advancing from SEK 1.55 to SEK 2.52, SEK 2.01 in the last quarter in Q1 '11, SEK 2.52 this year. And then you see operating cash flow on the slide below there.</p>
          <p>We have in focus as we move forward, we are managing a productivity and ramp up, and with that you can say increased productivity both in the U.S. and in Japan, less so in the rest of the Group. I'd say in some parts of the Group we are still in &#x2013; also in a ramp up mode outside of those countries.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; I should say almost constantly have supply chain problems, they can be roller bearings or they can be tires, or they can be certain materials. So far, we've been able to manage those quite reasonably well with very little impact in Q2 here. We expect to be able to be continue to manage that but there are risks there when the supply chain in some parts of the world is as strained for capacity as it is.</p>
          <p>From our own point, you can say we are eliminating bottlenecks in many parts of the Group, and what of course we are trying to do here is to make sure that we can get the combined output of assembly factories, power train facilities and for example gearbox facilities. And so far that's been going well too.</p>
          <p>I think we spoke last time about the need to look at capacity investments towards the end of this year, with really trying to estimate where would '13 and '14 or even '15 be in terms of capacity needs, and how best to go about that. If we look now, you can say that perhaps at least in the short-term here a better way to look at that is to eliminate bottlenecks, and then see how the world develops over the next say a year or 18 months.</p>
          <p>We all have a continued focus on cost and working capital control. We're happy that we shaved off another day here in terms of CCC. We will not build inventories and therefore we expect to be able to make those adjustments. And of course in the midst of everything here those are not any significant issues, but we don't want to start a trend here of building inventories.</p>
          <p>And finally, it is good to note that we have a very strong sales momentum right now, both in terms of underlying demand in the different markets that we are operating, but also in terms of having successful products to go to those markets with.</p>
          <p>And with that let me open up for a Q&amp;A session and answer any questions that you may have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. I'd like to ask three questions, please. First one is on the drop through in Construction Equipment. I just tried to strip out SEK 850 million in currency, the extra sales of SEK 1.2 billion and SEK 300 million that we're missed due to Japan, and I note a drop through of about 13% year-on-year. Overall, the margin in Construction Equipment has been declining a little bit. Whether you &#x2013; wonder whether you can give us some more explanation apart from the currency, as well as sort of the Japanese issues that you've been facing as underlying drop through sales seems to be a little bit low.</p>
          <p>Secondly on China, sort of wondering what you're seeing on the financing part in China within Construction Equipment. Wonder whether you could talk here about the financial tightening that the government announced, and whether that has been perhaps easing up a little bit already, or whether that's still standing? Just an update there. Lastly an update on Aero. How long do you expect the production disruptions and the raw material impact still to last?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, should we ask Pat on the first two of those, or if Marty has something to chip in there, you're welcome to do that too. Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Leif. First point on the drop through margin, I assume it was Q2 this year over Q2 last year you're trying to estimate. I think we &#x2013; our calculations at least based on backing out the currency impact and the Japan crisis would have had us somewhere over 14% on an apples-to-apples basis, which would have been a record. So a slight difference maybe in calculation there. But I will say we are, like all competitors, facing pressure on material cost, which we work to pass on in to the marketplace. That's really the challenge that we are faced with, but so far we've been successful in pricing those costs forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the financing, I'll start by saying first of all, it's been a strength for us to have access to captive financing through Volvo Financial Services in China, and that's allowed us to continue to find financing solutions for our customers.</p>
          <p>I'll also point out that still quite a bit of the business, in terms of fixed asset investments in the country, are financed by either cash or other basis are not actually requiring financing. So the &#x2013; it's about two-thirds of the CapEx in the country on projects is actually financed through other means than bank lending. So we don't see, as much, perhaps, exposure to the tightening in that segment. I don't know, Marty, maybe if you have some other comment on the...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, I would add while the market has tightened, we have not, and I would say that from Volvo's standpoint, Financial Services has ample capacity to continue to grow in a very good way, our CE Finance and Truck and Bus finance business in China. And our credit appetite remains robust. It's a strongly performing portfolio.</p>

          <p>Hi, gentleman, good afternoon. Could I ask you about the R&amp;D productivity program and your R&amp;D outlook? Could you maybe remind us of your &#x2013; how you see the savings, or the productivity increases developing in terms of time? How you expect these to scale up? And then secondly, if you expect any significant changes in R&amp;D spend post Euro 6, and then you have the Tier 4 introductions as well, obviously?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I perhaps should ask our incoming CEO to speak a little about the future on R&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. When it comes to the R&amp;D 30 program we are running at full speed ahead, and it's a number of activities that we're doing looking into tools, processes and other efficient means in order to get the work &#x2013; sort of the efficiency out of every invested krona, dollar, or whatever into the system. This is of course nothing that you do from one day to another and this program is over a number of years. But so far so good. We have a steering committee that is monitoring this. Their KPIs are getting into place, and we start to measuring this in a stringent way, and we will continue to do so going forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the R&amp;D, going forward, that's something that we of course have to judge over time here. But you can say that if you look at over time, we have of course a Euro 6 that we're getting through, but on the other hand there are other things coming in into the portfolio as well that we need to take care of. So I wouldn't sort of sit there and giving any forecast on the R&amp;D that's going forward here long-term. But one thing, and one message is clear that we're going to work very much on the efficiency to make sure that we have a very efficient R&amp;D system in place.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Great. Could you maybe give us a crude estimate of how much one of these engine, regulatory changes cost you, whether it's Euro 5 or Euro 6?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think we could &#x2013; it's very difficult, you can say, to isolate it frankly <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:09). If you do what we typically do, which is what &#x2013; also what you see in our R&amp;D cost is that we &#x2013; when we make big changes in the power train and the packaging of engines and gearboxes, then we also take the opportunity to make other changes in combination with it. It's a good opportunity you can say to change. To isolate, we are talking about billions over some period of time. I don't know that I really have a good catch-all number isolated Euro 5 or Euro 6. Big numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just three questions please. The first one is on capacity utilization. I was just wondering if you could give some indication by region, where you are right now, both for the Trucks and the Construction Equipment segment?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, could you tell us a little bit where truck pricing in Europe and the U.S. is versus pre-crisis level? I mean this morning you spoke about pricing being relatively positive, but I'm just trying to get a feel of where we actually are right now?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, could you also give a bit of outlook on your working capital development in the second half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with capacity. I think in general, I think we can say we don't have much of an issue when it comes to assembly capacity. There is some tightness in some of the supply chains that we spoke about before. I think the issue that might need to be addressed over the next 24 months or 36 months is capacity on heavy duty engines, and potentially also automated gearboxes, automatic gearboxes.</p>
          <p>But, in general, you can say what we would be aiming to try to do is to get those capacities, when it comes to power train components, in line with the regions where they are sold. So for example, investments in North America for North American engines, and over time investments in Asia, like we did with the medium duty engine for the Asian markets. And then see how we'll spread that out. But not an issue for capacity in general when it comes to larger assembly factories where we have all the people, more of an issue of bottlenecks elimination on the power train side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. I think you misunderstood the question. It was more about capacity utilization levels by region. So if you can tell us a little bit of how high utilization is, for example, in Europe and the U.S. and also, I guess for the Construction Equipment division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think in general you can say, if you take heavy duty truck &#x2013; heavy duty engines, there we are in the range of 80% capacity utilization. So it becomes a matter of looking how to call '12 and '13 to get that right. And you can say installed capacity when it comes to assembly factories is not that meaningful, because it really has to do with people, and I don't think that's much of an issue, and I don't know that we can give you a catch-all number on the different factories. What would you say about Eskilstuna for example, Pat? Are we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eskilstuna, we are probably running in the 2/3rds, 70% utilization, still room to develop as we did the CS09 program there a couple of years ago. But same comments for me as you made for the truck factories. The issues are not in assembly capacity for CE. Perhaps with the exception of China, where we've actually had to double shift operations in line with the market, it's more key components, hydraulic components where we need to make investments to alleviate the bottlenecks going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on assembly capacity, you can say it's still low utilization rates in &#x2013; also in &#x2013; on assembly side, both in North America and Western Europe, higher when you move out there.</p>
          <p>Truck pricing is &#x2013; has been in North America and in Europe, quite reasonable in the sense that we have been able to get across cost increases, driven by either regulatory regimes or from material increases. And I'm not so sure that that I know how to compare that to 2007-2008, because as you know that we have fairly significant regulatory changes. Prices are obviously higher, but so is cost. I think the best, perhaps, way to look at that would be to look at gross margins and try to compare them, where they are actually now again coming back to be quite good.</p>
          <p>In general, on pricing you can say, in the markets where we see a good demand, we have been able to get across both cost increases in terms of raw material and regulatory cost.</p>
          <p>Is that in line with what you expected me to say? What you wanted me to answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's fine. Thanks, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Then we had the outlook for <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:28).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know, we don't give a forecast per se here. But as I expressed earlier on, we are confident in the target of 20 days when it comes to our cash conversion cycle here. I mean, the negative effect, if I put like that, in the working capital in Q2 here was really a slight build up on inventory, which has very natural explanations. I mean, we have some effect there from Japan. The Japan issue, so to speak, where we had some material incoming, at the same time we got some problems in other materials from Japan, and we couldn't switch off the inflow of the materials that actually didn't have a disturbance there. So you got some raw material and WIP issues there.</p>
          <p>And then we also have vacation effect currently here as we are shutting down in Europe for four weeks, while we have U.S., for example, going for vacation only for two weeks. So there you have some buffering issues to manage to keep on going in the U.S. while we are on vacation in Sweden, and smaller things like that. So that is the things that will of course be straightened out as we move forward here.</p>
          <p>And then we have the so-called extra payment days on the payable sides here. But it's really where in trade payables and inventory where we will make it happen to get down to the 20 days here, and we are confident in that we will do that over time.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Yann Benhamou from Exane. Three questions please. First, assuming that the current prices for currencies stay where they are, what do you assume qualitatively in terms of ForEx impact in H2 compared to what we have seen in H1?</p>
          <p>Second question, for Construction Equipment. Do you see a sensitivity of profitability depending on China? In other words, would you consider that China has a higher than average profitability for you, for Construction Equipment?</p>
          <p>And last point, in Brazil there will be new entrants over the coming years, plus players having local <mark type="ph" /> pollution] (47:51). So, do you see the current huge margins changing over time?</p>
          <p>Honored. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the truck side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Truck side, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Should we start with currencies? And I'll ask Mikael to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. As I said earlier today here, to give guidance when it comes to FX impact is, it's a very challenging task, and nothing we intend to do here. But what we have said is that we have given you some guidance previously here on what kind of flows we normally have in the different quarters here. And when we look at the second quarter here, we have really an impact coming from the dollar here, as we have seen the biggest movements there. And, I mean, everything else equal, I will say you shouldn't see sequentially that much of an impact between the quarter here, but I will say, it all depends on what's happening here and that's very difficult to give any guidance on that.</p>
          <p>But when it comes to the hedging impact, we only hedge our foreign flows there. And we are not, I would say, taking advantage of what you might, could see as favorable currency levels at any particular moment. So we are following the natural flow of the currencies here.</p>
          <p>And what does then foreign flows mean? I would say it means practically around 50% of the flows you see in the quarter is hedged over the time period there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Profitability, China and CE?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess I'd start by saying don't quote specific profitability for specific markets and CE. But I think you can say that given the size of the China business for us, it's &#x2013; we wouldn't be doing the result we were doing overall if we didn't have a profitable business in China. So we can say that it's a profitable business for us. So from that standpoint you could say there is some exposure to <mark type="inaudible" /> (50:13) in China. But to tie to my market comments from earlier, again when it comes to the softening in the market, even with the softening that we foresee, we still expect a very strong market in China, up 10% to 15% year-over-year. So don't feel extreme exposure from that standpoint to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think let me get the question of Brazil, and the truck market, and the configuration of the truck market with different competitors there, over to Mikael. Mikael is our good expert on Brazil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So of course, Brazil here is a steaming market, it attracts a lot of attention from players that are not currently in Brazil here. And I would say that there are certainly some movements for new entrances here. And I think you have seen some announcements from some other players investing more in Brazil here. But I would say, I mean, they are of course operating under the same circumstances ourselves here, and with the challenges there.</p>
          <p>The only thing I can conclude is that we have a very good position there, we have been around for a very long time in Brazil, very strong and good performing dealer network, and we have good products now where we're actually taking market share in our segment there. So I think we are well-positioned to meet the new competition in Brazil.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Maybe a last question, if I may?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall on that theme, you see announcements every now and then of different players in the industry having set up factories and defined products. Over time, it is just as important, or sometimes more important, to build distribution networks, that can do 24X7 service on a number of vehicles distributed over a large country like Brazil. The ways to quickly get up market shares are limited on the distribution side.</p>

          <p>Yes. Yes, we can.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. I was wondering if you could update us a little bit on your penetration of own engines and gearboxes in North America, and really whether this is making a difference to your business out there at the moment?</p>
          <p>Second thing is, I was just wondering if you could give us a little more explicit guidance on capital expenditure going forwards? I mean, should we expect it to be a fairly stable figure or should we expect it to increase in line with sales?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, some comments obviously in the presentations about industrial engine growth. Can you just sort of tell us a little bit more about that business? About where &#x2013; who the end customers typically are, and the geography of them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the engine &#x2013; penetrations of own engines and gearboxes in the U.S., which is now coming up into the 80% when it comes to engines and 35%, 40% on the gearbox side. That clearly are &#x2013; is good news. It means that we will be coming in to a spare parts stream of revenue that we have not had before. And as we go through the cycles, you know, that is always very good. So we are doing well with that and happy with that. And when I said those numbers, now those are the Volvo brand. On the Mack side, as you know, we have 100% own engines.</p>
          <p>And your second question was on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>CapEx, right. You want to speak to that, Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take that. The guidance we have given you when it comes to CapEx here is about SEK 10 billion for 2011 here. And that is increase compared to previous year. As you know, we pulled quite a lot in order to reduce the CapEx during '09 and '10 here, and there is of course some pent-up demand there that needs to be done. So you should expect around SEK 10 billion for 2011 here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And going forwards, one might be good to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:04) with sales, or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say. I mean that is not the rule of thumb you should use here. I think it depends a lot of different things where we are in the product cycles and other things also. So I think we &#x2013; let's take one year at a time here in terms of guidance here. But it is not that dramatic fluctuations over time, I would say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me talk a little bit about industrial engines. And by the way, I think we have Dennis Slagle on the line too. Is that correct, Denny?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I am here Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you want to add something more on the U.S. side, feel free to do that. On the industrial engines side, the large segments on industrial engines would be everything that has to do with pumping. For example, pumping water or pumping different fluids in chemical industry, et cetera.</p>
          <p>There is a big segment in power generation, and power generation is growing in many places because of inefficient grid, and you can say smartness of grids. But you also see a lot of power generation being used for safety reasons, for example, in hospitals or computer halls.</p>
          <p>And then over time, what is quite evident is that there are a number of people in segments like cranes or different parts of mining equipment, et cetera, who now feel that with a much more advanced engine technology that they need to have to be able to meet regulatory regimes, are looking for two things. And one is a good engine, and the other one is actually the ability to supply spare parts all over the world in a global logistics system.</p>
          <p>I think the segment here where we have found Penta to be quite efficient is also is actually to be able to deliver both application engineering into segments like that, but also in terms of being able to supply spare parts and support for those products regardless of where they are.</p>
          <p>Good. Dennis, anything you wanted to add on the penetration of own engines or gearboxes there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just, first of all your figures are correct Leif, but the one thing I did want to add is the tremendous success of the I-Shift, we call it mDrive for Mack. That has helped us because, of course, we only put that behind our engines. With CSA requirement driver &#x2013; requirements, et cetera, this makes a marginal driver into a very good driver, and it's really starting to get popular, and frankly our competition is not that strong in that area. So we look forward to seeing &#x2013; using the I-Shift and mDrive as a vehicle to go even deeper in penetration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And Dennis Slagle there is our Head of North American Trucks. Good. Let's go to the next question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Sebastian <mark type="indiscernible" /> (58:13). Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions on Construction Equipment. My first question will be, since the start of the year, we have seen some Chinese players in this industry using aggressive selling techniques, like mortgage with zero down payment. And I'd like to know what was your strategy in this environment? If you used the same technique to be able to increase your market share?</p>
          <p>The second question is about the SEK 1.2 billion revenues lost due to Japan at Construction Equipment. Would you expect to recover these revenues in Q3? Should we see less seasonality than usual due to this catch-up effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the first question, you're asking whether we, on the finance side are doing zero down payment and full financing, et cetera. And I think the answer to that is clearly no. We are trying to keep up the discipline that we learned how to do, in our case because we basically have always done. I'm not so sure that I hear frankly a lot about zero money down payments even from our industry. I'm looking around the table here to see whether anyone...Pat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marty can confirm this. But I think typically we see at least &#x2013; go for at least around 20% down, and then financing typically over a three-year period. So we secure that there is always good equity in the machine, if you like. Marty, that's pretty much what we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's right, Pat. And I guess we collectively do not use credit risk as a way to build market share. So we...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we've heard of some competitors having more aggressive sales promotions, and perhaps discounting, and that's something where based on our positioning with the Volvo brand in the market we certainly don't resort to as a way to promote our product and our brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And your second question, see if you can repeat it? I didn't catch completely what you asked there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the question, you've lost $1.2 billion SEK revenues due to the Japanese disaster. And I was wondering if you would expect to recover these revenues in Q3 or Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what we have said earlier in the day is that with what we know today, we are &#x2013; we don't expect to have any more negative, significantly negative, effects off of the disaster in Japan. And that is both true for Construction Equipment and Trucks. But I also don't think that we think that we can recover lost sales. If you look at what we lost in Q2, that most likely is what we have lost. Customers who are in the midst of buying products like that typically would perhaps will have gone and made that. So I don't think we can &#x2013; you cannot add that in to quarter three.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Very good. Thank you very much. That concludes the conference call for Volvo's second quarter 2011. It was my 57th call. And as always, it has been a pleasure to be with you. Next time, you will have Olof at the helm, and I wish him all the best, and good luck.</p>
          <p>Thanks a lot, and have a good summer.</p>
