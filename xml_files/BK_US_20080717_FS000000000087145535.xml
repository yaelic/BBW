          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the second quarter 2008 earnings conference call hosted by The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Lackey.  Mr. Lackey, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, <mark type="inaudible" />.  Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us to review the second quarter financial results for The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.  Before we begin, let me remind you that our remarks may include statements about future expectations, plans and prospects, which are forward-looking statements.  The actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by the forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those identified in our 2007 10-K, our most recent 10-Q and other documents filed with the SEC, that are available on our website at bnymellon.com.</p>
          <p>Forward-looking statements in this call speak only as of today, July 17, 2008.  We will not update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, assumptions, circumstances or events, which have changed after they were made.  In addition to this morning's press release, we also have a supplemental document available on our home page, with quarterly earnings summary, which provides the five quarter pro forma combined view of the total company and our six business sectors.</p>
          <p>Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons to the prior year's results reflect this pro forma combined view.  Also available on our web site are the financial trends, a 10 quarter pro forma combined view of the total company and in six business sectors. This morning's call will include comments from Bob Kelly, our CEO and Todd Gibbons, our CFO.</p>
          <p>In addition, there are several members of our executive management team to address your questions about the performance of our businesses during the quarter.  I'd like to remind you that Todd's remarks will be focused on the information available in our quarterly earnings summary beginning on page three.  Now I would like to turn the call over to the Bob Kelly.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Steve and good morning, everyone.  Thank you very much for joining us.  We have most of the executive committee here around the table this morning.  Jim and Tim, who head up our Asset Servicing business are actually on the phone but from Europe, so I'm hoping the sound quality will be good if they're answering questions.  And frankly, I'm on my way to Asia tomorrow morning and this speaks to what a global company we've became here.</p>
          <p>We continue to be served very well for our focused strategy of managing and servicing assets around the world.  Let's start with revenue, if you look at our GAAP numbers, revenue growth was minus 3% year-over-year.  But the way I think of it is, the underlying growth rate was 12% in a period of very broad equity declines. Included in revenue was a SILO charge of 377 million after tax, and we that we signaled that this was quite possible in our Investor Conference. And from a capital stand point; this was offset by sale of the 1st Business Bank in California, which closed on July 1st.  It also included the absorption of $152 million in securities losses.  This is somewhat higher than we expected.  But frankly it is now built in a pretty brutally realistic assumption of 17% further declines in housing prices.</p>
          <p>On the global side, the expansion continues.  Our non U.S.. revenue is now 35%, excluding SILOs, and that's compared to 31 or 33% in Q1 and 31% in Q4.  So we're adding a couple of percent per quarter right now which is really quite extra ordinary.  Expenses looked pretty good year over year, but not on a linked quarter basis.  And we've already started working on that. If you looked to earnings and on the bottom line, they were at $771 million or $0.67 cents excluding the SILO charge and M&amp;I, which actually was up slightly year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The margin moved from 31% this time last year to 34% this quarter, excluding the SILO charge.  Liquidity is excellent.  Capital ratios are strong and have increased nicely from the prior quarter. Quarter in TCE was 431 versus 414 in the first quarter.  But frankly, we had a short term bloom in assets at the end of the quarter.  So I would suggest, perhaps a better way to look at this is the average assets basis, which is 444, so that's a very nice increase over the period.</p>
          <p>Capital generation has about roughly 25 basis points quarter, and you may have seen or been aware of, a few weeks ago in this environment, S&amp;P raised our debt ratings, which I'm assuming is a bit of a rarity nowadays.</p>
          <p>We're winning a lot of new business. Net asset flows were plus 13 billion during the quarter.  New asset servicing wins were 600 billion.  Private wealth client assets wins were 2 billion.  We saw a good momentum in DRs, non U.S. Corporate Trust, Clearing and Treasury Services.  We're delivering great service.  We won recognition for service quality in Asset Servicing, Corporate Trusts, Collateral Management and Transition Management.</p>
          <p>And finally our integration is nicely on track. July 1st was a big date for us, from a consolidation and merger standpoint.  We brought together a number of our legal entities.  It was a really complex procedure, involved an awful lot of people in and around the company and it was really impressive to watch and listen in on the calls as everyone reported back on how it went.  Bottom line is, it made our company more efficient, it streamlined our payment systems and it made it easier for clients to deal with us.  Overall, it went really well.</p>
          <p>So at this point, why don't I hand it over to Todd, who will provide us with more an in-depth view of the quarter.  Todd?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob and good morning.  Let me take you through the highlights of the quarter, help you understand where we are with our merger integration milestones, and offer a few thoughts about our outlook for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>As Bob said, our business model is focused on managing and servicing assets globally.  And our revenue continued to benefit from strong secular trends.  Once again, we had a good operating quarter in a difficult environment.  Security servicing revenues, which include both fee and net interest revenue, were up 16% over last year, reflecting the benefit of continued new business wins in Asset Servicing, DRs, corporate trust and clearing, together with strength and underlying volumes as well as volatility in the markets.</p>
          <p>Asset and wealth management revenues declined by a modest four percent relative to double digit declines in the global equity markets.  Here we benefited from the strength of money market flows and our active global strategies as well as client growth and wealth management particularly with family office clients.  Our treasury services segment continued to benefit from growth in global payments and also the cash management business. So overall, revenue in our business segments was up 10% and our pre-tax income was up 20%.  As Bob mentioned, pre-tax margins for the company, excluding the SILO charge increased to 34% from 31%.  And we continue to improve our corporate risk profile and exit non-core businesses. We have also continued to exceed our merger related synergy targets.</p>
          <p>Now, let's get into the numbers.  Our continuing earnings per share was $0.67.  This excludes the SILO charge of $0.33, and M&amp;I cost of $0.08 and represents two percent growth compared to the second quarter of 2007, even with the impairments in the investment portfolio.  If you add back $0.09 for the securities write downs and the cost to cover credit monitoring related to the lost tapes, it results in operating earnings of $0.76 cents or 15% increase over last year.</p>
          <p>Our net interest revenue in the second quarter was reduced by 377 million due to the SILO charge and our fee revenue was reduced 152 million by the securities write downs.  Once again, we had a strong quarter with total company revenues up 12%, excluding SILOs and securities losses.</p>
          <p>Now my comments going forward will focus on our core business excluding the SILO charge. Our three largest businesses; Asset Management, Asset Servicing and Issuer Services continue to capitalize on the faster growing global markets, as each generated in excess of 40% of their revenues outside of the U.S.  Non-U.S. revenue for the company increased to 35% from 30% in the second quarter of '07 and 33% in Q1.  We kept expense growth to 2% resulting in 500 basis points of positive operating leverage. If you exclude the securities losses, we had year-over-year positive operating leverage of a thousand basis points.</p>
          <p>If you turn to page five of the Earnings Summary, you can see that despite fraud declines in the global equity markets, assets under management increased three percent compared to the prior year and one percent sequentially. During the second quarter, we had $21 billion of positive money market flows and $8 billion of negative long-term flows. Assets under custody and administration increased 4% compared to the prior year and were flat sequentially.</p>
          <p>Turning to page six of the Earnings Summary, which details fee growths, you can see that security servicing fees were up 13% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The key drivers were continued new business wins and strong performance in volume, volatility driven activities.  Asset servicing had another outstanding quarter with fees up 25%, driven by an increase in securities lending fees, which more than doubled on a year-over-year basis on favorable spreads in the short-term money markets.</p>
          <p>We also benefited from strong net new business and the impact of the buyout of the joint venture with ABN AMRO, which we completed late in the fourth quarter. The sequential decline of 3% in asset servicing fees resulted from a $35 million decline in securities lending revenue. This decline primarily reflects the impact on spreads for government securities compared to record levels we enjoyed in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Issuer Services fees grew seven percent year-over-year reflecting growths in depositary receipt and an increase in non-U.S. corporate trust fees. The sequential growth of 18% was due largely to seasonality and strength in DRs.  Clearing and execution fees decreased by five percent but you should keep in mind here that this includes the impact of the sales, the B-Trade and G-Trade execution businesses, which were sold to BNY ConvergEx during the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for this transaction, clearing and execution fee revenue increased 13% over the prior year.  This is principally due to increased activity resulting from market volatility, along with continued growth in money market and mutual fund investments by our clients, reflecting our continued success in asset gathering activities.</p>
          <p>Despite double digit declines in the equity markets, asset and wealth management fees declined only one percent compared to the prior year and increased $2 million sequentially.  Lower equity values and the prior loss of a team at one of the investment boutiques was largely offset by strength in money market flows and certain global equity strategies.</p>
          <p>Performance fees were $16 million.  This is down 47 million year-over-year and 4 million sequentially.  The year-over-year decline represents a lower level of performance fees generated from certain equity, fund-to-fund and fixed income strategies.  FX and other trading revenue generated strong growth of 75% year-over-year and 19% sequentially.  Here we benefited from higher levels of currency volatility, client volumes and merger synergies relative to both periods.  Investment income declined 32 million, compared to the second quarter of '07 and increased $22 million sequentially.  The change relative to prior periods primarily reflects returns from seed capital investments.</p>
          <p>Turning to net interest revenue, which is detailed on page seven of the earnings summary. Interest revenue increased 30% &#x2013; 34% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.  This strong performance compared to the year ago quarters reflects both wider spreads and a higher level of average interest earning assets.  This was driven by strong growth in client deposits from our Issuer Services, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management businesses, once again reflecting continuing new business wins.</p>
          <p>The sequential increase in net interest revenue primarily reflects wider spreads and the continuing benefit of prior Fed eases, partially offset by a lower level in value of non-interest bearing deposits.  Our yield came in at 221, up 26 basis points from the year-ago quarter and 7 basis points from Q1.  The higher yield here was primarily due to wider spreads in our investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Turning to page eight on the expense front, excluding M&amp;I cost and the amortization of intangibles, total non-interest expenses grew 2% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.  The main drivers of the year-over-year increase were business growth.  There was $27 million in higher professional, legal and other purchased services.  We had a $25 million impact due to our annual company-wide merit increase, which took place on &#x2013; which took effect on April 1st.  Also in the fourth quarter, the acquisition of the remaining 50% of the custody JV with ABN AMRO and there were also higher costs associated as we mentioned with the lost tapes, increased benefits, business development as well as a software impairment, some of which we would not expect to be recurring.</p>
          <p>These expenses were partially offset by the sale of the B- and G-Trade businesses, the benefit of merger related expense synergies, $30 million in charges in the year-ago quarter for occupancy and 46 million related to the redemption of subordinated notes.  The sequential increase of 5% was driven by the same factors, in addition to the benefit of certain rebates.  We actually had rebates that are a negative expense enjoyed during the first quarter.  All told, we expect about 30 to 40 million in Q2 expenses will not recur in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Page nine of the earnings summary shows our investment securities in our core portfolio, as well as the conduit that we consolidated at the end of 2007.  We have detailed the asset categories, ratings and fair values for each of the investment types in the two portfolios, as well as the other than temporary impairment write downs incurred during the quarter.  Now, we have always focused on high grade, short duration mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities.  Our current core portfolio is 93% AAA and 4% AA.</p>
          <p>I want to emphasize that we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until the prices recover or until maturity.  The unrealized net of tax loss of our total securities for sale portfolio was 1.818 billion at June 30th.  That's an increase of 29 million compared to the prior quarter.  This reflects the benefit of improved credit spreads for certain securities offset by higher interest rates.</p>
          <p>We routinely test our investment securities for other than temporarily impairment and we use realistic assumptions based on independent research.  As Bob mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we assumed for this analysis an additional 17% decline in national home prices over the next two years and we then estimated the impact that would have on the cash flows underlying the individual securities.  As a result of that analysis, we impaired certain securities and wrote them down to their current market value and recorded $152 million pre-tax securities loss associated with OTTI.</p>
          <p>This breaks out as follows:  first, we had write downs of 72 million related to securities backed by Alt-A Loans. As you can see, our Alt-A portfolio is 99% AAA rated and 1% AA rated. At origination, the portfolio's weighted average FICO score was 716 and it had a favorable weighted-average loan to value of 74%.  Approximately 70 &#x2013; approximately 50% of the total portfolio is supported by the much better performing fixed-rate collateral and the portfolio's weighted-average credit enhancement is 13%.  This means the losses on the underlying loans would have to exceed 13% before any of our principal would be at risk.</p>
          <p>Second, we had write downs of $50 million dollars related to asset-backed CDOs.  At June 30th, the amortized cost net of charges was $0.24 on the dollars &#x2013; on the dollar.  At that point, we have 93 million in total of ABS CDOs, 79 million in the core portfolio and 14 million in trading assets.</p>
          <p>And thirdly, we had write downs of $30 million related to securities backed by HELOCs in the TRFCO portfolio.  There were specific securities that had deteriorated and there was questionable credit support due to the below investment grade ratings of certain bond insurers.</p>
          <p>The HELOC securities in the TRFCO portfolio are tested for impairment based on the quality of the underlying security and the condition of the monoline insurer providing credit support.  Securities were deemed impaired if we expected they may not be repaid in full without the support of the insurer and the insurer was rated below investment grade.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have applied realistic assumptions to calculate the potential losses in this portfolio.  All of our held-for-sale and held-for-maturity portfolios continue to pay principal and interest. So we have a high grade investment portfolio and given the structural protections provided, we are comfortable with the quality of these assets.</p>
          <p>The credit quality of our loan portfolio remained relatively stable.  The provision for credit losses was 25 million, compared to a provision of 16 million in the first quarter.  Charge-offs were less than the provision at 13 million.  Non-performing assets increased by 64 million to 279 million and were principally related to our Florida bank.  The effective tax rate excluding M&amp;I expense and the SILO charge was 32.4%, compared with 31.9% in the year-ago quarter and down slightly from the prior quarter.  Our capital ratio strength in the quarter, we ended Q2 with a Tier 1 ratio of 9.13%, well above our 8% target.</p>
          <p>And as you recall from our investor conference, we've been focused on quickly rebuilding our TCE, which last quarter was below our 5% target due to the increase in unrealized losses and our securities portfolio. At quarter end our TCE was 431 up from 414 last quarter.  However that's a little bit misleading because as Bob had mentioned we did see a spike in period-end deposits. So if you were to use average assets for the quarter which we think is a better indication of the run rate going forward to the balance sheet, the ratios is 444.  So as you can see our capital ratios are strong, and based on our ability to generate 25 to 30 basis points of tangible capital per quarter, we continue to expect to reach our target of 5% by year end.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the merger for a moment.  You may recall that based on the success we've enjoyed to date, at the Investor Conference we increased our targets for both revenue and expense synergies.  Focusing on expense synergies, we generated 131 million in the second quarter, an incremental increase of 13 million compared to the prior quarter and are on track to reach our cumulative targets for 2008.  We continue to exceed our service quality and client retention goals for Asset Servicing.  And on July 1st we flawlessly executed the consolidation of the legacy banks.</p>
          <p>I'm going to conclude my remarks by offering a few observations about the third quarter.  The sale of B-trade, G-trade and Mellon 1st Business Bank and the rerun of the SILOs will reduce second half earnings per share by approximately $0.04.  Traditionally the third quarter is impacted by seasonality associated with lower levels of capital markets related to lap revenues, particularly securities lending and foreign exchange.  However, given the ongoing volatility in the markets, we may see better than historical trend in some of our businesses including foreign exchange.  Of course, if the current weak equity markets hold it will obviously impact markets performance and asset and wealth management.  Expense growth is being managed especially carefully.  The credit provision should be stable with Q2 and we are continuing to focus on delivering our synergy targets.  We expect the tax rate to be approximately 33%, and finally we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, good liquidity and excellent credit ratings. The combination of our financial strength, leading market positions, excellent client service and favorable secular trends will continue to drive our businesses.  With that I'll turn it back to Bob.</p>

          <p>Hi everyone, how are you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  What assumptions, Todd are baked into your &#x2013; particularly with impairment charges, possible future impairment charges?  What assumption on the impairment charges are kind of baked into your proposal, I think you commented that the bank is in a position to generate or build tangible capital by 25 to 30 basis points over the next several quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Tom there's a couple of points there. Number one, the impairment charges actually don't have a capital implication because this portfolio is run through other OCIs so we're already taking any market value reductions as a hit to the capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Great.  And?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>17%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can we assume that these impairment charges are kind of behind you now, given the aggressive assumptions you've made on the housing price declines in the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I'd like to think that. I have to admit, it's pretty hard to predict this with any real precision. Why don't I give a little more color around what I did is, we don't think we can really use historical loss experience to project future losses in this environment.  These are such &#x2013; these times are unprecedented and what we're reaching out to is looking at street research as well as market prices to indicate where we think losses could possibly go, and that's significantly exceeding historical experience. So that's why it's really based, when we run our cash flow models, we're basing it on those market assumptions.</p>
          <p>Now in order for us to take additional impairments, our assumptions are going to have to, they're going to have to get worse.  So we've laid out what we've told you our assumptions were for the future of home prices. The other thing that could happen is your actual experience could worsen than the severe estimate that we've got.  So of course it's possible we could take more.  We're pleased that we're in the AAA tranches and have good structural protections.  So we feel pretty good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Tom, it's Bob.  I totally agree with Tim.  We're in this bizarre period of something that none of us have experienced before.  The article in the weekend, for example the Barron's article, is pretty interesting saying, you know, there's aspects of the housing situation that maybe has turned.  Who knows?  We'll just have to see what happens here over the next six to 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just kind of looked through all the various second quarter non-recurring charges and the results are pretty strong both in relative and absolute basis.  But there's a slight distraction, which I'm sure you're hearing a lot about on this Russian Federation lawsuit and they had a conference call last night.  Bob, do you have any reaction to the points that were made last night conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, as a little bit of background for people.  Some of you may have heard that the plaintiffs held a call last night.  You know, obviously it was time to coincide with our earnings call today.  It's kind of the bottom line. There was nothing new on the call, I didn't listen it in &#x2013; on it but a few of our people did it.  Simply part of our plaintiff's ongoing campaign to try to pressure the company to get a big settlement as quickly as possible so they can move onto something else.  And as I said to you the last couple of times we were together, the plaintiffs would turn up the noise at some point.  In this case on the public relations front and they continue to try to do it.</p>
          <p>You know, the question probably on some of your minds might be, you know, why not settle the case.  And the fact is we've always been willing to engage in some kind of reasonable discussions with authorized representatives of the customs services to resolve the matter.  We've never taken anything off the table and we've never received a legitimate settlement offer.  Now, you know, I want to put this behind us as much as you do, but the solution has to make sense.  We're really confident in our defenses.  There are substantial well-established laws in place to protect our assets around the world.  We're really confident an adverse decision would not be enforceable in the U.S, wouldn't be enforceable in the U.K., or in fact in any another country where we have significant assets.</p>
          <p>We've consistently said that we've been prepared for an adverse decision.  Given the irregularities of this particular court we wouldn't be surprised if it happened.  But as you know we've been a partner to Russia.  We've been a partner to Russian business and we been a partner for a long time.  We tend to continue to support our clients there.  And frankly this case is absolutely not in the best interest of Russia.  So it is what it is, and we've been saying it for some months now that this is what these guys would try to do.  And I think we are doing absolutely the right thing for our shareholders and for our clients.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks.  Todd, maybe just a few follow-ups on the securities for the investment portfolio.  One, on the all paid side following these marks, you gave us the CDOs are at 24% of par.  Can we get that for where the all paid portfolios, and can you comment anything about vintages of when these were originated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you actually look at the earnings summary, you will be able to compute where we are carrying them versus the fair value.  And if my memory serves me right, it's about $0.80.  What was your second question, Glenn?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Something about vintages when originated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, many of these vintages do date pre the '06.  And the vintages that were originated or that we invested in, in '06 and '07 tended to have the greater credit support to them. So, much higher levels of credit enhancement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I appreciate that.  And then, I'm going off memory, but the &#x2013; in the Q I think I remember seeing commercial real estate exposure a little more than 3 billion on the loan side and another 5 billion on exposure.  Could you just give some qualitative comments on, I mean, I see in the table where you have the CMBS mark but just qualitative comments on where you see commercial real estate land shaping up and what those 5 billion of commitments are and what if any of it been pulled down and when you think it could be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Most of our commercial real estate is related to the leading developers here in New York City.  And that portfolio continues to perform very well.  We've got very good LTVs there, very good cash flows and we're not seeing any unusual behavior there, frankly, at all.  Maybe there're one or two little bumps in some of the boroughs.  We did, as I had mentioned, we did see an increase in MPAs out of our Florida bank.  Those guys have been pretty good lenders over the years.  They've avoided a lot of the pit falls but just the noise in Florida, we think there are going to be a couple of MPAs down there.  We don't see significant losses though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the 5 billion, still a 5 billion number or is that started to become actual commitments?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're looking at a combination of funded and unfunded commitments.  So, that would be total commitments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys.  Thanks.  I guess over the past couple of quarters we've seen core EPS come in pretty good and GAAP-stated EPS be a little bit lower than, well obviously, lower than core EPS. And appreciating the number of different issues we're kind of working through, how far out do you think we look before those two numbers start converging?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well, first of all, we, when you're looking at your &#x2013; and I think the way to look at EPS is at the core and for this quarter the $0.76.  There are three adjustments that we had to align. One was clearly a one-time tax adjustment, the second was the impairments and the third was M&amp;I charges.  We anticipate having M&amp;I charges after 2010. So, unfortunately you're going to see that adjustment, Brian, after that point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what I would say as well on that, Brian, just on that issue, is you must bear in mind that the IRR on this merger is extraordinarily high and the risk parameters are coming down massively every quarter.  So, on a risk-adjusted basis and on a nominal basis, those M&amp;I charges are really worth it to our shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Can you help me out with expenses?  We can strip out some of the one-time items and linked quarter offering leverage seems flat to maybe negative and we can disagree about some of the parts.  But just seems like expenses could be better relative to revenue.  So, I guess the question is can you remind us how much the merger savings you've achieved versus your target?  I guess you're running parallel systems; when that ends, and when we see a better improvement in expense control?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start.  What I say is, Todd will go through the details on this right there, I agree there is higher than we would like on a linked quarter basis. There are some special stuff in there and we've already engaged a team here on working on that so that we're all over that issue now. Todd.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the quarter we did see about 13 million in synergies and we're right now on kind of the steeper part of the synergy curve, Mike.  There were &#x2013; we mentioned some of the one-time on a sequential basis. In the first quarter, you had the rebate.  Here, we had the pretty significant expenses associated with the lost tapes.  We also had our business development expenses were pretty high.  We had a number of client conferences obviously to generate new business.  And we also incurred an impairment charge in software.  There were a lot of little one-time items. I don't know if I would call one-time items like that which we really don't see recurring.  So, the combination of some additional expense control and just bringing some of this out of the run rate, we would expect to see some improvement in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I didn't have the business development costs and the impairment charge on software.  How much were those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The combination of those two were nearly 20 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>20 million?  So, all else equal, should we see expenses 20 million lower given the absence of those next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In my remarks, I said I thought we would actually see nonrecurring stuff of about 30 to 40 in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so this is an aberration in terms of expense control in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that's true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that should help.  The margin was up.  What's the outlook there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the net interest margin up 11 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh. That was largely driven by the spreads on the investment portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So do you think that's kind of stayed flattish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably peaked Mike.  A combination of a couple of things happened in the quarter.  We still seem to be benefiting a little bit from the &#x2013; from the Fed ease, you're seeing our assets go down and yield slower than basically what are our deposits go down.  So we're still seeing some benefit from that.  But you're also seeing &#x2013; and part of this is related to the OCI &#x2013; just as the investment portfolio goes down in value, its yield increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And OCI, since quarter end, it's pretty good.  Your underlying securities losses were kind of flat, around 1.8 billion even though like non-agency MBS declined so much in value, but since quarter end has that gone down more?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has gone down a little bit more, probably on a tax adjusted basis.  We looked at it Tuesday night, it would have been down about a hundred million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So not too much.  And last question, the pipeline of business, some would say they're winning from other big players.  You're going through a merger.  Is your pipeline going down at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we, Jim &#x2013; it's a good question Mike.  Jim and Tim, would either of them who are on the phone like to comment on that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure, Mike, it's Tim Keaney here.  I would say the pipeline is quite strong.  If you looked at it, it would be down slightly sequentially, but up about 11 or 12% percent year-on-year.  Batting average is still pretty strong, kind of, well north of 60%.  And we're seeing, a very &#x2013; a much larger amount of opportunities and also a concentration of several very large outsourcing opportunities.  So overall, we're quite happy and it's very consistent with the new business results we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're up 11% year-over-year.  Is that apples-to-apples or does that include the benefits of the acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would stay that's apples-to-apples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  All right.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We should probably highlight a couple of the other businesses too.  Karen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, all of the Issuer Services businesses look good in terms of great healthy pipeline, global corporate trust, NDRs particularly.  And then on our Treasury Services side, the cash and particularly global payments, quite a nice, healthy pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Dave, you had a nice quarter. Any comments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would say the same thing.  Our pipelines are probably the strongest it's ever been.  Especially as Todd had already mentioned, the family office business and the short-term pipeline over the next couple quarters looks especially strong.  So, I would say real flights to quality right now and kind of difficult times in the high net-worth side, so we're feeling good about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And who are you getting that from?  Because we heard that yesterday from Northern too. I guess you're not winning from each other, who are you winning from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a very small group of capable providers in the family office side right now.  And there are especially clients that are especially drawn to a trust company status as opposed to perhaps a brokerage status for protection of their assets.  So I would say the competition is very small, and where it's coming from would be those other players.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, any thoughts on Pershing?  I know you've been booking a lot of new business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Pershing has definitely benefited from market construction that's been going on.  And we have significant increase in the <mark type="inaudible" /> and the pipeline remains probably at its peak because while the initial sort of market disruption, some of those credit risks or immediate risks have passed, the truth is that firms seem to be increasingly engaging in more long term review of options and alternatives.  And we have a very healthy pipeline of people are being more methodical about the review consider it an emergency review.  And so we're pretty optimistic.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Ronald O'Hanley.  Maybe I will finish this on asset management.  The pipeline continues to grow for us.  I think that the only possible negative, which the industry is seeing is that decisions are taking longer.  Particularly as pension funds are seeing changes in their funding status.  So albeit decisions are taking longer, we've got a bigger pipeline so we expect to see growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  A couple of questions.  I guess one is a comment given that Russian lawsuit call last night and the fact they refused to answer the questions about who's really benefiting from these payouts or whatever they're expecting from this.  You may not be able to comment, but I would hope that the Feds or some other authorities get engaged in figuring out what is &#x2013; who the potential beneficiaries are really.  And given that they kept changing their answers about whether they were approaching you for a settlement and not on what the amounts were was just way to many inconsistencies that just raises a lot of questions about the real motivations here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks Vivek. I did read your, the piece you put out this morning and you raised some great issues.  You know, you shouldn't assume &#x2013; I don't think people should assume that the government isn't doing anything to help us.  On the other hand though, I can't speak on their behalf.  So, what I would say is if you have questions or thoughts or concerns, which could be legitimate, I would encourage you to contact the people you referred to.  And that's really all I can say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then to a couple of business issues, Ron O'Hanley, the long term asset outflows that you're seeing from the team that left, when do you think we should be able to be done with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The &#x2013; in fact, the actual asset outflows moderated significantly in the second quarter, what you're seeing of course is the full year kind of revenue impact of prior quarter asset outflows.  But because the performance is actually strong and strengthening, the asset outflows have decreased.  So we've got a couple, one more quarter to go to get through to the full year impact of this, but the bulk of the company is in great shape.  Investment performance is strong and getting stronger.  So, you'll see the financial impact for another quarter, but the asset impact is largely done.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And on security servicing, if I strip out the set lending, if you look at the linked quarter three comparisons, they were just a tad down.  Can you talk a little bit about how much &#x2013; I recognize this is not for Ron but whether it's for Gerald or Tim or Jim, how much of that is market related versus what is going on in terms of business flows, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; this is Jim, Vivek.  Your question was it securities lending or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Service and securities lending.  <mark type="inaudible" /> securities lending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, yes.  You're right.  It was an offset of converting in 588 billion of new assets in the second quarter.  Excuse me, year to date.  And that was offset by the market value of the client.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and as, so as we look out over the next &#x2013; sort of the second half on security servicing, based on what you're seeing in terms of new business flows, how should we think about what the outlook looks for that?</p>

          <p>Well, as we talked about the pipelines and Tim mentioned the substantial win rate we've had where we've won one trillion of new assets year-to-date and as I've said, we've converted in the first half of the year 588 billion, so you can see that.  Not only from prior quarters but just this year there's some assets to be converted.  So we would expect that to flow through on the trust fee and related line items such as foreign exchange and securities lining as well as increased deposits on the NIR side.</p>

          <p>Hi, Vivek, it's Ron O'Hanley again.  I should just add something on your assets, your long-term asset questions.  Half of what is in the second quarter for long-term net outflows actually relates to one client.  It was an accountant done as an accommodation to a client.  It was less than a basis point and fortunately for us the client has restructured the portfolio.  So to put that number in context there, half of it is just a very unusual assignment that we're happy to not be part of any more.  And in fact, the restructuring over time is going to benefit us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, just a couple of questions on the merger update again.  You've given us some good updates at the Analyst Meeting and I was just wondering the revenue synergies you really just kind of list that on an annual basis?  I'm wondering if you could touch on A, how that has built up in the numbers already and how it intends to and then second, 13 million more of expense synergies this quarter still puts you already on a run rate ahead of your annual target for this year.  So I'm just wondering if you can also remind us about the next major integrations as far as when we should start to see some of those chunkier cost savings come through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  On the revenue side, we're tracking it pretty closely and regularly. And why don't I have Gerald talk to that a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I think a good example on the revenue synergy side would be in an area like foreign exchange where the combined book continues to perform very well.  And I would suggest we may be out-performing our peers in some of this category because of the revenue synergies associated with combining the books.  And that's a great example where we're pulling through, it's just showing up in existing revenues how those synergies are coming together.  Some of the other revenue synergies are around the asset gathering capabilities, some of which are showing up in Pershing's numbers, some of which are showing up in asset management's numbers.  So we are tracking it, we're on or ahead of schedule of what we updated you on in the investor conference and feel very good about the continued opportunities going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Todd or Steve or Don, any thoughts on the expense side or on upcoming events?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Steve Elliott.  We do have two-key events happening here in the second half of the year over Labor Day weekend.  We have the private wealth accounting and custody conversions coming into play for the legacy BNY clients.  And then over the Columbus Day weekend, we've got a major data center conversion from Pittsburgh to our other primary data site.  Each one of those obviously has synergies associated with it that you don't see in the run rate, plus, remember, the major conversions that we just did over July 1st with respect to getting the banks together you'll see the follow-on impact of our expense synergies there.  So we're tracking right along and this is kind of a steady march if you will, as we look into the balance of this year as well as through 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ken, I think overall we continue to be confident in the expense synergies that we upped at the investor conference and it will continue to meet those numbers as we presented them to you.  So we're right on track and I think you're implying should we raise them again and I think we've already indicated a very nice raise in those expense synergies and we're right on track with them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  As a second question, if we pull back to a bigger picture company perspective, a good revenue quarter but with a disappointing expense <mark type="inaudible" />.  You've talked to the concept of Asset Servicing over earning and Asset Management under earning, but relative to peers you kind of come in line with the expectations and some of the other peers have beaten with forward estimates moving more upward.  Can you talk just talk to &#x2013; give us some perspective on any thoughts to both the revenue lines all aligning the right way, vis-a-vis the expenses as far as that kind of built in hedge which you have in the model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start on that.  It's a good question; we're a lot bigger than our peers.  We have a lot more business lines than our peers. And when you look at us, we're a more complex play.  The advantage of us is we are a lot more diversified and therefore in stressful periods we're more stable.  The downside is we're a little harder to understand because we have more business lines.</p>
          <p>I was pretty encouraged to see what we've seen here is that Asset Servicing is continuing to probably over-perform versus what we would have expected a year ago.  Market stress has been attractive to us in a number of places, particularly in Asset Servicing, although it's been a hit in the asset management business and that business has slowed down from that perspective and it's not unlike most of the Asset Management players around.  At some point, people are going to get pretty tired of keeping assets in really short, low risk type products and duration has to extend here at some point.  It's just hard to predict when it's going to occur but our expectation is it will.</p>
          <p>And if you look at Corporate Trust, it's been, it's &#x2013; we signaled certainly in the second half of last year that the U.S. operation was slowing down.  But it's been great to see how international operations have been terrific.  DRs have been extremely impressive around the world and our Treasury Services and Clearing businesses have been pretty good as well.</p>
          <p>So really, from my perspective, the only issue at this point is the market reality and Asset Management.  That's kind of a major issue and there's nothing we can do about that even though we're in alpha play versus an index play, we're still correlated to market levels.  Certainly when you look at the U.S. equities versus historic norms, global markets are a lot more attractive today than they were pretty short time ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Ken on the expense side, I think, as Todd said in his comments, we had a number of expenses in the second quarter that we do not expect to reoccur in the third quarter.  So, none of us want to call them one-timers.  They are issues that we simply just have to deal with but we do not expect them to reoccur in the third quarter or into the future.  So we are very, very attentive to the expense line as well to get that positive operating leverage that we articulated to you in the past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, our next question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon with Sandler O'Neill.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I've noticed over the last several quarters since the closing of the merger, head count has been steadily rising. I think it's up above 7% since the closing of the merger, and total number of employees in the second quarter were up by another 500.  When do you think we'll start to see some of the synergies from the merger and can you give us a sense where we should look for that head count number to trend over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mark. I'll take it; it's Todd Gibbons. We &#x2013; almost all of the head count increases that you're seeing are really related to growth in our Asset Servicing businesses and I'll let Jim and Tim speak to that in a moment.  But we are on track to manage to the numbers that we've given to you.  So I think any growth that you're seeing is just the growth in the underlying businesses. And I don't know, Jim or Tim, if you want to add something to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Todd, it's Tim here.  You know one of the things you just have to remember is you're also seeing the growth in head count due to the acquisition of the ABN AMRO Mellon joint venture. And Jim and I both talked about the very strong new business momentum we have.  Just as a reminder, it's not uncommon to see some of these expenses in advance of the new business conversions because we have been winning business so steadily and I just remind you that we're still to convert almost 500 billion in assets.  So, I think you're seeing some of that playing out in the head count numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then secondly, maybe for you as well Tim, are you hearing from clients that they're concerned at all about this Russian litigation?  Is it having any impact on your ability to generate new business?  Are people concerned about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'll be honest, in terms of new business, it's never come up. Not an issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clients are very supportive of us, including in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And by the way just on the head count side as well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, Ronald O'Hanley &#x2013; the other thing that's in that head count number is Brazil.  Two things in Brazil, one was the ARX acquisition and second we have taken out a very large outsourcing deal down there which has brought on some administrative and clerical people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other just kind of thing I was saying to Mark is we continue to shift people to different locations that either have lower costs or a better operating environment.  For example, in Pittsburgh, the staffing is way up in Pittsburgh. And &#x2013; but what it means is as you're shifting resources and shifting activities, you tend to have double staffing for a while. And I think there's a real impact that way.  So, I wouldn't worry about it because in the end what you're going to end up with is better client service and lower overall cost base and lower turnover of people.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, is the Mellon First business, you know, divestiture or sale reflected in the employee numbers for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably would be, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, is there any plans to raise capital barring the need &#x2013; you know, if you did an acquisition or something, would you contemplate raising some additional equity if the opportunity presented itself?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be pretty clear, I think.  I'm glad you asked it actually because I know Steve Lackey gets the question pretty regularly.  If you look at our numbers, you know, our generation of capital even with the $150 million of the security losses in it, on a pre-tax basis it -pull aside the SILOs because that was a one-time thing &#x2013; you know, our pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion during the quarter and that's why we're increasing our capital ratios.  We feel pretty comfortable increasing our capital ratios 25 basis points a quarter.  Our Tier 1 is extraordinarily strong, and our 444 on our total capital ratio, it's stronger than a lot of banks in America.  And we have a much, much higher quality balance sheet.</p>
          <p>So one of the interesting questions is what do we do with that capital?  You know, we are seeing a few isolated examples at this point of the few things we might be able to acquire.  But frankly, they're not that big.  So we continue to stay very focused on our global growth strategy, and getting the merger integration done.  There might be a few things we can pick up here and there that will involve some small hits to our capital account.  But in the end, we are very confident that we are very well capitalized and that capital account should continue to drift northward.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, just &#x2013; if you would just remind us about your plans for the expansion of the &#x2013; I guess you call it PFS business or wealth management or private banking?  Could you just refresh us on sort of on office expansion plans, etcetera?  And I'm hopeful that the plans to expand this business are sort of not falling prey to the needs to reduce expenses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's an investment business for us, and maybe Dave can update you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi Nancy, this is David.  No, we do continue to expand.  We opened, I think as we mentioned, a Tampa location here in the last couple of months, and we're looking at a couple of others in terms of new locations.  We've also added I think about 50 client-facing people here since the beginning of the year.  Most of those are either in sales or the banking side.  They do include a couple of lift outs where we've had unique opportunities in different parts of the country.</p>
          <p>Today, we're at 106 salespeople.  We've stated that goal to try to get that up to about 120 by the end of the year.  I think we're on pretty good track to do that.  That compares against the number that's probably in the high 80s here 12 months ago or so.  So the answer is &#x2013; the short answer is we continue to invest both in people and then selectively in locations as we see them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see any new opportunities for locations because of some of the things are going on in the industry right now?  I mean, we're hearing that there is a lot of business, a lot of substantial business coming out of some of the "troubled" entities in the industry right now, and some of those in the southeast.  Have you thought about expanding your presence in the southeast as a result of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is one of the locations where you would probably see an inordinate amount of the growth that I already talked about is in the high demographical growth areas.  Some of those do have troubled competitors.  But the long-term demographics are great.  So, if you look at the west coast, you look at the southeast part of the country, and then here in New York City, as that would be probably the three areas I'd say that are getting a disproportionate amount of the growth.</p>
          <p>And you're right &#x2013; there is a sort of moving marketplace right now as was the earlier question.  So you don't necessarily need to add locations to take advantage of that.  We will look at locations where it makes sense, but probably more importantly and more accretive right away is to add talented people.</p>

          <p>Less than 5%, okay, great.  And on the &#x2013; just a question for Ron on the long-term asset flows, I know you mentioned there was one client that led to the outflows.  Can you about the inflow side of the business? Where are you seeing net new business mostly within your long-term managers and how do you see the trend over the next couple of quarters there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the net new &#x2013; there clearly is just a lot of cash continuing.  We made a lot of short duration business and that's &#x2013; some of that is investor behavior although that actually stumbled a bit in the second quarter.  What we're enjoying really is just more share from the various Bank of New York Mellon channels, which really is a result of the merger.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the non-U.S. business continues to grow very rapidly for us.  We finished the quarter with revenues derived from non-U.S. clients up to 42% of our revenues.  That's up from 39 in the first quarter and 34 same quarter last year.  So those areas we would expect to see continuing into the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, global equity and international equity; we are just very well positioned there.  We've got a very strong product suite there.  And as equity markets recover, I think that's what we'll recover first.  More and more investors are taking less of a U.S., non-U.S., or even a kind of small cap, mid cap, large cap, and much more of a global equity view and we've got a whole suite of very strong performing products there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great.  And then just lastly, just on the Russia &#x2013; just on the conference call last night, I think the plaintiff said that for a settlement, you'd have to go through him and or &#x2013; is that true?  Or can you go directly to the Russian government for a settlement?</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and thanks for your patience; hard to believe there's too many more questions.  And I do apologize, I did have to step off briefly earlier, so you may have gone over this, but can you talk about the interest margin?  I guess it's concerning how I think it tends to run &#x2013; try to run a neutral book.  It kind of jumped a little bit more than I would have expected.  And maybe just update us on your expectations there and maybe along with that your kind of rate assumptions built into that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Rob.  A couple of things.  Number one, it's largely &#x2013; the margin is being driven largely by the higher spreads on the investment portfolio.  So that's the number one driver.  Number two, even in the money markets, and you see that a fair amount of our interest-earning assets our money market instruments, they've done better even though the Fed has eased.  So we're getting a little wider spreads on the assets that we've got, despite a little bit of a loss of free deposits.  So that's largely what's driving the margin.</p>
          <p>I should make a comment that SILOs will have a &#x2013; in the rerun of the SILOs will have a slightly negative impact to the margin over the next few quarters.  So we would think &#x2013; we don't see it coming down dramatically, but we would expect it to come down from the current high run rate.</p>

      <speaker id="23" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  And maybe just one quick follow up.  And I think you probably touched on this in some other comments, but granted that the securities lending revenue was up pretty nicely year-over-year, could you maybe just remind us why relative to maybe some of your competitors, you tend not to have as much seasonality in Q2?  I mean how your &#x2013; that business differs a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll make a comment and then Tim or Jim, if you want to jump in?  We are the largest lender of treasury securities in the world and treasuries are driven by the spread.  So if they're in tight demand as they were in the first quarter, the spreads were what we could earn on lending those securities were very wide.</p>
          <p>It more normalized in the second quarter.  And the second quarter tends to be seasonal around equities, in the lending of equities and I would say on a relative basis, some of our competitors, as a percentage, have more equities than they do treasuries.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hey Bob, how are you?</p>

          <p>Hey, Gerard.  Good.  Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="24" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question.  Maybe this could be directed toward Todd, possibly.  But if we move into an environment of higher inflation that was talked about this week by the Feds, how do you guys see that impacting your net interest margin?  But also maybe just your business in general since this last 20 or so years has been a disinflationary environment and we may now be heading back into an inflationary environment that we last saw in the 1980s?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I take the net interest side of that.  We actually as we model out our various scenarios for interest rate and interest-rate risk, we're pretty well hedged out a year or so, so we don't see too much interest sensitivity.  But if interest rates were to stay down here at these very low levels, it compresses very much what we can do on the liabilities.</p>
          <p>In other words, we can't earn any more on the liabilities when you got a one or two percent whole rate, or especially on free liabilities; on free deposits.  So we would see &#x2013; we would welcome, frankly, a rising &#x2013; rising interest rates over the next year or two.</p>
