          <p>Thank you, Doug. Good morning and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Teva's fourth quarter and full year 2007 earnings call. We hope you've had a chance to review our press release, which we issued earlier this morning. A copy of the press release is available on our website at www.tevapharm.com. Additionally, we are conducting a live webcast of this call that is also available on our website.</p>
          <p>Today, we are joined by Shlomo Yanai, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dan Suesskind, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Marth, President and CEO of Teva North America; and Moshe Manor, Group Vice President in Global Innovative Resources.</p>
          <p>Shlomo and Dan will begin by providing an overview of our results. We will then open the call for question-and-answer period. Before we proceed with the call, I'd like to remind everyone that the safe harbor language contained in today's press release also pertains to this conference call and webcast. Shlomo?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Elana. Welcome everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review Teva's results for the fourth quarter and full year 2007.</p>
          <p>2007 was an outstanding year for Teva, the year in which we further fortified our market leadership in key markets, grew our businesses and achieved record breaking results, including net sales of $9.4 billion and net income of $1.95 billion. I believe that these results represent a truly extraordinary accomplishment.</p>
          <p>As you will recall, our unprecedented growth in 2006 meant that we faced extremely challenging comparisons going into 2007. Our ability to meet these challenges, to surpass our performance in 2006 and exceed our own internal targets, demonstrates Teva's unique strength and capabilities and the robustness of our balanced business model. Indeed, our results in 2007 were driven by exceptional performances across our many geographies and businesses. I would like to share with you just a few of the year's highlights, then we'll provide more detail as well as a review of the quarter later in the call.</p>
          <p>Let's begin with North America.  Teva USA broke all previous sales records in 2007, a remarkable achievement given the extraordinary year we had in the U.S. in 2006. We launched 28 generic products, which had annual brand sales of $11.2 billion. Demand for our products remained high throughout 2007 as Teva USA increased its leadership position among all pharmaceutical companies, capturing over 12% of all prescriptions filled in the U.S., and 20% of all generics prescriptions.</p>
          <p>Our pipeline in the U.S. is extremely robust with an unprecedented 160 abbreviated new drug applications before the FDA, representing $101 billion in annual branded sales. Approximately 60% of the files have a Paragraph IV certification.</p>
          <p>The most significant event of the fourth quarter was of course our major launch of Pantoprazole, the generic version of Protonix. I believe that this launch exemplifies Teva's competitive advantages, including the strength of our global supply chain and the exceptional capabilities of our R&amp;D, legal operations and marketing teams.</p>
          <p>In only five weeks time, our generic Pantoprazole captured 68% of all new Pantoprazole prescriptions. I'd like to emphasize that our decision not to re-launch is based on strictly commercial considerations. As to the legal proceedings on this matter, we are very confident in our case.</p>
          <p>In 2007, European business enjoyed impressive growth of 21%, and with record breaking sales of $2.2 billion, Europe is a very significant part of our business. In 2007, we strengthened our leadership in the U.K., Italy and the Netherlands and made very good progress in improving our market position in France, Germany and Spain. Our businesses in Europe is already quite substantial and our presence in this critical region continue to grow.</p>
          <p>2007 was also an excellent year for our international business, where sales grew 19% over the last year driven by especially good results in Central and Eastern Europe as well as other parts of the world including Latin America where results were strong.</p>
          <p>Turning to our global respiratory business, the trend of converting from CFC to HFA-based inhalers especially in the U.S. and the U.K. drove sale higher in 2007. ProAir maintained its number one position in the albuterol HFA market in the U.S. with 60% market share. We are especially encouraged to see that the conversion rate in the U.S. has begun to pick up steam again with HFA inhalers today representing 60% of the albuterol market. We are now focused on the remaining 40%, which will convert by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Finally, this was an outstanding year for Copaxone, which enjoyed record breaking global in-market sales of $1.7 billion with growth of 21%. In the U.S., the world's largest MS market, in 2007, Copaxone became the market leader in terms of both unit and net sales, passing the $1 billion mark for the first time. Outside the U.S., we continue to grow our share and we expect that in 2008, Copaxone will also become the global leader.</p>
          <p>We are looking forward to sharing much more information about all the businesses I have reviewed today at our Investors Day on February 21st in New York City.</p>
          <p>I was delighted last month to announce our agreement to acquire CoGenesys. As you know, we have identified biogenerics as the key long-term growth driver for Teva, and this acquisition is a major step towards Teva's becoming a leading player in the evolving biogenerics market. Combining CoGenesys's cutting edge technologies with Teva's expertise in bringing drugs to market will enable us to offer patients high quality, affordable generic products and will position Teva extremely well to capture the tremendous opportunities that we believe lie ahead in biogenerics. We are excited about welcoming the first-rate team at CoGenesys into the Teva family.</p>
          <p>And now I would like to provide our current expectations for 2008 and 2009. In 2008, we expect revenues of around $10.75 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of 2.60 to 2.75. As for 2009, I would like to reiterate last year's guidance of adjusted EPS exceeding $3.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the guidance for 2008 and 2009 is inclusive of an increased R&amp;D spend. In order to support our ambitious long-term growth targets in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets, we have increased the R&amp;D budget as a percentage of total sales by approximately 1.5%. Please also note that this guidance is based on organic growth and does not assume any significant acquisitions. While acquisitions play an important role in our strategy, given their opportunistic nature, we do not incorporate them into our guidance figures.</p>
          <p>We will providing you with more clarity on our strategy targets and goals at our Investor Day. But for now, let me just say we are very optimistic and excited about the next years.</p>
          <p>I would like to make just one more comment before turning the call over to Dan. I believe that in these days of volatility, uncertainty and possible economic downturn, Teva's balanced business model, financial strength and unique position, coupled with the fundamentals and the trends in our industry, provide Teva with exceptional opportunities; opportunities that will, I believe, enable us to build on our momentum and continue our tradition of continuous profitable growth in 2008 and in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you all very much for your attention, and now let's turn to Dan. Dan?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Shlomo and good day to all our friends around the world. I hope you have had the chance to review the excellent quarter and annual figures we released this morning and appreciate your taking the time to join us today. First, let me start by reminding all of you that the comparison between the two quarters and the two years is not an apples-to-apples comparison, because 2006 included adjustments for the IVAX acquisition and IVAX's results were not included for the first months of '06. The fourth quarter of 2006 included a few additional adjusted items, the largest of which was a release of prior year's tax provisions of $120 million. There were no adjustments in 2007.</p>
          <p>We strongly believe that the as adjusted results, which are the results used by management and our Board provide a better indication of Teva's operations and trends. So, my analysis on this call will speak to the as adjusted numbers excluding those items, which are primarily acquisition related. By the way this is one of those years in which the straight U.S. GAAP comparisons are more favorable than the adjusted ones.</p>
          <p>Let me give you a synopsis of our figures. In the fourth quarter of '07, as compared to Q4 '06, sales were up 13% to $2.6 billion, and again compared to the adjusted 2006 figures, net income was up 32% to $570 million and EPS grew up 30% to $0.69.</p>
          <p>Shareholders equity on December 31st, '07 reached $13.7 billion up by $805 million from September 30, '07. We again generated very significant cash from operations amounting to $545 million for the quarter, while free cash flow amounted to $324 million. And as to the annual '07 figures, sales exceeded 9.4 billion up 10% and again compared to the '06 as adjusted figures, net income was up 5% to $1.95 billion and diluted EPS increased 3% to $2.38 per share. Cash flow from operations for the year amounted to $1.4 billion and free cash flow exceeded $1 billion. At year's end, our total cash balances and other liquid assets reached $3.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As all of you are already very familiar with the figures for the first nine months of '07, I would now like to focus primarily on the fourth quarter figures. So let's take a closer look at our quarterly results line by line, beginning with sales. As I mentioned Q4 sales reached close to $2.6 billion, an increase of about $300 million year-over-year and an increase of more than $200 million sequentially.</p>
          <p>Q4 sales benefited approximately 4% from exchange differences due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. On an annual basis, the benefit was just &#x2013; was even lower at just over 3%. But let me already mention at this stage that the exchange differences had practically no affect on our bottom line.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. sales benefited this quarter from 25 new products that were not sold in the comparable quarter of '06, the more significant being the exclusive launch at the end of the fourth quarter of Pantoprazole, as well as the sale of product launched in previous quarter of '07, such as Amlodipine, Famciclovir and in addition there was a significant growth in Oxycodone sales. We stopped selling Oxycodone during January of '08.</p>
          <p>Sales this quarter reached an all time high, climbing even higher than those of Q3 of '06 where we launched or still enjoy exclusivity on simvastatin, sertraline, pravastatin, venlafaxine and both quarters had sales exceeding $1 billion.</p>
          <p>Pharmaceutical sales in Western Europe including Hungary grew 17% to an all time high of $601 million representing 25% of global pharmaceutical sales. In European generics, we were basically flat in euro terms, mainly due to a decrease in sales of Humantrade, our Hungarian trading subsidiary, which was offset by nice growth in France, Italy and Spain. In dollar terms, we grew about 13% and for the first time exceeded the $500 million mark.</p>
          <p>International sales by which we mean sales outside of the U.S., Canada and Western Europe, these sales grew at a significantly higher rate than the group average, mainly due to the acceleration in sales from our businesses in Central Europe. Our Latin American business showed strong performance with the exception of Mexico. In Mexico our business suffered from problems primarily related to the integration of our historic Teva and IVAX operations, but we feel that Mexico is now back on track.</p>
          <p>Global in-market sales of Copaxone amounted to $436 million. This is a 15% increase over the comparable quarter. Sales in the U.S., a much more mature market, increased 13% to $269 million; and non-U.S. sales, mainly Europe and Canada, increased 19% to $166 million. Non-U.S. sales of Copaxone now account for 38 % of total global in-market sales.</p>
          <p>In Q2 of '08, Teva expects to take over the significant responsibilities for Copaxone in the U.S. and Canada from sanofi-aventis. According to our existing agreement &#x2013; and as we cannot estimate the total amount today &#x2013; starting in Q2 '08 and continuing for two years, we will book 100% of in-market sales in the U.S. and Canada, less a payment to sanofi-aventis of 25% of sales. So we will effectively record 75% of in-market sales compared with somewhat over 50% of in-market sales that we book today.</p>
          <p>At the same time, Teva's SG&amp;A will increase by roughly the same amount as sanofi-aventis will cease to participate in Teva Neuroscience marketing expenses. Although the exercise of this contractual option will thus increase Teva's net sales, the more or less parallel increase in SG&amp;A will have a minimal impact on the bottom line until the second quarter of 2010. After that, the additional increase in sales when we cease the 25% payment to sanofi-aventis will flow all the way to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>However, as we have continuously stated, what I have just described is the agreement in place today. As sanofi-aventis and we are still negotiating for a possible change in the terms, there is no assurance that this will be the final arrangement. However, as you may rightly assume, a change will only be agreed upon if it turns out to be beneficial for both sides. The agreement with sanofi-aventis will follow essentially the same pattern starting mainly as of February 2012, but in exchange for a significantly lower residual payment stream.</p>
          <p>Once again in this quarter our global respiratory product business, which is included in the North American and European sales figures as I have just mentioned, performed very well with sales of $189 million. This represents an 18% increase in sales over Q4 of '06. On an annual basis, the global respiratory business reached sales of $742 million, up almost 50%.</p>
          <p>And next as to Teva API business. This quarter, total API sales amounted to $463 million, up 65%. This includes internal API sales totaling $323 million, an increase of 150% over the comparable quarter of '06, and $140 million of sales from third parties, a decrease of 8%. Volume wise, API sales actually increased by 7%. A breakdown between the third party sales and internal sales reflects the periodic shifts in opportunities of Teva Pharmaceutical's businesses and those of third party clients of Teva's API business.</p>
          <p>Stepping down one line in the P&amp;L to gross profits. Gross profit margin reached 52.3% in this reported quarter, essentially no change from the past two quarters, but substantially higher than the gross margin in the comparable quarter and the first quarter of '07. The last time we updated our guidance to you regarding our normative gross profit margin was in Q3 of 2006, when we increased this from a range of 45 to 48% to a range of 57 to 50. Since then, we have had two quarters with gross margins within the band and three quarters where the gross profit margin exceeded the band. I will relate to that later in the guidance section.</p>
          <p>And from gross margin to R&amp;D. Net R&amp;D increased this quarter by 23% compared to the previous quarter's $268 million. This record number represents the importance that Teva is giving to its R&amp;D activities and demonstrates the combined R&amp;D efforts on generic, branded and API.</p>
          <p>As Shlomo indicated, it also reflects the strategic increase emphasized on generic R&amp;D coming out of our internal strategic review quarters.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A, which reached $580 million in the quarter, represents 20% of sales compared with 21 in Q4 of last year. On an annual basis, SG&amp;A as a percent of sales increased in 2007 to 20.2% from 18.7% in '06. To a large extent, this increase in '07 reflects higher cost levels due to the increased sales of branded products and due to the operations in many branded generic markets with a typically higher gross margin, but correspondingly substantially higher selling and marketing expenditures. In addition, Teva's successful introduction of Azilect in the U.S. and non-U.S. markets generated higher sales and marketing costs per dollar.</p>
          <p>Furthermore in '07, SG&amp;A figures included substantially higher amounts reflecting profit splits with third parties in connection with settlement reach. Operating profit this quarter amounted to $661 million or 25.7% of sales, substantially higher than in the comparable quarter but in line with the past two quarters <mark type="audio gap" />. It was also in line with the 2007 annual margin of 25.5%.</p>
          <p>As to financial expenses, we recorded $3 million of financial expenses in the reported quarter compared with a quarterly average of $10 million throughout '07. This deserves some elaboration. Our normal or usual interest expense in a quarter is about $47 million, the majority of which is service of our $5.3 billion of long and short-term debt. Net of income on our &#x2013; net of income on our invested cash and other liquid assets, this would result in a net interest expense of $10 million, but there are substantial swings in the financial expenses line item, since it includes not only the above-mentioned net interest expense which is fairly predictable but also the results of hedging activities, which in this quarter as in the comparable quarter reduced financial expense. Again, we will address our normalized forecast for financial expenses going forward in our February 21 investors meeting.</p>
          <p>As for the provision for income tax, the provision this quarter amounted to $84 million or 13% of pre-tax income, a rate similar to that of the comparable quarter. In both quarters, the tax rate was lower than the annual one and actually represented the last quarter's reconciliation of the annual tax to the best estimate made in Q3 of the effective years. This year, this reconciliation brought the annual tax rate to 17% compared with last year's 15%. By the way, our U.S. GAAP tax for the comparable quarter last year actually showed an income of $78 million. This included a credit with a provision for taxes for $141 million mainly due to closure of settlements with tax authorities and expiration of tax statute of limitations in various jurisdictions.</p>
          <p>All that leads to a net income of $570 million, up 30% from last year. EPS based on this income to which about $6 million were added back to, related to our converts works out at $0.69 per share.</p>
          <p>And from EPS to cash flow.  As mentioned, our free cash flow &#x2013; free cash flow, after CapEx and dividends in '07, exceeded $1 billion, 324 million of which was generated in the fourth quarter. 152 million of the annual cash flow was used in the first quarter of this year for our share repurchase plan, since then we have not repurchased any securities and at year's end we still have an unused authorization of approximately $210 million. Our working capital increased sequentially by $570 million and at year's end amounted to $4.5 billion compared to 3.6 billion at the end of '06.</p>
          <p>And now let's move to some working capital items; and first DSO, days sales outstanding; these amounted to 30 to 63 days this quarter compared to 58 days in the Q4 of '06 and 61 days at the end of Q3 of '07. This mainly reflects the end of the quarter launch of Pantoprazole, which increased the rate of the last months of the quarter sales. We have calculated the DSOs after netting out from the receivables, the sales reserve &#x2013; reserve and allowances, the so called SR&amp;A.</p>
          <p>To remind you, we record receivables on a gross basis and record the SR&amp;A on the current liabilities, but in order to facilitate a more meaningful comparison with some of our peers, our record receivables &#x2013; we record receivables net of these reserves, we have used the net figure.</p>
          <p>Total SR&amp;A at December 31, '07 amounted to $1.7 billion, an increase of $100 million from September '07. About 90% of the total reserves are from the U.S., up $166 million from September, most notably due to reserves for charges.</p>
          <p>Inventories were up 142 million for September 30th, reflecting both our efforts to improve customer service levels and the impact of exchange differences. In terms of days sales, they actually decreased from 181 days to 176 days. This quarter CapEx amounted to $148 million bringing the total for the year to $501 million net, an increase of 14% from Q4 of '06.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we mainly invested in increasing our production capacity worldwide to face future challenges and capture future opportunities. As to our debts $3.3 billion or 65% of our total interest bearing debt at December 31st is long-term of which 1.4 billion is convert and 1.9 billion in straight, fixed or floating interest debt. Our leverage measured as debt to debt plus equity at December 31, '07 stood at 0.27, compared to 0.29 in September 30th, and 0.32 at the end of '06.</p>
          <p>Shareholders equity as December 31, '07 reached $13.7 billion. It should be noted that of the year-over-year increase of $2.6 billion in equity, 741 million represented the increase in our net assets due to the depreciation of the U.S. dollar. For the quarter, this increase of shareholders equity amounted to $805 million of which $246 million was due to the effect of currencies. This increase is net of a $50 million temporary adjustment to the value of failed auction rate securities charged to the equity. This ARS represent about 10% of our $3.3 billion financial investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>For the convenience of our audience, I would again like to mention three figures relating to our share count, so that we are all on the same page. For the fourth quarter of '07, our average share count for the purpose of calculating free diluted EPS was 834 million shares, while at the end of the year, our share count for calculating this EPS going forward is approximately 837 million shares and for calculating our market cap, it is approximately 775 million shares.</p>
          <p>As to dividends, yesterday, the Board approved an increased fourth quarter dividend amounting to approximately $100 million. On a per share basis, our dividend was increased from 0.4 shekels per share to 0.45 shekels. Based on the current rate of exchange of the shekel to the dollar, this translates into 12.4 cents per share, up from the third quarter dividend of $0.10 per share for Q3.</p>
          <p>And finally, as to the guidance, Shlomo gave you an outlook as we see today following the three-year guidance I gave a year ago. We obviously have more clarity today for '08 which is already underway than we had at the time we gave the guidance, and we are in a position to increase the numbers from those we indicated last February, both at the top line to achieve sales of around $10.75 billion and bottom line where we expect to be in the range of 2.60 to $2.75 per share. This increase in guidance is made even after taking into account the fact following our strategic review we now plan to allocate significantly more resources to R&amp;D than we originally contemplated in our three-year plan.</p>
          <p>I would like to add here that we expect the year to unfold as a relative back-end loaded one. So, additionally in this &#x2013; and in line both with our practice and our understanding of market best practices, I would have closed my guidance remarks at this point. However, since we included reference to '09 in our guidance to you last year, we felt that we should address it again.</p>
          <p>So as Shlomo indicated, we are reiterating what we have said a year ago that EPS for '09 should exceed $3 per share. Plus we are now confident enough to reiterate it in spite of our strategy to significantly increase R&amp;D spending.</p>
          <p>In this connection, I would like to mention that we are raising now our forecast of the normative band of gross profit margin to a range of 49 to 52%, from where we were until today, 47 to 50. As Shlomo has mentioned, this guidance does not take into account any major acquisitions and I would like to add to this that it relates obviously to non-U.S. GAAP figures, and let me give you an obvious example. Last month we announced our agreement to acquire CoGenesys. The expected write-off of acquired in-process R&amp;D relating to the transaction is not included in the guidance we have given to you today.</p>
          <p>One more remark I would like to make relates to our balanced business model. Too often people focus a bit too much on our U.S. generic business when they try to foresee our future. U.S. generics are no doubt our major business, but there is so much more at Teva even in the U.S. itself like the respiratory business and Copaxone. During our Investor's Day on February 21st, we will highlight the geographies outside the U.S. where some of Teva's major growth engines are apparently not visible enough like Europe, CEE and Latin America.</p>
          <p>I would like to reiterate once again, as I have done so often during the past year that as of next year, we will once again limit ourself to giving you guidance only for the current year as we have done for many years and no longer looking out to an additional year.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for the time and attention today.</p>
          <p>Now, we will be glad to take your questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Guys. Just a question, maybe for Bill Marth if he is on the line. I know, partnership agreements are something that we really can't model for, but certainly have become increasingly important over the years, Allegra, Wellbutrin XL as examples, is this something that you are now actively pursuing or are partners finding you? Is it something that we should consider as being core to the business going forward or something that we should just think of as kind of nice benefits when they occur?</p>

          <p>Hey Ken, it's Bill Marth. I am here and I'll take that call, that question. I appreciate the question and good morning. With respect to partnerships, they've really been always part of our business and we view them a bit on the opportunistic side, but from our perspective we will do them as often as we can and they, you know, they continue to be a part of our plan as we move forward.</p>

          <p>Hey Dan, question for you just on the tax rate and SG&amp;A, can you give us a sense of what would be a sustainable tax rate in the coming year? And on SG&amp;A, was there anything in the quarter that was aberrant or is this kind of a level that you would expect also on a go forward basis?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that the best guesstimate for our tax going forward would around 17%. Relating to SG&amp;A, I would say that it should, go forward should be somewhat lower than we had in this quarter, but not too much. But you can take it as a fair indication of the future.</p>

          <p>Great. Thanks a lot and, Bill, congratulations on the appointment this morning. Just a question on how, or actually a follow-up on Ken's question actually. Viewed theoretically, would you guys partner with a company outside of another generic manufacturer in terms of indemnifying risk for a potential at-risk launch? And, Bill, maybe can you just expand on how you guys are currently thinking about your at-risk capacity in general right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Randall, and thanks for the congratulations. With respect to providing indemnification, from time to time, I really can't speak about specific deals, but from time to time that is part of a deal we may do. The, it's really difficult to provide a whole lot of clarity on these deals, you know, until they present themselves. So, we are really kind of in the realm of, right now in the realm of the maybes, and so I really can't give you any more detail than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it fair to say though that if an opportunity to partner with a company outside of the generic business, perhaps, a supply chain or otherwise type of a company, would that be something that you guys would look at?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'd look at, Randall, I think, I'd have to say we look at everything, and you know, and again, getting back to the risk portion, we look at risk in an accumulated fashion. We are a very careful and cautious company. We do our due diligence on all of these at-risk launches before we proceed with them. There's a very rigorous process in which we take it to our board, and when we bring it to our board, we do present to the board the accumulated risks that is, that we have in front of us. So I think we do a very careful analysis, and a good job when we look at that. But yes, the answer to your question would be, we would look at almost all opportunities.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good afternoon or good morning. I'll throw my congratulations in there as well, Bill. I guess, we will be able to give you credit for finally getting generic biologics across the goal line eventually. My question is for Shlomo. I guess, specifically with respect to your outlook for the increased R&amp;D spend, roughly a 150 basis point increase in terms of percentage of sales. I mean, with respect to traditional generics, I mean, it would seem that, you know, the company is pretty well maxed out in terms of spending there and the opportunity set so it's hard to imagine where that amount of R&amp;D spend increase could be allocated. So maybe could you just talk about where the bulk of that increase is expected to be directed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, yes, it is a substantial increase, but I see it more as an investment for our future and our long-term ambitious goals that as I said we are going to elaborate more on that on our next week Investors Day. Having said that, what I can tell you is that this is a definitely a substantial amount of spend that we would dedicate to, mostly to our generic R&amp;D in order to actually almost doubling our R&amp;D activities in order to make us a substantial player in capturing the growth that we believe is in front of us in the coming years.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, can you give us an idea of some of the exciting Paragraph IV opportunities that could hit this year? And Dan, I just want to make sure I understand this change in R&amp;D, you used to talk about it around 6% and now it's 7.5, so we should take up the percent of sales by 150 basis points starting in '08 and then going forward. And so, is that like an extra $150 million or $0.15 that you are spending extra, just to make sure I understand it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marc, let me start first by answering your question directly. As you know of course we just launched alendronate, that went out on the 6th. Coming up though we also have bupropion XL 150 milligram and we anticipate that somewhere around the second quarter. As well as lamotrigine that will be an exclusive license that we have and that is in the third quarter that will be around July 22nd. And as well as we, we are also looking at just some challenges right now that we have in front of us, obviously the lansoprazole case has been heard and we hope for positive decision there. As well as we've got a PI coming up on donepezil which we find very interesting. Also, our appeal has been heard on rabeprazole and I think the last product we would mention of course that we haven't said a lot but is out there is the quetiapine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to your question, Marc, regarding the R&amp;D, you basically got it right. Obviously, you cannot make such an increase overnight. We started already in Q4 and you saw that the Q4 figures were already about our, above our recent norm. We are shooting at 7.5% of sales and that will be done gradually over '08, but as fast as we can. So, I think, I don't expect it to be 7.5% on the average for '08, but to be more than we have seen last year, which was 6.2.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning, I have a two-part question, first for Dan, how much generic Protonix and Oxycodone revenue did you recognize in the fourth quarter? And for Bill, on Protonix, can you confirm whether Sun and/or Wyeth have stopped shipping their generics? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Let me start, Bill, in sequence. As you know, Greg, we never give out figures on specific products but on Copaxone and Azilect which are innovative products not on generics, what we have said is that the majority of the quantity will be booked in '08 and this I can reiterate now, but the breakdown of sales between the two years or between Q4 and in 2008, we are unfortunately not giving out.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Greg. Just to follow up on the Protonix, as you know, we shipped on the 21st, and haven't shipped since that point and I'm not, frankly, from my perspective, I have not heard much about what's going on in the market. It's been fairly quiet. So I think you are going to have to really get, you know, get to those other individuals to find out exactly what they are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple set of questions, Dan, on your initial comments on Protonix you said that the reason you haven't reshipped is due to commercial consideration, that you feel uncomfortable with the legal. Can you just give us color as to what does commercial really mean, does that mean that there is just enough product in the channel right now? And our second question is around pricing, you know, from what we are hearing, pricing for Fosamax has just come down significantly since the launch last week. Firstly, if the magnitude of decline is surprising you or were you expecting it and then if you can just comment generally on the pricing environment for the old book of business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Ricky, this is Bill Marth. Good morning. I think I got most of it on, the early part on the Protonix, I missed a part of it, could you do that again...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think the question on Protonix, in the prepared remarks, I think you said that the reason you did not go back to the market is really due to commercial considerations. Do you think it's &#x2013; can you just give us color as to what does commercial consideration mean, is it a reflection of the fact that there is just a lot of product right now in the marketplace from the initial launch or is it related to something else like just pricing or any other consideration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Ricky, I think we were pretty clear on what we did. Now, once again, you know, we launched on December 21st, that was the only time we shipped. We entered into the 30-day standstill, after that we did about a 10-day extension. And then prior, you know, when we were bound by the extension, Wyeth launched and then we had to make a decision at that point in time. We looked at the situation and realized that, again, if you think about what we have said before, it was a relatively full launch, though to a narrow band of customers, though we're very happy with the share we have, which is in our last reporting about 67% of the TRxs, so we are pretty pleased with that.</p>
          <p>Our customers have adequate inventory and so when we look at this opportunity moving forward and I balance that against the other opportunities that I spoke about earlier, as I look at the combined aggregated risk as I look at opportunities, pravastatin $3.5 billion, donepezil also well over $1 billion. There are other opportunities for us to go after and we are a very careful cautious company and we look at accumulated risk, so this is something that went into the factors for us right now. So we are, at this point in time, we are not shipping and we don't see, I don't see that changing at the moment. Your second question, I think, was about the alendronate pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, and also just pricing in general for the old book of business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the second one first, we have had no notable change on pricing in the fourth quarter. As you know, we've been, or as we've said before, the last 18 months or so, the pricing has been very stable and at this point in time, there is really no notable change nothing really to talk about. With respect to alendronate pricing, you know, it was a three-player exclusive market so it was within the range that we had anticipated. So I didn't see it anything out of the ordinary.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I was just wondering if you could provide any additional context in some of the non-U.S. markets, 17% growth in Europe, 11% growth ex both the U.S. and Europe. These are attractive growth rates but you know, do you compare those to be areas where you are actually gaining share, has there been a price component to any of that growth. Just wondering how currency has impacted each of those regions and you know, how that growth compares to, given the substantial number of product approvals that have come through in those regions over the course of the past 12 months, how we should think about that as we look into 2008? Thanks.</p>

And shipping us for the account, what will, I call multi-focal view on the global opportunities that these very important markets -- regions are representing to us. So you might expect in 2008 that we would enhance our efforts to grow our business there and actually our market share in these countries. Definitely in Europe and in emerging markets so, and to a certain degree in Latin America as well, and we will elaborate more on that on next week Investors Day, so if you would be so kind to wait till this day, we can give you much more detail than I can provide you right now in a more holistic context.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

          <p>Good morning guys and congratulations on the quarter. A couple of questions, the first one...</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I wanted to just follow a little bit on the issue of Copaxone pricing, especially given the recent price <mark type="inaudible" />. How do you guys think about the pricing power you have with Copaxone going forward?  Is it still an area where we could see significant pricing increases? Particularly how do you think about the 40 mg Copaxone, is this something that will be roughly around the same pricing as the 20 mg or is that a more efficacious drug that could command higher pricing? And second question is I don't know if you guys have submitted to the EMEA application for biogeneric round, sometimes early in '07?  Can you just give us an update where that one stands?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, as was mentioned, based on the price increase, Copaxone now is really the cheapest product in the market and definitely, as we don't provide any guidance on the pricing, but we don't see reason that Copaxone will not be positioned in competitive price.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>If I may add on Copaxone, actually one element Tysabri helps us is that they brought into the market the high umbrella, at a much higher price which enables all of us to increase prices probably more than we would have done without Tysabri.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking the question. And I have actually got several but they are all focused on CoGenesys because I don't really think I understand that acquisition. So, can you please speak to the three-year manufacturing agreement that HGSI and CoGenesys have? Can you also speak to the fact that CoGenesys was performing work on two new products at cost plus which I thought was really just a way for Human Genome to put some R&amp;D onto another company. And then also, do you get to keep any of the rights to the albumin fusion technology or any of the genes that were discovered by HGSI and conferred to CoGenesys?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Amir, I'll try to go shortly over here because the scope of CoGenesys and HGSI is not the scope that is a part of what Teva is acquiring. Basically CoGenesys had work done with and for HGSI on two projects, one for Novartis, one for GSK. We have no, I would say, continuation of commercial needed benefit of obligation as we moving to acquiring CoGenesys, so this is mostly an HGSI domain.</p>
          <p>As for the albumin fusion technology, this is totally owned by CoGenesys and we hope that soon it will be owned by Teva, and this is their IP and it moves with the company <mark type="inaudible" /> to Teva soon. As far as the specific product in the, I would say common library of targets between CoGenesys and HGSI, we have a few products that we can select within a certain period after acquisition but we know what we are after and we will have a bank of opportunities that we can own and after that there will be no obligation or commercial link between HGSI and CoGenesys in Teva going forward. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the quarter and to you also Bill on your election to Chairman. First question just has to do with the extra 100 million of R&amp;D that Marc Goodman was asking about. Can you just give a little color on the allocation of that extra 100 million &#x2013; percent going to generics, development of generics versus shared biologics versus branded products?</p>
          <p>Next question has to do with your agreement with UCB, just a rationale for the agreement. Is it because of the competitive environment being &#x2013; increasing or rising in the HFA market and anything around the economics of the agreement. Is it a share gain agreement and how you will account for it?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, let me, let me first refer to the R&amp;D question, and then Bill will follow. I cannot give you details about where we are going to allocate, to what project the additional R&amp;D expenditure or as I call it from my perspective our R&amp;D investment. What I can say right now is that this is a part of our strategy conclusion that we are going to enhance and increase our efforts in order to be more competitive in other parts of the world not only in The United States, but also in Europe and in the emerging markets and definitely in other parts as well. So, all in all in order to be there a substantial player in &#x2013; with a growth strategy, we have to ramp up our R&amp;D capabilities and that's what is beyond this additional 1.5% in our R&amp;D expenditure. Bill?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning John and thank you. I appreciate the congratulations. With respect to UCB, let me start at the beginning. On HFA, we have about, as you know HFA is about 60% of the entire market. So, of the entire what used to be CFC market is now about 60% converted to HFA and remains about 40% CFC.</p>
          <p>Now, we all know that at the end of this year, it is essentially mandated that CFC goes away. Whether it actually goes away on January 1, 2009, yet is a bit unclear but the fact is it goes away. That leaves the opportunity for Teva &#x2013; at the remaining 40% because again 60% of the share is in HFA, our share at the HFA market is roughly 60% so we have got a pretty nice share.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we look at this market and realize the 200 reps that we have are very good where they are positioned today but moving forward there will be a lot of primary care and we'll need that help. The deal with UCB gives us back to approximately 400 more reps to bring our reps force up to about 600ish and that's really the rationale as we close in on this 40% you really have to think about this as a purely branded market and with respect to talking about the financial we really haven't disclosed the financial arrangements with UCB but you might think about it in terms of a pay for performance.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just in terms of growth in Europe and in the international segments of your business, I think you reported 17% and 11% in each of those respectively. If you strip out foreign exchange from each of those markets, each of those segments what were the growth rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan you're going to take that question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Europe, as we have said, we were basically flat in terms of euro, but 13% growth in dollar terms. This reflects a decrease in ongoing mainly of our, of our trading business which didn't have much bearing on the bottom line, which was offset by improved business in other places. I don't have in my head now, the international figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">

          <p>Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Dan, I want to add one more thing, I was made aware that I may not have been clear regarding the guidance or the band in which we are going to be regarding our gross profit just to make clear we indicated the band before of 47 to 50% and now we are indicating a band of 49 to 52% and that is, this obviously as I am not sure, if I said these things before. Thank you and we will take one more question.</p>

          <p>Our last question comes from the line of William Kirby with Nevsky Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a quick question what proportion of your costs are incurred in Shekels and what will the effect of Shekel strength be on your margins please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have indicated before that obviously every move of every currency compared to the dollar has a full effect on our top line. So every appreciation or depreciation of any currency we work in is directly reflected in the top line because of the inflation because our accounts are in dollars. On the other hand, we have shown traditionally for quite &#x2013; many quarters that the impact on the bottom line is very minimal because of the balance of our balanced income and expenses in various currencies. I hope that answers your question.</p>
