          <p>Hello, everyone and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report strong fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. Total revenues for the fourth quarter grew 110% year-over-year. This was driven by a healthy increase in both of our key growth drivers, the number of active online marketing customers, and revenue per customer. Our active online marketing customers grew to 155,000, approximately 44% increase year-over-year. And revenue for online marketing customers grew to 3,700 R&amp;D, up 48% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our leading market share in iResearch also grew as users continued to choose Baidu's suite of search and community-based offerings, such as Baidu Notes, and Baidu Post Bar, and new products like finance channel, statistical search, and patent search.  According to iResearch, Baidu's web search traffic share rose to nearly 72% in the fourth quarter, up from nearly 69% in the third quarter of 2007.  And the study recently released by comScore that Baidu is the world's third most popular search engine.</p>
          <p>Standing by large advertisers started to outpace our traditional SME customer base as they realized the importance of integrating search with other online and offline campaigns.  In particular, we have seen increases in large advertisers from the financial services, IT, electronic, and automobile industry.  Compared with other online media platforms Baidu has the advantage of offering a variety of advertising products in bundles.  This can combine traditional search, Internet, behaviorally targeted ads, or target incitement and ad space on our union sites.</p>
          <p>They can also incorporate our newly launched branding service.  We expect our bundled advertising offering to continue to gain traction as a generous increase in traffic and enhanced brand recognition for our customers.  Also of note, from the fourth quarter is that Shengen, we in Shengen we have transitioned away from third party distributors and are now using a direct sales model.  We now have direct sales teams in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Taiyuan, Tianjin and Foshan.</p>
          <p>Looking at our new initiatives we are very excited to officially launch Baidu Japan this past January.  As you know, we've had a beta site live, since last March.  And the day after the official launch, user traffic quadrupled.  We are already offering web search, video search, image search and blog search on Baidu.jp.  This year will be the year of products and our on-the-ground team is dedicated to creating more search services that suit Japanese user's needs.  With Baidu search technology and focus on local users, we're confident that we can create a dynamic competitor in Japan's search market. In 2008, we are expecting to invest about 20 to $25 million US dollars in this.</p>
          <p>Another initiative that we announced last quarter is our C2C auction platform. Plans for a launch in 2008 are on track.  We have established a unit of professionals currently working on the details of this model; including placement, layout and payment mechanism.  We will be keeping you informed as we move ahead on this.</p>
          <p>One thing we are really excited about is Japan's &#x2013; is Baidu's growing importance in China's top culture scene.  Since a lot of people are already coming to Baidu to search for entertainment or related information, we've become a leading destination for entertainment based online communities.  And so, we are actively working to position Baidu as the hub of China's fast growing digital entertainment eco-system.  Part of this effort is online.  Our new entertainment channel for example, serves as a community for all kinds of discussions.  And we will continue leveraging our brand recognition to increase collaboration with entertainment industry players, to bring users advertising-supported online music, video and more.</p>
          <p>We believe that our efforts have paid off so far.  In 2007, Baidu became the first Chinese company to join the NASDAQ 100 index.  With 2,010 million users today, China's internet population continue to grow fast from a relatively small base.  Baidu's dominant market share, well received products and strategic initiatives, such as C2C, position us to benefit from this growth.</p>
          <p>Today, web-based search is our main source of revenue, but only accounts for 40% of our total traffic. That means non-web search, including users accessing our community and entertainment platforms, accounts for 60% of traffic, but much less a proportion of revenue.  We see many opportunities to monetize this non-web search traffic, creating new revenue streams to support our long-term growth.</p>
          <p>On a separate note, as you know in late December, our CFO, Shawn Wang, passed away while on vacation with his family.  This has been a very difficult and sad time for us, as Shawn was an important and much loved presence at Baidu.</p>
          <p>While we conduct our search for a permanent CFO, our Vice President of Business Operations, Haoyu Shen, will be responsible for our financials.  By way of introduction, Haoyu joined Baidu in June of 2007, coming to us from American Express, where he served as the Vice President in charge of US Consumer Card Acquisition.  Haoyu has an MBA and holds a CFA charter, and previously worked for McKinsey &amp; Company in greater China and New York.  Haoyu will now take you through fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2007 financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin.  Hello, everyone.</p>
          <p>As Robin mentioned earlier, we delivered healthy revenue and earnings results in the fourth quarter.  I will walk you through some important factors contributing to these results and other financial highlights before taking you through highlights and financials for the full fiscal-year 2007.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter total revenues were approximately 571 million RMB, within our guidance range and up 110% over the year-ago period.  Online marketing revenues were 570 million RMB, representing 111% growth year-over-year.  The growth was driven by a number of factors, including traffic growth, an increase in number of active online marketing customers of over 8% over the third quarter of 2007, as well as the nearly 6% sequential increase in per-customer spending.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition costs as a component of the cost of revenues was 72 million RMB, or almost 13% of total revenues, compared to nearly 9% in the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>The increase in TAC as a percentage of total revenues primarily reflects the continued growth of revenue contribution from Baidu Union members.</p>
          <p>Share-based compensation expenses increased to 13 million RMB in fourth quarter of 2007, from 7 million RMB in the year-ago period.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses were 132 million RMB, an 86% increase from the fourth quarter in 2006.  Excluding share-based compensation expenses, SG&amp;A rose 95% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses were 47 million RMB, a 123% increase from the corresponding period in 2006.  Excluding share-based compensation expenses, R&amp;D expenses rose 99% year-over-year, mainly due to the expansion of head count.</p>
          <p>Costs and expenses related to Japan operations in fourth quarter of 2007, were 25 million RMB in aggregate.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter was 220 million RMB, up 79% year-over-year. Net income excluding share-based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was 233 million RMB, a 79% increase from the fourth quarter of 2006.  Basic and diluted EPS excluding share based compensation expenses was 6.84 and 6.70 RMB translating roughly to $0.94 and $0.92 US respectively.  Net margin excluding share based compensation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 41%, down from 48% in the year ago period.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the balance sheet.  We ended fourth quarter of 2007 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of 1.6 billion RMB or 218 million US.  Operating cash inflow for the quarter was 335 million RMB or $46 million US, a year-over-year increase of 96%.  Capital expenditure for the fourth quarter of 2007 was 166 million RMB, up from 23 million RMB in year ago period.  Adjusted EBITDA, again a non-GAAP measure, was 247 million RMB for the fourth quarter and an increase of 87% from the corresponding period in 2006.</p>
          <p>Now turning to fiscal year 2007 results.  Total revenues were 1.7 billion RMB representing a 108% increase on the previous year.  Online marketing revenues were 1.7 billion RMB, a 110% increase from the previous year.  The growth was driven by a number of factors including traffic growth, an increase in the number of active online marketing customers of nearly 50% over 2006 as well as the year-over-year increase in per customer spending of nearly 40%.</p>
          <p>Traffic acquisition costs were 205 million RMB representing 12% of total revenues compared with 9% in 2006.  SG&amp;A expenses were 411 million RMB, up 64% from 2006 mainly due to expansion of the direct sales force and strengthening of the distributor network.  R&amp;D expenses totaled 141 million RMB, a 78% increase from 2006 largely due to expansion of R&amp;D head count.  Costs and expenses related to Japan operations were 73 million RMB in aggregate.</p>
          <p>Net income was 629 million RMB, an increase of 108% from 2006.  Net income excluding share based compensation expenses, a non-GAAP measure, was 669 million RMB representing a 94% increase from 2006.  Basic and diluted EPS excluding share-based compensation expenses were 19.79 and 19.26 RMB, translating roughly to 2.79 and 2.64 US, respectively.  Net margin, excluding share-based compensation expenses for fiscal year 2007, was 38%, down from 41% for 2006.</p>
          <p>Full-year net operating cash inflow and capital expenditure in 2007 were; 979 million RMB, and 569 million RMB, respectively.  Adjusted EBITDA was 768 million RMB in 2007, a 101% increase from 2006.</p>
          <p>Now let me provide you with our top line guidance for the first quarter of 2008.  As many of you know, our first quarter results tend to be affected by the seasonality from the long Chinese New Year holiday.  This year, the seasonality was amplified by the severe snowstorms across large portions of the country.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter of 2008, we currently expect total revenues to be between 533 and 548 million RMB, which would represent an annual growth of 93% to 99%.  I do wish to emphasize that this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.  I will now turn the call back to Robin for his closing remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you again for joining us today.  It is our focus on tailoring online products to meet users' and customers' needs, and our commitment to making strategic investments for the long term.  We are confident that we will continue to lead the Chinese Internet search market and enjoy growth well into the future.  I will now open the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. I guess, Robin, if you could clue me in about the first quarter in terms of the outlook; you guys, I would say, had a strong December quarter, but I should think about the guidance being down about a couple percent relative to last year was up 3%, maybe give it some framework in terms of maybe, timing of the New Year, maybe the best way to think about that.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that, as Haoyu mentioned in his prepared remark, this year for Q1 the revenue was not only affected by Chinese New Year, but also by the severe snowstorm across a large portion of the country.  At this time, we just passed the Chinese New Year holiday.  It's kind of difficult for us to give an accurate projection of our Q1 revenue.  At this point based on what already happened in January, and the first part of February, our current projection is that revenue will be that kind of range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I guess just one quick follow-up question.  Revenues per user was up nicely in the quarter.  What was driving that sequential increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that revenue per customer is basically decided by the traffic we have or inventory we have as more and more users come to Baidu to do their search we will have more opportunities to monetize those traffic.  And we also continue to improve the money transition outward so that advertisers have more flexibility in spending.  We do believe that we are &#x2013; still lot of potential in the money transition outward.  We can have more ways to deliver more element in front of the targeted consumer.  So as long as our traffic continues to grow, and we continue to optimize our monetization algorithm, I think that the revenue per customer will continue to grow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so we should think of that, as it should be increasing in the March quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the March quarter during the previous year because of the Chinese New Year, traffic usually goes down quite dramatically during the holiday season.  So we cannot really say revenue per customer will grow sequentially, but year-over-year that's certainly true.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excellent, that's helpful.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  First of all Robin, allow us here at Citigroup to convey our heartfelt condolence to you and on the passing of Shawn Wang.  He was a great person that we enjoyed working with and great CFO and yes we'll be sorry missed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Turning to a couple of the business items.  I have two questions.  First of all, can you tell us how much revenue you're going to expect to generate from Japan in 2008 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We currently do not have plans to monetize our Japanese traffic.  So for year 2008, we would expect zero revenue from Baidu.jp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe a housekeeping question.  Could you tell us how much CapEx you ended you ended up spending in 2007 on Japan?  I know at the beginning of the year you indicated 15 million.  I'm not sure if you ended up spending that amount by the time we got to the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jason.  It's Haoyu here.  The 15 million guidance we gave at the beginning of 2007 was impact on P&amp;L so I think at the end of the year as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we spent 73 million in aggregate.  So that's just slightly over 10 million US.  As far as CapEx for Japan, we don't give detailed numbers but it's probably over 10 million US CapEx spend for Japan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great and then a final question.  Regarding the C2C initiative, can you maybe give us a little bit more of an update on your strategy having had another quarter to look at it?  And the two things I am most interested in are, first of all, are you still planning on building your own platform or have you considered possibly going to try to buy or license somebody else's platform?  And then second related, could you give us an indication of how much spend and the impact on the P&amp;L that you expect from this initiative in 2008?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>C2C.  Yes, we are going to build our own C2C platform.  The product for the service will launch sometime this year.  We do not expect any revenue for the current year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how much is the spend should we be modeling for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The spending will be significantly lower than what we spent in Japan.  So at this time, we do not plan to announce a number on the spending.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your next question comes from the line of Dick Wei with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Morning Robin, Haoyu, and Linda.  My question is on the first quarter guidance.  Is it possible to give more color on the guidance?  I guess your guidance for '08 is actually worse than '07.  I guess do you expect, I guess do you expect it to be similar trend for the March, the month of March as well, compared with very last quarter?  I remember last quarter, last year, it was; March revenue was about 50% of your total quarterly revenues.  Do you expect to see a similar trend as well for the next quarter?  And, is it going to more coming out of the customer and, or is it going to come from the average spend of the customer?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dick.  I, I think every year is a little bit different, even as that Chinese New Year hasn't been in Q1 for every year.  But the timing of Chinese New Year is a little bit different year from year.  Last year, the Chinese New Year was quite late in February.  So the revenue for February was quite low.  That affected the Q1 revenue for last year, and also resulted in March representing like 50% of Q1's revenue.  This year, although the timing, the timing of Chinese New Year is kind of normal, it's in early February, the snowstorm which is kind of unexpected to us, happened a couple of weeks before the Chinese New Year.  So our revenue was affected, even in January, but the dipping in February will not be as large as it was last year.  So, the bounce-back in March, according to our current projection, would not &#x2013; as March -- as last year, too.  So combining with all this kind of factors, as well as a larger revenue base, we are comfortable to give a guidance like, well, Haoyu just talked about being in his prepared remark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Maybe if you can comment a bit on &#x2013; I guess the snowstorm is of more impacting your traffic, or impacting your I guess, the customer spend, or I guess, or the new customers that you able to sign up.  Or more customers just stop their search campaign during the period &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, I think it impacted all, first off, of many of the people were stuck on the road when they tried to go back home for the Chinese New Year holiday, so traffic was negatively  affected.  Customer spend was also slightly affected because if they run out of money they don't have the chance to renew it before the Chinese New Year holiday and the new customer was certainly affected because sales people were not able to contact the potential customers during that period.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I think we have the English market for MP3 search or music related file search for a long time.  I think we have a very good understanding of the customer needs or user needs for digital music.  We firmly believe in advertising supported digital music.  We think that Internet is a new form of media that can help record companies to promote their artists and sounds.  We have been working with many record companies and they are happy about the results we are offering.  As a search engine, we try to provide as much information as possible that's publicly online so we do believe in an open system that allows all the record companies, all the artists, all kinds of files to be found on our search platform.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning.  I have two questions is &#x2013; Hi.  Can you outline how does Baidu plan to increase the traffic of Baidu Japan?  And I have a follow-up question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well frankly that question is still an open question for us.  We employed a number of local people, local Japanese people, who help us to study the market and come up ways to attract Japanese consumers.  We are happy, we are very happy about the progress so far.  As I mentioned, our traffic provided with our JP portable does the day after our public launch, even though the service was publicly available -- not for the past 10, 11 months -- so the public announcement really helped Baidu &#x2013; became known to more and more Japanese users.  But at the end of day, I think, in the search engines product and services speak themselves.  As long as we can provide high-quality search services, that satisfy Japanese user's needs, I would not worry about the traffic growth.  So our main focus will be delivering the best search quality and search services to the Japanese consumer.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Since, if I may have a very short question to follow-up?  Robin, you talk about your bundling strategy for your branded ads.  And could you give us some examples in how you bundle your branded ads with your search ads?  And in particularly, what is the pricing for a display ad at this point, if you can disclose?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Eric.  How are you?  Here, let me take on this question.  What we have seen in the recent quarter is our brand advertisers spending on Baidu has been increasing because we have the advantage of being able to offer a bundled product, including search, display ads and a behavioral-targeted ads as well; either in TAC format or in display format.  So, I think the reason they enjoy the bundled product is so they can really integrate all these different forms and different advertisements for their different campaigns.  And also, it's a great way for them -- especially search -- is a great way for them to integrate with their, even their offline campaigns.  So be it multi-nationals or domestic, foreign advertisers have increasingly realized the synergy between search and other forms of online and offline campaigns.  As far as pricing for display ads, we do look at what our competitors do and look at advantages we have, look at the pay scale we have and we believe our pricing in display ads is very competitive in terms of ROI that could be achieved by advertisers.</p>

          <p>Morning, Robin.  How are you?  Just wanted to have a question again on the brand advertising.  What's the percentage revenue in fourth quarter coming from this business?  And also follow-up question actually on the first quarter guidance actually as brand ad is typical slow season in first quarter.  Does this have any implication on first quarter guidance and may have lowered the solid revenue guidance that you have given out?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, sometimes it's very difficult to separate brand ads from performance-based ads even for search related traffic.  For example, BrandLink, our new product launched last quarter, its search oriented brand ads.  Our customers come to us for a number of needs.  We try to come up with proposals that will satisfy all of them, so it's very hard to separate brand ads from performance based ads.  At this time trend we are seeing, we have more and more larger companies, multi-national companies or national companies, domestic companies; they increasingly realize that our platform especially a search centric platform can help them to not only deliver performance but also help their brand advertising campaigns.</p>

          <p>If I can just add because you did ask what percentage is from revenues from brand advertisers.  It is still comparing with our revenue P4P revenue from SME is still a small portion of our revenue but we do see a lot of good traction from these advertisers.</p>

          <p>Hi, Robin, how have you been?  I have two questions and the first one if about direct sale force.  You have been actively recruiting direct sales force over the past one year and can you help us to understand a little better about your future expansion plans?  And related to the question about the fact of union, which has been a significant traffic driver for your company.  Can you help us also understand that your current thinking, especially given Google, your arch rival Google, has been aggressively building AdSense-like alliance, with some leading websites such as Sina. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll talk about the direct sales force and Robin take on the union questions.  As we were mentioning in the prepared remarks, we already have direct sales forces that's in the tier one cities.  All the tier one cities in China; namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and a couple of other smaller cities.  At this time we do not have plans to convert other regions from channel to direct.  I think that the efficiencies for direct sales hitting all the regions we currently have present, still have a lot of room to improve.  And we already have a very sizeable direct sales force in these areas and we will continue to work on improving the efficiency of the sales team.  And we will also continue to support our channels in other regions as the growth potential for them is still huge.  Managing the channel system better is also a priority for our company.</p>
          <p>As of the question of Baidu Union, Baidu Union is going to &#x2013; according to a piece of research put out by iResearch last year, we are the leading ad network in China.  I think we command about 30, over 35% of market share, well ahead of our competitor.  And so, and we've seen very healthy growth in union traffic in past few quarters.  And we are constantly on the look-out of identifying great partners to work with.  To give us traffic, to provide great content.  And also, as some of you may know, we launched a new product called Baidu TV, which is a one ad, one format of ad that we put on union sites on our content, union content sites.  And that's just indicative of our continuous effort in terms of exploring new monetization formats for our union members.  So, with our continuous effort we believe, we are confident that we will continue to be the leading internet ad network for China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, if you look at the tax, at the percentage of revenue, it has been increasing, which represents the increasing importance of revenue contribution from Baidu Union.  That says something the strength of our union system.  We believe we have a very competitive incentive system for the union members and going forward this should have a lot of potential too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Good morning Robin and how are you?  I want to ask you still a question on this Shenzhen distributor.  So is this, at the end of November that Shenzhen distributor was acquired and consolidated into your numbers and also, the revenue from this Shenzhen distributor, can we think about that is comparable to Guangzhou?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not disclose the scale, revenue scale for individual cities or regions.  What we can say is that Shenzhen distributor was a very important distributor in our channel system and converting them into a direct has been an important task for us.  We've been preparing for this for some time and even though the transaction has closed, I would say it's going to take a couple more quarters for the direct sales team in Shenzhen to really get up to speed and realize the power of customer acquisitions and customer services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just a follow up question on the branded advertising.  When we look at the balance sheet especially the accounts receivable line, is this mainly the big advertisers?  Assuming that the small and medium sized companies, when they do the search marketing they will pay up front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's right the accounts receivable on balance sheet it's mostly for these brand advertisers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  Hi.  You know just looking at the growth in TAC and if it does continue to grow at a rate much faster than revenue and it's certainly becoming a meaningful part of your cost structure.  I was hoping you could give us a little more insight to what's happening there.  You've already called out growth in terms of Baidu Union, I'm wondering is there any TAC expense associated with revenue, just I mean not from the union but Baidu's proprietary traffic such as tool bar distribution or being loaded on a PC, etcetera.  And I think the last time you disclosed the percentage you were paying to the union members was around the time of the IPO.  I was wondering if you could tell us, has there been any movement or how much movement has there been or since that time in the percentage that you're sharing with the numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question on TAC is that as you can see on the P&amp;L as the component &#x2013; TAC on total revenue as being an upward trend in the past few quarters.  It is really a largely a reflection of the fast growth of our union, revenue from union members.  On the other hand, we do, when we look at especially when we look at strategic deals, when we look at strategic partners that we want to work with, to recruit them to become our union members, we don't have a strict tail weight that we have to stick to, so we do &#x2013; on individual deals, we do look at revenue and that will TAC from that perspective.  So I think a slow upward trend for TAC is really a combination of those two factors.  I didn't quite get the second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Well I was just wondering if there was any TAC associated to driven the Baidu direct traffic like a tool bar distribution, or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes there are.  We struck deal with some distributors to distribute the tool bar otherwise, search bar emphasis for Baidu.  That is considered as union traffic, not organic traffic.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking our one question.  I guess you had a big reinvestment tax rebate in the quarter, looking forward, as long as you're CapEx remains at high levels should we expect you to continue getting reinvestment tax rebates and continuing enjoying very low on negative effective tax rate.  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The 21 million RMB tax refund we got in Q4 is really a one-time event so going forward if you exclude that one-time refund, I think when you look at effective tax rate for 2007 it's about 1.3% and as we mentioned in previous conference calls, different entities -- we have different entities in China, some of the tax holiday they've been enjoying is going to expire.  So for going forward for 2008 I think we're probably looking at single digit tax rate.  And because China's tax system is undergoing reform in 2008 and the details and flotation guideline has not been published yet.  So there's some uncertainty to it but I think it's safe to assume that the tax rate in 2008 will be in the single digits.</p>

          <p>Yes, Robin.  I was wondering if you could give us any sort of feel as there's concerns out there that a global consumer recession going on or potentially going to occur, could you give us your thoughts and your feel on sort of the insular capabilities of Baidu and any sort of impact that analysts be baking in for any potential recession in 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not an economist so it's very hard for me to predict if there is going to be any recession.  But having said that I think the potential for the Internet industry in China and search in particular, is so huge that it really largely depends on our execution, our improvement in the search quality, our improvement in the monetization algorithm and our effort to educate companies, enterprises better to understand the benefit of paid search.  So in my mind, if a company even has $1 to spend on marketing they should spend the $1 on the Baidu platform.  So in that sense I don't think any kind of economic downturn, unless it's very, very severe, would have a material impact on our revenue growth.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

We currently do not have any plans to monetize that kind of service.  We are just trying to satisfy the information and needs or the training needs for our existing users.</p>

I would -- Baidu Campus construction is well in progress.  The construction will end early part of 2009.  So between now and the early part of 2009 I would think there will be around 50 to 60 million US CapEx spent on Baidu Campus.</p>

          <p>I guess I need to talk about from two aspects.  The first is on the user aspect.  I think in the tier two cities Baidu enjoy even a higher market share, I mean traffic share for our search services, because we are local.  We do have features and products that really tailors to the need of the local user.  On the customer, or advertiser side we've been building a channel system, or distribution system, since the year 2002, and this system has been, I think, the strongest in the Internet space in China.  We are so far ahead of any competition in this front.</p>

          <p>Right.  If I understand you correctly Ming, under other income there's 12 million RMB interest income and there's another 13 million RMB other income.  The bulk of that is some tax related subsidies from the government and also probably a one-time event.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a couple of questions.  First if you can give out the head count breakdown that would be good, and also interested if you can break out the CapEx for fourth quarter, how much was spent in servers versus on the campus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Dick we don't give detail breakdown of head count but as I said at the end of the year the total head count is slightly over 6,000 and what I can say is over 4,000 is in sales and marketing.  As far as CapEx in Q4, the total CapEx for Q4 is 166 million RMB, over a third of that was for Baidu Campus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically, about roughly 60 million is for the campus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the total is 166, and more than a third of 166 is for Baidu Campus.</p>

          <p>Hi, just a question on the share based compensation is that it tends to go up a lot in the fourth quarter so it's going to have much higher growth in the next few quarters.  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the SBC in Q4 is a slightly &#x2013; that's really a function of the grants we gave in Q4.  And that's really a function of our hiring of senior positions.  So it does fluctuate from quarter to quarter but I don't expect it to continue to go up.</p>

          <p>Yes.  We are always open to all kinds of listing options if that can serve our shareholders better.  At this time, the planning is very preliminary; we need to find a way to prove that this will be beneficial to the existing shareholders, employees, and customers.</p>

          <p>Yes.  Just a quick question regarding Microsoft, Yahoo acquisition.  I'm wondering how you prepared for this acquisition.  How is that going to affect you?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you may know that these two players do not have significant market share in terms of Chinese search, and the deal will probably take quite some time to complete if it ever completes.  So it's very hard for us to speculate the impact on Baidu.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys.  Thanks for taking my questions.  You know, I guess during this last quarter you had a pretty nice reacceleration in the year-over-year change in customers. It went from 40% in Q3 to 44% this quarter.  I was wondering to what extent is that being driven by an increased percentage of repeat customers.  And also, if you could also comment on to what extent the faster pace of growth in the large advertisers compared to SMEs is driving the ARPU growth that we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think the number of active online customers is really a reflection of our execution capability of the sales team. The potential for this market is huge. There are more than 10 million or 20 million enterprises in China. In theory, every company, every enterprise can take advantage of our paid search platform.  It's just a matter of market maturity and how we execute in terms of customer acquisition.  So, I think the numbers in Q4 really is the, are a reflection of our execution in the salesforce.  ARPU &#x2013; large customers generally spend more on our systems, so that certainly helps increasing ARPU.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think you can disclose the number of, the percentage of your customers that are repeating?  That have spent with you in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really hard to define what is a repeating customer.  We are basically offering this like a service, people in theory should just keep putting money in this system, but sometimes they would decide to stop for awhile and come back later.  They may stop for a week, they may stop for a month, they may stop for a year.  It's really difficult to define what a repeating customer is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For example, a customer that's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Customer loyalty is very high and the performance we are delivering is very good for all of the customers.  They are very satisfied.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about the mix between large advertisers and SMEs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned before, we see increasingly high interest from, higher interest from the larger companies.  But SMEs is still major part of our revenue contribution, and like I mentioned, the potential is still very, very large.  And we don't really see any limit in new customer or customer spending.  It's' really about market maturity, our execution.</p>
