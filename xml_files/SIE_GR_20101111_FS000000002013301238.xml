        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very, very much. Good afternoon to everybody. I think we have to cover a lot of ground today, so let's go straight into the achievements and then I would like to quickly update you on the path forward for Siemens towards continuous improvement and capital efficient growth. I will also introduce to you the new strategic framework, One Siemens where we will outline to our strategic direction and the significant strengths of our company and also as part of it, outlining the financial target system that will guide our actions in the future.</p>
          <p>Strong operational performance in the last quarter; outstanding 2010 performance also relative to competition in Q4. Order intake gained momentum driven by major customer wins in energy, revenue growth stabilized further. The sectors again improved their efficiency and competitive positions. 10 divisions delivered a higher profit over an already strong fiscal '09, but the Q4 net result was also heavily impacted by project and restructuring charges and by the non-cash effective diagnostics impairment what all of you are well aware of.</p>
          <p>Q2 closed on &#x2013; closed a record year for our cash. All stakeholders should participate from the excellent performance in fiscal '10. Therefore, we have proposed a significant dividend increase to &#x20AC;2.70 in recognition of the outstanding work what everybody has done in the Siemens organization. We have also given a special bonus for the non-management employees totaling &#x20AC;310 million.</p>
          <p>This quarter marks the end of a strong fiscal '10 and the successful completion also of the Fit4 2010 program. Let me just give to you a couple of highlights. We achieved over the last four years the two times GDP growth target. On average compounded annual growth rate, the operational sector profitability is either better or is par with our competition. Our cost reduction efforts in SG&amp;A and supply chain management have paid off and our balance sheet is a strong source of growth. And all of this has been accomplished during a very difficult economic environment.</p>
          <p>Let's have a closer look at the Q4 numbers in detail. New orders were up very strongly, 18% year-over-year growth and this came across the entire organizations with particularly strength in the emerging markets like Russia, India and Brazil. Revenue rose 2% above Q4 2009 and confirms that we are back on a sustainable growth track, the book-to-bill was also very encouraging with 1.11.</p>
          <p>As I said, the total sector profit was mainly hit by the DX-impairment charges of &#x20AC;1.2 billion euros as well as by the charges in Industry, Solutions and Particle Therapy. And together with the SIS restructuring charges, this added up to a net loss for the quarter.</p>
          <p>We saw particularly a very, very strong cash flow development of almost &#x20AC;3 billion, which is close to the 2009 level and Joe will talk about it in more detail. The divisional picture for the quarter on the right-hand side of the slide looks not only good for Q4, but also is encouraging in terms of the growth momentum what we see across our businesses.</p>
          <p>You can see the very positive order intakes and sales growth numbers across all &#x2013; nearly all divisions. In Industry, we saw a continued momentum and this was based by a double-digit order and revenue growth in the short cycle businesses like Industry Automation also around motion control within direct &#x2013; within DT. And increased demand in Industry Automation was also a broad-based across all businesses in all regions. Margin in Industry Automation were helped by top line growth of higher capacity utilization. OSRAM saw its most profitable year ever and also regained pre-crisis volume levels.</p>
          <p>We grew the LED share now to 21% in the fourth quarter and further benefited from healthy automotive demand. An upcoming global sales effort and capacity expansion will further spur the transition to LED. Building Technologies saw strong demand for energy efficiency solutions and from emerging markets. The Industry Solutions division had mixed performance. As we have said, the division took some significant restructuring charges as well as there were additional charges of &#x20AC;125 million for a project in the U.S. with a local partner, which hurt the margin.</p>
          <p>On the positive side of the I&amp;S Division, the division booked a number of large contracts in the Metals Division, adding up to a significant order intake increase. Mobility delivered again a very solid profitable quarter due to ongoing negotiations with customers. We have seen some large order postponements into 2011, but we're very confident about the current sales funnel.</p>
          <p>In the sector Energy, again, Energy has delivered an excellent execution, delivered 13.1% profit margin, well in the target range and fossil, in particular, has an outstanding profitability supported by the consistent project delivery and favorable revenue mix with strong product and service content.</p>
          <p>The overall Energy market continues to recover. The speed of recovery is different for each division. We clearly see large orders in many divisions and base business demand such as in Power Distribution has also picked up. The book to bill ratio for the Sector was again at a very strong 1.25 for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Renewables is expanding very, very strongly, not just its global footprint, but also its backlog, it's now at a record &#x20AC;9.2 billion of order backlog. Profitability in the current quarter was impacted by a less favorable product mix and expansion efforts in wind and solar. And in the first half of fiscal 2011, we expect impact on profitability related to the further build up of the solar business and seasonal effects in the wind business.</p>
          <p>Healthcare showed a solid 6% increase in order intake and a 1% revenue growth. Orders in Healthcare were particularly strong in the Americas where we will see &#x2013; where we see positive effects from the release of the pent-up demand also in the United States.</p>
          <p>Imaging and IT maintained the overall lead in profitability through a favorable product mix and above average growth of the service business. Profitability at Workflow and Solutions was burdened by the charges of &#x20AC;96 million associated with particle therapy. The charges stemmed from the tests of this prototype technology resulting in a revised assessment of the additional cost required to complete the projects.</p>
          <p>Due to the FX movements in the final number of the non-cash Diagnostics impairment of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, operational Diagnostics showed an increase order intake of 4% in revenue growth mainly driven from the regions Asia and Australia.</p>
          <p>At this chart, you can see that we have quite significantly build our order backlog over 2010, we have increased the order backlog by &#x20AC;6 billion, standing now at &#x20AC;87 billion excluding currency movements of around &#x20AC;3.5 billion, we were also increasing it, by the quarter. The factor of quantity and its high level margin quality give us a lot of confidence as we go into 2011, so we have not just increased order backlog in its totality but also when you look into the quality of the order backlog, it's very encouraging in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>The Energy sector remains the biggest contributor to the backlog with &#x20AC;53 billion and all divisions had significant order wins in Q4. Fossil, for example, won a number of turnkey contracts in India, in Oman, the Netherlands. We closed long-term service agreements in France, for a new plant and extended a contract in the Philippines both worth a total of &#x20AC;800 million, the Renewables division won a number of very large onshore and offshore wind parks in Europe and the United States, among them, Anholt with a 400 megawatt Denmark's largest offshore wind farm from DONG Energy, the Comber wind project in Canada from Brookfield Renewable Power, and in Transmission, we extended our leading position in offshore grid connections through the HelWin order worth &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>And this wins demonstrate that the energy markets about to turn in a more positive direction and our integrated Energy portfolio gives us a unique competitive edge to win market share.</p>
          <p>And there is one more order I want to highlight in the Industry sector, Mobility has succeeded to win a major order in the United States to sell its locomotives to the Amtrak as a customer and this has, for us, obviously also significance when you look ahead in terms of the rail programs, which are currently in discussion in the United States, so a great order win there as well.</p>
          <p>And now, I would like to hand over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Very warm welcome to our Q4 conference here in London. Let me start with what I always like a lot especially if it turns out like that is free cash flow. And as you can see, we've been pretty much following the path, which has already been shown in prior years, maybe with the exceptions that there is no significant backlash in the first quarter or first month of the new fiscal year. You could see that from the beginning in 2010, we've been quite consistent in building up the free cash flow over time.</p>
          <p>Obviously, one of the major contributors to that what we believe was a decent success and achievement for us that we've been consistently improving our growth times, been maintaining our net working capital terms, which now are stemming at 8.9 times revenues, which we believe is quite a decent achievement and supposed to be just about stable also going forward. So another question is what have been the reasons, why that has been developing like that, first of all, and secondly, what do we expect or how do we expect that to develop into fiscal 2011?</p>
          <p>If you look at the slides here on page number eight, you can see basically the development of our bookings over time and then the billings &#x2013; the development of our billings in excess also above that red bar. And for quite a long period of time, we've been able to increase the billings in excess, which means that our customers have helped finance us our working capital. We've seen some downturn during the course of 2009, which has not been continuing.</p>
          <p>Now, we are at the similar pace of some volatile development in order &#x2013; on pre-development of orders. If we model &#x2013; if we model a situation where billings in excess and the behavior of our customer prepayments would change in a way that we cannot finance the working capital like we used to then that could be as much as 2 billion impact of the free cash flow in 2011. So, time will tell, but that's just something to consider. We have seen some developments &#x2013; recent developments that our customers are less motivated in continuing with the current business model in terms of prepayments and financing over time.</p>
          <p>The second topic where we have been pretty diligent on was the CapEx spending with business spending quite a lot of money when the cycle was developing from 2005 to 2007, even 2008, way above depreciation, and then we saw orders turning south. We obviously have also been putting the brakes on the CapEx spending. You see quite a correlation within the CapEx rate and the organic order growth, and we expect that to maintain that way going forward. So that means with a &#x2013; with that clear order increase in 2011, we also expect CapEx to increase in a similar way.</p>
          <p>We obviously are not spending them before the growth arrives but we just be prepared that we are going to be just at about 100% of depreciation in 2011. That again, will obviously have an impact of &#x2013; into our free cash flow. And as you might remember depreciation has been in the neighborhood of 2.2, 2.3 billion in 2010, so if you are getting close to 100%, you are pretty much know what our growth impacted and growth driven CapEx expenditures are going to be in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now the next chart, well basically get to <mark type="inaudible" /> but that also has to do with cash and that is basically how our pension fund has been developing over time. You could see if I may start from the bottom here, you could actually see that our fund people have been managing the fund pretty well in terms of actual return, have been able to yield 2.3 billion out of pension assets, which started to be 21.1 billion when we started fiscal year or ended fiscal year 2009 at 21.1.</p>
          <p>However, during the course of the fiscal year, we've been seeing a massive deterioration of the discount rates going forward, you can see the discount rate which we have been using to discount our future obligations and that has been going down from 5.3 to 4.2. And those 110 basis points have had a massive, massive impact on, obviously, the funding status, which now has been increasing from a minus 4.0 to 6.4 billion. If you look forward, I think, there are only a few people who believe that the interest rates are going to change quickly any time soon and if they change it, probably have some further downward potential.</p>
          <p>Secondly, it's our view that there are some longevity risks going forward, including, demographics. And then thirdly, at some point in time, inflation will be always become a matter to be considered too, which has actually two aspects as you know, the first one is that the discount rates go up, that also do benefit obligations.</p>
          <p>So that's a &#x2013; to cut a long story short, that's all considered. You have to be aware that 6.4 billion in pension deficit would be just about close to the maximum the company would feel comfortable in growing forward. And that would mean that we would need to address demographics, longevity and inflation in the pension fund.</p>
          <p>So, we obviously need to look into solutions which also help us go up against inflation in the long-term, just to make sure our assets get protected. And we're looking into ways and areas on how we can ease the minds and the situation in the long term in that aspect.</p>
          <p>Now, that much to the cash side of the company and the surrounding matters, let me now come to the other side, which is profitability and its impact also going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, if you look into our income from continuous operations at the upper-left here on the slide, which has been showing quite a decent conversion of growth. Remember, we had actually a negative revenue environment, our revenues were down year-on-year and profitability has been up from continued operations. Some may believe it's not as much as it should have been. However, it's been significant there which has been 7% like-for-like and we've had several impacts on our OpEx as well as in the gross margin.</p>
          <p>If we go to the gross margin first, the gross profit as you see, we've been expanding the margin, we've been increasing the gross margin not only in absolute but also in relative terms from 27 to 28.5%, which is 150 base points against the falling revenue, which is not always the usual aspect one would see also having deteriorating revenues. And there have been a few aspects why we were able to do that. First, we've had quite a favorable mix when we started fiscal 2010, at developing that into this &#x2013; the half of 2010. The short cycle business environment, Industrial Automation, OSRAM, Drive Technology, Motion Control here for the most part has been growing the fastest. And they probably have been showing quite a decent profitability and also a decent drop to the bottom line. So favorable mix impact on the gross profit.</p>
          <p>Second topic was that we've also, from a regional standpoint, have a quite favorable impact on the premium products, which mostly sold in Germany and that is &#x2013; consider numbers. Germany has been up for quite a large number of percentages year-on-year. So two favorable mix impact, first, short cycle versus long cycle. Secondly, premium products, high innovation, high margin carrying products sold mostly in Germany and in parts of Italy and this is all be tool makers' high tech environment.</p>
          <p>The second major impact has been on the purchasing side. Obviously, we've been encountering two facts. The first fact was a managerial performance, as you know, from our supply chain. We've had quite a decent result and performance on our supply chain initiative, not only in reducing the number of suppliers but also in terms of how it turned out to the bottom line. And secondly, admittedly, there has been some tailwind in negotiating with suppliers because it's been a buyers' market during the trough of industrial cycle.</p>
          <p>Now going forward, and that actually has lead to the situation that the supply chain contribution to net income, called C&amp;I, contribution to net income. has actually been bigger in euro than the price erosion has been in the market, okay. So has been able to over compensate the price erosion in the market fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Now going forward, we do expect the 2011 to be different. We are not going to see tailwind in terms of product mix while the shorter cycle environment is still supposed to be growing, especially in Automotive and Toolmakers environment which is IABT and in part, also OSRAM. We do see a more significant part of the growth coming from the long-cycle environment, such as Mobility and less gross margin carrying assets and businesses.</p>
          <p>So, there's not going to be any tailwind any more in terms of product mix, actually, it's the other way around. It will be slightly below. In terms of pricing, we do expect pricing to be up from current year &#x2013; from the last year, last year it was just about 2.5% of sales. That could easily end up in 3 to 3.3% of sales for 2011, assuming that there will be a higher degree of market and competitive activity in mostly China. We do see several new entrants, especially in the T&amp;D environment, mostly in the Transmission environment that could lead to some price erosion. We are back in the U.S. dollar range where obviously there is also some impact to be expected there. So the assumption in 2011 is a slightly higher price erosion from about 2.5 to 3, 3.3%, so these will be taken in consideration.</p>
          <p>By the same token, we do not expect &#x2013; we do not expect in our planning, we do not expect the C&amp;I to again cover the price erosion in the market. That has to do with first of all that the low hanging fruits have been harvested, rightfully so. That secondly, the sentiment turns from a buyers into a more sellers related environment. And then thirdly, obviously, us shifting from the short-term action on negotiating power into a more long-term design-in related partnership with the suppliers. So don't expect a compensation of the C&amp;I covering the market prices going forward. So that is important to understand also how we see 2011 and that eventually how that turns out into the guidance going forward.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, on the other two parts which is R&amp;D and SG&amp;A, we are planning to invest a material amount of money into R&amp;D, mostly engineering in 2011. You see we've been just about flat in terms of R&amp;D spend in 2009 to 2010. We do expect 2011 to be up in both in quantitative absolute numbers as well as in relative numbers to revenues and that could be as much as 500 to 600 million investment for growth.</p>
          <p>Similar aspects you can or should expect in the go-to-market part of the SG&amp;A environment. We are very stable and pretty much cleaned up in the G&amp;A environment. So, there's not going to be significant changes in the SG&amp;A numbers in absolute terms but we do invest in applications specific go-to-market activities selectively in order to make good on what we have also in focus in terms of where growth comes from in the years to come.</p>
          <p>So also expect some 300, 350 million investment into go-to-market expenses. As I said, SG&amp;A flat and selling go-to-market including application specific activities in that ballpark. It's important to understand and it's gets much easier then also to get a view on where profitability ought to be.</p>
          <p>So the good news &#x2013; the good news in OpEx is that it is in our control to spend them. So we've cleaned up the base, through the SG&amp;A program in terms of where we want to have the money at work. And now it's our decision based on our growth opportunities to invest money into engineering R&amp;D as well as go-to-market. So it is something we decide or not to decide to invest into to the current plan how it will call for those numbers, which as I shared with you going forward. All right, so that much to the OpEx side and gross profit.</p>
          <p>As I said, we're pretty clean and pretty well settled in the G&amp;A part. There has been two major drivers for making that possible and have massively reduced complexity but also have been taking a lot of G&amp;A costs out of the system by reducing the number of legal entities from 1,800 in 2007 all the way down to 995. So the Project 1000 has actually been successfully completed as one of the major enabler to reduce complexity; one of the few things Peter has been giving out in terms of transforming the company and also, of course, the reporting units have been also been brought down from 900 to 439 such as for the ones who've been or are just about to get concerned about the clarity and the in-depth reporting of the numbers.</p>
          <p>So we do know, I do know, the company knows the P&amp;L, the cost, the revenues, the bookings, major parts of the working capital for 439 different entities in the company. So we know exactly what's going on in terms of P&amp;L and working capital, we haven't issues. So there is no lack of transparency for the company, we will know exactly where the laggards are and who make a lot of joy for us in terms of profitability and growth. So there is no lack of clarity of what needs to be done in the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of finance bundling, it's another topic we are making pretty nice progress. So that will also keep the SG&amp;A costs down not only in 2011 but also going forward. So no worry about G&amp;A, very dedicated spending on go-to-market and then innovation-driven engineering and R&amp;D OpEx going forward.</p>
          <p>Now look at the second topic that might be of interest. This was happens below the so called below the line. You've seen here the bridge in terms of fiscal Q4, the equity investments were down 181 million that predominantly stem from the NSN challenges they continue to have going forward.</p>
          <p>Restructuring of 383 million was the major driver for the reported loss in SIS and accounting, I'm sure you agree with me that 137 million profit in SFS is an outstanding result. We finally solved the Pick and Place matter with a loss of 92 million. And then there are a few smaller items like SRE which in absence of selling any assets, obviously there is &#x2013; has also been turning out into a smaller loss.</p>
          <p>The big number here in the 928 million on the so called corporate, pension and others, obviously, predominantly comes from the fact that we spend about 400 million or billed about 400 million on the reserves for employee related matters. About 300 as Peter mentioned earlier have been the appreciation campaign and the rest has been reserved for the upcoming incentive scheme to be paid out for the management going forward.</p>
          <p>And then everything else, obviously, tax, as you can see have been pretty much in line. So what to expect going forward. On equity investments, we do believe that there will be an ongoing materially impact on NSN. As you know, Nokia has reported early this year that the NSN unit will have about 600 million, 500 or 600 million in restructuring, about 200 and change have been already done, so there will be restructuring coming into the fiscal 2011 on levels which were just about similar of what we have been seeing.</p>
          <p>SIS basically in the main area has completed its restructuring. There will be some resource adjustments going forward, but basically we are competed here. SFS has had a peak earning year and that predominantly came from the fact that a lot of our &#x2013; of their customers had actually prepaying back their loans because they had better opportunities in other markets. The debt markets and credit has been opening up at the different sources. There was some peak profitability here, which is not going to be coming again in 2011.</p>
          <p>So, for 2011 we expect that pre-tax return equity, which was about 30% in 2010 to be back in the ranges of 23%, 25% which we consider to be a normal level. Considering that SFS is predominantly there for supporting our industrial business, and not as a purpose of itself. So that means less risk and it is in return on equity range between 23%, 25% and that also will turn into some EBIT number as you can probably figure out yourself.</p>
          <p>CMPA, much smaller impact here. However, in order to look at this one, you need to consider there is about 2,000 people in this CMPA still who need to be managed, who have not been joining the new entity, which we need to manage till they are finally concluded. SRE will be volatile going forward, obviously because of the fact that we continue to be marketing our real estate assets depending on market conditions. So there will be ups and spikes in terms of gains and proceeds from those sales, but then again, this will be volatile over time. But the disposal strategy remains unchanged. That means we continue to transform long-term fixed assets into a more variable component going forward. And we also are pretty much on target with our REIP concept, which is supposed and targeted and committed to deliver 400 million of savings by 2012.</p>
          <p>Corporate Treasury is straightforward, about 50 million a quarter should be doing it as a decent number. On corporate items and pensions, there are two metrics I wanted to draw your attention to. First, during the course of 2007 up to 2010, we've been accumulating cost at corporate, which actually were very operational cost, about the buildup of supply chain for example, the marketing and selling campaign of Siemens. We agreed to do that to make sure that there is not going to be any confusion about how the divisions have been achieving their target margins.</p>
          <p>So we kept the definition for the target margins and their content as we had in 2007 all the way out to 2010, so that with a clean comparison about the achievements of the target. Now with Fit4 2010 having come to an end and us moving forward and putting an emphasis on a outside in benchmarking on relative performance to the market, we will allocate those operational costs, which have been carried at corporate to the sectors at division. And that will be about an 80 to 100 base point impact on the EBITDA margins of the sector. Okay, 80 to 100 base points impact to that. So, that means corporate items will be reduced and you'll see them distributed where are also then the benefits of those investments happen in the business.</p>
          <p>The second topic is that the carve-out of the SIS entity will continue to have some cost related to making them a standalone, legal and operational and competitive entity in the IT environment. And those efforts will be carried under corporate items in 2011 till the companies are standalone and fully self-contained to compete in the IT environment. And that could also be a material amount one needs to consider in that area. So that much to basically all the line items you find below the line.</p>
          <p>And with that, I hand it back over to Peter on the Fit4 2010. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Joe. On this chart, you just see once more the accomplishment what we have achieved in the Fit4 2010 program. On the top left hand side, the four times GDP, twice the GDP number, four percentage growth, the very good cash conversion rate, the profitability achievements in the sectors operationally, and then of course, the capital structure target, which we have deliberately decided actually not to achieve. But in the same time, we have also made significant strategic re-alignments, not just on the leadership culture aspects and leadership team aspects, we have also initiated a number of new joint ventures in a marketplace, for example, in for Mobility in Russia, for Power Generation in China. As Joe have highlighted &#x2013; has highlighted that we have also maintained the R&amp;D investments.</p>
          <p>So overall, we have seen an excellent performance where Siemens is today. And going forward, we are now in a position to really close a chapter of 12 years of restructuring. And when you look back, this is exactly what has happened over the last 12 years. We are now in a position to be a leading company, a normal company. We're in attractive growth markets; we have two-thirds of our business already in number one or number two positions.</p>
          <p>We have changed very much the attitude of our leadership team. We have aligned it with our shareholders for sustainable long-term and marking leading positions and it's clear to everybody that we've to continue to drive long term shareholder value creation. This means outperforming our competitors. This means being in the growth markets and growing fastest in the marketplace, maintain the top profitability what we've achieved independent but it's cyclic and the business cycles are in the current environment, and very important also to increase capital efficiency for the company overall, and that's precisely the new program what we called One Siemens. And if we try to summarize One Siemens, the key aspect before we go into the numbers, let me just summarize the key aspects.</p>
          <p>One is, in the old program, we talked about our margins what we try to accomplish. In the new one, the EBITDA our target margins for the industries we are operating in over the cycle. And as you can see we anticipate that the industry cycles will be for Industry in the range of 10 to 15%, for Energy in the range of 10 to 15 and for Healthcare between 15 and 20. That's number one. The most important aspects of the new program is, the aspect of continuous improvement. Wherever we are, we continue to drive improvement, and we want to measure ourselves among the best, so the relative performance versus our direct competitors is a very critical element.</p>
          <p>And just one word also how this is aligned with our incentive systems. In a couple of weeks, we will provide you with all the details of the new incentive systems, which will be part of the invitation for the Annual Shareholder Meeting, but let me just give you a flashlight what it will be.</p>
          <p>Number one, that the annual bonus system will be exactly aligned behind the aspects of continuous improvement. If a business is unable to continuously improve performance, the management teams are unable to increase their pay-out, number one. Number two, on the &#x2013; and you have to do this against competition, of course. Number two in terms of stock awards, the stock awards will be measured on two key criteria. One is EPS performance, and the other one is relative share price performance against a basket of competitors. And this just demonstrates to you, wherever we are, there is an enormous and strong incentive for the top leadership team of the organization to continuously to drive for improvement and that's &#x2013; and then, we want to get rid of a system where we have tracked 23 targets, 23 KPIs.</p>
          <p>We were talking about multiple initiatives. Now it is very simple. What is it the topline performance, how do we do relative to competition, where and how do we invest our capital and therefore, increase capital efficiency, and how do we drive free cash flow improvement? And therefore also, this is a critical element where we now have the clear focus when you look into where the incremental value drivers are for the organization. The key incremental value driver for organization is growth, capital efficient growth and therefore, we have really targeted the organization behind key growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>Joe has just highlighted in terms of how we actually invest in a very targeted way our resources to drive for this growth. I will just in this regard really focus on two initiatives, one is our environmental portfolio, what you have seen, what we have already announced on Monday where we have clearly a target out there for increasing our environmental portfolio from 28 billion today to 40 billion by 2014.</p>
          <p>And the second one is of course, we want to drive our emerging footprint, our emerging market footprint and on the left hand side, you can see what we anticipate that over 50% of the incremental growth of our markets will be in emerging markets. We already have a very strong emerging market footprint. On the top right hand side, you can see that we increased from 2005 to 2010 already up to almost a third of our business are currently already in the emerging markets. So, on the top right hand side of the business here, the target is continuous improvement. We will continuously improve our footprint in emerging markets and therefore, the SMART initiatives, therefore the application centers, which we're really putting down on the ground and therefore, the incremental investment there. We have already currently over 110,000 people in the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And the third, as I said, in our business. We want to drive and this is why this is linked to pioneering new markets, we want to pioneer very important new markets for Siemens like electro-mobility, like eCar, like smart grids, the whole issue in terms of where real big, big investments are happening currently in the global markets and this is behind sustainable urban city infrastructure developments and therefore, most recently as one example, we have announced our innovation partnership and alliance with Masdar City, where Masdar City, the first CO2-free city in the world, will be powered by smart grids and linking it to smart building solutions. All of these are examples where we are going forward to really continue to drive the aspect of capital efficient growth.</p>
          <p>The key target will be organic, but we will supplement this with focused M&amp;A activities behind these activities. We will continue to, as I said, to drive our SMART initiatives and we will have very targeted focused investment programs. And Joe has just highlighted what it means for the research and development aspects and what it also means for application centers, particularly in emerging markets.</p>
          <p>And against this backdrop, we are changing fundamentally the approach for the company. Siemens is from an investor perspective, no longer a restructuring story. Siemens is a value story and this was the core reason why we felt strongly we also have to bring the dividend to a new level. And therefore, we want to propose at the Annual Shareholder meeting &#x20AC;2.70 per share, and you should expect from us continuity in our dividend policy as you have seen it in the past just at the different level going forward and this is the combination of the strength what we anticipate operationally, the strategic alignment and reposition &#x2013; repositioning what we have achieved with our portfolio and realigning what we are doing with incentivizing our top leadership teams.</p>
          <p>A last word on outlook 2011, we want to drive the increase from the organic order intake to show a clear increase compared to fiscal 2010 as you can see here on the chart, a moderate organic growth on the sales. This is simply to do as you know with the cyclicality of our long-term businesses. We have a very strong order book. We see, obviously, the order intake momentum going into 2011, and we anticipate this continue to be in our favor and we see the revenue growth moderately grow positively and the &#x2013; and we also would like to have a new quality in terms of how we guide from the bottom line to the &#x2013; from the top line to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>And close another chapter what we have spent many, many hours and discussions together; what is above, what is below, what are the exceptions, what are not the exceptions? Now, it's very simple. It's a commitment for management where you can look how we are doing relative on a rolling quarterly basis on a growth versus key competitors and what is falling through at the continuing operation spaces after-tax and the rest is our responsibility, our commitment and this is, I think, also a new quality and this guidance is certainly meant not to disappoint. And with this, I would like to open it up, Joe and myself, for the questions what you have. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sir. It's a Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please; firstly, I would like to welcome the much higher dividend, it's very pleasing to see. You still have surplus capital on your own calculation on this basis and assuming you grow profitably that surplus capital is going to build up. So, what are your plans to do with that?</p>
          <p>You obviously haven't done a special dividend this time. Do you plan to invest that money on acquisitions or can you talk about what your plans are there? Secondly, you're not that far off your return on capital target, can you talk about &#x2013; do you have a time table to hit the return on capital target? And then thirdly, SIS has been a ongoing restructuring story for a long time, is the end game finally close?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Peter, that's a quick list of questions. So anyway, SIS, we've closed the restructuring, its main focus, we've been pretty, I believe, especially for the German environment and the fact that this has been the third big restructuring wave in the last probably less than 10 years, went reasonably quick. We were able to book 383 million charges for 2,000-plus people in Germany and another 2,000-plus, 2,400 actually, in outside Germany, so that then actually &#x2013; we get those costs will be out of the SIS division starting October 1. So that will give them a big bit boost in terms of cost effectiveness.</p>
          <p>What needs to be done now is to develop the customer story, to incrementally gain current value over profitable growth going forward, and it's now the main focus of SIS. But otherwise, we are just starting the next cycle of building up restructuring for the years to come. So that's where we at and if anything changes and progresses to that, we'll update you without delay. Now on the &#x2013; when do we hit the ROCE targets. I mean, we've been at &#x2013; depending on how we look at it, at 10% or comparable 13.</p>
          <p>We set the near target into the years to come of 15 to 20. There is a slight change in the definition because we want to focus much more on the Industrial piece of Siemens. Their ROCE matters and take out the financial part of it, their ROCE couldn't be anything but meaningful, which is SFS. That's why do return on equity for SFS and do Industrial ROCE on the Industrial environment that &#x2013; out of comparability reason.</p>
          <p>There has been a very detailed description on what the changes have been and how they are impacting the calculation, first and second, I know there will be concerns about ROCE, how define it and how to deal with it. We are crystal clear in our filing. We would also make sure that we very detailed describe on which item in the P&amp;L and the balance sheet is going to be considered how. So any literate reader can actually follow the path from the balance sheet from the P&amp;L into the ROCE calculation. There is no alchemic component to it and we will be accountable for that in any given point in time. I mean if we give &#x2013; if we give 15 to 20 and are at 13, obviously, you know this is a target for the years to come and I wouldn't really feel comfortable on when we're exactly going to hit it. But we are working hard on being there quickly.</p>
          <p>And the surplus capital, that's a luxury problem to have. I mean we've done at least the first meaningful thing, which is giving money back to shareholders and that will only take care of 2.7 billion of that pile. And you can be &#x2013; and that also is one of the, I believe, the beautiful parts of the One Siemens framework. It is a very clear description on the obligations and accountability we've given ourselves in communicating and acting to the markets. One is the capital structure goal, which obviously is net debt over EBITDA, 0.5 to 1.0. So if we are continuously below the 0.5, something is going to happen in terms of what we do with the money, first of all.</p>
          <p>Secondly, all of a sudden, everyone thinks that, oh my god, they are going to spend and waste the money for acquisitions. But then if you turn your attention to the left part of the One Siemens, you will see that there are very clear, very well defined hurdle rates for the organization on how to spend money based on acquisitions.</p>
          <p>So I'm sure that a material component of the future growth story will also consist of acquisitions, but they need to &#x2013; that we have a default on how to handle them. And the default is first. There's got to be capital decision, there's got to be EVA and need to earn the cost of capital two years after acquisition, and they need to actually already achieve the ROCE target three years after integration depending on what asset we deal with, could take up to three years. So it's obviously a longer period of time till that's needs to be made good on. I want to make sure that there is a very clear default rule on how to make acquisition and where not. They need to have synergetic value, ideally, both the acquisition as well as the buyer.</p>
          <p>And in terms of where at, they need to be in the center of the integrated technology company. That's where they need to be at because it is where the maximum of synergy happens in the company. And that also could mean by growing in the center of an integrated technology company, there should also be a contribution to make the company and continue to make the company less complex with divestitures along the edges of the value chain. So that's our philosophy and that's how we are handling it, that particular matter.</p>
          <p>So the One Siemens, definitely, you know, offers the opportunity to grow but also set hurdle rates in both how we distribute the money and how we do acquisition. That's all I believe we should tell at this point in time. Everything else, we'll discuss based on the actions that will be taken.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Mark Troman from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. I've got two questions, please. Firstly, in terms of the growth benchmarking against competitors and the incentives you're putting into the organization, Peter, I wonder if you could spend a few minutes how that actually works. I mean, if you have benchmarking against GE, is it the country manager for Healthcare in the U.S. will be benchmarking his imaging growth versus that of GE and get rewarded accordingly? How deep does this go down into the organization and what are the rules here in terms of capital and margin in terms of gaining market share? That's question one.</p>
          <p>And question two, on the new EBITDA margin ranges, it looks as though you're at the very top end of the Healthcare and Energy numbers and, Joe, very comprehensively went through a whole host of issues further the down the P&amp;L for next year in pricing. Is it fair to &#x2013; is there any margin upside in the Industrial division where you still are a little way off the top side, so how should we interpret the margin guidance as really the only upside there is in the Industrial division? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Market terms of how we position in terms of relative to competition. The important thing is that we have a very, very detailed benchmarking exercise that the relevant divisions are benchmarking themselves against their competitors. I mean you have pretty much seen it when you went through Capital Market Days and others. It's exactly the same principle. So the Healthcare division or Siemens has, of course, as one of the benchmarks the Healthcare division of GE and others. The Lighting division has obviously the benchmark Philips and then it rolls up. So it's a very detailed set of competitors which are relatively to each other, basically positioned.</p>
          <p>And this is really rolled up for all the divisions and the sectors. So it's not a company-wide where we simple take a company, we really do it in a same way as we have done under the old program. The deep, detailed direct part of the competition as far as we can do it. We cannot do it everywhere and always, but as far as we can, we're benchmarking against the direct peer group of either a company or part of a bigger company who is competed against them. So, that's really what we do. And maybe you can give an update on the margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And obviously &#x2013; it's basically on divisional level, so the accountability sits on the divisional level, and then the divisional CEO, you know, takes targets down to make it happen on that level. Otherwise the granularity gets a little awkward at sometimes. In terms of the EBITDA margins we've set forth, it's again, I think it needs to be repeated a few times just to make sure that we're on the same boat. Those EBITDA margins we've been taking out is our assumption on what the peak and trough margins ranges ought to be over the cycle in those industries. That's the assumption. Okay?</p>
          <p>So, if it's trough, we are down, if it's peak, it's just around, up there in that level. That is the assumption. And you want to be in the leading pack of that peak and trough, if and when it happens, the first assumption. If those assumptions prove to be wrong then the continuous improvement aspirations is a default. Okay? There is always a combination that there is no way out say okay, I'm going to set, you know, conservative margins and then fine. That's not the way it works, so if that proves to be more aggressive then, obviously, we need to take it in consideration and then it falls into the aspiration of competitive &#x2013; relative competitiveness. That's the first aspect.</p>
          <p>The second is, how can &#x2013; how to become, how do we arrive at this type of margin levels between peak and trough. Well, first of all, we believe that the markets, the customers, competitors do not accept more and higher margins and if the margins go up, someone else is coming and tries to get the piece of it, new entrants or something like that. So that's the &#x2013; that's the important aspect. And the second is, as you have rightfully said and that is the second point we took first, technically understand by redeploying the operational costs, which have been at corporate before, now being to the sectors, you need to deduct 80 to 100 basis points of what you see today into Q4 numbers. Okay, just that we have a straight comparability.</p>
          <p>And now going forward, it's right to believe that healthcare is at the very peak &#x2013; the very peak of what is achievable in that market. The other ones obviously are a bit below. So there could be aspects there too. But then again, assuming that we are at the upper part, the upper quartile of performance, today, the conclusion of course is more than logic that we focus at the second factor of sustainable profit generation and that's growth times margin.</p>
          <p>And now comes the beauty of it. The moment we see that the profit pool allows more profitability based on the industries, the company needs to reallocate its focus from growth to cost productivity because all the others do that much better. There's always a variable into based on the profit pool. So the system says, aspiration, continuous improvement against peers, period.</p>
          <p>Secondly, assumption on the industries, which may change over time and if we change to the upper part then the company needs to reallocate its focus from growth more again into productivity, cost saving, benchmarking on you know who is able to do matters better than anyone else. So this is the &#x2013; this is the integrated system of the One Siemens. It is what the method is all about.</p>
          <p>So your question on Industry, yes, we are not at the peak levels yet. There might be some product mix macros going forward, but the assumption is true. If you believe 15 is what is the best, and we're at 12.8, then obviously, there is some room there to go.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas Willi, JPMorgan. Two questions please, the first one on growth with the increased focus on growth, should we expect an increase also of the proportion of a solution system turnkey businesses at Siemens in the mix going forward because these tend to be easier and quicker to grow than products or services and are you comfortable now with Siemens pursuing more of contracting risk again going forward? Also in light that there was still some issues going on in some of your divisions also in 2010.</p>
          <p>And the second question on OSRAM, there is potentially a big investment need coming for LED, are you comfortable pursuing that as aggressive as some of your competitors? We're seeing lots of equipment going into China, partly state-driven to build LED champions there. What's your view on that market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andreas, your first question is a very important one because many of you know the history of our company, particularly in the surprises in the areas of large projects what you are highlighting in the past. There is a massive fundamental difference. In the old days, these projects were very much driven locally. And as we have shared with you over the last number of quarters, we have significantly changed the process. And &#x2013; so it's a direct &#x2013; this is a direct responsibility of the divisional top leadership team globally. So, nobody can go for solution businesses if this is not clearly signed off and evaluated and assessed at the top echelon of the global division. And this is fundamental.</p>
          <p>What is the incentive? It's &#x2013; of course, one element is growth. The other one is a free cash flow target and if they want to increase the ROCE, they have obviously to make sure that the margin quality is maintained. So, there is a very, very high &#x2013; and we have, in addition from an incentive perspective going forward, 50% of the annual cash compensation is also paid out in stock. So, there is a very, very strong incentive that absolute &#x2013; the clarity of what we have achieved in this business is there &#x2013; continues to be there and you should not anticipate that there is a change. Simple, there is an easy way out. Just go for the big integrated turnkey project, and then everybody will be fine on the growth agenda. No, this is not the intention and we have enough hurdle rates and stringent processes in place to really ensure that this is not happening and maybe, Joe, you &#x2013; I let you also explain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That is absolutely right. There is the aspect of a extremely stringent so called LOA, Limit of Authority, in terms of bigger projects. And then, obviously, the temptation is there because usually those project business also have quite the decent ROCE with prepayments and the likes and very slow margins. But we want &#x2013; we do not want the businesses to be below the best industry margins. That's why we have made sure that everyone understands that we have industry margins in those respective sectors are, and we do not want them to drop below. Otherwise, the focus needs to be shifting back to margins and not to extension of growth based on stable margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Other question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OSRAM.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, OSRAM. Yeah, well, I mean, probably the answer is, your observation is right on the investment needs in predominately &#x2013; there are actually two categories on investment needs in the Lighting environment. The first one is the massive expansion of the semiconductor environment predominately that the wafer fab environment. We've been continuing to invest into the Austrian semiconductor market, because they still had wafer fabs, which could incrementally be equipped with the equipment and deliver quickly. This &#x2013; it came to a massive investment in building new wafer fabs. Obviously, that question will need considered in more detail. That's the first topic.</p>
          <p>And we are pretty close to what we believe happens in that industry in terms of growth cycle also coming from TVs and the likes and so on and so forth. So while you usually do that without looking to your own business, you look into the equipment manufacturer for MOCVD because there is other machines which are being needed to do the wafer fab layer. So that's quite a good method to look at not being caught flat-footed in the late stage of investment pressure.</p>
          <p>Then the second topic is the forward integration. There will be more downstream over time. And obviously, one of the other competitors needed to be a bit more quickly because they could not really afford to lose one important lick in a portfolio environment. We've been more decent on the matter.</p>
          <p>We've had our easy quick chunks in Diagnostics. I'm not there, but I believe we have got time to understand what really happens in the downstream way. The jury is still out on who is going to win over whom and I think one should not get into the way of consolidation in that particular matter. So we do not believe that we've missed an opportunity, yeah, either way.</p>
          <p>If you look at our growth and our margins, both at OSRAM and compare them to the environment, you can see that at this point of time there is no reason for Siemens to be concerned about anything. So therefore, if we are not lacking growth, we obviously, are not missing anything and if we are not lacking margins then we've done what was right and have not jumped stupidly into something which costs a lot of margin over time. But you are right, there is &#x2013; there are directions here for paradigm shifts and we will make sure that we are not going to be caught too late in the cycle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe as a third investment, restructuring in OSRAM, in terms of shutting down plants? GE and Philips have taken quite some charges to close some plants. What are the plans at Siemens?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OSRAM has to over time. Naturally they have been in forefront of acting quickly in 2009 and in the first half of 2010. If you look at it, obviously, they have been doing quite enough that it hasn't made the work to the news. So they've been &#x2013; have been shedding thousands of jobs when the sector &#x2013; the Lighting sector got hit, that's one of the first ones because they are very early cycle. They've done a very decent job.</p>
          <p>They were caught by surprise for one quarter, as you all know, Q4 2009, but then they acted very diligently and very diligently and there is no massive structural demand, now to reallocate resources. There will always be locally placed alignments, but all those local based alignments which we are not only having in OSRAM, but elsewhere in the company because it's an ongoing living organism. It's included in what we are committed to deliver at least. So that's also a new quality. We do not need to talk about restructuring here and that issue there and a acquisition there. It's all in &#x2013; it's a downside protection it's all in. And if there are material impacts from acquisitions or divestitures, we will update the guidance the moment we know what exactly that we are talking about.</p>
          <p>So that's also a new way of being clear about accountability and all what we need to include out of, I belief, a prudent thought process. There's legal and regulatory matters of course, but everything else is in &#x2013; everything else is in and that also includes restructuring, which will be ongoing in the company.</p>

          <p>I had a couple of questions. One was just on the Healthcare strategy in particular. You're clearly going for growth and you're signaling that you are obviously at the upper end of the range. When we look at Diagnostics margin, it's very nice to see 4% pick up in the top line but at the same time, sequentially, margins have gone from 19% to 15.5%. Well, I guess then next year, how long should we expect you to persist with the sort of lower margin strategy in order to drive that growth?</p>
          <p>And related to that, on the Imaging and IT side, we are seeing obviously a good build-up in the order book, 9% in the quarter, should we be expecting that you're now willing to do that at significantly lower prices and the Imaging and IT margin too in 2011 could be under pressure? So that was on that one.</p>
          <p>And then a much more kind of big picture question vis-&#xE0;-vis China, you mentioned power transformers in your opening comments and you've got a fantastic position in Power Generation on the steam side with Shanghai Electric. We see these Chinese competitors now in power transformers in rail, they are going to come in other areas too. It's getting ever more prevalent. How does Siemens respond to that on a five-year view? What do you do, do you have to make more joint ventures or do you have to change your business model?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, I will start with your second question first. I would say there is actually not a big surprise and we should anticipate that this is happening, because it's nothing else than what is happening in an industrial &#x2013; in an industrialization of any economy. And of course, the Chinese companies want to be also more competitive and be competitive on the regional level or global level, that's normal. And there is not a singular &#x2013; a singular strategy. So this is not, per se, something which all of a sudden bumps up and say, wow, now we have to find out what to do with this competitive challenge.</p>
          <p>I mean we are in a global market, we have to compete against global competitors in all our markets and this is just one of them. And there is not one response either. In some of the instances like we have done on the steam turbine side, we said well, we make actually a joint approach in terms of joint venture for China and then going for an export joint venture together. In other areas, we have licensed our technology for China.</p>
          <p>A third approach is that we actually for these reasons very much focused now also that we're not just being caught flat-footed in the high end piece of our markets and therefore, a limited set of customer bases. That we also are relevant when China says a big push, for example, for Healthcare is now the rural healthcare development in China and therefore, we need applications and solutions, which are relevant in this area with a different price point and for this reason, we are very much pushing the SMART initiatives with local engineered, local developed, local manufactured and using this as a platform for our business as well and competing in this new segments for us. So there are multitude &#x2013; we have also in the meantime actually 13 research and development centers.</p>
          <p>We have more than 30 &#x2013; 3,000 people in China doing just research and development. Joe has highlighted that the next big push will be application centers where we have very much also put the responsibility, the engineering in conjunction with the product development aspects straight into China and develop this business from the, what we call, end-stream marketplace, very forcefully.</p>
          <p>So, there are a multitude of responses not just one answer, but the general question is we should not be obsessed either. I mean we are facing emerging market competition all over the world from China and from outside China. This is normal way of business and our approach is really fundamentally to have a &#x2013; leverage our base what we have in this emerging markets. I mean we are the company, who is in 190 markets of world. At home, we have already there a big, big industrial base. In China, we have over 90 joint ventures; we have more than 40,000 people.</p>
          <p>So, we can leverage this strength in this regard as well for us and there are multitude of responses but we are not just facing it from China, we are facing it from other emerging economies. If we look into, for example, light rail, I mean there are companies, there are Korean companies like Rotem who are building up their global business.</p>
          <p>When you talk about EPC on the &#x2013; on the Power Generation front, you see Korean companies all of a sudden very, very aggressive. So this is just for us a normal set of challenges what we have to deal with and the answer is business specific and within the business specificity, absolutely make sure that we don't have a blind spot, that we don't &#x2013; because many times, the biggest danger what I see, the biggest danger is that you have a blind spot that you look too narrow in terms of who your competitors are and all of a sudden, you find out, wow, there is somebody actually developing significantly faster, being far more aggressive as I would have anticipated and this is precisely, for example, what happened with us in the telecommunication business.</p>
          <p>We have simply completely underestimated, a couple of years ago, what Cisco can actually do. That Voice-over-Internet protocols all of a sudden will be relevant. Or we have in the telecom equipment market, we are &#x2013; so the biggest, the important thing what we always challenge the operating units and we have a very close eye on, where are emerging competitors and how do we assess their capacity, their capability and what do we do against them? So product, area and business specific response and obviously, multiple responses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was a very complete answer but just to just to go back, if you'd ask the telecom equipment operators three four years ago about the advent of ZTE and Huawei or whatever, they would have said, we can handle this, but the pressure seems to have built far faster than anybody expected and when we look at China in particular, it's very clear that in Power Generation and Power market, it's effectively being state-funded, and dare I say state-sponsored. You have a very successful strategy of joint venture. Is this &#x2013; I guess in principle I am asking, is this the way to go going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but again I can easily say yes and then let's make it very short. But the real answer is, in many instances, you have to have multiple responses. For example, I mean if there is a rail link to be built in Saudi Arabia, the famous Medina rail link. Well, maybe there is a chance where we can team up between a Turkish construction company, component supply from us, rail signaling from us, and the trains coming maybe from China. Maybe this is a combination &#x2013; a winning combination in the certain given environment and not going for joint and several contract liabilities.</p>
          <p>So, that's maybe a specific response in a specific project, which could work for us and in another one, the response and opportunities very, very different. So this is the business reality what I have tried to convey. I do know that this is not maybe satisfactory, that you can immediately put it into a model, but the business reality is that it is very distinct, different and you have to assess case-by-case, but the important thing is that you assess the relevance of these type of competitors right, and then have a very solid discussion with the operating teams around it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think we had one more question on Diagnostics' margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, obviously &#x2013; then as we've seen in telecom, the world needs more than one supplier. Also so therefore, what Peter said is right, we just need to see and act. There will be multiple opportunities. On Diagnostics, as strange as it sounds, this margin deterioration has actually been a good thing. So why is that? It's not easy to &#x2013; why is that? Because for &#x2013; for a long period of time, we've been selling a lot of consumables and our &#x2013; our part of selling instruments has come down.</p>
          <p>And If you have that situation, at face value it looks good, but unfortunately, for the future it actually it's a massive trap. Because if you don't sell your razors, at some point in time you're not going to sell razor blades again. And that's basically the same model here. So, while there's been focus &#x2013; and that was also &#x2013; had been one of the confusions unfortunately, we have been seeing that for a long period of time in margins are okay. Unfortunately, the top line inventory also led to a re-evaluation of the targets we have set originally some time ago.</p>
          <p>And now we focusing much more instrument sales now, the instruments are having a much lesser margin as compared to consumer goods in the beginning, but then eventually they secure and improve their install base. So that's as far as the margins are concerned, but secondly, this is important, it will take time till we are back up on a growth path. Till those instruments incrementally also drive sales of consumer goods. That's just something we need to keep in mind. It will go slower than we all would have wished for, but that's also a matter of this razor/razor blade type of environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're slightly running out of time, I'll ask Martin and then we'll go to James then Simon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Martin Prozesky from Sanford Bernstein. I have three questions please. If I look at the One Siemens targets, for me, the clearly the biggest challenge is going to be in achieving the ROCE range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you expand a bit on what specific efforts you're pushing to kind of reduce capital efficiency, are you doing things like pushing the services businesses harder than rest, is it more internal product development? Is it the more software, is your M&amp;A going to be focused on capital efficient businesses?</p>
          <p>It's the first question, and second, in terms of SIS the operating performance continued to deteriorate in Q4, the underlying. Is this now a bottom given the restructuring is now been mostly negotiated, should we expect this kind of level of operating performance for a while to continue until you've come out with new propositions to the customers, or just what should we expect for the underlying performance of this business in the short term?</p>
          <p>And then, third question, in terms of the prepayment comments you made around 2 billion potential headwinds from a working capital point of view. Can you just clarify, is that a structural change you see in terms of how customers are now prepared to pre-fund big products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right so, the 2 billion is just a kind of a heads up about how material such a impact could be on the free cash flow, you know, if that development happened. Nothing more. So there is no imminent need related to guide you to saying this is going to be significantly lower, which has the massive impact, reason being that if we see a reduced prepayment behavior then obviously, it's gone and then it takes a long time for building up the working capital till you get the money back at the end. So this is important to flag that if we see those changes continuing and apply that to our business in Mobility and the long cycle environment that we typically have those type of environment. Could be as much as 2 billion in the impact year-on-year.</p>
          <p>So that one &#x2013; so it's more technical just to flag it. But there is no imminent guidance here that this could make a massive change going forward in the short term. On SIS, so the division will see the benefits of restructuring as, of first, already because they've kept all the ones who didn't want to move it, then they need to be restructured at this corporate environment, as well as flagging the corporate items, will be impacted by that for a while. So there should actually be a material improvement of the underlying efficiency in the division.</p>
          <p>And then on the One Siemens capital efficiency, I agree with you. This is not a piece of cake because, you know, many matters need to go right till we end up in that range and then still assuming that we are at the upper quartile of the margins. So first, the single biggest and quickest relief and contribution to that goal will come from the activities below the line, below the sector line.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the long term, in the sustainability discussion, it will come from service, taking advantage of the installed base and then make sure that those businesses, which are massively capital efficient and capital consuming carry a huge load of working capital are you know investment driven by wafer fabs and the like, are tightly controlled in terms of their long-term development and that's just a few of examples.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll continue with Simon and James. We still have a lot of people wanting to ask question. We have to hurry up a little bit and we'll continue with James and then we'll move to the left of the room, but we'll start with Simon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Yes, I just have two quick questions. One of them is in terms of the profit bridge that we should use to kind of get from 2010 into 2011. You mentioned in your presentation a number of sort of elements of it, you know, price declines of sort of 2 billion odd and the sort of the SG&amp;A increases and the R&amp;D increases. And obviously, within a sort of normal model, there is an element of when the company is growing those cost lines are growing anyway.</p>
          <p>I just sort of wondered if you could help how we should interpret those as to, is this a build-up of what you would expect if you were going to see modest growth at the top line and how much of it may be exceptional beyond that, in terms of the sort of drop-throughs where you would expect to see excluding or including those costs.</p>
          <p>And the second question which is a follow-up really on the pre-payment, and obviously, as you say, it's something that will happen over time, not immediate, not imminent, but what exactly have you seen change in terms of contract terms of &#x2013; in some areas of the market. We've been sort of used to seeing 20% or 10% pre-payments depending on the industries that we're in. Is there anything particularly in recent contracts that you've seen that would lead to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Simon, and I understand the questions, that's why I was actually scrambling to walk you through that bridge already in my presentation. So if you have noted it down, you should end up in a significant part of the explanations of why the guidance is designed as it is. The way you want to do it is, first of all, it's all in. It's continued &#x2013; continued operation after-tax, restructuring is in that. It's all in except discontinued.</p>
          <p>So no up and down in the excuses back and forth and over backwards firstly generally. Secondly, the other topic is that I mean obviously, there have been some negative one-offs in 2010, but there's also been positives, so if we do that like-for-like, you also need to consider the positives. So it is about, if I do the math here, 1.2 billion around about was DX, about 300 million was the employee bonus. About 600 million was total restructuring, round numbers, another 300 million was other one-offs in projects and the likes. So that would count as much as 2.3, 2.4 one-offs.</p>
          <p>Obviously, one need to consider the tax impact because we go down to continued operations after-tax, but the end comes the positive when SRE disposals, it's about 300 million. Then other disposals and assets, smaller ones about 200. Pension curtailment about 300, compliance recovery about 100 and FX impact about 200-plus. So for the real quick ones, who have been adding that up on the top of your heads, you can see it's much less dramatic and one or the other might have though, just adding up the negatives and add them to the 2010 line.</p>
          <p>I mean, obviously understand you know that if you do that type of math, people will say, what the hell is going on with you and your 25 to 35% at least. We understand that and that's why we are a transparent company. We walk you through the assumptions we are making. If someone tells me you know and raises hell and high water about how bad the Chinese or how massively the Chinese are coming after anyone who is even close in transformers. Well, it shouldn't come by surprise that the company put some higher intensity of competitiveness into the pricing. And all that pricing increase, which we have just mentioned from about 2-ish, 2%, 2.5 to 3, 3.3, guess where it's coming from? Energy.</p>
          <p>So, this is 500, 600 million on pricing. We've talked about the supply chain impact and we also talked about those means we deliberately are taking as a company to invest into sustainable capital efficient, value creating growth on R&amp;D, or engineering and on the go-to-market and by the same token, we keep the G&amp;A flat. So that means more productivity in order to cover for inflation and workers and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>So, that's been a pretty transparent pictures of what we assumed. The beauty again is by announcing that, we have to spend it yet. So now we have been taking the pace down on SG&amp;A and now we are very, very focused to make a decision on where to spend money on application centers, because there's got to be resources spend if we want to penetrate the markets as Peter has been laying out in terms of service and so on and so forth, because one doesn't go without the other. So now it's about the management to balance between spending &#x2013; investing in resources and get the quick benefit back on growth.</p>
          <p>And in terms of &#x2013; that's the beauty of it. And so we are down and when need to decide to spend it, we spend it. If we &#x2013; for example, in six &#x2013; in about half year's timeframe, we see that the global economy is being impacted by all sorts of currency, war and of the protectionist &#x2013; what else is in the air right now. We may change our mind. We are not going to invest as much as we might have done if our assumption had been coming along as we started. This is the way we want to communicate to the markets in what we do. Of course we don't talk about the strategies because if we talk about it, everyone else start it if they believe it is a good idea and that's &#x2013; please, bear with us, why we are not as specific as on what contract we are expecting to win and what area we are going to penetrate next.</p>
          <p>So that as a general remark, now on your &#x2013; on the prepayment matter. There have been a few contracts, mostly in big infrastructure areas, for example, Mobility, but also longer term contracts on energy generation, where people got a little less, as I said, at accomplishing in terms of the prepayment. So we see some financing changes in the marketplace. It obviously, in terms, make us ask for more margin. That's how the way it looks. Now then, if you ask some more margin, margin develops over time with the progress on POC whereas the lack of prepayment, obviously, goes to the free cash flow right away. So that's been the thought process on that particular matter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. James Stettler from UniCredit. I guess we can hope your guidance this year is as conservative as it was last year. I guess we'll see that. Three questions quickly, just on emerging markets. I mean, clearly you are looking to grow that. That will be much bigger than 30% going forward. Do you believe you can have the same margins there as you do in very profitable markets like Germany given the pricing pressure that's been discussed? Power Generation has turned, or Energy in general has turned. You're at peak margins now. Why do you think the margins can't go up, is it more mix issue or is that where you start seeing the pricing pressure coming in? And then finally, on the whole...</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly Energy, yeah, where you are at 15% at the moment. And just finally on NSN, how actively are you involved in trying to find another shareholder for that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one I'll answer for Joe. He's spending too much time on it. Now, Joe, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have nothing to add to that, but maybe that's an encouragement to spend that time more effectively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just joking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the other topic on the &#x2013; there is no reason &#x2013; there is no reason that the in the emerging markets should be less than in developed markets if you get the right product offering. The issue however of course is that the baseline is smaller. So in terms of absolute number of profitability, it's smaller. Of course, the pricing would be down but the cost can also be down. So there is no reason to let the margins in percentiles, but obviously the volume goes down too so that may have some impact.</p>
          <p>And then on the Energy, I do not expect energy to materially increase its margins, it's got to come from growth. There is too much market intensity on the T environment, distribution is nice but pretty much up there where you can be and the Fossil matter, I mean, we have discussed that before. We have meaningful competitors. They are very strong and getting stronger. We've fortunately, thanks to Peter, one of his first actions in the business was to increase the share with Shanghai Electric and especially the cooperation.</p>
          <p>And now this single biggest ever order announcement from an Indian company is also in part ours. So this is good. Because the option would have been zero. So it's not all that bad to team up. The real point to make which will decide about success or not success at end is how does it balance cooperation and partnership versus competitive environment. That's the big matter and this is every company, every CEO, every, you know one needs to decide that for themselves because at the end, that will make a difference between the very successful and between trying to be successful One last question.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Olivier Esnou, Exane BNP. Few questions, maybe because we haven't touched upon, why did you go for EBITDA margin target, rather than some people believe more orthodox EBITA margin target? Secondly, after allocating the part of the corporate cost back to the division, what is left really as a run rate for next year for corporate cost, how should we model that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't get the last one, is that the last question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward after you allocated part of it back to the divisions, what is left going forward of run rate spending? Maybe a last quick one. I am just trying reconcile more generally the fact that you are highlighting in your introduction that there is some mix effect, negative mix here because there is more emerging market growth, less demand coming from Germany, et cetera. With the fact that, at the same time, you are saying Siemens maybe at the end of 12 years of restructuring. This for me means, if anything, you should maybe continue to restructure and reduce your exposure to major countries in terms of cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try it. On EBITA versus EBITDA, fine, could have been chosen either one. We've got EBIT, we've got EBITA, we've got EBITDA in our financial statements which we issue every quarter. There is not going to be a change to that, so pick either one you like the most. So that's also about transparency so we have decided for EBITDA but we also of course contend that EBITA  would have also been a decent way of doing it. We delivered EBIT because then if someone acquires or disowns anyone, then there is a massive change, and that's again a complexity which we didn't want to have.</p>
          <p>On corporate cost, I understand the question. We will respond to it, I'd like to do the following. We will &#x2013; after we have our audited numbers as of December 1, okay, we will put a bridge into the investors IR website. And then they see what has been the old, what is new, what are the changes where you can very quickly see on what the impact is on the line items. Because if we discuss that now, that probably adds more to confusion, than it helps, all right. And it's only a weekend I have or two weeks, so we will do that. There will be transparency on the matter. And the cost don't go away. And so therefore, there is no material impact, so that will be very clear on this one.</p>
          <p>Maybe on the mix effect, I think, we need to clarify on &#x2013; all I was saying in 2010 goes back to short cycle, high profitability, high gross margin businesses such as Industrial Automation, OSRAM and in part, Drive Technology as it is related to Motion Control have been growing massively and obviously those products and those divisions have completely different margin and gross margin environments than Mobility or IS or Renewable have. So you get then inherent change of mix going forward then they see they are growing but not as massively as deep as they have come up from the trough of the business.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; in terms of regional, I was slowly putting back to Germany, because they've been down as long as you can think and then again, they have been also buying premium products. But that hasn't seemed to do with that margins are worse elsewhere in the world. It is just on average. So this just that it was a predominant help to the margins to explain the mix impact.</p>
          <p>Now on the other topic and this is a very important and, Peter, if you allow, I take that question even though it probably was addressed to you. When Peter said that this restructuring story in a way ends, this is not about the company now stopping restructuring and it's over, it only gives people 300 million every year. That's not what it's meant to be, absent it will be not.</p>
          <p>This matter was about that the transformation process ought to be over. Transformation is not about not restructuring or not looking for the best products or not looking for the best people. This is about changing the company's culture. You know my pick up, make sure that all the thoughts which have been put into the transformation into the new organization as of 2008, that this now made it all the way down in the company. That people understand what the CEO principle is all about, not just driving a nice company car but this is also about accountability. That they are the ones responsible for business and that controls are in place which are not there for suggesting whether they apply or not, but to follow them.</p>
          <p>And this takes time and this part of organizational culture of transformation is over and now we drive upon business results and not look at every little single enabler whether or not the enablers have been made good on. It is about how CEOs now combine those enablers and make a meaningful contribution to the value. That's what we meant and this is important.</p>
          <p>So we will continue to restructure and there will be hundreds of millions spent every year on making the business pick up because perhaps, you now run out of lifecycle and then we'll build their mills here because this is where the customer wants us to build them. And then contrary to economies which are in trouble, either way in the world, they cannot move to where life is easier, but companies always can reallocate their resources based on where demand happens.</p>
          <p>And that's will always happen, as a company, we have the benefits that we have been in most of those countries already. So we can always reallocate matters and make sure that we get the most out of it. So this is what has been meant in now ending. We could have had a Fit4 2015. Again, of course, with all previous matters too, but we wanted to actually now make &#x2013; test the company as I look at the divisions. So this is what we need to do and this is how we are doing it and then you are up on your own for getting it done new plan. I think that was important that to clarify what was meant from transformation versus restructuring.</p>

          <p>It's James Moore at Redburn Partners. Three quick ones if I could &#x2013; could you put a percentage -</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just gave you a last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, could you percentage on moderate? Could you talk about pricing in orders for Energy versus revenues in the quarter in percentage terms and could you roughly size the SIS carve-out impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so first it was about the language, right? So we discussed that already this morning with the press and so significant would be above 10%, okay? And clear could probably be between five and 10, all right? And now you need to figure out what moderate could be. So, SIS, could you help me on this one again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about further carve-out costs in the corporate line coming, could you put a size on what that will be in euro millions, just to give us a feel?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It could be a meaningful number. Could be a meaningful number 200, 300 and if you put 300, you're safe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the pricing in Energy orders versus revenues in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The order backlog has not suffered in gross margin as compared to the P&amp;L which put out, so it's still about making good on project execution and there is no reason to assume that the gross margins will be materially less. All right?</p>
