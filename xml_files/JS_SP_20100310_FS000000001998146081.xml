        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, everyone and welcome. Let's get started. And thank you for joining us for the presentation of Jardine Matheson's 2009 Results. I think we've given you the release for Jardine Matheson itself. Jardine Strategic is in the process of getting printed; that will be with you shortly.</p>
          <p>So to begin with, I'll give you a snapshot of the Group and show you where our profit came from in 2009. I'll then give you an overview of our performance before reviewing some of the major developments in the Group during last year. And finally, I'll consider briefly the outlook for 2010.</p>
          <p>Our Finance Director, James Riley, will then provide some more detailed commentary and analysis of the results, including those of the individual company, and we'll both be happy to take any questions you may have at the end.</p>
          <p>This shows the level of the ownership at the Jardine Matheson Holdings level of the various companies together with the share of profit, which we derive from them. The four biggest contributors were Hongkong Land, Astra, Dairy Farm and Jardine Pacific.</p>
          <p>For the first half of last year, many of our businesses suffered from negative trading conditions that were really prevailing globally. Although the magnitude was less felt in our home market in East Asia, the Group reported at the interim stage a 13% decline in underlying profit. However, the second part of 2009 saw a significant recovery in most of our activity.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole, the Group's revenue, including associates counted as 100%, declined marginally to $36 billion; it was roughly flat. But despite this, the Group's underlying profit increased by 23% to just over $1 billion. Our earnings per share increased 22% to $2.84. Dividend per share will be &#x2013; is proposed to be up 20% for the year to $0.90.</p>
          <p>As you can see in the table presented, excellent earnings growth was achieved at Hongkong Land, Dairy Farm and Astra. It's worth noting that Astra's result in U.S. dollar terms was affected by adverse currency movements that took place in the early part of last year.</p>
          <p>Jardine Pacific, Jardine Motors and the Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage businesses outside Astra all reported a satisfactory contribution. Jardine Lloyd Thompson performed well in sterling terms, but this became negative to us on translation into U.S. dollars.</p>
          <p>Among our major businesses, Mandarin Oriental was the most severely affected by weak sentiment from both corporate and leisure travelers. The 56% decline in corporate and other interests of the Group was largely due to a lower contribution from Rothschild. James Riley will go into all of this in more detail.</p>
          <p>Let me move to a few highlights of the major developments around the Group. Within Jardine Pacific's Group of Companies, the engineering and construction businesses performed well, and Gammon benefited from increased works in the public sector. Our aviation and shipping-related operations experienced a significant decline in both rates and volumes, although particularly in air cargo, there has been a recent recovery.</p>
          <p>Jardine Motors had a slow start last year, but saw a very good recovery in the second half. The U.K. motor market continued to suffer from low demand for luxury cars, but our operations there mitigated that by excellent cost reductions and working capital control.</p>
          <p>In Hong Kong, the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class in May helped to boost sales. And in our China Zung Fu operations excellent sales growth was achieved in a buoyant market. Despite difficult trading conditions, Jardine Lloyd Thompson had a good year and profits increased in sterling term, which is of course its reporting currency. It grew revenue both organically and through bolt-on acquisitions. At the same time, its effective cost reduction program continued.</p>
          <p>Hongkong Land, which is now consolidated as a subsidiary, saw further growth in rental income. After a fall in market rentals during the first part of the year, demand revived, particularly in Singapore, although taken as a whole, rental reversions had started to turn negative towards the end of the year. That's not a across the board, but here and there.</p>
          <p>A very good contribution was received from the residential sector in Hongkong Land. The projects in Macau, Mainland China and Singapore were completed. And towards the end of the year, the Group secured a major new development in Chongqing in joint venture with China Merchants.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm added a further 431 stores, bringing the total of its number of outlets across Asia to over 5,000. There were good performances from its supermarkets, hypermarkets and health and beauty stores across the region, though convenient stores in Hong Kong and in South China experienced tougher trading environments. Good progress was made with growing Mannings health and beauty operation in Mainland China, reaching 120 outlets by the year-end.</p>
          <p>Mandarin Oriental mitigated the fall in revenue by good cost management without compromising its high quality. Its development program progressed with three new hotels opened in 2009 in Sanya, Barcelona and Las Vegas. Its Chicago property reopened in October following extensive renovations. We now have 25 hotels in operation and a further 16 under development. As previously announced, Mandarin Oriental sold at a good profit its 50% interest in its Macau hotel. A new Mandarin Macau in Hongkong Land's One Central development will be opened later on this year.</p>
          <p>Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage reported a gain on disposal from the 51 stake in Tunas Ridean, its associate finance business. Recently, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage has increased its shareholding in Tunas Ridean to 44%, and it's also raised its shareholding in its Vietnam associate Truong Hai Auto Corporation to 29%.</p>
          <p>Astra did well to offset the fall in the Indonesian four-wheeler market by raising its market share to 58%, while in the two-wheeler market, which is also declining, Astra maintained its 46% share despite stiff competition.</p>
          <p>United Tractors' mining and contracting subsidiary, Pamapersada, continued to expand and extracted 68 million tons of coal last year, which was actually an increase of 50%. Astra Agro also achieved improvements in both production and productivity, but it experienced a decline in profit as the palm oil prices fell.</p>
          <p>I'll now touch on the outlook for 2010. As you all know, the economies of East Asia, particularly China and Indonesia, fared much better last year from the developed world, but many uncertainties remain, making it difficult to predict exactly how strong demand will be in the many business sectors in which we operate. We do feel, however, that our strong market positions will serve us well and our strong balance sheet will give us the capability to seize opportunity as they arrive.</p>
          <p>As part of our ongoing investments in Group company shares, Jardine Strategic today just now announced a tender offer for the repurchase of approximately 1% of its outstanding share capital. It's making a $250 million offer per shares, its own shares in the region of $18 to $19, in the range from $18 to $19, which represents premium of 4.7% to 10.5% to yesterday's market close.</p>
          <p>I'll now pass you on to James, and look forward to your questions at the end. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Anthony. I'll now go over in little more depth the financial results of Jardine Matheson, Jardine Strategic and their principal investments, and I should note at the outset that all of the dollar figures that I will mention will be U.S. dollars, unless I say otherwise.</p>
          <p>The Group's key earnings performance measure is, of course, underlying profit attributable to shareholders or what we normally refer to as underlying profit. This excludes non-trading items, which we identify separately in order to find a greater understanding of the Group's underlying business performance.</p>
          <p>Underlying profit was $1.01 billion for the year, an increase of 23% on last year, and underlying earnings per share were $2.84, up 22%.You will recall at the half year the Group's earnings was 13% down on the prior year and I noted that business conditions for some businesses would continue to be difficult whilst for others they will prove more benign.</p>
          <p>The positive full-year growth in earnings of 23%, therefore, represents something of a turnaround reflecting some excellent results for the Group as a whole during the latter part of the year, as well as the relatively weak comparative period during the second half of 2008, when the financial crisis was beginning to affect some of our businesses. In the event, the decline in the results from Mandarin Oriental was more than offset by increased contributions from Hongkong Land, most businesses in Astra, and from Dairy Farm.</p>
          <p>One notable event during the year, which is worth mentioning at this point, was the small increase in Jardine Strategic's stake in Hongkong Land that took it through to 50%. As a result, we began consolidating Hongkong Land with effect from the 30th of June.</p>
          <p>The impact on the Group's underlying profits was minimal, as we only raised our stake by less than 1%, but it has had an impact on how both the balance sheet and, to a lesser extent, the profit and loss account look in our accounts.</p>
          <p>Group revenues, including the revenue of associates, decreased by 1% to just under $36 billion. This reflected the inclusion of revenue from Hongkong Land's joint ventures for the second half and the increases in Dairy Farm and Zung Fu's China sales, more than offset by falls in the revenues of Astra automotive businesses, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, Jardine Motors in the U.K., and JOS.</p>
          <p>Non-trading items for the year totaled $594 million. These included a $357 million gain on the revaluation of investment properties in Hongkong Land, as well as the $19 million gain on Jardine Pacific's investment portfolio. Other large non-trading items include gains on the disposal of Mandarin Oriental's 50% interest in its Macau property, the disposal of the Group's interest in Tata Industries, a net discount arising on the acquisition of Hongkong Land, and the derecognition of perpetual liabilities in Rothschilds Continuation, those last two being slightly technical accounting figures rather than ones that you'll naturally relate to.</p>
          <p>The revaluation of investment properties in Hongkong Land takes a more complicated form on the face of the P&amp;L account this year, which is perhaps worth mentioning. In the first half, the value of Hongkong Land's investment properties fell, and thus a non-trading loss was recorded in the Jardine Matheson books under the share of results of associates. In the second half, the value of the properties increased quite materially.</p>
          <p>By this stage, Hongkong Land was already a subsidiary, and the uplift is therefore recorded under non-trading, in the operating profit line, the tax line and minority interests. Therefore, it takes a combination of elements of all four of these lines to come to the net uplift on revaluation of $357 million that's been summarized in this table on the screen.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the balance sheet, shareholders' funds have increased 20%, from $8.2 billion to $9.9 billion, with NAV per share standing at $27.69. The principal elements in this gain were the profit for the year, including the uplift in the value of Hongkong Land's investment properties, gains on the revaluation of other investments, and exchange translation differences.</p>
          <p>The face of the balance sheet has changed considerably, as I said, from last year because of the consolidation of Hongkong Land. But I'll leave it to you if you wish to ask any questions on that.</p>
          <p>I've also shown on this slide a figure for adjusted shareholders' funds. This assumes the write back of the deferred tax, but international standards still require us to provide on the revaluation of investment properties in Hong Kong, even though no such tax is payable. One day, the rules will change, but it hasn't happened yet.</p>
          <p>And with this anomaly remedied, the adjusted shareholders' funds for Jardine Matheson are 10% higher than the reported figure, giving an adjusted NAV per share of $30.43. Overall, the Group benefits from surplus cash, strong operating cash flows, and substantial committed facilities, with no significant refinancing requirements over the coming year.</p>
          <p>At the end of 2009, the undrawn committed facilities of the Group exceeded $2.9 billion. In addition, the Group had available liquid funds of over $4 million. The cash inflow from operating activities for the year was $2,786 million. This represents an increase of $695 million on 2008, principally due to higher operating profit with the inclusion of Hongkong Land for the first time. Capital expenditure for the year before disposals and excluding any notional adjustments for the acquisition of Hongkong Land amounted to $1,653 million.</p>
          <p>This included $747 million for the purchase of tangible assets, mainly in Dairy Farm, Mandarin Oriental and Astra; $293 million of advances to associates and joint ventures, mainly in Hongkong Land on the residential properties; $77 million for the purchase of plantations in Astra, and $157 million for the acquisition of shares in Tata Power.</p>
          <p>The Group also invested $114 million in increasing its interest in Group companies. The sale of Mandarin Oriental's 50% interest in its Macau property and Jardine Strategic Holding in Tata Industries contributed $90 million and $157 million, respectively, to the Group's cash flow.</p>
          <p>Net borrowings for the Group, excluding those relating to Astra's financial services companies, ended the year at $2.2 billion, representing 9% of total equity. This was substantially down on the $3.1 billion of net debt at the end of 2008, assuming the pro forma consolidation of Hongkong Land at that point.</p>
          <p>Then the net debt of our financial services subsidiaries in Astra increased by $302 million as their overall loan book grew. At the Jardine Matheson Holding Company level, we had net cash of $246 million at the 31st of December, up from $195 million at the end of the previous year.</p>
          <p>Jardine Matheson took its Jardine Strategic dividend in script and Jardine Strategic also took its Jardine Matheson dividend in script. Jardine Strategic has a net cash position of $110 million due to net dividend receipts of $471 million during the year, but offsetting this were share purchases in Hongkong Land, Mandarin Oriental, and Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage of $99 million. Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage ended the year with a cash position of $1 million, a similar level to last year.</p>
          <p>Now turning to the businesses we group as Jardine Pacific, I'll begin with Gammon, which had another five year with a number of landmark projects currently under way. Its order book has risen to $2.3 million.</p>
          <p>Another sector that performed well during the year was engineering with JEC's underlying profit contribution up 48%, a result of both good performance in most of its businesses and some provision releases. Jardine Schindler also achieved good earnings growth, up 48% with improved contributions from both the new installation and maintenance operations and the reversal of a $2 million provision made in 2008.</p>
          <p>HACTL experienced an annual cargo throughput decline of 8% for the year as a whole, but volumes have strengthened significantly in recent months. Reduced flight frequencies in the aviation sector caused the reduction in contribution from Jardine Aviation. Similarly, Jardine Shipping continued throughout the year with low freight rates and volumes.</p>
          <p>At Jardine One Solution, discretionary IT spending from large financial institutional clients has remained depressed; however, tight cost management has mitigated decreases in contribution. Excellent results from Pizza Hut in Taiwan offset slightly weaker trading in Hong Kong. And since the end of the year, we've also completed the acquisition of the KFC franchise in Taiwan.</p>
          <p>Overall, Jardine Pacific's underlying profit increased by 2% to $119 million; shareholders' funds, $413 million at the end of 2009, representing an underlying return of 31% on average shareholders' funds. And I would note, as ever, that this figure is made more remarkable by the fact that close to 70% of those shareholders' funds are invested in Hong Kong residential property assets, which is producing a single digit, a low single-digit net yield.</p>
          <p>Jardine Motors experienced mixed fortunes during 2009, but with underlying profit increasing by 17% to $51 million. In Hong Kong and Macau, Zung Fu recorded a lower contribution, mainly due to reduced deliveries of Mercedes-Benz passenger cars and tighter margins.</p>
          <p>Market conditions in Southern China were much better, and Zung Fu recorded a 72% increase in the number of units delivered during the year, to over 9,200 units. The trading environment in the U.K. remained challenging, but our focus on cost savings and an improvement in used car margins enabled Jardine Motors U.K. to record a much improved profitability.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday, Jardine Lloyd Thompson announced a satisfying set of results in the U.K. In sterling terms, its underlying profit was up 11%, with organic revenue growth in each of its business segments and an effective cost reduction program. JLT's position in the U.K. pension and benefit sector was further strengthened by the bolt-on acquisition of HSBC Actuaries and Consultants. The fact that JLT's contribution to JMH results fell by 5% is a reflection of the depreciation of sterling against the U.S. dollar year-on-year.</p>
          <p>That completes my review of the businesses directly held under Jardine Matheson. I'll now turn to Jardine Strategic, which achieved underlying profits of $1.082 billion, an increase of 26%, with underlying earnings per share also up 25% at $1.74. The net asset value per share we show for Jardine Strategic is calculated by reference to the market value of the underlying investments held by Jardine Strategic. At the 31st of December, this was up 80%, to $32.64 per share. The Jardine Strategic dividend is proposed to be increased by $0.01 to $0.20 per share, an increase of 5%, which is consistent with the increase over a number of years.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the main listed companies under Jardine Strategic, Hongkong Land's underlying profit increased by 107%, to $777 million, and underlying earnings per share was 111% higher at $34.55. Hongkong Land's final dividend of $0.10 takes the full-year dividend to $0.16, 23% higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Overall, Hongkong Land experienced growth of 19% in its net rental income from commercial properties. But by the end of the year, it's experiencing some negative reversions and occupancy levels were slightly lower at 96%. The Group's Hong Kong central retail portfolio remained fully let. Significant progress was made with the Group's residential development projects, recording a substantial contribution in 2009, significantly up from the breakeven result in 2008.</p>
          <p>Profit was recognized from the completion of a number of residential projects: the sale at Victoria in Hong Kong, One Central Macau, Phase 2 of Bamboo Grove in Chongqing, and MCL Land's Tierra Vue, The Fernhill and Hillcrest Villa.</p>
          <p>Excluding the deferred tax provision on the increase in the value of its investment properties, Hongkong Land's adjusted NAV per share increased by 12% to $6.64. Net debt decreased during the year to $2.4 billion, resulting in year-end gearing of 16%.</p>
          <p>Dairy Farm continued its strong growth of recent years, with revenue including associates increasing by 4% to $8.1 billion, and underlying profit up 14% to $364 million. The full-year dividend of $0.16 per share is up 14% on last year.</p>
          <p>Most Dairy Farm retail banners achieved good performances during the year, though its convenience stores in Hong Kong and Southern China both experienced comparable store sales declines. Maxim's faced difficulties earlier in the year, but the second half saw a strong rebound in patronage on a generally more buoyant Hong Kong market.</p>
          <p>The sale and lease back of two retail properties in Malaysia generated cash inflow of $47 million towards the end of the year, and this enabled Dairy Farm to finish the year with net cash of $34 million and gave it a very strong balance sheet with which to begin the New Year.</p>
          <p>With the economic downturn, the Mandarin Oriental Group experienced sharply reduced demand from both corporate and leisure travelers, especially in Asia and the Americas. Underlying profit decreased by 82%, to $12 million.</p>
          <p>The drop in demand and the highly competitive market environment led to a decline in occupancy and rate deterioration. As a result, the overall revenue per available room dropped significantly. And the fact that the Group was able to remain profitable is attributable to a very effective cost management program. Mandarin has experienced an encouraging improvement, though, in occupancy in the last couple of months, but the average rate achieved remains weak.</p>
          <p>At the end of December, Mandarin had a net asset value, adjusted to include the market value of the Group's leasehold properties, of $2.18 per share, up 5% from the previous year. Net debt was $30 million lower at $116 million, resulting in gearing of 5% of adjusted shareholders' funds.</p>
          <p>One noticeable success in 2009 was the sale of its interest in its Macau property, which generated a post-tax gain of $81 million and this, together with the Group's strong financial position, enabled the dividend to be held at $0.07 per share.</p>
          <p>Now, moving to our Singapore base holding company, Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage. Underlying profit rose 8% to $515 with Astra, which I'll come onto in a moment, being a key driver. JC&amp;C's other motor operations delivered a good set of results, with contribution rising by 32%, partly benefiting from strong demand for its competitively priced vehicles in Singapore.</p>
          <p>Tunas Ridean Indonesia, in which JC&amp;C increased its stake to 44%, made a gain on the disposal of its 51% owned finance business to Bank Mandiri. And during 2009, JC&amp;C increased its stake in Truong Hai Auto Corporation in Vietnam twice, each time by 4%, to 29%. Corporate costs and withholding tax were up 4% to $28 million.</p>
          <p>During 2009, the Indonesian economy grew by 4.5%, as it benefited from good domestic demand and a relatively low dependence on exports. Astra's reported net profit was up 9% in rupiah terms, at 10 trillion rupiah. This translated into a 3% increase in U.S. dollar terms. And the underlying net profit contribution at the JC&amp;C level was $485 million.</p>
          <p>The Indonesian car market experienced a 20% drop in demand to some 486,000 units, particularly in the first half. Astra's motor car sales fell by only 12%, which enabled it to increase its market share to 58% and it was also able to strengthen its margins. The wholesale motorcycle market in Indonesia fell by 6% to some 5.9 million units, with Astra Honda sales declining in line with the market, thereby maintaining a market share of 46%, just ahead of Yamaha.</p>
          <p>Astra's consumer finance operations in its 45% held associate, Bank Permata, recorded higher profits, with the consumer finance operations growing their loan books despite a contracting market size.</p>
          <p>In agribusiness, the profit contribution to JC&amp;C from Astra Agro Lestari was 33% lower at $65 million. Palm oil production increased by 10%, but CPO prices achieved were some 13% down compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>United Tractors also achieved an excellent increase in its profit contribution, with weak heavy equipment unit sales being offset by higher revenues in parts and service. Its mining subsidiary, Pamapersada Nusantara, produced a significant improvement in earnings as it benefited from the expansion of coal production in Indonesia.</p>
          <p>I shall now touch on the other investments held by Jardine Strategic. Rothschilds inevitably has been affected by the financial crisis. But the Group has maintained its leading position in the M&amp;A sector and mitigated some of the impacts of the downturn with an increase in demand for its debt and restructuring advisory services. This investment is equity accounted within corporate and other interests, and the positive contribution in 2008 became a negative contribution in 2009.</p>
          <p>Jardine Strategic sold its 20% stake in Tata Industries and reinvested the proceeds in Tata Power, for a 3% stake. A profit of $85 million was made from the disposal. Bank of Butterfield, Asia Commercial Bank and the Group's other miscellaneous equity holdings, are dividend accounted and generated income of approximately $5 million during the year. I've also included on the slide a 12% stake in ACLEDA Bank in Cambodia, of which we expect to complete the purchase this month.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I'd like to note that the corporate costs net of other income increased from $26 million to $41 million in 2009. The main reason for this was the turndown in the contribution from our stake in Rothschilds. This aside, the Group's corporate costs, other income and net financing charges were largely unchanged.</p>
          <p>That completes my run through for the Group's results for 2009.</p>
