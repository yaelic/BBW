        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter capped off a great year for IBM, driven by continued margin expansion, profit growth, and cash generation, all in an uncertain environment.</p>
          <p>Let me start out by sharing a few financial highlights. In systems, we had substantial share gains in: POWER, four points; System x, three points; blades, six points; and storage, one point. In software, we had share gains in WebSphere, Tivoli, and key branded middleware. And in Services, we booked $18.8 billion of Services signings and $57 billion for the year. In 2009, outsourcing signings were up 9%, or 11% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Once again, we had great profit and margin performance. This quarter, PTI grew 10%. We expanded margin and grew pre-tax profit in every segment. As we indicated in October, we had double-digit profit growth in Systems &amp; Technology, up 15%. For the year, PTI margin was up 2.8 points, led by Services up over two points, Software up over five points, and Financing up over six points.</p>
          <p>When you put this all together, we delivered EPS of $3.59, which is up 10%; and $10.01 for the year, up 13%, making this our seventh consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you another perspective on 2009 EPS. In May 2007, we established our roadmap, with an EPS objective for 2010 of 10 to $11.00. And with EPS of $10.01 in 2009, despite a challenging economy, we got there one year early. In 2010, we expect to deliver our eighth consecutive year of double-digit EPS growth, or at least $11.00 of earnings per share for the year, with consistent EPS growth throughout the year.</p>
          <p>For the first quarter, we expect a four to five point improvement in IBM's year-to-year revenue growth rate from the fourth quarter at both actual rates and constant currency. This would result in mid-single digit revenue growth at actual rates, with software posting double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>We're confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand margin, grow profit, generate cash, return value to shareholders, and return to revenue growth in 2010.</p>
          <p>Now before moving on to the details of the quarter, I want to take a step back and talk about our performance over the long term. You can see that we have consistently generated strong profit and cash growth since the last recession in 2002. So let's look at what we've accomplished recession to recession. Since 2002, we've added $12 billion to our pre-tax profit base. Our pre-tax margin is up 2.5 times. Our EPS is up four times. And cumulatively, we generated about $80 billion of free cash flow. This is the result of a dramatic transformation we started at the beginning of this decade. It's driven by a combination of shifting our business mix, improving operating leverage through productivity, and investing to capture growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at these three initiatives. First, we've been remixing our business to move to higher value areas. We exited commoditizing businesses, while at the same time acquiring 108 companies since 2000 for a total of almost $22 billion.</p>
          <p>These portfolio actions have contributed to a significant change in our mix of businesses. In 2000, Services segments PTI was $4.5 billion, and in 2009 it's over 8 billion.</p>
          <p>Our software profit growth is even more impressive. In 2000, software segment PTI was $2.8 billion, and in 2009 it's also over $8 billion. That's almost tripled. In 2009, over 90% of our segment profit came from Software, Services, and Financing, with Software and Services each contributing 42% of our segment PTI.</p>
          <p>The unique portfolio of businesses we've built, heavily weighted toward software and services, generates high profitability. And we'll continue to remix to higher value through organic investments and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Second, we've had an ongoing focus on driving operating leverage through productivity. We are leveraging our scale and global footprint to improve processes and productivity in a number of areas like support functions and service delivery. In 2009, we yielded $3.7 billion of cost and expense savings from our structural actions we've taken. Along with mix, this helped drive our 1.7 point improvement in gross margin and 9% reduction in operational expense for the year. These actions are reducing our fixed cost base and improving the operational balance point. This will provide a real advantage as the spending environment improves, with solid operating leverage off our now leaner cost base.</p>
          <p>Third, our strong margins and profitability enable us to make significant investments for growth. We have been investing to capture the opportunity in the emerging markets as these countries build out their public and private infrastructures. In 2009, while the economic environment slowed globally, our revenue growth in the growth markets remained eight points faster than the majors. We've been investing in capabilities that differentiate IBM and accelerate the development of new market opportunities, areas like business analytics and cloud computing, and Smarter Planet.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we invested almost $6 billion in research and development to strengthen our technology leadership. Last week we announced that for the 17th consecutive year we were number one in US patents, with over 4,900 in 2009. That's more than the total for Microsoft, HP, Oracle, Apple, Accenture, and Google combined. And consistent with our shift in business mix, about 70% of our patent portfolio is for software and services.</p>
          <p>We've complemented our organic investments with acquisitions. And one of our primary investment areas is business analytics, which provides a solid platform for our Smarter Planet initiatives. Since 2005, we've invested $10 billion or $8.5 billion net in 14 strategic acquisitions to build our business analytics capabilities. These acquisitions delivered strong results in 2009, generating 9% revenue growth at constant currency.</p>
          <p>So over the last decade, we've driven a significant transformation of our business. And we'll continue to shift to higher value areas, improve efficiency of our business, and invest where we see the best long-term opportunities. All of this positions us for growth as we move into 2010.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn to the detailed financial results for the fourth quarter. I'll start with a quick walk down the P&amp;L for the quarter. Our revenue was $27.2 billion. That's up 1% year to year and down 5% at constant currency. With continued strong margin performance, we increased pre-tax income by 10% and net income by 9%. Gross margin expanded 40 basis points due to better margins in services and systems. Our expense was better by 5% year to year, driven by actions we've taken to continue to transform and globalize the business, and focus expense management. Pre-tax margin was up 1.9 points year to year to 23.4%. With an increase in our tax rate year to year, net income margin expanded 1.3 points to 17.7%.</p>
          <p>And finally, our ongoing share repurchase activity drove a lower share count year to year, though it was up sequentially due to increased dilution because of the higher stock price.</p>
          <p>So bottom line, we delivered $3.59 of earnings per share, up 10% from a year ago. And I'll remind you that we had 18% EPS growth in the fourth quarter of last year, so this is double-digit growth off a very strong base. The balance sheet is solid, and capital structure is well positioned to support our strategy.</p>
          <p>Our liquidity position remains strong. We finished the year with 14 billion of cash on hand.</p>
          <p>Now let me get into the fourth quarter details, starting with revenue by geography. In discussing the geo results, as always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency.</p>
          <p>The major market growth was consistent with the last couple of quarters. In the fourth quarter, the UK had solid growth, and sequentially we improved performance in Canada and Japan. The growth markets once again outpaced the major markets in the fourth quarter by nine points of revenue growth. For the year, the growth markets grew eight points faster and contributed 19% of IBM's geographic revenue.</p>
          <p>This quarter, the BRIC countries were up 7%, driven by growth in India, Brazil, and China. And for the full year, China grew 10%.</p>
          <p>In China, we are leveraging our broad portfolio to provide comprehensive solutions to our clients. Recently, we announced one of the largest and most comprehensive consulting engagements to date in China, where we're helping to build smart eco-cities across the country. We see growing opportunity around the world, much of which is outside the traditional IT opportunity, to help our clients drive efficiency in their physical infrastructures.</p>
          <p>Turning to the results by segment, I'll get into the specifics within each of the segment discussions, but let me give you a snapshot of the revenue and gross profit performance.</p>
          <p>Our total Services revenue performance at constant currency was fairly consistent with third quarter, and we had year-to-year growth in both signings and backlog. In Software, we gained share in key branded middleware. We had a number of transactions that didn't close this quarter, and we're entering the first quarter with a very strong pipeline. Systems &amp; Technology year-to-year growth improved again in the fourth quarter, with share gains in most brands and particular strength in System x.</p>
          <p>Across all of our segments, we had great margin performance. Our productivity initiatives have yielded consistent improvement in our gross margin over time. This is the 21st quarter of the last 22 that we've expanded our gross margins. Now that's quite a streak.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total expense and other income was down 5%, and our expense to revenue ratio improved 1.5 points year to year. The expense reduction was driven entirely by operational expense, which improved 15 points year to year. Mitigating this improvement, currency impacted expense growth by nine points and acquisitions by one point.</p>
          <p>We've been executing our operational plan to increase efficiency and drive productivity, leveraging scale and our global footprint. We've focused on all areas of the business, and this year we yielded $3.7 billion of cost and expense savings from a number of initiatives such as the globalization of our support functions and rebalancing our workforce. These actions reduce our cost base and make it more variable. A lower level of fixed cost improves our operational balance point, so as we return to growth we'll get better operating leverage off of our cost base.</p>
          <p>To close out the discussion on spending, as always I'll lay out the roadmap of items that had significant year-to-year impact to our profit.</p>
          <p>First, accounts receivable provision was better by about 70 million year to year, driven by a lower level of additions versus last year. Our reserve coverage is flat year to year at 2%.</p>
          <p>Second, we had a year-to-year benefit of about $80 million from investment transactions, driven by a charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to an investment in a joint venture.</p>
          <p>Third, consistent with what we told you in October, we had workforce rebalancing charges of about 100 million in the quarter, virtually all of it in Europe. These charges are down 340 million from last year's fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Impacting profit growth, our retirement-related plans were worse by 100 million in the fourth quarter. As we described last quarter, we had a one-time curtailment gain associated with a non-US plan of about $120 million.</p>
          <p>We also had an unprecedented regulatory charge in Germany. Let me explain. Companies with German pension plans are subject to mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage. In the fourth quarter, we received notification of a significant premium increase due to the level of insolvencies of other companies in Germany in 2009. This does not relate to the IBM plan. It's other companies' plans in Germany. This premium increase resulted in an annual charge of almost $140 million, a year-to-year impact of $120 million in the quarter, though the cash impact will be spread over five years.</p>
          <p>So this quarter, we had a large gain and an unanticipated offsetting charge in our retirement related costs, neither of which is related to our operational performance. For the full year 2009, retirement-related plans, including this insolvency insurance charge, cost about $1.4 billion. This is relatively flat versus 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me comment on the performance of our pension plans. In the US plan, return on assets was up 11% for the year. Our non-US plans, which comprise about 40% of our assets, in aggregate were up 14%. So globally, our pension plans were up 12% for the year.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we will hold our expected US long-term return assumption at 8%. And we will take our discount rate down to 5.6%, reflecting the current interest rate environment. In 2010, with these assumptions together with other factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions, we expect retirement related cost and expense of about $1.5 billion, a year-to-year increase of almost $100 million.</p>
          <p>From a funding perspective, we ended the year with total assets in our defined benefit plans of $82 billion. Our US plan is fully funded, and globally our qualified plans are 99% funded, so we've made great progress in a year.</p>
          <p>I'll comment on two other items. With the year-to-year change in currencies, our hedge of cash flow program generated a loss in fourth quarter 2009 as compared to a gain last year. The year-to-year impact in the fourth quarter was over $430 million, which is roughly half in expense and half in cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>Our tax rate was 24.6% in the quarter, up 80 basis points year to year. For the full year 2009, our tax rate was 26%. And for 2010, we expect a tax rate in the range of 26 to 26.5%, so fairly consistent on a year-to-year basis.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to our segment margins. This is a snapshot of both gross and pre-tax margins by segment, and as you can see, the improvement is broad-based. Our PTI margin improvement of 1.9 points was led by Systems &amp; Technology, up 2.6 points; Software, up 2.4 points; and Global Financing, up 5.5 points.</p>
          <p>I'll comment briefly on our Global Financing business. We're emerging from a challenging credit environment with strong financial results in Global Financing. Our financing business remained focused on core competencies, providing IT financing for our IBM customers and business partners, and delivered both gross profit margin and PTI margin expansion this quarter. And we ended the year with a return on equity of 34%.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Services. In the fourth quarter, the two Services segments delivered strong margin performance and good growth in outsourcing signings to cap off a very strong year. For the full year, the combined Services businesses delivered $8.1 billion in pre-tax income, up 11% year to year. Pre-tax margin was up 2.3 points to 14.1%. This improved margin was a result of the structural changes we've made to services delivery over the past several years. The global delivery capabilities we've built proved to be dynamic and flexible enough to deal with very tough market conditions.</p>
          <p>Our backlog at the end of the year was $137 billion, up 7 billion year to year and over $2 billion sequentially.</p>
          <p>We delivered $57 billion in new Services business, with outsourcing signings up 11% at constant currency for the year. Outsourcing signings growth was broad based. We grew across all major geographies: the Americas, Europe, and Asia. And we grew in each of our outsourcing categories: strategic outsourcing, business transformation outsourcing, and application outsourcing.</p>
          <p>Overall, we had very strong margin and signings performance in what was a difficult economic climate.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to the fourth quarter results. Our Services segments delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 2% at actual rates but down 5% at constant currency. Total signings were $18.8 billion, up 9% at actual rates or 2% at constant currency. Within that, total outsourcing signings were up 15% at actual rates and 8% at constant currency. And we signed 22 deals greater than $100 million.</p>
          <p>Now I'll go to the key drivers of performance in the two Services segments. In Global Technology Services, total GTS signings were up 3% at actual rates but down 4% at constant currency. GTS outsourcing signings were up 5% at actual rates, down 1% at constant currency. For the year, GTS outsourcing signings at constant currency were up 8%, with major markets up 7% and growth markets up 14%.</p>
          <p>Integrated Technology Services signings continue to be impacted by client deferrals and capital constraints. However, we have seen stability in the past two quarters in smaller transactions under $5 million.</p>
          <p>Global Technology Services revenue in the quarter was $10.1 billion, up 4% at actual rates or down 3% at constant currency. Revenue trends in outsourcing should improve through 2010 as we start to see the benefits of 2009 signings.</p>
          <p>In Integrated Technology Services, revenue performance largely reflects signings performance, which continued to be impacted by declines in OEM as we shift our portfolio to higher value offerings.</p>
          <p>Global Technology Services improved gross margin nearly a point and pre-tax margin 60 basis points to 15%. For the full year, Global Technology Services gross profit margins expanded in all lines of business, and total pre-tax margin was up three points.</p>
          <p>In Strategic Outsourcing, we have improved gross margin for five consecutive years while improving overall service delivery quality. We've accomplished this through a disciplined and innovative approach to delivery, focused on both labor and non-labor productivity actions. As you know, we've been executing a strategy to deliver services out of key global delivery centers using consistent global delivery methods and processes. We're continuing to expand our capabilities with new centers in Dubuque, Iowa; Cairo, Egypt; and Wroclaw, Poland. We're also improving labor utilization with analytics and by applying supply chain tools and techniques to our labor base.</p>
          <p>In Integrated Technology Services, we improved margin by mixing toward more profitable labor based Services, and in business transformation outsourcing through improved deal selectivity and delivery performance.</p>
          <p>Turning to Global Business Services, signings were up 20% at actual rates and 13% at constant currency. Application outsourcing signings were up 65% at actual rates, 55% at constant currency. And for the full year, signings were up 25% at constant currency. This performance illustrates the strong value proposition that application outsourcing can provide our clients with compelling cost savings.</p>
          <p>Consulting and systems integration signings were up 3% at actual rates, down 3% at constant currency, a significant improvement over third quarter. This quarter, small deal performance improved as the quarter progressed. General business and distribution sectors grew, and the growth markets were up 34% at constant currency.</p>
          <p>Global Business Services revenue was down 3% at actual rates, 9% at constant currency, while pre-tax margin improved 1.1 points to 16%. This was a record level of pre-tax margin, driven by strong utilization in our delivery centers, good subcontractor resource management, and spending management. Throughout the year, this dynamic delivery model has enabled us to perform well in a tough economic climate. And this quarter, we saw some of the leverage our delivery model can provide with profit growth on lower revenue.</p>
          <p>Overall, we feel encouraged about the business as we saw improving trends in revenue, margin, and signings.</p>
          <p>So our two Services segments did a great job delivering value and managing margin in a very challenging year. We believe that our dynamic infrastructure and delivery capabilities are paying off. It's what enabled us to deliver on our profit objective of $8 billion for the year. And we are well positioned heading into 2010. With double digit outsourcing growth in 2009, backlog of $137 billion, improving trends in Global Business Services, and a delivery structure that has enabled us to perform exceptionally well in a tough environment.</p>
          <p>Turning to Software, revenue of $6.6 billion was up 2% year to year, down 4% at constant currency. Key branded middleware grew 6% and was flat at constant currency. Branded middleware gained share for the ninth straight quarter as we continue to solidify our lead in the middleware market. In fact, it represented 63% of our software revenue in the quarter. That's up two points year to year.</p>
          <p>Software pre-tax income was up 10% and pre-tax margin up 2.4 points year to year to 41.5%. And for the full year, we delivered 14% profit growth in Software and expanded margins by five points. Software delivered over $8 billion of pre-tax income, nearly triple the profit in 2000.</p>
          <p>Now let me take you through the brands. WebSphere had another strong quarter, growing 13% or 6% at constant currency, and gained share. Business Process Management, Commerce, and DataPower product segments all grew double digits. ILOG, which drives business rules management, did very well again this quarter and contributed to WebSphere growth.</p>
          <p>Information Management software was up 7% or 1% at constant currency, and held share.</p>
          <p>Business analytics continued to be a key growth area. Cognos posted strong double-digit growth and gained share, providing a proof point on analytics demand in the market. IBM's acquisition of SPSS further strengthens our business analytics and optimization strategy by delivering predictive analytic capabilities that help customers drive better business outcomes.</p>
          <p>InfoSphere Warehouse, which helps our customers turn information into a strategic asset, also grew double digits.</p>
          <p>Tivoli grew 7% or 1% at constant currency, and gained share. Enterprise Asset Management, which is part of IBM's Smarter Planet strategy, grew over 40% in emerging markets. Tivoli storage continued its robust growth as customers manage their rapidly growing storage data. Data Protection as well as Storage Management grew double digits, with broad based geography and sector growth.</p>
          <p>Lotus software declined 5% or 11% at constant currency. Rational declined 4% or 10% at constant currency, and held share.</p>
          <p>Although Software faced a difficult compare against a very strong fourth quarter of last year, we saw continued strength in the demand for software in the growth markets, strong growth from our recent acquisitions, and an increase in the volume of small deal activity in North America, so all very encouraging signs.</p>
          <p>There were a number of large deals, however, that did not close during fourth quarter and have contributed to a very strong first quarter opening pipeline. And consequently, we expect Software to grow revenue double digits at actual rates in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Systems &amp; Technology revenue was $5.2 billion, down 4% at actual rates and 9% at constant currency. While our revenue performance bottomed in the second quarter of 2009, the rate of year-to-year decline has sequentially improved in each of the past two quarters. We had strong growth in System x and blades, and improved performance in microelectronics. We gained share in System p, System x, blades, and both disk and tape storage.</p>
          <p>Gross profit margins improved year to year in all brands and for Systems &amp; Technology in total. This quarter marks the highest gross profit margin for this business since fourth quarter of 2007, driven by improvements in our System x server business and Converged p. And bottom line, Systems &amp; Technology pre-tax profit grew 15% year to year in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>System z revenue declined 27% year to year. MIPS declined 19% in the fourth quarter. Over the past two years, MIPS grew 4% compounded. This is consistent with what you would expect at this point in the product cycle. Later this year, we are releasing the next generation System z.</p>
          <p>Converged System p revenue declined 14% year to year and gained four points of market share. This is the seventh consecutive quarter of market share gains. System p has gained share in 10 of the last 12 quarters.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, our success with competitive UNIX displacements continued, with almost 200 competitive wins totaling $200 million in the quarter. For the year, we had over 500 competitive wins which generated sales of over $600 million. Later this quarter, we'll introduce the next generation POWER systems, which will deliver two to three times the performance in the same energy envelope; so quite an announcement for this product line.</p>
          <p>System x server revenue grew 37% year to year, taking three points of share. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of share gain. Our improved sales model and enhanced product offerings are the key contributors to this performance. Total System x blades grew 56% year to year, and we expect to gain six points of share in blades.</p>
          <p>Storage revenue grew 1% year to year but was down 4% at constant currency. Disk grew 6% and gained share. Disk growth was driven by strong growth in midrange and XIV. In fact, we added more than 130 new customers to our XIV platform in the fourth quarter and 400 since the acquisition. Tape declined 10% but gained share again in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Microelectronics OEM revenue was up 2% year to year. Our 300-millimeter fab is at near full utilization and our 45-nanometer process output was sold out again this quarter.</p>
          <p>Systems &amp; Technology closed out 2009 with improving year-to-year revenue dynamics, gross margin improvements in every brand, and pre-tax income growth of 15% year to year and a margin of 15.4%, up 2.6 points year to year, quite a performance for our hardware business.</p>
          <p>Turning to our cash performance, we generated $7.2 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, down 600 million year to year. For the year, our free cash flow was up 800 million to $15.1 billion. This is our seventh consecutive year of free cash flow growth. The year-to-year improvement was driven by growth in net income, higher cash from sales cycle working capital, and lower CapEx. This was mitigated by higher retirement related payments.</p>
          <p>When I look at uses of cash for the year, we reduced our debt by $7.5 billion, and we returned $10.3 billion to shareholders. 2.9 billion of this was through dividends. And we bought back almost 69 million shares for $7.4 billion, including $3.1 billion this quarter. At the end of the year, we had $6.1 billion remaining from our last Board authorization.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, we finished 2009 with a substantial cash balance of $14 billion. Cash is up $2.5 billion from September and $1 billion from last December. Our strong free cash flow enabled us to add to our cash balance while reducing our debt by almost $8 billion from last year.</p>
          <p>Our total debt balance is now $26.1 billion. Of this, $22.4 billion is in support of our Global Financing segment, which is leveraged at 7.1 to 1. So our non-financing debt was $3.7 billion, down almost $6 billion from a year ago. As a result of the debt reduction and growth in equity, our non-financing debt-to-cap is now 16%. The balance sheet remains strong and positioned to support the business over the long term.</p>
          <p>I'll start to wrap up with a brief discussion of the drivers of our earnings per share performance. This quarter, revenue growth contributed to our earnings growth. Our ongoing work to improve our operating leverage resulted in gross margin expansion and expense productivity, which together contributed 30 of the $0.32 of EPS growth. We also had a modest benefit from share repurchases, but it was offset by a higher tax rate.</p>
          <p>For the year, you can see the benefit of the shift to higher value areas and focus on driving efficiency in the spending base, as margin expansion and expense productivity by far were the largest contributors to our earnings growth. Our ongoing share repurchase program contributed another $0.34, and tax rate provided a very modest help of only $0.03.</p>
          <p>All in, we delivered EPS of $10.01, our seventh consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth.</p>
          <p>This was a great year in a tough environment, all a result of the strategic transformation of our business.</p>
          <p>We've been shifting to higher value businesses. This better positions us to meet client needs and drives a more profitable mix. In 2009, Software and Services each contributed 42% of our segment profit.</p>
          <p>We've also been globally integrating our company to improve productivity and efficiency. Our ongoing productivity initiatives have reduced our fixed cost base and improved the operational balance point, generating more profit from each dollar of revenue. With a spend base of almost $80 billion, we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to reduce structure and make our business more efficient. This operating leverage will provide a real advantage as revenue performance improves in 2010.</p>
          <p>We're using our strong profit and cash base to drive the significant investment needed to expand our base of opportunity, both organically and through acquisitions. We're positioned to capture the secular growth opportunity in the emerging markets, and we're investing in areas like our Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics, and new compute models such as cloud computing.</p>
          <p>In addition to supporting investments in growth initiatives and acquisitions, our great cash position and strong cash flow allow us to return capital to shareholders. This year, we spent over $10 billion on share repurchases and dividends, and increased our dividend for the 14th consecutive year.</p>
          <p>Bottom line, the changes to the company have allowed us to deliver strong performance since 2002 and even over the last two years in a tough environment. But more importantly, the transformation has positioned us to come out even stronger in 2010. And as I said earlier, for the full year we expect EPS of at least $11.00 for the year.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mark, I just had a couple of questions. First of all, I was hoping that you might be willing to provide either quantitatively or qualitatively some sort of waterfall to your double-digit EPS growth estimate in 2010. And then as an adjunct to that, can you tell us which segments have the most room for further structural margin expansion over the next two to three years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Richard; let me put this in context. I think as we go into 2010, we should go back and look at the overall roadmap for 2010 because frankly, the progress that we anticipate making in EPS is going to be very similar to the rollout and the balance that we had in that original roadmap.</p>
          <p>Now just to go back and review that, it had an element of our typical revenue growth, our margin expansion actions, our share repurchase actions, our investment in growth, our acquisition focus, and then lastly, actually I was thinking about the pension. But I would contrast 2010 to 2009. In 2009, working through the recession with as much pressure as we had on the revenue line, it really required us to overweight the contribution from margin. And you saw the actions that we put together to do that. We took out 3.7 billion of spend. We achieved some very strong margin performance across our business lines.</p>
          <p>But as you look at 2010, I would contrast it. Will we still have margin expansion?  Absolutely, consistent with our overall roadmap, but I don't think it's going to be overweight to margin as it was in 2009. In 2010, it should be a more balanced performance on revenue performance with new products in a more stable economic environment. You saw that as we described improving our growth rate from fourth quarter to first quarter between four and five points both at constant currency and at actual rates. You'll see that ongoing focus in contribution from margin. Face it, as we get to better revenue performance, that revenue can now take advantage of the improved leverage in our business as we've been able to take all this spend out as a matter of efficiencies.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're always driving tools and content to drive that efficiency, process efficiencies, standardization, tools and analytics, and you can look at the first quarter. We'll have a gain from the sale of our PLM [Product Lifecycle Management] business offset by a charge, predominantly in Europe and Asia, for productivity actions. So those will continue to drive our margin performance.</p>
          <p>Then, in addition, we're still very focused on share repurchase. And on share repurchase if you contrast it a little, you remember that we closed out last year with a fairly high core debt to cap at 49%. So we were relatively cautious and I think conservative during the year in share repurchase. Now we enter 2010, big recovery in those pension funds. So now our core debt to cap is at a very, very conservative, 16%. So share repurchase is still one point. Now you've got to admit share price is higher. We'll still have a lot of dilution at that share price, but we'll still have good contribution from share repurchase.</p>
          <p>But I'm most interested to see the momentum that we pick up from our growth investments, our investments in Smarter Planet and business analytics and cloud computing and the contribution that we get from those as well as the ongoing performance in our acquisitions. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, acquisitions performed very well, very well.</p>
          <p>So again, the way I would look at it, Richard, is that in 2010, we should see a more balanced contribution to our EPS growth from all the elements of the overall roadmap as opposed to 2009, where it was overweighted on margin, given the recession we're in.</p>
          <p>Now when you look at the segments that have the most room for further structural margin content, they'll all benefit from the structural actions that we're taking across the board as a corporation. And I would say as you look at overall margin, though we have had very good gross profit margin and I'm very encouraged by it. Over the last 22 quarters, I think we have expanded gross profit margin 21 of those 22, we're still not in that top quartile of margin performance of the S&amp;P 500 or the tech universe of the top 330 companies. So I think IBM should be &#x2013; our objective should be set to firmly engage in that top quartile.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, good afternoon. Mark, this quarter IBM grew at minus 5% at constant currency. Last year you grew at minus 5% at constant currency, but the comparison was actually easier this quarter. So given what appears to be from your commentary an improving economic environment, were you surprised you didn't see better revenue growth? And I know you called out some software deals not closing. Maybe you can dimension how significant that was in the quarter and whether there were other reasons why maybe we didn't see better revenue growth in light of a modestly easier compare year over year and an improving demand environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think very good question, Toni. If you look at the content in our businesses, one of the trends that we saw in the fourth quarter that was quite encouraging is the performance of smaller deals, and that's smaller deals across our hardware business, our software businesses, our services business, both in major markets and GMU [Growth Market Unit], in our growth markets.</p>
          <p>Now number one, smaller deals are a significant portion of our total revenue stream, but I think what we have seen in smaller deals, they have been more characteristic of a leading indicator. So as we enter the recession, those smaller deals produce as a proportion of revenue more aggressively, and you see them coming back especially as we went through the end of the quarter. But what was interesting about it, it was across our business units as well as within major markets and growth markets. So with that stronger small deal performance entering the first quarter, that gave us a level of confidence.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we did literally have a lot of large deals that were fairly well progressed in the fourth roll over to the first quarter, especially in our software business. That's why software at actual rates, we see in the double-digit level performance as we go into the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And then additionally, we've seen this trend through the year in our hardware base of business. After we bottomed out in the second quarter, that relative growth rate improved every quarter as we went from third quarter to fourth quarter. And with our new announcements that we see in p Series in the first quarter, we think that should also help improve that level of performance.</p>
          <p>So you put all those together and roll up all the work that the teams and the general management have done on their pipeline and their deals, and that's why we felt pretty confident that we should be able to improve the relative growth rate by four to five points as we go from fourth quarter performance to first quarter performance both at constant currency and actual rate. That would put us at actual rate at a mid-single digit level of growth.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Mark, over the last four years, you've averaged about 18% EPS growth, and your guidance is basically 10% plus for the year as we enter an upturn in IT spending and economic activity. You said you have more leverage in your OpEx given things you've done and you have room for a buyback and your pension expense is in line with where you said it would be. So I guess my question is, are you just being conservative? Or is there anything out there with the economy or anything else in the P&amp;L that keeps you conservative?</p>
          <p>And that hedging loss maybe year over year was a big number that surprised me, the 430 million. Maybe that's a hit in upcoming quarters, so you're being conservative. If you can just go through that, that would be great. Thanks so much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ben. When you look at it from my perspective sitting here on January 19, looking out for the close of the year to be at double-digit EPS growth coming off of what really, Ben, is seven consecutive years of double-digit EPS performance, I think that's a pretty strong statement. And so to be able to come out this early and peg that I think is pretty strong. Obviously, if worldly performance turns out to be even stronger than we're looking at now, then we should have upside to that number.</p>
          <p>Frankly as we looked at it, I pegged the $11, the at least $11, and I remind everybody that's an at-least number, but I pegged that at-least number on flat constant currency performance in the year. If we do better than that, then we certainly have upside. And on that base, I mean we do see some encouraging signs in our business. But frankly, our indication and our indicators are best on that 90-day framework. So I'd like to get into that first quarter and get a little more validation that this is an ongoing recovery before we take this up further than we have. But I think 10% growth in what would be our eighth consecutive year, coming in at the very high end of the roadmap that we've set for 2010, I think that's a pretty strong position.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much. I wonder if you can give any more in-depth view into &#x2013; you went through the geos and verticals in the quarter. But maybe if you can give us any idea where you see real concrete improvement, and then maybe where there are alternatively or on the other side persistent weakness, particularly within verticals? For example, public held on nicely for you. It looks like financials have gotten better. Can you give us any more specifics? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean if you look at the overall industry performance, the financial sector was quite consistent in the quarter with the average. Within that, it had strength in the growth markets, and we saw that clients within the financial sector continue to focus on cost reduction, capital requirements, risk, and compliance, so I thought that was very consistent. Distribution likewise was consistent, though you've got to look at it, and distribution has now improved for two quarters in a row. And frankly underneath that, the retail industry returned to growth for the first time in seven quarters.</p>
          <p>But as you said, you look at public sector and public sector had the strongest performance in the quarter in the year. For the year, public sector was up around 4%. So if you look underneath that, in the quarter with growth in healthcare and life sciences, that marked the 11th consecutive quarter of growth there, growth in growth markets across all industries as well as government, where we continue to focus on solutions that will reduce costs.</p>
          <p>So as I look at it going into 2010, that maps to the value propositions that we're putting on the table. And within each of these sectors, I can tell you with the CFOs and the client meetings that I had, they're very interested in this transformation capability for this business and the benefit that clear business analytics can provide there; and within public sector across major cities, the advantages of Smart Planet. So I think we have good solutions entering the year in these key areas, and it can help these organizations transform as we go into a more stable climate.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you very much. Looking out at 2010, how should we think about additional cost and expense savings, or will spending start to increase on a net basis as your revenue grows again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When you look at the cost and expense work they're doing, that is going to be an ongoing part of our overall business model, David. That has been a part of the 2010 roadmap and that should continue. So we're going to see good cost and expense productivity. Now it's not going to be at that level of 3.7 billion spend takeout that we saw last year. And the dollars that we're investing to drive that are more focused on Europe and Asia. But we're going to have good spend takeout. And it's going to be complemented this year by I believe better revenue performance that will capitalize on the improved leverage we have in the business. So those two together should I think put us in pretty good shape as we continue to drive our margin performance.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks, good afternoon. Mark, did you see better momentum in large deals in the Systems business during the fourth quarter that would suggest that behavior may flow into software early this year? And then as a follow-up, was there any pent-up demand in the Hardware business given the component constraints during the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at &#x2013; our Technology business did do much, much better in the quarter, and our factories are much better loaded as we go into 2010. I think the important part of the overall hardware performance is number one, that year-to-year growth rate has improved every quarter since we bottomed out in the second quarter. Very strong performance across some elements like x Series, and I think we're seeing some of the effect of the overall product cycle in our businesses as we enter 2010 where we'll have new announcements in z Series and new announcements in p Series.</p>
          <p>So I think what we saw was an improving level of performance; and within that, characteristics more driven by our position in the product cycle. And as we go into the first quarter, like the other elements of our business, we're expecting that our STG business should improve their revenue growth rate from fourth to first by that same range of four to five points.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at the progression of the pipeline on Services, I would reiterate the point I made earlier that in Services signings, like the other elements of our business, we had an improving performance in the small deal content, and that was characteristic for both sides of the business. I'd also say if you look at major markets, major market signings, still very focused on cost takeout, capital conservation, transformation, but GMU markets still very focused on big infrastructure plays. And we saw some really strong deals in that GMU content.</p>
          <p>So as we go into the first quarter, recognizing that the fourth quarter we had in our total signings 2% growth constant currency, 9% at actual rates, as we look at the first quarter in total, I think we could be a little stronger than that. But the trend underneath it is improving performance I think on a year-to-year basis in our short-term deals and long-term deals continued and ongoing growth.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the US performance, North American performance and Europe, it was consistent with what we saw in major market performance. Now we do see major market performance improving as we go into the first quarter. And we did have very strong performance in the UK and some sequential performance in other areas. I thought it was a fairly tight band around that.</p>
          <p>The thing you clearly saw though is the difference between major market performance and growth market performance actually expanded in the quarter to about a nine point differential. When you look underneath it, I thought we had pretty good performance in Brazil, India, China all in that mid to high single digit. But the element that really stabilized underneath it is Russia came in at relatively flat performance.</p>
          <p>And Russia has actually been declining for the first three quarters of the year given the concentration on raw materials. So Russia did better, better stability across that. Growth markets now growing faster than major markets by about nine points for the year. It closed at about eight points, which has been very consistent for the last couple  years. And I thought the performance between North America and Europe was really a fairly tight range. Although across those, we see improvements in the growth rates from fourth quarter to first quarter.</p>

          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Mark, you mentioned in the first quarter, you're going to still have some offsets to a gain on the sale from actions you're going to be taking in Europe and Asia. Are these actions still greater than what you would consider some of the normal efficiencies you're trying to wring out of the business on an annual basis? And can you quantify perhaps the gain on sale you think that you'll get in the first quarter? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I don't think I'm going to quantify the gain yet. We have a lot of work to do to close out that deal right now. But what I will tell you is if you look at the overall actions that we're driving for productivity, it's pretty consistent with what we've incurred on a charge basis for the last couple years, so I don't think it's different than that. What you will see, at least as we start out the year, is more of that will be associated with &#x2013; dominated really by Europe and Asia. But that overall level of charge would be very consistent with the last couple years.</p>

          <p>Thank you, ma'am. Your last question comes from David Grossman with Thomas Weisel. You may ask your question.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Mark, you've given us several data points on the changes you've made in the business and its impact on margins. Can you share your thoughts on whether these changes impact the revenue growth of the business as the cycle kicks in? And should we think of secular revenue growth any different in a normalized economic environment than perhaps we were thinking going into the downturn two years ago or two and a half years ago?</p>

          <p>When you look at the transformation in the business that we had been working so diligently on, and really I would say it's not overstating let's say the last decade, I mean our objective there was to exit businesses that were commoditizing and didn't have strong margin potential. But I think more importantly than that, it was businesses that didn't have good value propositions or customer sets, and that's what we're moving towards.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the money that we spent buying those 108 acquisitions since the year 2000 for $22 billion and you go down that, what you're going to see is those are big value plays for us with better growth prospects. So we're moving out of business that we don't think had the same growth prospects and don't have the same margin and moving into businesses with better value contribution and better growth prospects that fit within the solution orientation.</p>
          <p>There's no better example in that than business analytics. And you look at business analytics, we think that opportunity set could be as big as CRM or ERP. We'll see. But we invested about $10 billion gross and about $8.5 billion net acquiring 14 companies to build that capability. They weren't just add-on, bolt-on capabilities. It was really moving the corporation into this higher growth, higher margin, to our customers' higher value opportunity space and that's our objective. So I think it should have the compounded opportunity of moving into better growth with better margins. You can see that underneath as well that mix of strategic middleware within our Software business is at one of our highest levels that we've ever had. And those strategic middleware products have by their nature better growth characteristics, so very good question.</p>

          <p>Let me take the opportunity now to just wrap up. We feel very good about our performance this year. In fact, I'd say it was pretty remarkable given the economic environment. We achieved 2010 EPS objective I'd say one year earlier, and I don't think I'm overstating it. If we look back at the comments that we all pulled together when we announced it in second quarter 2007, I think we got validation that was achievable to get in that 10 to 11 by 2010. But to hit it one year early I think is pretty strong performance despite a two-year recession. And if you look at 2010, we've guided to the high end of the range in an at-least characterization.</p>
          <p>All of this, consistent with the last question, was a result of a transformation that we began a decade ago. But it's also very good execution and using the flexibility in our business model to adapt to market conditions. The structural actions and continued investment throughout the downturn have us better positioned going into 2010 than 2009. We've got improved revenue growth performance, better operating leverage, a good set of opportunities in emerging markets in areas like business analytics and Smarter Planet. So you put all of that together and we see another year of double-digit earnings growth in 2010 with at least $11.00 of EPS for the year. So thank you very much for joining us today.</p>
