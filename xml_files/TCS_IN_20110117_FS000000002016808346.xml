          <p>Chandra and Maha will give us a brief overview of the company's performance, followed by the Q&amp;A session. As you are aware, we do not provide specific revenue and earnings guidance. Anything said on this call which reflects our outlook for the future or which can be construed as a forward-looking statement must be reviewed in conjunction with the risks that the company faces. We have outlined these risks in the second slide of the results presentation that was e-mailed to you earlier this evening, and which is also available on our Web site.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Chandra to begin the proceedings.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kedar. Let me take a few minutes to give you some highlights on the outlook. We have been able to deliver another stellar quarter. The revenues have gone up 4.1% on rupee terms, and 7% on dollar terms.</p>
          <p>If you only look at the international business, it has gone up by 7.8% and volumes are up nicely at 5.7%. We have been able to deliver an all around solid performance in the margins. The gross margin has gone up by 26 basis points, the operating level 7 basis points and that the net margin  144 basis points.</p>
          <p>We have seen pricing record growth in this quarter, 118 basis points. In terms of the markets, the major markets have led the growth; U.S., UK and Continental Europe and Asia Pacific have done exceedingly well. India and Latin America have shown a decline primarily because the mix we have in these markets still are not fully annually based. They have a lot of discretionary portion as well, and in the December quarter the projects wind downs have happened and then you have not seen growth in these two markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of the industries, all the industries have shown growth, even telecom, which has shown a decline. If you exclude the India business in telecom, it has shown growth, so all the industries have delivered good growth. If you look at the industries which are smaller, they have shown double-digit growth; industries like high tech, media, travel and hospitality and utilities. Those industries have done higher level of growth.</p>
          <p>In terms of services, we have seen excellent growth in our asset leverage business, in the infrastructure business, BPO business and assurance services business. The deal closures have been solid, and they have come in different sizes and they've also come across verticals and across markets.</p>
          <p>Overall, what we see in the environment is while the macro continues to be very dynamic, both from efficiency point of view as well as from a transformation or a growth point of view, customers are continuing to spend. And their behavior is different in different markets, and the priorities are different with different customers, but across the board, we are seeing good opportunity and we think the outlook is good.</p>
          <p>And we've also gone ahead with extra hiring this quarter; over 20,000 people gross addition, over 12,000 people net addition, and the original target of 50,000 people has already been exceeded this quarter. We think we will add another about 12,000 to 15,000 people in Q4.</p>
          <p>From a spend point of view, most customers, their situation will be either at the current spend levels or they will be increasing their spending. I do expect an uptick in the discretionary spend going by what we see currently.</p>
          <p>Those are my initial comments, and I'll now hand it over to Maha for his detailed comments. Then we'll get on to questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Chandra, and Chandra has already walked you through some of the numbers, so we had a robust above average volume growth of 5.7% accompanied by a constant currency pricing improvement of 1.2%.</p>
          <p>The strengthening rupee led to an exchange impact of minus 1.7%, and increased offshore leverage led to an impact of minus 1.1% in net revenue. Adding these up, you get a 4.1% INR sequential growth.</p>
          <p>With growth momentum picking up, expenses associated with revenue generation, such as travel and communications, continued to go up as expected. We also continued to invest in building capacity to better handle the large numbers.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have to contend with the strengthening rupee. The realized rate in INR against dollar and GBP were 2.7% and 1.7% less this quarter over the Q2 rates. Despite such formidable headwinds, we were still able to expand the EBIT margin by 7 bps to 28.08% through improved pricing, offshore shift and continue containment of cost in other areas which are not growth linked.</p>
          <p>The impact of different levers on the operating margin is as follows: currency minus 112 basis points; impact of offshore shift plus 23 basis points; rate of productivity and other SG&amp;A efficiencies 90 basis points; total EBIT margin 28.08%.</p>
          <p>Other income was higher this quarter due to a net foreign exchange gain of 521 million rupees against a loss last quarter, and higher interest income from invested cash. Our effective tax rate was 18.6%, giving us a net income of 23.302 billion. That's a net margin of 24.12%, 144 basis point expansion q-on-q. Lastly, our DSO for the quarter was 80 days. Invested funds stood at 85.7 billion rupees.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, the continued growth momentum we saw in Q3 is evidence of a broadly diversified growth engine that is running smoothly, consistently delivering us strong high quality volumes quarter-after-quarter. Likewise, our ability to hold the EBIT margin at what we think is ideal level for TCS reflects the sustainability of our cost at a structural level.</p>
          <p>With this, we can open it to questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery Scott. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My first question here is one of your competitors had talked about a lack of a budget flush at the end of the year, but the demand trends being strong heading into 2011. Did you experience something similar to that? And maybe you could just talk a little bit about that commentary towards the end of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you look at the Q3 performance, it's basically we have continued the momentum, and I wouldn't say that there is any specific budget flush and that there is no indication of a one-off flush related growth in any specific account or in industry or in the market. So I think the momentum has been good.</p>
          <p>As I said, whether it's a market or a customer where there is an economic uncertainty or not, the initiatives for using technology, both from an efficiency point of view or from a growth point of view, is something that we are witnessing, and that is driving opportunities and we are able to capture that opportunity because the business model is there a fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just &#x2013; and maybe you could just &#x2013; I think the Americas slowed a little bit, maybe application development work slowed a little bit. Do you expect that to reaccelerate heading into next year once budgets are set? Or how should we think about the trends in those two businesses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See currently I don't really expect a drag in any of those areas, whether it is Americas or the application development. I think both are in line, and they are doing well and as I said, overall the momentum is good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally, we saw pricing increase. Is that a trend that you're expecting to continue heading into next year? Should we &#x2013; I mean, how quickly are people accepting price increases? And do you expect that to continue through '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well be cautious on the pricing increase because the macro environment is still a bit dynamic, so the pricing uptick I wouldn't take a call. Definitely it will be stable with an upward bias is the commentary I would give, but I wouldn't put a target on pricing increase at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Foresi. Our next question is from the line of Vihang Naik of MF Global. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Congrats on a very good quarter. IMS has basically contributed on an average about 20% to your incremental revenues over the past four quarters, despite about just about 10% revenue contribution. I mean, just curious about what are you exactly doing right in this vertical and doing better than your competitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hopefully, we are doing many things right in many verticals and many services, not only in IMS and this is the end business. It's been growing rapidly. I think we have a very strong capability and offerings and more importantly, proof points. We created this for the international market only in late 2003/2004.</p>
          <p>It has already crossed on an annual 12 months basis a 700 million range, and we are continuing to see robust opportunities. We are able to take on larger contracts and execute on that. I think it's a huge opportunity in terms of the space because of the size of the infrastructure contracts involved. So I expect the growth momentum in Infrastructure Services to continue in the coming quarters, and also frankly we have had some excellent deal wins which have not yet resulted in revenues. They'll be coming in the next fiscal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And just secondly, can you give us some outlook about; I mean some things that you're seeing in BFSI, especially for the regulatory and compliance areas? Do you really expect some kind of huge spending in those areas? And also how M&amp;A spend is shaping up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the BFSI in some of the major customers that we are involved in the integration projects, those integration projects have been completed. But then we've been able to sustain the growth due to either compliance related work or work related to new technologies which are resulting in high end analytics and customer insights, cross-selling, up-selling, those kind of initiatives.</p>
          <p>Or re-platform initiatives where there are some core systems that are being replaced, so we are seeing good momentum. In fact, if you look at our Asset Leverage business, the Products business, the Banks business has delivered a 23% growth this quarter on a sequential basis. So I think the momentum in BFSI is good. The outlooks from all I can see is that is very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. That's it from my side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Naik. Our next question is from the line of Sandeep Shah of RBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello? Yes, just in terms of the ADM, if you look at the percentage contribution, early around six to seven quarters back it was higher than today's contribution by almost 400 to 500 basis points. So any trend one should read regarding this? So the other services have increased significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sandeep, when ADM is the first vertical which almost had 100% of our revenues and we keep introducing new verticals as a percentage will continue to keep going down. What is important is we are continuing to grow in ADM. In some quarters it is &#x2013; the sequential growth rate is high. In some quarters it is lower single digits, but the point is that ADM continues to grow.</p>
          <p>And ADM, we also see a lot of discretionary spend, so as the discretionary spend picks up, transformation projects will also come in ADM. So I don't see any negative message should be taken from ADM growth at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. And just as the deal renewals which come up, your comments in terms of which service lines where the largest renewals are happening?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is ADM is happening. Infrastructure is happening. BPO is happening, all those areas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah. Our next question is from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. An excellent quarter, sir, and my first question is related to your BaNCS product. Any initiatives around North American geography for that product that you can talk about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, see BaNCS is an integrated platform with lots of capabilities, and we have installations for BaNCS in North America already, but not at the core banking area, but in many of the other areas like securities, custody and so on. And we continue to pursue opportunities for all the segments of BaNCS, whether it is core banking, whether it is payments, securities, treasury, cash management or custody or market infrastructure. I think there are a number of opportunities, and we expect to grow in North America in BaNCS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you feel that some of the new reasons, sort of the regulatory changes, creates that opportunities? Or makes it more easier for you to grab that opportunity than before? Or it's...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See, I think BaNCS is now a very mature product, which is in the <mark type="inaudible" /> technology. You may have seen during the quarter, we announced a go live of a very large core banking installation which went through very successfully. BaNCS is rated as the leader by many analyst reports and many of those reports are out this year.</p>
          <p>So we think that whether it is a regulatory compliance related or transformation related because some of the institutions are looking to replace the core or the heart of the operation because they want to get more customer insight from an integrated platform, et cetera, BaNCS holds an excellent opportunity. And also we are seeing a lot of traction for the insurance side in BaNCS. There also we have won a few deals, and we are competing in a few more deals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And looking at sort of next year, do you feel that both you and industry would be sort of more prepared for growth and, as a result, maybe more campus hiring, and also maybe less of lateral movements and hence sort of lower wage inflation? Is that a reasonable conclusion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we are hiring a lot already. We have not only hired over 20,000 people this quarter and for next year, we already made more than 23,000 offers. Ajoy has got the exact number, and so our recruitment pipeline is pretty strong. And I really can't comment on the wage inflation yet. I think we are still working out all the details on what is going to be the increments. As we do that we will also look at what kind of a payout we have to make.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just last question from me. I think in the -- for the Indian market in the SME segment you have some sort of pilots going out in terms of cloud sort of offering? Can you talk a little bit about that? And do you see that as a something that's going to be very meaningful in future? Or it's too early to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will not do it if it is not meaningful. We think it's strategically very important, and it's going to be meaningful in size and scale. That's why we are pursuing that, and we are very happy with all the pilots. We have 1,200 customers. We will do a formal launch in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Srivathsan Ramachandran of Spark Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just wanted to get some particulars pricing move, was it more driven by a mix change in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> &#x2013; or was it more a like-for-like basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>He is asking whether in terms of mix change out of the portfolio higher value is part of it, just the like-for-like pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think generally it's a like-for-like improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Like-for-like. And is it more driven by new deals are renewed? Or just want to know what kind of deals we got price improvements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is a combination. Some of the renewals and some of the new contracts that we have signed are coming up in scale because pricing takes a while, and the new contracts in this scale also you see the improvement. So a combination of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>And on our BPO business we had a superb Q4, and earnings <mark type="inaudible" />. Just wanted to know because as a year, BPO slightly been slower than IT services. How do you see the BPO outlook for calendar year '11 or maybe <mark type="inaudible" /> at this point of time, given that BPO attention to traditional application development?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the BPO we look at two parts. On verticalized BPO, we are seeing traction in retail. We are seeing traction in pharma, and also travel and apart from banking and the business side. On the platform side, all the platforms that we have created they've all gone live, and we need to scale them.</p>
          <p>We have started getting successes. They are contributing to revenue, albeit very small, and we expect the ramp ups to start coming in, in next fiscal year. So I hope we do well in BPO.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Ramachandran. Our next question is from the line of Kuldeep Koul of Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Yeah, thanks for taking my question. My question is basically if I look at your data over the last two years when I look at specific vertical and service line exposure, Manufacturing plus Hi-Tech used to be around 17% plus of revenues a couple of years ago, and now it's down to around 12% of your revenues. At the same time, Package Implementation and Consulting used to be 23% of revenues, and it's now down to 17%, so as far as Package Implementation, Consulting is concerned TCS used to be a bigger player than Infosys two to three years ago, whereas today Infosys is a bigger player. So I just want to understand the dynamics, whether it is any loss of competitive positioning within PI that is leading to the decline of Manufacturing as a proportion of the mix? Or is it specific client exposure within Manufacturing/Hi-Tech which is consequently leading to a decline in Package Implementation/Consulting mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually if you look at Manufacturing, we had during the long term we had a huge hit of our Manufacturing revenue we had a significant exposure to the auto sector when the whole industry tanked. At that time, we came down very sharply on Manufacturing, and now all I can say is that the last three quarters we are continuing to maintain the Manufacturing share of the overall revenues, whereas if we take Hi-Tech, it is continuing to get better every quarter and you had deals as well. So I think from here it will grow, but it's just that we had a very sharp decline in Manufacturing during the crisis.</p>
          <p>So I would not read anything more than that, plus we were involved in many large scale transformation projects. All of those got altered at the time, and if you go back to the March or I mean the December 2007, then the March 2008 period and then the subsequent quarters we continuously came down every quarter on Manufacturing. So I think we are regaining that growth at this point, so I wouldn't complain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you would expect the growth in each of these, the Manufacturing/Hi-Tech vertical, as well as Package Implementation/Consulting to at least be similar as a proportion of the mix? Or ideally be growing as a proportion of the mix from here on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's what I'm looking forward to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Yeah, thanks for that. And second question I have is when I look at your cash flow statement for the nine month period, even though the profit after tax has increased from 49 billion rupees to 63 billion rupees, the cash flow from operating activities is actually down for nine months 2009 to nine months 2010, so from 57 billion to around 53 billion. Can you just give some color around what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a question that has been answered even in the last quarter when we looked at the six month figure. See basically what has happened is there are a few things. One is the extent of efficiency that we have in terms of cost collection and so on came in last year, and there, there was a significant drop outside of the number of days outstanding was concerned and therefore, the cash collection became far better. The second one is that we also have to take into account the extent of dividends that we have paid in July this year, which included a special dividend. So that was a cash outflow.</p>
          <p>The third one is that there's been a growth, and this growth has demanded higher working capital. So these are the three factors which have really erupted, and therefore when you do an analysis over a longer period and so on, you will find that there is a fair amount of efficiency in it. There is nothing to worry about here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Thanks very much for that. And throughout this quarter, again we had this write-back of bad debt provision, so is that going to remain like that for a few quarters? Or is it going to revert back...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can do that, in which case it will lessen all our efforts. See bad debt provision go through a process of what we &#x2013; a very detailed process in terms of the write-backs and so on, and obviously this is not something that you either plan for or you can hope to have it happen quarter-after-quarter. It just turns out the same.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I was interested in the trend in the tax rate, 18% or so now. I've seen others; seems like the new level is sort of settling out in the mid 20s. Is that sort of a level or is there something special in your tax structure that will keep you below that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In India, we have had two provisions. One was in terms of what is called the 10A, which is the Software Technology Parks, even the other one SEZ which was 10AA, and 10A of course there is a 10A rule and after that some of the units get out. So in our case, we have consciously planned from 2006 onwards that many of our extended businesses get into the SEZ facilities and so on.</p>
          <p>Probably we have done a very good way of planning that as compared to many of the competitors and so on, but you will also notice that we have moved from 15% to 18%, and that has really happened because of units moving out of STP and so on. And as far as next year is concerned, we have said that we'll be somewhere around 23% in terms of tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My other question is on your sort of view on local hiring, non-Indian hiring in the U.S. and in Europe in particular, and what the implications are? How you're doing on that front? What impact it might have to your cost structure and so forth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly we are continuing to recruit in the U.S. and U.K., and we will accelerate that. But I think the way our business model is structured we should be able to take care of that because when we recruit people from India there is a significant cost, and by hiring people locally I don't think that is going to pose a significant problem.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening to the management, and thanks for taking my question. I had a question regarding the lateral recruitment which has been very strong since last three quarters, in particular much above the historical range. Is this a strategy in terms of expanding the  employment in terms of span of control? Or it's something which is becoming abnormal in terms of incoming incremental projects that are coming to the system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, overall you would like to have from the planning point of view more of trainees, and that is how we had planned out, but as the demand picks up and as there is growth and we have to fulfill their requirements, the result we have to go for laterals as well because the entire project can't be stocked with trainees.</p>
          <p>So that is reason why given the growth to meet that demand we had to hire laterals, and it's been about 54:46 kind of a ratio in favor of that percent this point in time, and going forward that will come down and will be more in favor of trainees rather than lateral, maybe around 52:48 kind of ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So essentially that will mean that FY '12 will be a very strong year in terms of share addition, if I'm not wrong, so are you seeing any kind of supply side issues when you are going to campus because adding less to the whole, fresh recruitment isn't expected to be strong in FY'12, if you could highlight what kind of freshers, salaries that you can opt in for FY '12? And what kind of overall numbers you are looking for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as FY '12 salaries are concerned, it remains the same as what we have been doing so far. There is no change in the campuses, and as far as campus plan is concerned, we are planning to give around 37,000 offers and out of that, 23,692 are already given out from 171 institutes and we still have a few institutes to go and we'll complete our campus by mid February to end of February.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally one last bookkeeping question. In balance sheet this quarter, other non-current affairs has witnessed a significant jump; any particular reason for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. There are no specific issues in other non-current  affairs and so on.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I think we had highlighted I think a quarter back or a couple of quarters back saying that by fourth quarter of 2012 we should have 10% incremental revenue from cloud-based offerings. Where are we on that today? And how do we see it going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we are on track for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any sense you could give us in terms of what percent of the incremental it is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't we wait for next four quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And the other thing was with regard to pricing per se. I just wanted to understand with Asset Leverage Solutions basically adding $17 million incrementally this quarter wouldn't that have had some sort of positive impact from the pricing perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and no. Yes and no I think, but if you overall look at the 118 basis points, I don't think there is an increase that has come in a lopsided manner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So it would be fair to assume that most of these are from scale ups of non-top 10 clients where a lot of scale up has happened and were at basically higher rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would say that it is a combination of three things: contract renewals to existing clients. There are a few and some contracts you see closed in the earlier quarters that have been scaled and the third one is some services like the Product business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And just one final question, what would be the yield on cash that we are getting right now? And is there a scope for improvement going forward, considering that overall rates are going up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As the annualized basis it is 6.5%. And whether it will go up it's basically a question of putting it into a lot of these high yielding one. After taking on complete security we don't invest on equity and all that kind of things, so given that with this kind of interest patterns that we see in India there could be a slight movement upwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, perfect. Thank you, and all the best.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, earlier in the call you alluded to the fact that growth in India and Latin America was really quite weak. In fact, when I looked at the numbers, it looked like Latin America in particular had quite a big hit, something 15% down sequentially in dollar terms, and I'd just like to understand why that was. Is that one particular marketplace in Latin America? Or even one particular client?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No actually, as I said, we have seen declines both in India and Latin America because in these markets we have higher portion of discretionary projects, and those projects came to an end and we have not been able to get the follow-on projects, especially the quarter being the December quarter.</p>
          <p>So there was no enough discretionary project based revenues, and that is the phenomena both in India and in Latin America. In India also we had an exceptionally good quarter last quarter where we grew almost 20% q-on-q. So given that, I think we have taken a hit in revenues in terms of growth rate, but they will...</p>

          <p>The particular reason for this quarter is because we had some discussion in progress in India that came to an end in the Telecom vertical that resulted in the overall Telecom vertical showing de-growth. On a sequential basis, the international business in this quarter has grown, but having said that, we see opportunities in the telco sector both in terms of upgrades, and also in terms of people are adopting to technologies like 3G, but albeit the growth in the telco sector will be lower than the other sectors.

          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question. My question is pertaining to the utilization levels. It's great that we've been able to maintain utilization despite the strong growth, but are we comfortable with the current rates? Or do we think they've peaked out at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The utilization level, excluding trainees, is we have been able to retain at 83.8% and whether can we do better than that? The possibility is always there, but at the same time we are, as we talked about it at the last quarter, we are trying to improve our hiring so that we can create sufficient bandwidth and capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So in that case should we see utilization structurally at higher levels? I mean in the sense above 80% for the full year for FY'12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FY'12 we still have to do our planning, but overall yes, we would like to maintain our utilization levels at a high level.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And just the question pertaining to the other income; it's actually doubled. If you exclude the forex gains it's actually doubled versus the last quarter, so any reason behind that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, actually this quarter we have had a gain of about 52 crores against last quarter, and therefore the swing has been quite substantial, about 106 crores or so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>You see the problem that happens is the July, September quarter is that, but I mean we have a lot of dividend outflows and so on. And therefore, the amount of money that is kept in liquid funds in order to spend for that becomes a little higher and therefore the yield was a little lower. Now this quarter we have had much greater, much better yields.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, we continue to see opportunities due to vendor consolidation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Thanks a lot. That's all from my side.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Ms. Gurumurthy. Our next question is from the line of Dipan Mehta of SBICAP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to listen about our Assurance Services offering. From last couple of quarter it is showing good growth, so what we are offering in that specific service line? And second I wonder about attrition; what kind of trend we have seen in last two quarters specifically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Assurance, this is an area where we see significant opportunities that are continuing to grow. The reason is that our offering in the Assurance space is very verticalized, so we are focused on developing assurance offerings for each industry, and that is getting a lot of traction from the customers and we are also using technologies like cloud in Assurance. And in terms of attrition, I think Ajoy will be able to answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In attrition, LTM basis we are at 14.4, slightly over what we were in last quarter, but if I look at from an absolute attribution point of view, the total number of people that we lost this quarter that is down by 13% as compared to last quarter. So we have lost 13% less in this particular quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So can you give us quarterly annualized number for current quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which one?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So which are the service lines which will grow higher than the company average over the next two years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's almost guidance I feel. I can't really point out, but I said services like Infrastructure, Assurance, even BPO, all these things and products are all doing well. So I can't give you more specific.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So considering that Infrastructure Management, one of your competitors has seen a bit of lower margin because of ramping up that service line. Do we take employees on our payroll? Or how will the margins in IMS be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See our business model is office light. Our business model is also remote infrastructure management, so given that we don't take cost on our books or assets on our books in the way we deliver. So we are at this scale in any contract we will be able to deliver the right margins in infrastructure. That's our take.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And most of the people are employees, and they do use business associates just like any other business when it's needed, but they're our employee.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. And last question, sir, APAC has been seeing strong growth. Which are the geographies which have seen strong attraction in the APAC region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Australia is showing a lot of traction, and we hope to &#x2013; we are working on other focus markets like Japan, China and Singapore. So those are the key markets we look at in Asia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, and congratulation on a very good state of numbers. Just wanted to have a little more detail on the product that is BaNCS, just wanted to have more clarity on that how it is doing, what is the kind of contribution it gave during this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>See the BaNCS business is doing very well. As I said, BaNCS system integrated suite of offerings which has a broad portfolio apart from core banking payments, securities, custody, brokerage, market infrastructure, depository, settlement systems and insurance offerings. And we are seeing a significant traction for all those offerings, and it's continuing to do better this quarter. It has contributed to 4% of the company revenues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Compared to the previous quarter where it contributed 3.4%</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. And, sir, one more question on the utilization level, sir. Just wanted to know like will you be or do you perceive that this kind of utilization levels can be maintained going forward we will be able to bring down attrition levels further?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if we're able to get demand, yes, definitely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sir, on attrition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, attrition is something that we constantly work on; it is a top priority for the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Continuing to focus on people retention is a major initiative. Every manager is actively working on it, and we can state our intent, but it's very difficult to say, but we hope that the attrition levels will continue to decline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Agarwal. Our next question is from the line of Amar Mourya of IndiaNivesh Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello, sir; congratulation for a good set of numbers. My question is relating to geography, like India and APAC has seen a decline in this particular quarter; any specific reason for this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The APAC has not seen a decline. Only India has seen a decline and Latin American has declined. As I said earlier in the call, it's primarily due to the mix of discretionary projects and native projects. These two markets have higher portion of discretionary compared to other markets, and December quarter is always a difficult quarter for getting discretionary income. So these are the reasons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, sir, just wanted to know like you have just mentioned,  probably, what is the gross additions for this quarter was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Mourya. Our next question is from the line of Mitali Ghosh of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Congrats on a good set of numbers. I dropped out somewhere in the middle of the call, so I apologize if this has been asked. I just wanted to understand what the large deal pipeline is looking like and how many large deals were closed this quarter? And also the budgeting trend that you are seeing, so should we be expecting a strong March quarter? Or directionally how should we expect the March quarter to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mitali. I think the large deal pipeline looks good. We closed about nine deals this quarter across markets and verticals, and pipeline is quite healthy and from a spend point of view, what we are hearing from customers is that it will be at the current levels with uptick with some customers. So there will be an increase in spending with some customers, and then it looks good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just in terms of the nine deals that you closed, any trend in terms of market or vertical or a service client?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's very broad based and across market and industries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, secondly just on the telecom space. You mentioned you've seen a growth sequentially in the international telecom area; any sense of what kind of quantum you're talking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is lower than &#x2013; obviously, it is lower single digit, Mitali, in the international market, and the growth in the telecom sector is continuing to be below the company average. And probably that trend will continue into the coming couple of quarters at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and just two quick questions. One is in terms of the pricing. What is the trend like in terms of offshore pricing and onsite pricing? I know you've given the combined 1.18, but any color in terms of offshore/onsite?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't normally break up between onsite and offshore, and overall what I said is that the pricing will remain stable with an upward bias because the macro being what it is, it's very difficult to put a number for pricing increase. But we have done well in seeing the 118 basis point improvement in pricing, and that's all I would like to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure. And just lastly just very quickly, Maha, what is the hedging position right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have not taken much of hedges as of 31st of December. Subsequently as far as the coming quarter is concerned, we have done close to about U.S. $225 million, but very little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is with respect to revenue in March quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is with respect to the revenue at March quarter, that's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ms. Ghosh. Our next question is from the line of Pratik Gandhi of IDBI Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. Maha, I just wanted to understand, I think on the SG&amp;A front we have seen couple of line items like rent, travel and also the recruitment and training cost going up significantly in this quarter by close to around 50% on the rent side and around 25% and 17% on the other two items. Is it a quarter specific phenomena? Or probably it will be normalized during next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You see the thing is, as far as rent is concerned we had clarified last quarter that we had a dip last quarter because of certain arrangements that we had made that was supposed to be one-off. And therefore, we are back to be same kind of trajectory as we used to have before that. As far as travel is concerned, it has certainly gone up as I made in my initial statement as well.</p>
          <p>We tried to ensure that our cost cutting does not imply killing any of the growth parameters and so on, so we have continued to focus attention on that. So some of these costs that you are talking about are really those which are either normalizing because we had some benefit last quarter or just that we continued to incur cost in that area rather than apply any of the cost reduction measures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Maha, but I was talking about the SG&amp;A rather than the cost of revenue where I think the cost has gone by close to 56%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Even there, SG&amp;A also we had certain benefits last quarter through restructuring. It was not restricted only to cost of revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and secondly, any indication on the tax rate for FY '13?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>FY '13 we said that we expect it to be closer to 25%, which will be in line with the direct tax cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Gandhi. Our next question is from the line of Hardik Shah of KR Choksey. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great earnings, and congratulations on a good set of numbers. Sir, can you tell me how many percentage of your clients have closed their budget for FY '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I can't give you a percentage, but majority of them have closed, and I think the budgeting cycle for clients are back to normal, so majority of them are closed, but I'm not going to put a percentage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, sir, like do you expect any delaying their spending cycle because normally like  normal budget start spending in the first quarter of calendar.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think discretionary project spending will begin to happen towards the end of the quarter, first quarter. Even though budget is finalized by the time it is allocated to people and they convert into projects, etcetera, it takes a couple of months. So the discretionary for the next &#x2013; will actually happen towards the second week in March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a final question, sir, in case a customer close their budget, are you seeing any increase in their discretionary spend or you're expecting the flattening of spending in discretionary areas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the discretionary spend will be better in 2011 compared to 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="22" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sir. Thank you, thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Shah. Ladies and gentlemen, due to time constraints that was the last question. I now hand the conference over to the management to add closing comments.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Overall, I would say that we have had yet another good quarter, and all the operating parameters are looking good and from the deal closures and the deal pipeline the outlook looks healthy.
