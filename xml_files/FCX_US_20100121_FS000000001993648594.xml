          <p>Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call.</p>
          <p>Our press release was made earlier this morning, and a copy of the release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet. We have several slides to supplement our comments this morning, and we'll be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are accessible using the webcast link on our fcx.com website homepage.</p>
          <p>In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has also been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay will be available by accessing the webcast link on our internet homepage later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin today's comments, I'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. Please refer to the cautionary language included in our press release and slide presentation materials, and to the risk factors described in our SEC filing.</p>
          <p>On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have Red Conger with us today, Dave Thornton and Mark Johnson.</p>
          <p>I'll briefly summarize our financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide materials on our website to discuss our operations and outlook. We'll then follow-up with questions.</p>
          <p>Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2009 net income attributable to common stock of 971 million or $2.15 per share, compared with a net loss of 13.9 billion or $36.78 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008. After adjusting for special items totaling 14 billion in the prior year quarter, our adjusted net income totaled 23 million or $0.06 a share for the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>For the year ended 2009, we reported net income attributable to common stock of 2.5 billion or $5.86 per share, compared with a net loss of 11.3 billion or $29.72 per share for 2008.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter copper sales of 989 million pounds were higher than our previous estimate of 915 million pounds as we gained access to higher-grade material in the Grasberg mine. But they were lower than last year's fourth quarter of 2008 sales of 1.2 billion pounds, when we were mining in a relatively high-grade section at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>Our gold sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled 551,000 ounces. Those again were higher than our estimate of 425,000 ounces and higher than last year's fourth quarter of 462,000 ounces.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum sales during the fourth quarter totaled 16 million pounds. That was higher than last year's fourth quarter of 12 million pounds, and our prior estimate, because of improved sales to Asia.</p>
          <p>Our recorded copper prices during the fourth quarter of 2009 averaged $3.20 per pound. That was more than double the average of the fourth quarter 2008. And our realized gold prices averaged $1,115 per ounce during the quarter, compared with $818 in the year ago period.</p>
          <p>We realized $13.45 per pound from molybdenum sales during the fourth quarter. That compared to 24.55 in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>I think you'll see from our results that they reflect our continued strong operating performance and execution across all our operations. This is also shown in our unit net cash cost, net of byproduct credits, which averaged $0.62 per pound for the fourth quarter of 2009, significantly lower than last year's $1.04 per pound. We averaged $0.55 per pound for the year 2009, compared to 1.16 for 2008.</p>
          <p>We generated strong cash flows during the quarter, totaling 1.5 billion. For the year, we generated 4.4 billion of operating cash flows, and that was net of a $770 million reduction in cash flow for working capital uses.</p>
          <p>Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled 449 million. That included a $200 million property acquisition that we made during the quarter that's adjacent to our Sierrita mine. And our capital expenditures for the year totaled $1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>We ended the year in a strong financial position. Our total debt approximated $6.3 billion at the end of the year. We had reduced debt during the year, a total of $1 billion, including just under 300 million in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with a cash balance of 2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>At the end of the year, we had 430 million common shares outstanding. Assuming conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock, which automatically converts on May 1, 2010, we would have between 469 million and 477 million common shares outstanding, depending on the applicable market price of FCX's common stock at the time of conversion.</p>
          <p>Now I'd like the turn the call over to Richard, who will be covering materials in our slide presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.</p>
          <p>In preparing for today's call, last evening, I went back and reread our conference call from a year ago, and it's quite a stark comparison. Two things really jumped out from comparing what we said last year to what we're reporting to you today.</p>
          <p>First of all is we set out an aggressive plan to deal with very low commodity prices during our call last year. And during 2009, we executed on that plan in a remarkable fashion. Second thing, of course, is we have much higher prices of copper and molybdenum today. And adding those things together resulted in what you're seeing for the quarter &#x2013; fourth quarter &#x2013; and for the year 2009.</p>
          <p>It's a very strong operating and financial performance. The cash flows that we've generated have allowed us to strengthen our balance sheet. This gives us the enhanced financial and liquidity position that positions our company well to take advantage of what we believe is going to be a very positive long-term outlook for the commodity businesses that we're in.</p>
          <p>Then in looking at 2009, we successfully started up our Tenke operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Even though we reduced our exploration spending during 2009, we were able to continue our long-term experience of adding to our proved and probable mineral reserves, and we have confidence that we'll be able to continue that in the future, even though we have high levels of current production.</p>
          <p>While we curtailed high cost production at some of our mines, we maintained all of the future growth opportunities that we had in our portfolio going into the year. Because of the nature of the ownership rights of our ore bodies, we didn't lose anything by deferring projects and curtailing operations. Then, while we had eliminated our dividend at the end of 2008 in response to the times we were living in then, we've now taken actions to restate our annual cash dividend to shareholders. And when we look forward, with the amount of cash that we generate, we look forward to an increasing ability to return cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide four, the strong volume performance that we had during 2009 first of all can be attributable to the fact that we were mining during the year in the highest grade section that we have available to us in the Grasberg Open Pit mine. For those of you who have followed Freeport over the years, you know that our mines sequencing allows us to have access to this high-grade ore from time-to-time, depending on where we are in the pit. And when we have access to that ore, by taking advantage, when we can from a prudent standpoint, in terms of maintaining the integrity of the mine and maintaining our long-term mine plans, by accessing a limited amount of material, we can add significant volumes of copper and gold. And that's what you saw happen to us in the fourth quarter and characterized 2009.</p>
          <p>Of course, having the access to the high-grade gold volumes in Grasberg was very beneficial to us during these times of high gold prices. But stepping back from Grasberg, which we've always known would be our bedrock asset during times of low commodity prices, particularly proud of the performance by Red Conger's team and by Dave Thornton's team with the molybdenum business, because we had very solid results of our mines in the Americas. And these are mines, because of their grades, are challenged when commodity prices are low. But you can see by the results, we set out an aggressive plan and we achieved it. And then, of course, to have the successful start-up of Tenke in a country that has such challenges in terms of infrastructure development is a significant accomplishment.</p>
          <p>We significantly reduced our cost structure. And this was a challenge we faced and met. We revised our operating plans prior to mid-third quarter of 2008. We had had a strategy of pushing incremental volumes because we could earn margins on them. When prices changed, we started scaling back those operations where we had high cross incremental volumes. And we were able to drive our costs down, benefiting by lower input cost. The Grasberg, of course, with its high gold grades, improved our cost structure. But this aggressive cost management along with lower input cost allowed us to push our costs down by 26% before byproduct credits.</p>
          <p>Kathleen went over our financial results that are summarized on slide five. We went into the year telling you we were projecting to have 3.9 billion pounds of copper sales. We exceeded that by 4.1. Our copper price a year ago was in the $1.40 range. We averaged 2.60 for the year, 3.20 in the fourth quarter. That generated a lot of cash for us with our reduced cost structure.</p>
          <p>And then at Grasberg, we went into the year with an outlook of 2.2 million ounces of gold sales. We produced 400,000 ounces more than that because of our ability to access high grade gold. Now this is gold that was there. It would have been in our future plans. But by following our philosophy of trying to move forward metal when we can safely do so, we were able to have the kind of year that we have. And this has been the characterization of the Grasberg mine ever since we started mining it in the early 1990s. That resulted in the very strong financial performance that we are reporting to you today.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, slide six shows that our companywide cash cost, net of by product credits, was a very positive $0.62 a pound. You can see that, at Grasberg, our gold revenues more than offset our total cost of operations, so that we had a negative cost, on a unit basis, of $0.67 a pound, but very strong performance in North America and South America.</p>
          <p>And then the chart at the bottom of page six shows how our sales are distributed between North America, South America, and Indonesia, where we have the geographical diversification that the Phelps Dodge transaction brought to us. This was a record quarter in terms of unit cost performance for Grasberg came at a very positive time for us.</p>
          <p>Our reserve situation is presented on page seven. As I said, we took advantage this year of a lot of core hole drilling and exploration work that we had done during 2007 and 2008. We did less core drilling this year, but with the information that we had, we were able to replace 150% of our copper production, three times our molybdenum production. And you can see that when you look at our pro forma of our company over a 10-year basis, we've had a long history of being able to add reserves through extensions of our existing ore bodies and through our exploration program, and this is going to be a key objective and one that we have a lot of confidence in being able to continue in the future.</p>
          <p>Our reserves by area are shown on page eight. We have significant reserves in all areas of the world that we operate in, North America, South America, Africa, and Indonesia, and the ability to add reserves in each of those areas. And we will continue to work to do that.</p>
          <p>Page nine shows that, at $1.60 copper, which we use this year for our proved and probable reserve analysis, we have over 100 billion pounds of recoverable, payable copper in our properties. In those properties, based on drilling and exploration analysis that we've done to date, we have an incremental 100 billion pounds of in-place copper that's not yet defined and qualified to be proved and probable reserves. But at $2 copper, we have that material that gives us the chance to work over time to take the steps that are necessary to define those as proved and probable reserves, and then to develop cash flow generating projects out of those. That's within our existing set of assets and which really points to such a favorable position for our company going forward. We don't have to acquire properties or acquire companies to give ourselves a growth profile in the future.</p>
          <p>Besides our strong operating performance, of course the thing that is positive from 2009 has been the strong performance of copper in the marketplace. Going from lows in late 2008 to early 2009, the price has now risen to where it is today of roughly $3.40, which is a price that was not expected by any consensus outlook going into this year. A lot of uncertainties in the world, but the strength in China because of the growth of its internal economy, the spending that China has done in its infrastructure development and stimulus programs, renewed investor interest in copper has resulted in the strong price.</p>
          <p>And as we've just seen the reports that are coming out currently on Chinese economic growth in the fourth quarter, their economy continues to do very well, and the beginning of seeing positive signs and economic data in the U.S. is encouraging for the outlook for copper, although we recognize that there is risk in the marketplace, and we're going to run our business to manage the possibility of lower prices, while positioning ourselves to take advantage of what we believe is going to be a very, very positive view of copper in the long run.</p>
          <p>Molybdenum had a recovery from its lows of about $8 a pound during the spring of 2009. There was a spike in mid-year, and prices dropped back to &#x2013; went to $18 to approximately $11. And now molybdenum prices are moving back up to $15, and we're the world's largest producer of this strategic metal, and it's a very positive feature of our company. Of course, gold prices continue to reflect the attractiveness of gold during economic times and the times of weak dollar.</p>
          <p>As we look forward into 2010, we are positioned to continue our strong operating performance. We are looking to have copper sales of 3.8 billion pounds, a bit lower than this year, because of mine sequencing at Grasberg principally, and the effects of curtailed operations in North America.</p>
          <p>The Grasberg sequencing leads us, and the fact that we accessed gold earlier in 2009, to a gold sales outlook of 1.8 million ounces with 16 million pounds of molybdenum. That would result on a modeled basis in a unit net cash cost of an attractive $0.86 a pound, with prices of gold at $1,100 an ounce and molybdenum at $12 a pound. That model results would generate $5.3 billion of operating cash flows at 325 copper, and we have a revised capital expenditure outlook of $1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Because of the positive market situation, we are taking some steps &#x2013; not to go back to the kind of expenditure strategy that we had in 2007, 2008 &#x2013; but we are taking some steps to move forward on some projects that we had temporarily deferred during 2009. That includes restart of mining in the historical Miami-Globe district here in Arizona, where we are spending money on reclamation activities. We are now going forward to begin producing some copper from those operations. This is the project that we had planned earlier.</p>
          <p>In Morenci, we had suspended the concentrater mill. As part of our plans last year. We have &#x2013; we're mining sulfide ore, which is available to feed that mill, as part of our operations there. So we are planning to restart that mill, or we're taking steps to restart that mill now, which will enhance our profitability at Morenci.</p>
          <p>In Chile, we had deferred for a year project at our El Abra mine to begin mining a large sulfide mineral deposit, which was available to us as we deplete the current oxide pit. This project extends mine life, continues El Abra as a major mine with significant volumes going forward. We have now restarted that project, and we are continuing to study other expansion opportunities at El Abra with our partner, Codelco.</p>
          <p>In Peru, at Cerro Verde, we are taking a step now to incrementally increase its mill rate. Based on our existing mining and mill facility configuration. This will be a very positive incremental addition. Our very large reserve base, which is growing at Cerro Verde, continuous to give us an opportunity to study, and we're engaged in those studies now, to look at a large scale expansion at that project where we have a footprint and the ability to expand. And we'll be reporting to you on that.</p>
          <p>At Grasberg operations in Indonesia, we have continued during 2009 and forward the development of our very large underground projects to develop the reserves that are there. These are 40 billion pounds plus of copper, 35 million ounces of gold. Enormous reserves with very large life. We've continued to develop the access to the reserves that directly underlie the existing pit, which will be available to us as the pit depletes, which is currently scheduled for 2015. We're continuing to study exactly how we will mine the Grasberg as we approach depletion of the pit.</p>
          <p>Our DOZ mine, which is an adjacent ore body and a continuation of block cave mining that we began there during the early 1980s, is now up to a sustained rate of 80,000 tons per day. World-class in every respect and very profitable.</p>
          <p>We've continued development of the small high-grade Big Gossan mine, and we'll start production late this year, ramping that up to provide profitable volumes there. And we're continuing to study the extension of the DOZ mine at depth, with what we call the Deep MLZ mine. So Grasberg continues to produce well currently and to provide a great future for our company.</p>
          <p>In Africa, at the Tenke Fungurume mine, we completed construction activities during the first half of the year. We have now achieved design production rates on copper. We're dealing with startup issues on the cobalt circuit and with logistical issues associated with getting product to market. At full rates, this initial phase will have aggregate annual metal of 250 million pounds a year and 18 million pounds of cobalt, although we may &#x2013; we expect to produce higher level of cobalt during the initial years.</p>
          <p>We continue to explore this large, 600-square-mile-plus concession. We've added reserves this year. We'll continue to add reserves as we go forward. We have initiated in the fourth quarter of '09 a second phase to that project, which is an optimization of the current plant, and initially we're looking at potentially increasing current capacity by 50%.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we had reduced our exploration spending in 2009 as part of our cost containment project. We're increasing it to the $100 million level in 2010, and we'll be looking at all of our major mineral districts in the regions around the world, and expect that to continue to be positive in terms of adding reserves and future development projects.</p>
          <p>The sales profile for looking forward 2010, 2011 is shown on page 17. You see the gold chart in the upper right shows the impact of sequencing at Grasberg, where we were in the low-grade section in 2008, moving to the high-grade section in 2009. And then we'll be sequencing the lower grades early in 2010, returning to higher grades by the end of the year. We are currently looking at 3.8 billion pounds of copper consolidated worldwide for 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p>This impact of sequencing at Grasberg is really shown on page 18, where we show you our quarterly outlook for copper and gold sales. Our sales are going to be back-end-loaded this year because of Grasberg's sequencing, both for copper and particularly for gold, where substantially all of our gold comes out of Grasberg. You can see mid-year will be down to lower grade sections, returning to higher grade sections by 2010.</p>
          <p>These are grades that are shown to be there by our exploration reserve model. Over time, our reserve model at Grasberg, which is supported by core holes, thousands of core holes and exploration analysis, has historically shown to be very, very accurate over time in giving us guidance as to where we're going to go. So it's not a question of having a mine with diminishing grades. It's just when we can physically access the higher grades.</p>
          <p>Our sales by region for 2009-2010 are shown on page 19. Essentially, we have our copper sales shared by North America, South America and Indonesia. Our molybdenum comes out of North America, and the gold comes out of Grasberg.</p>
          <p>Production costs for the year are shown on page 20. 2009 experience, shown earlier, a year ago, we had a plan to show that we would work to achieve unit cost of $0.71 a pound for the year. Our actual experience with the higher volumes at Grasberg and higher gold prices is &#x2013; resulted in $0.55. But the performance at North America and South America were both consistent with the plan that we'd set out at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>As we look forward to 2010, some of our input cost, like copper cost, have risen, and that will have an impact on our cost performance. The lower volumes at Grasberg will have an impact. But when you add it all up, we end up with a very attractive consolidated cost picture going forward, particularly in relation to a copper market today, where we have $3.40 copper.</p>
          <p>The reconciliation of 2009 and 2010 is shown on page 21, showing the impact of Grasberg, principally because of its lower volumes.</p>
          <p>The nature of our site operating costs are shown on page 22, where you can see that energy is roughly 20% of our cost. Manpower and materials are about a third each.</p>
          <p>When you add all of this together and look at varying copper prices, our projected or modeled cash flows and cash earnings are presented on page 23. When you look at range of copper from 2.50 to 3.50, you see that our EBITDA could range from just under $6 billion to just under $10 billion over that price range. At $3 copper, we would have roughly $5 billion of operating cash flows, which excludes working capital changes, but is net of cash taxes and cash interest. So very strong outlook at these prices for cash generation and the sensitivities to commodity prices and certain input costs are shown on page 24 for your information.</p>
          <p>Capital spending dropped off significantly in 2010 as we deferred projects out &#x2013; 2009. 2010, we have increased our outlook for capital spending because of the project I mentioned earlier by about $300 million and will continue and review that as we study the market and study our growth opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our balance sheet is very strong for our company and is growing stronger. Page 26 shows where we all were in March 2007, following the Phelps Dodge deal, with over $17.5 billion of debt. We reduced that during 2007 and 2008 by about $10 billion, and today we have gross debt of 6.3 billion and cash of $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>So very strong situation in terms of total debt, but particularly with our debt maturity schedule, which is outlined on page 27, we have very small amounts of debt that are maturing until 2015, and we're looking at opportunities now to use some of our cash to opportunistically reduce that debt in 2015 and after.</p>
          <p>Our financial policy is to focus on having a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We made great progress this year in managing cost and we believe that we've learned a lot during this year that will allow us to sustain effective cost management as we go forward. We will invest in attractive growth projects as economic conditions warrant. As I mentioned, we are going to look for ways to reduce our debt on an economic basis. The Board has restated the dividend, and with this kind of cash generation capacity, we're going to have the opportunity to discuss with our board the opportunity to return cash to shareholders as we look forward in the future.</p>
          <p>So we are real pleased with our team's performance this year. We're encouraged by where the market is today. But as we mentioned a year ago, even in the face of very low prices, we continue to be very optimistic about the future of copper. The industry is supported by supply challenges, first of all. Challenges from aging mines, the inability of the industry to find new projects of the quality that historical projects have been.</p>
          <p>And then, when you look at the fundamental requirements the world has for copper in the developing economies and in the developed worlds, as those economies recover. And the physical nature of copper, where it's a commodity that's difficult to substitute for its basic uses. We have a very positive outlook for copper over the longer term, and we're very pleased about where our company is positioned to take advantage of that marketplace.</p>
          <p>So with that, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, my question is regarding actually the logic behind the restarts at the various projects. It sounded to me like in terms of your comments Richard and also in the press release that improving market conditions were the reason behind the restarts.</p>
          <p>So my question is, is that primarily a copper price driven improvement or an underlying demand driven improvement? And if it's demand driven, if you could just give us the main areas of demand improvement that you're seeing. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Dave. First of all, these are relatively modest steps in overall picture. We're doing some things that we can do that have some short-term incremental benefits, and we're deferring those major projects &#x2013; we continue to defer the major projects that will require very large amounts of capital and require a confidence about the long-term demand situation.</p>
          <p>So the fact that the copper price is high makes these projects &#x2013; or higher than it was a year ago &#x2013; give these projects very, very high rate of returns and very quick paybacks. And so there, we're &#x2013; in this environment, it didn't take a lot of analysis to say, you want to go ahead and do these. And at $1.40 copper environment, we didn't, but just the current copper price, to answer your question drove these decisions.</p>
          <p>Your second &#x2013; the question about fundamental demand. We're seeing some more positive more numbers about the economy in the U.S. and Western Europe and Japan, but still, there is great uncertainties about that. And so before we undertake the expenditures of the very large amounts of capital and the longer return characteristics that big projects would involve, we're not today starting to invest in those types of projects.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Richard, with regard to your comments on the potential for expansion at Tenke, can you comment a little more?</p>
          <p>Does your study include expansion of infrastructure for shipping? Is it covered under the existing agreement you have with the government? And further in Africa, would you consider other opportunities to grow production in that region, other than growing the Tenke property itself. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, first of all, this is more in the nature of an incremental improvement of our initial project. So it would be optimizing what we have now. It would involve shipping on the same basis that we're currently shipping product, and that's by truck to South Africa, to get to marketplace.</p>
          <p>Longer range, to develop this project to what we believe will be its ultimate potential will require other infrastructure to allow rail shipments and access to different ports. But this is an optimization of the existing project.</p>
          <p>Our contract with the government covers this and our longer-term projects. We are continuing our discussions with the government and its contract review process. We are continuing with positive discussions, but those discussions have not yet been concluded. But we want to note that we do have a contract, which does cover this potential project as well as future expansion projects. It's a life of mine type contract.</p>
          <p>So, we are currently focused on this optimization project. Our work in Africa is focused on Tenke Fungurume because of its size and potential growth opportunities. We have a exploration project that's near by there, that's a separate contract situation. But for the present time, we are focused on Tenke Fungurume, because of its size and its potential growth opportunities.</p>

          <p>Thanks. And with the number of companies that are there, are there any moves to get together some sort of consortium to expand infrastructure so that the region can live up to its promise? Thanks. That will be it for me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thanks, Mark. Well, over time, we have worked other companies on infrastructure development. For example, on the national road that goes from Kuwasi down to the border, we have worked cooperatively with companies over time.</p>
          <p>Now, the situation of other companies changed dramatically during late 2008, when the prices of copper and molybdenum and cobalt dropped so much. So at different times, we've had consortiums and not. We are now studying, together with other companies, the future of rail access there. And we will work cooperatively with other companies. But our project is such size that we're driven by what makes sense for us.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Hi, Jim Bob, Richard, Kathleen, and the other troops on the line. I've got a question here on Cerro Verde. And when I visited Cerro Verde last year, you certainly had tremendous capabilities in terms of water availability, the resource itself, et cetera, and the electricity availability in the region.</p>
          <p>What, besides the market maybe being on a more stable footing, where would that sit in terms of your pecking order, Richard and Jim Bob, as you see it, at as you look forward, in terms of the growth plans for the company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because of all the reasons you said, it's at the top of the list. And we have this chance to spend a relatively small amount of capital there to optimize what we have. But in terms of a major growth project, for the very reasons you said, it's really at the top of our list.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would cause you to attack more quickly on it? Just the matter of the economy just being on a sounder footing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. I mean as soon as we &#x2013; as soon as some of the current uncertainties related to the economy in the U.S. and the western world are resolved, and we can see that the world globally requires that copper, than we're going to be prepared to go forward.</p>
          <p>We're, as we speak, engaged in studies at assessing the size of that expansion. Exactly how we would approach it. We're looking at capital cost estimates. There's been a huge fluctuation over time in the cost of construction. But we're studying that right now, so that when we gain the confidence that these economic uncertainties facing the western world are resolved, then you'll see us going forward at Cerro Verde, because it's a great resource, got a great footprint, great access to all the things that you need to justify expansion.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, I might just add to that for Toni. Toni, as you recall, our comments have been on a progressive basis. As we drill these additional core holes and continue to reanalyze the old core holes that have been drilled in the past, we see &#x2013; I think I used the analogy one time before &#x2013; in all of our properties, what's been the highlight of production has been the ore that had been oxidized by natural weathering. And that ore is the ore that is available to be leached.</p>
          <p>The big sulfide ore bodies, that have to be milled and then smelted, are all in place, so that Cerro Verde, as Richard just said and you pointed to, is a great opportunity for us. But we have it &#x2013; just about every one of our major ore bodies, we have this huge sulfide ore that has not been expanded. And those projects will all be on our watchlist as we see the demand for copper go up and we see the depletion of other mines.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to understand the use of cash flow. You certainly will have a strong cash flow, as you have projected. The CapEx numbers you have given, and absent that you are not going to be purchasing any large properties, looks like there will be a opportunity to do something. You have mentioned find ample opportunities based on that.  Have you heard of any other ways of returning cash flow to the &#x2013; actually to the shareholders, in terms of share buyback or additional dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. I mean we're going to first look for the opportunity to reduce debt. And we have some opportunities that we're analyzing right now to do that. Then, as the market goes forward, we'll be assessing when is the time to invest in new projects that we just referred to. And then other than that, we are going to have the opportunity to look at both increased dividends and share buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but that would be your sort of -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course, you can look at our long-standing track record of the Freeport-McMoRan board and companies to see that that's been not just something we say we do. But we have a track record of doing that over a long period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough. The last question is on the demand side, you made some comments earlier, but we are also seeing, while you are bringing capacity up, that we're seeing some buildup in inventory and some concerns about China trying to slow the economy over there. Is that concerning to you? Are you putting that in your projection of expansion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, I mean the key to it is really the restoration of a vibrant economy in the U.S. and the West.</p>
          <p>Concerns about China have been things that have been expressed since China emerged in 2003. And a year ago, there was a lot of skepticism about China because of the potential impact of the global recession on its export economy. And there was talk about its property values being over inflated. And yet we've seen China have this remarkable economic performance during 2009. So it is an issue.</p>
          <p>When we talk about inventories, exchange stocks have risen during the second half of 2009 as a consequence of weak demand in the U.S. and in Europe. And yet, when we talk with our customers in the U.S. and in Europe, their inventories are very low. And when you look at exchange stocks in relation to an expanded market because of China, the relative amount of stock on exchange is much lower today than it was, for example, in 2001, when we had the last recession.</p>
          <p>So the markets are going to be what the markets are going to be. We run our business to be responsive to near-term conditions, but we really focus on what's the opportunities available to us long run.</p>
          <p>Last year, we didn't want to get in a corner because of liquidity issues. We structured our business that would have avoided that, if we'd have to live through a year of low prices. We fortunately didn't have to do that. We made a lot of money. That's allowed us to take steps to improve our financial situation and our liquidity. So we are very well positioned going forward.</p>
          <p>And I think a real key, when you look back at last year, was &#x2013; questions was &#x2013; which I heard a lot at the time of the Felstocks Freeport deal &#x2013; can the new Freeport manage low commodity prices? We had developed plans to show that we could. Now, we've executed those plans and demonstrated that we could. And we're positioned to do extraordinarily well in a positive commodity price environment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just first off, obviously the mix issue is pretty clear for the year ahead, and what that does to your cost mix, as well. If we just focus on the site production costs, particularly for North America, the outlook for 2010 has costs up relatively higher versus the other regions. If you compare the 2010 outlook versus your cost performance in the fourth quarter. Can you just speak to what's driving that in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's input cost. I mean compared with where we are. North America has really operated extraordinarily well with the plan we set out last year, and that is where we faced our big challenges.</p>
          <p>Kuni, you remember that in the third quarter of 2008, Morenci's cost, where we had no by-product credits at all, was at $2. And that was our flagship mine. And now we've taken steps, through effectively managing our workforce, effectively managing our equipment utilization, to drive the cost of Morenci down to where it's a very, very profitable operation today.</p>
          <p>So, what you're seeing is a continuation of operating using these cost containment approaches that we did, and having the input. A year ago sulfuric acid was free. I mean, we have a few shipments of sulfuric acid, where people delivered it to us, and we just took it without paying for it. Well, today sulfuric acid prices are up a bit. Of course, energy prices are higher. And those are the things that you are seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We also &#x2013; this is Kathleen. We also passed some lower volumes in some of our concentrating operations, which ends up bringing up their unit cost because of the fixed nature of the cost structure there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just a follow up also on North America. Can you just talk a bit about the Twin Buttes purchase? Kind of flush out some more on your plans for those resources? And how that adds value, and what kind of returns look for there, over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Twin Buttes is a property that's immediately adjacent to Sierrita. And it &#x2013; over time, it was operated as part of the Sierrita operations under contractual relationships. It is a property that, for years, the organization has recognized should be part of Sierrita. But this gave us &#x2013; this was the first time we really had the opportunity to close the deal.</p>
          <p>It has some copper resources that we're going to study about how to develop. And alternatives are to develop that on a standalone basis or to develop it as part of the Sierrita operations. And we are looking at those alternatives. What it also gives us is some important material that we can use in managing the tailings of Sierrita, which, absent that, would have been much more costly.</p>
          <p>So by spending $200 million to acquire this resource, a lot of this is going to be recaptured if we never access the resources that are there. We believe we will, because we think the copper markets will justify developing the copper resources that are there, either on a standalone basis or as part of the Sierrita operations. But even if that weren't to happen, this is a strategic acquisition that makes sense, just in terms of the long-term management of the tailings at Sierrita.</p>
          <p>So we were really pleased that finally the stars and moons aligned to allow us and the previous owner to come together, and allow us to make that acquisition.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, and Richard and everybody, congratulations on the very strong results.</p>
          <p>My question was just again to hone in on the dividend policy. You made it very clear that the Board, in your presentation, has authorized a $0.60 common dividend for the year, but I wanted to understand the mechanics, if this is set on a rolling quarterly basis. In other words, if by 2 or 3Q of this year, you decide to take your dividend to $0.25 in a quarter, would that then imply an annualized dividend policy of a dollar. If that's how we should interpret it. Or should we interpret as you said that your first order priority, pay down some debt, then fund some more growth. And dividend policy review will be more in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>And my follow up question is about it. What further improvements would you want to see in the balance sheet to trigger a potential dividend policy review?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, all these things are not mutually exclusive. In other words, we're pleased that we have an investment grade credit rating from S&amp;P and Fitch. We're one step below that with Moody's. And we have these, the debt obligations that are there.</p>
          <p>So to the extent we have cash, and we can retire that debt, it makes sense for us as a company to do it. We don't &#x2013; we're not a company that's facing refinancing obligations, that you have to do that. It's something that's part of a long-term financial strategy. And as part of that long-term financial strategy, we want to invest during the time when it makes sense to invest.</p>
          <p>And as we look forward, when we make these major investments that we were talking about, in terms of new mills at Cerro Verde and new mills at Morenci, and potentially Sierrita, and the idea of continued expansion at Tenke, and what opportunities might come to us at Grasberg, or in our exploration areas that we don't know about. We'll look at the best way to finance those. We want to have an appropriate amount of leverage within our company. And so it's an interactive process of looking at how all these things fit together.</p>
          <p>And then as we generate this excess cash and review our investment opportunities, we will talk with our Board. If the Board does decide to increase the regular dividend, which we did as recently as mid 2008, that would set a new dividend policy for some period of time going forward.</p>
          <p>Historically, we have bought stock back, when we had excess cash. Old Freeport paid special one-time dividends. We had &#x2013; in fact, we had policies of doing that regularly over time.</p>
          <p>So all those things are available to us. And I think you can look at our history and get a sense of what our philosophy is, and look at the market conditions and get a sense of where the Board might go. But ultimately it is a decision that our Board will make. And we review that with them at every meeting we have.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I wondered if you could give us an update on the Climax Molybdenum project?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that project is one of the projects that we deferred. We were in the midst of construction.</p>
          <p>It is an extraordinarily good project. It's just exactly what a mining company wants to have. It's a project that has long life reserves, very attractive cost structure, and a reasonable capital cost.</p>
          <p>And when the molybdenum market changed, and it's a small marketplace, and we're the largest producer. We have this byproduct molybdenum that's going to come, regardless of what the price is. And we had the ability to flex our Henderson mine, which is our standalone molybdenum mine &#x2013; the underground mine that's in Colorado &#x2013; it made sense to defer that project.</p>
          <p>So we are continuing to do some work there. To complete the project basically requires two summers. This is a &#x2013; this project is located at 10,000 feet on the continental divide, and you can do construction during the spring, summer, fall months.</p>
          <p>So we have it available, we have a lot of the equipment that's on site. When we pull the trigger, 18 months later, we can be producing, start producing 30 million pounds of molybdenum a year, with the opportunity to grow that significantly at a very attractive cost structure. $4 pound or so.</p>
          <p>So it's there. We look at that continually. Dave Thornton and his team reviews the overall marketplace. And I can tell you that, when the market needs that molybdenum, this project is coming. I mean it's going to be there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had a question about your ability at Grasberg, in particular, to accelerate copper and gold production compared to the plans that you put out. I mean if we continue to see gold prices, for example, stay high, would you be able to sort of follow suit as we saw in 2009, and pull some production forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not to the extent that we had in 2009. And I'll just refer you to our supplemental slides that are &#x2013; they are on our website &#x2013; that shows our sequencing. And I think that will clearly indicate why we had this opportunity during 2009 to grab some additional high-grade material.</p>
          <p>And we're always on the lookout &#x2013; Mark Johnson, working with our team there at Grasberg &#x2013; for those opportunities to do that, when we can maintain the geotechnical integrity of the pit, and where we can do so in a way that doesn't disrupt our long-term mine plans, over time, we'll continue to do that. But in 2009, when we're in the very highest grade section, we could do that. And as I said, accessing a relatively small amount of material because of the very high grades allows you to get more metal.</p>
          <p>Now, as in 2010, as we move to the higher elevations of the Grasberg, you don't have that same kind of opportunity. We'll continue to do that, but it won't have the same impact.</p>
          <p>Now, by the end of 2010, we'll be back in higher grade material. You could see that with our fourth quarter projections. And our team will continue to look for opportunities to do that.</p>
          <p>Mark, is there anything you want to -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Richard, like you said, in 2009, we accelerated about 1.5 million tons at 7 South. And as Richard said, that was very impactive.</p>
          <p>We'll continue to look in 2010. 8 East will be our source for the high grade.</p>
          <p>We feel we have an appropriate plan for our mining rate in 8 East. And as Richard said, we also have to keep in mind the stripping phases both 9 North, 9 South. And we looked at where we are relative to that in our stripping and our ability to accelerate mine rates in 8 East. And like Richard said, it would be in the fourth quarter, if we had an opportunity to really access some impactive tons.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And to put 1.5 million tons of material in context, on an average day, we're mining over 700,000 tons of waste and ore at the Grasberg. So 700,000 tons. 1.5 million tons have that kind of impact on metal.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess as a follow-up to some of the commentary that you made on costs. I mean I know you said in the past that you don't &#x2013; you try not to engage in any hedging of production. But I was curious if there was any input costs or currency hedging that you might have engaged in for your 2010 costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there's not. No, we look at the correlation between our input cost and our &#x2013; and the copper price. And because &#x2013; we have fixed cost. Our equipment fleet, our personnel complement, the infrastructure support. But when you look at the variable input costs, like fuel, they're correlated to the copper price. So when copper price goes up, typically fuel prices and some other input costs &#x2013; steel costs and so forth &#x2013; go up. And our philosophy is that that correlation is such that we don't look at hedging costs.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a couple of questions. Just quickly, in South America, you comment about production is down year-over-year, mostly due to El Abra. But if I look at this, it looks like Cerro Verde should be up, because you should have some of the year of that expansion.</p>
          <p>So it looks likes El Abra is down about 100 million pounds a year. Is that kind of right, and the way I should about El Abra at 250 going forward, until the new expansion comes in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's going to &#x2013; first of all, the benefits at Cerro Verde are principally very late in the year in 2011. So, you're not going to see much of an impact during 2010 from that.</p>
          <p>And at El Abra, Brian, you recall, we were going to start on the Sulfolix project in 2009, and we deferred it a year. And what we are facing there is a depletion of the availability of the oxide ore. So there is a drop-off of oxide ore that will &#x2013; that's just inevitable. And that will ultimately be replaced by the sulfide ore, but we deferred it a year, so you're seeing the impact of those two things coming together.</p>
          <p>And then we have grade changes at Candelaria that are plus or minus. But that's the big thing, is the decision that we made to defer Sulfolix a year has an impact on our volumes at El Abra.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My second question is kind of on the same lines in North America, and was kind of talked about earlier. But again, we have sales down year-over-year but presumably Morenci is coming back up. Is there something going on in the other operations, or is it just grade? We're down a 100 million pounds there with a little bump back. Or it just an inventory issue, sales versus production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a couple of things going on here. As always, there's different deals. But the fact that we curtail mining rates at Morenci has an impact that's a tail impact. In other words, we benefited during 2009 because of mining rates at high levels in 2008 and earlier years. Because you're putting material on the leach pads, and it takes time to draw that copper of the leach pads.</p>
          <p>And so the consequence of cutting back on the mining rate, putting less material on the leach pads, is going to be an effect we are going to see for several years going forward. And that means, even if we were to say, at Morenci &#x2013; which we're not &#x2013; but if we were to say we were going to restore mine rates to over 1 million tons a year -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A day &#x2013; a million tons a day &#x2013; you wouldn't see the impact on copper production over time, because it would take a time lag in getting the copper out of the leach pads. And that's just a fundamental difference in concentrating operations and leaching operations.</p>
          <p>So you have that. We also have some grade issues at Sierrita that's affecting us. And so the combination of the Safford, Morenci, grade issues at Sierrita, which is up and down &#x2013; that's what ends up with the variation that you see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Brian, in terms of Morenci's production, we are bringing back the milling operations. But in terms of the mining rate, which is what we cut so much in early 2009, we're still operating at roughly 500,000 tons a day. And at one point we were operating it, as Richard said, at over 1 million tons a day.</p>
          <p>So we're still looking at scenarios from Morenci in terms of the mine rate. But right now, we are still operating at curtailed rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful. And just at Sierrita, with the grade going lower, is that on the Moly side too? And that's kind of why you see Moly go up, but maybe not as much I thought. Going back to 80% at Henderson. Is Sierrita's Moly coming down too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit. It's not a major factor.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Not a major. Okay, my final question is something totally unrelated, but with gold continuing to do well, what's the update on Wabu? I mean you probably got 5 million ounces there, which &#x2013; versus a lot of other publically traded companies right now, that's ahead of what they have in the gold sector. Is there any update on that or where does that stand now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually, you know, as we've evaluated Wabu and the access issues and the cost issues of developing, it's not a project that makes sense for us. It may make sense for someone else over time, but in terms of the issues associated with access, the amount of resource that we've been able to identify, the nature of processing that would be required, and so forth, it's not a project that we're planning on going forward with.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a question on the $54 million litigation that you mentioned as ongoing litigation. What does this entail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This had to do with an issue that we disclosed in &#x2013; extensively in our financial statements.</p>
          <p>As part of the acquisition of Phelps Dodge, we stepped into a number of historical situations that had legal exposure. This has to do with the fact that Phelps Dodge represented an amalgamation of its historical operations going back to the 1800s. Cypress Minerals MX and across the country there were operations, some of which have not operated for 50 or 75 years, which had historical environmental clean-up issues that had to do with operations that occurred at times when people weren't aware of the environmental impacts, or where there were no regulations.</p>
          <p>And this was a settlement of one of those situations. It is part of our ongoing costs. We have significant amounts reserved for other costs with projects that we deal with. And it's important part of our business. And what we look at, it was just part of the cost that we incurred in terms of putting these companies together and realizing all these great things that we're realizing as a result of it.</p>

          <p>Well, there is not really much to report, other than we are having positive discussions as we speak, and we are listening to concerns that the government is expressing and working to be responsive to us.</p>
          <p>We continue to discuss with the government the benefits that our project has for the country, the region, the workforce, and the population in general, and the tremendous opportunity that we and the country together have to expand this to be a world-class operation. And what we, I think, will ultimately mutually work towards is to reach a basis for us to approach the expansion opportunities that we have in a partnership fashion that we can go forward on.</p>
          <p>It's clearly a country that has its challenges economically and politically and socially, and that's just where the resource is. But we're committed to working together in a positive fashion to reach a mutually agreeable way to go forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on the spectacular performances this past year. A couple of specific questions.</p>
          <p>How much is Safford slated to produce next year? And is the acid plant moving forward at Safford? And for the underground projects in Indonesia, what would the tons per day throughput be at Big Gossan in 2013, and at the mid level zone beneath the DOZ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, the Safford numbers for 2010 are roughly 130 to 140 million pounds.</p>
          <p>In terms of the underground ramp up, Big Gossan is going to ramp up to 7,000 tons a day. You remember this is a relatively small but very high-grade mine.</p>
          <p>Where we've got the Deep MLZ project, which Mark can talk more about, but we're targeting getting to 80,000 tons a day eventually with that underground mine. As you know, we're at 80,000 tons a day currently at DOZ. And then our deep Grasberg block cave mine, which we've been advancing, is targeting to get to 150,000 tons a day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. The MLZ 80,000 is within the DOZ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an extension of the DOZ. At depth and laterally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the volume is part of the 80,000 tons? Or is it 80,000 further tons?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, DOZ will start ramping down in 2015, 2016. And at that time, we will be bringing up the Deep MLZ, which is approximately 500 meters below the DOZ. And we'll start ramping up the Deep MLZ just as the DOZ is depleting.</p>
          <p>And it will be a similarly sized mine, the deep MLZ. We have some very good grades in the early parts &#x2013; the early sections in the deep MLZ &#x2013; that are going to be very impactive for our metal production during that period when the Grasberg pit is depleted. We'll also be bringing up the Grasberg block cave during that same time. And that will be our long-term &#x2013; both those mines will be our mainstays long-term, post pit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John you've been around looking at this long enough to remember the strategic challenge that we faced one time of how to fill up our mill once the pit depleted.</p>
          <p>And I mean, for several years, it was looking like 100, 120,000 tons per day. Now we've just shown you that we have proved and probable reserves and a mine plan that allows us to be 200, 240,000 tons a day. And we're continuing to drill that resource. And the drilling data that we got may well change our plans to enhance that.</p>
          <p>So as I said before, Grasberg's such a great ore body that now we're looking at, even without the pit, having this to be just a fabulous ore body in terms of throughput volumes and cost structure and long reserve life. So that's a great story.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to study the sulfur burner at Safford. We had deferred that. We've re-instituted those studies. We expect to complete those and reach a decision later this year. The sulfur burner would allow us to increase Stafford's production. It is an ore body that requires lot of sulfur. And that's what leading us to do the study. And &#x2013; but we haven't approved it yet. It's not in the capital yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question. Excluding by-product credits, consolidated unit costs were up $0.10 sequentially in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of how much of that increase was attributable to rising material and energy prices, as opposed to other factors, like say ore grade changes or differences in the proportion of contribution across your mine portfolio?</p>

          <p>Well, the discussions have gone on for a long time. Indonesia just went through elections, and that was something that the country was focused on for a number of months. But we continue to have very positive discussions.</p>
          <p>It was also impacted by the fact that we had such incredible market volatility. We saw the value of assets, including FCX stock, go on this roller coaster ride. So that's made it more complicated to get to find a basis for going forward.</p>
          <p>What I can report to you is we have great relationships with the province, and we'll continue those discussions and work towards finding a way where it works for them and works for us.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. I know you guys do not hedge. But given that you are buying back your six and eight year notes yields under 6%, and that the bulk of the EBITDA right now is coming from Indonesia. The Indonesian sovereign is yielding up near 9%. Is any of your cash being put in some of the sovereigns or the longer paper of the sovereigns, where you guys are doing business?</p>

          <p>No, not really. And you know, even though we are in Indonesia, the huge bulk of our cost &#x2013; all of revenues and the bulk of our cost are U.S. dollars. So we're not doing anything like that at all.</p>
          <p>And in Indonesia, 75% of our costs are U.S. dollar based and the remaining 25% are split between Australian dollar purchases and Indonesian rupiah, so it's not a major factor.</p>

          <p>But our cash spread is all invested very conservatively, and so the arbitrage for us on paying back debt is that we're getting a very small return &#x2013; very, very small return on the cash, and are earning, on the debt that we're buying back, spreads in the 300 basis points plus range. So &#x2013; and it also reduces our debt on our balance sheet. So &#x2013; but we're not investing any of our cash in other debt securities.</p>

There are a number of projects around the country today that are being completed, but since mid-September 2008, absent some government spending, there has been virtually no new commercial real estate development.

          <p>For the results of that to come into place. Now fundamentally, that's all going to be very supportive of the copper markets, because fundamentally, that says supply availability is going to be a supportive fashion for copper prices industry wide, not just for us. Because consumer inventories are very low, and when times &#x2013; when things turn, there is going to be demand for copper that's not going to be there. And so that's going to fundamentally supportive of prices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me just make sure that we haven't spoiled the investments you grew by saying that we were able to quickly make these decisions in the first of the year to be responsive to this downturn in the copper prices, and make all of our decisions to scale back our operations.</p>
          <p>One should not assume that that's &#x2013; click on a switch and it happens, click off a switch and it happens. These things are very disruptive to operations, when you're trying to make these decisions and turn down a mine.</p>
          <p>So that's why I think it's important, as Richard is trying to make a point, that we can't just flip a switch and turn these things back to full production and then flip a switch and turn them back. It costs a lot of money, and it's a big distraction to the operation. So when you get things operating in a cost efficient mode, you want to make sure, before you start pulling the switch, to start back up. Because if you make the wrong decision, then you have a huge distraction of having to be in a process of ramping  back up, and all of a sudden, you've got to pull the switch to ramp back down. It's not that easy to do.</p>

          <p>Yeah, we've seen some improvement in the west, but mainly in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>But one of the metrics that we watch is U.S. steel capacity utilization numbers, and they've increased to about the low 60% range. And in the first half of '09 they were in the below 50% range. So still way off the '08 range of about &#x2013; of high 80s to 90%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions have been answered, in terms of specifics, so I had something just a little bit more broad in nature. I am aware of the brownfield expansion and investments, and the potentials that you have, and obviously also the longer term potential at Tenke. But your balance sheet, especially with the cash flow outlook for 2010, is in about as good shape as it's been in a long time.</p>
          <p>So are there greenfield opportunities out there? I am not talking about that's currently in your portfolio, but just surveying the global landscape. Is that something that you're open too, or are there opportunities there? If there are, are they restricted to primary copper projects, or are there other metals that you have interest in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do have an exploration team that's very experienced in looking at global exploration opportunities. And they're continuing to do that.</p>
          <p>One of the things that we were able to expand our scope with this past year was to work more with some junior companies that were financially challenged. And so we're looking at those.</p>
          <p>The thing about it, Peter, is that, not only are we looking at it, but you've got this whole industry of very financially strong companies that are diversified metals companies. And when you go and look at the investor presentations of each of those companies, when they talk about their strategic objectives, copper is right at the top of their list.</p>
          <p>So as a company, we're prepared to do that, we're on the outlook for it, we have the technical skills and financial resources to develop any copper project anywhere in the world. Again, coming back to why we're so positive about the marketplace, is all of this effort is not generating new projects. I mean there are some new projects, there are brownfield expansions. But the new projects that the industry is able to identify are very challenging. They're either deep underground with technical challenges. They're in places in the world where, for community acceptance or for government relations or other technical challenges, they're expensive and tough to develop.</p>
          <p>And so what that leads us back to is the benefits of really focusing on these brownfield expansions of our existing operations, where we have challenges in terms of power and water and land rights and all of those things. But in comparison with what you face with having a greenfield project, they are much, much less.</p>
          <p>Now if we find the right one, we're going to be prepared to jump on it and go forward with it. We do believe copper is a great business to be in, so we are focused on looking at potential copper opportunities around the world. But we monitor the molybdenum market, and there are other markets, if we find the right resource.</p>
          <p>In the resource business, one thing that we &#x2013; that's imprinted on all of us is the key to it is having quality assets. It's not just a question of saying you want to get an asset. It's got to be quality, and we say quality, that means large, with a long reserve life, with attractive cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I get the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me just add this because I think this is important. We said it over and over. When you look at the greenfield versus brownfield, I've tried to describe and Richard has tried to describe on numerous occasions, the product category of ore body that we have. And I'll just repeat what I said a while ago. The oxide ore that we've been mining in most of the mines, because of the grade, has been leached. And the leach process was a boon to keeping these lower grade properties profitable in low copper price times.</p>
          <p>But when you ask about greenfield, you have to always compare to the assets that you have in the brownfields, and say are my brownfield projects better than greenfields? And for all the reasons that Richard's stated, like some of the deeper ore bodies that are being looked at and some of the land and environmental problems associated with trying to get those things developed, whether you are talking about Alaska or the Rocky Mountain area mining district in the United States. There's so many factors that have to be considered.</p>
          <p>But to make it simple, when we look at our greenfield opportunities, we always keep our staff out there, making sure that we're not going to miss something. But when we look at our brownfield projects and the enormous amount of sulfide ore, as I said earlier, that's available to us by going from a leach process to a milling process, always comes out, for us, that if there's a huge increase in demand for copper, and we see it expand, that we need to put more ore into the market, taking those sulfide projects and putting them to production is so much more profitable for us because we already got existing infrastructure et cetera, et cetera et, cetera. It's just a matter of deepening pits and the greenfield projects just don't come anywhere close to matching what we can do.</p>
          <p>You saw the slide earlier that showed the amount of mineralized material that we have. I know you understand that the only difference between mineralized material and reserves is you have to have a mining plan that shows the feasibility of mining that ore. And that enormous mineralized material number you saw is why we have such a great opportunity to use the brownfields that are literally by any other category. And the only reason why they are called brownfields by us is because they're in association with our existing ore body. Anybody else would be looking at the size of the reserves that are involved in these opportunities, these at depth and are certified ore would call those opportunities greenfield because they are so large.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. If I could just follow up briefly. Because when I look out &#x2013; I mean the production guidance that you've given for 2010 notwithstanding, means that obviously there is going to be changes in grades, et cetera.</p>
          <p>But when we look out over five years, going underground in Indonesia, and the change in economics after 2021 in Indonesia. And then also understanding the infrastructure requirements that are largely outside of your hands necessary to take Tenke to the next level over the next five years. When I look at your longer term production profile, are you saying that greenfield opportunities are going to be able to basically meet whatever challenges there are over the next 10 years? Or would there be opportunities outside of your existing portfolio of assets that that could be accretive, long term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's just say that we've looked around the world, had a great opportunity since the Phelps Dodge acquisition, to once again look at all the copper and gold belts that are available for exploration, where you may have the opportunity to find a greenfields project that would be another Grasberg type opportunity.</p>
          <p>And as you look around the world, one thing you have to really look back at is the past is always a key to the present. If you look at the top 10 producing mines that are producing all the copper to meet the current copper demand, remember that you still have the profile that says that Grasberg was founded in 1988. Before that, the Chuky Kamadas of the world, all the big mines that are still in the top 10 were found at the turn of this century.</p>
          <p>So it's clear that, when you look at only Escondida and Grasberg being founded in recent years that are providing the copper in the market today, it's a good reminder that there hasn't been a major greenfields project that matches some of these world class ore bodies in the last 20 years that you can point to. And the reason for that is the opportunities just weren't there.</p>
          <p>That's why you see people today stretching to go for mines that are ultra deep or tremendous environmental situations, like they're having up in Alaska today. Trying to get Pebble into production. So you have to look at all those kind of factors when you start trying to say what's the best opportunity for Freeport-McMoRan to have a long-term outlook in terms of keeping copper resources that we can come to the market for, and still comes out of our mineralized materials, i.e. our brownfield operations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter, just one thing. What I think is such a positive factor with our company is, with our big reserve base and with our mineralized material and growth that that adds, that gives us a base case for our long-term future.</p>
          <p>There'll be ups and downs depending on mine development and other factors. But we're not a company that has to go out and do something to replace its reserves or to grow. With a very positive market outlook and what we have in our portfolio, we've got a good long-term future already laid out. Then we're going to be in a world of where opportunities may come to us to enhance that. And that may be greenfield exploration, it could any number of things.</p>
          <p>But it's a great established base for our long-term future with the outlook for very positive markets that will give us a chance to be in this industry and to take advantage of whatever opportunities come to us.</p>

          <p>So you've got internal hurdles in terms of uses of cash flow, whether it's dividends, share buybacks, brownfield expansions, et cetera, but you're not restricting yourself to that. If there's an external, long-dated opportunity with a good return profile and it meets your geological requirements, that would be something that you're not going to exclude.</p>

          <p>Our final question comes from the line of Toni Rizzuto with Dahlman Rose.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. I appreciate you coming back to me.</p>
          <p>Richard, I just want to make sure, and Jim Bob, I think you were talking about this earlier. I just want to make sure I heard this correctly about Grasberg because this is critically important in my view. You guys were talking about the ability to achieve mill throughput rates of 200,000 to 240,000 tons a day. So, basically similar levels to what you're doing now at Grasberg.</p>
          <p>And did I hear you correctly on that? Because I don't think I really heard you sound as confident in the past as you did today on that.</p>
          <p>And then I'd like to also feel out if you could give us some view as to what ore grades and recovery rates might do?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, the answer about confidence is yes. A straight forward yes.</p>
          <p>We are very confident about it. There is a transition time between the depletion of the pit and as we ramp up that will have an impact on production during that transition period, and we are taking steps to deal with that. Through the way we managed the DOZ, MLZ, the Big Gossan, and stock piling, and so forth.</p>
          <p>But the numbers are very attractive. Once we get through that transition period and get into an operating mode of the underground mines, Toni, you can look at our 10-K, and we have ore body by ore body, the grades that you can see, the grades for the deep Grasberg, the grades for the DOZ, the MLZ, the Kucing Liar. You can see what kind of grades are in copper and gold.</p>
          <p>The ore that we have in the deep Grasberg is essentially similar to what we are mining in the pit, so recoveries and mineralology will be essentially the same. The DOZ, MLZ has great ore characteristics.</p>
          <p>We have a great opportunity with the Kucing Liar because right now, because of its pyrite content, we are only looking recovering 50% of the gold that's there, and we're looking at ways of potentially getting more of that gold.</p>
          <p>But you really touched on what is &#x2013; and I mentioned this when I was talking with John Tumazos earlier. A big change over the past 10 years at Grasberg is the ongoing exploration has provided us the resources to now have this continued at a much higher level of throughput than we were 10 years ago.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And Richard, I think it's important, when we talk about the confidence level of keeping our target production levels when we going underground, is the events that have occurred since we found the original Grasberg deposit and were able to continue to look at the underground ore body that we have expanded that grew from 75 up to almost 0.5 billion over there at the MLZ. All that underground work that we have been doing, that 80,000 tons, has given us a great opportunity to be in the underground mining business as far as signing personnel, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>It would have been &#x2013; if we hadn't had that adjacent ore body at the Ortsberg that was a huge underground operation competing with any of the biggest that's ever been produced in the world, it was then a training camp operation, as opposed to a commercial operation, trying to just get prepared to go underground.</p>
          <p>And the other thing everybody should remember is when you go underground people think about, well, aren't the costs going to go up? Well, if you look at the terrain at the Grasberg and know that we have to operate in a open pit where weather is such a huge impact on the big trucks hauling the waste out of that ore, that big open pit, as well as the mineralized material, and having to do these push backs to be sure we keep this imagery of the pit. Once you go underground, you're basically block caving that mine. And it reduces almost to zero the waste material and the stacking expense of how you stack that ore &#x2013; excuse me, the waste material. It has to be mined just to keep the symmetry of the pit.</p>
          <p>So the number of trucks, the vulnerability to weather operations, the vulnerability of a slide in the pit, all the things that you see there are the pitfalls of being in a pit, not to make a pun. But having &#x2013;  just to summarize again &#x2013; having that ongoing expansion of a underground ore body be almost like it was a coincidental opportunity to get prepared to go underground in the lower vulnerability to mining, block caving underground and getting away from many of the vulnerabilities of being in that terrain, with all the rainfall and fog and other things that lurk in the dark, when you're in the pit. We've had all that under control, but you can rest assured that it is a 24 hour 365 day job to operate in these pits without having something get away from you.</p>
