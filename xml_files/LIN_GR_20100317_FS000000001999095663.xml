          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Linde Group Full Year 2009 Results Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. Just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to hand over to your Chairperson, Dr. Wolfgang Reitzle. Please begin your meeting, sir, and I will be standing by.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference. I hope you all have in front of you this pack with actually 53 pages; don't be afraid, but we will find a way to move you elegantly and fast through this pack. But I think it's worthwhile to finally get the message across. So thank you very much for dialing in to our full year review.</p>
          <p>2009 was marked, as we all know, by a significant global recession. Against this difficult economic background, we have been able to show the relative stability of our Gases business model. Group operating profit declined 6.7% to &#x20AC;2.385 billion. I'm now at page four. Please you all start at page four. So you see the decline of 6.7%, while Group sales decreased by 11.5%. This resilient operating performance in the crisis was supported by strong cost and efficiency efforts across our whole organization.</p>
          <p>The Group operating margin improved by 110 basis points to 21.3%, or even 180 basis points if you exclude the restructuring charges. The adjusted ROCE remained double-digit with 10.4%. Driven by tight working capital management, the operating cash flow increased by 14.2% to now &#x20AC;2.142 billion. This allowed us to reduce net debt by a further 300 million to &#x20AC;6.1 billion.</p>
          <p>The impact of the HPO initiatives is already now well visible and becoming a high performance organization, still bears a significant structural improvement potential for our company. I will give you some more insights into our program that should also make clear that the scope of HPO goes far deeper than a pure cost cutting exercise.</p>
          <p>Looking around us, we are aware that the global economic environment still remains fragile, despite some encouraging signals in the second half of 2009. I would, therefore, like to emphasize today once again the stability of our growth setup built on our strong position in structural mega-trends. And I would also like to remind you of the important synergies we are leveraging from our complementary Gases and Engineering footprint.</p>
          <p>Let me start with a breakdown of the Group sales on page five. Group sales declined 6.1%, Gases sales, to &#x20AC;8.9 billion, or 5.1% on a comparable basis. The comparable figure represents the price and volume effect, excluding not only currency and natural gas price effects but also changes in consolidation. Adjusted for currency and natural gas price effect, the decline was only 2.3%. This is probably the most resilient sales development that you can find in this industry for this difficult year, 2009. Volumes were impacted by the broad based demand weakness in all regions, while pricing, rental fees and take-or-pay contracts in the tonnage business provided positive support.</p>
          <p>Sales in the Engineering division were as expected, below the record level of 2008. I think that can't be a surprise. As you know, execution and sales recognition in this business is more lumpy than in the Gases business. The key objective for us in the recession was to maintain our full engineering capabilities with regards to future growth opportunities. As you will see in a minute, our resources management worked off well as profitability did not suffer from the lower sales level. Moreover, looking forward, the order backlog in Engineering remained high, with still more than &#x20AC;4 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking at the operating profits development on page six, you see that the positive development of the Group's operating margin was driven by a strong performance in both divisions. The operating profit in Gases was with &#x20AC;3.378 billion very close to the two point &#x2013; 2008 level, leading to the margin increase of 120 basis points to now 26.6%. The operating margin in the Engineering division remained with 9.1% on a high level, and thereby clearly exceeded our target range of 8%.</p>
          <p>Let's now talk about some key numbers of our Gases and Engineering results, beginning with the product area split of the Gases division on page seven. There were quite some discussions at the start of the year 2009 on how take-or-pay contracts in general would fail in the crisis and how resilient in particular the new Linde setup would prove to be. I think the performance of our product areas gives an answer to these issues.</p>
          <p>Our tonnage business held up very well over 2009, ending the year about flat on a comparable basis. This performance is, of course, supported by a continuous contribution from new startups and ramp-ups of pervious year projects. Still having in mind the strong production cuts in our major end customer industries like, for example, steel and chemicals, this sales resilience in tonnage would not have been possible if take-or-pay agreements would have suffered any kind of dilution.</p>
          <p>Also our merchant business resisted quite well to the global recession, with limited declines of 6.5 and 9.1% in bulk and cylinder respectively. This performance was supported by rental fees, as well as ongoing positive pricing.</p>
          <p>As this merchant performance was perhaps the biggest surprise for the market, let me once again briefly remind you two driving forces of this relative stability. First of all, this business is extremely diversified, serving as you know a multitude of customers of all kind of sizes and all kind of industries. And for each individual client, our product is an absolute necessity, without being a major cost factor that can make the difference in the crisis.</p>
          <p>And second point, we have always emphasized going into the crisis is our strong local market position. Do not forget that more than 70% of our merchant sales are generated from a minimum market share of 30%. This is, of course, essential with regard to economies of scale and pricing behavior in the merchant business. And finally, our healthcare business grew by a very solid 4.6% in the crisis, again on a clean comparable basis. This shows the underlying mega-trends we are serving here.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about the order situation in our Engineering division on page eight. In the recession, our customers were more reluctant to engage large-scale investment projects; I think no surprise. It is hence no big surprise that our order intake is therefore down from the &#x20AC;3 billion level reached in the previous year. Nevertheless, we had again a strong activity in the fourth quarter with contract signings worth &#x20AC;944 million. Order intake for the year, therefore, exceeded &#x20AC;2.4 billion. I think this is a good figure given the investment sentiment in 2009.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, our order backlog remains strong. With &#x20AC;4.2 billion of orders still to be executed, we have a good visibility for our internal allocation of resources. This is important as it allows us to maintain our full engineering capacities through the usual ups and downs in market circumstances.</p>
          <p>I'm turning now to the slides nine to 11 with the update on our HPO program. HPO is a holistic program, covering the full value chain of our business across all regions. You know that we accelerated this program in 2009 due to the exceptional economic environment and achieved last year gross cost savings of more than &#x20AC;300 million. You can see on the graph the rough split of our expected HPO savings in four categories; bulk supply chain management, cylinder supply chain management, procurement and SG&amp;A categories.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we achieved a relatively higher share of savings in SG&amp;A, as this was, of course, the fixed cost item that we needed to adapt quickest in the crisis. Going forward, we will be returning to our original run rate of HPO savings, which implies a target range of 150 to &#x20AC;200 million of gross cost savings in 2010. Please do not forget that HPO is not a cost mitigation program that we implemented due to the crisis. HPO is addressing the execution of daily work of every single employee. We are targeting best practices or processes throughout our organization.</p>
          <p>We have listed a few examples out of this wide spectrum of productivity improvement initiatives on page 10. In the bulk supply chain, we are, for example, striving to have all our plants being run by regional or even global remote operating control centers by 2012. In the cylinder supply chain, we are harmonizing our scheduling and routine platforms all around the world.</p>
          <p>Initiatives in procurement and SG&amp;A address further standardizations to fully benefit of our economies of scale. These initiatives are, of course, all supported by the development of state-of-the-art IT solutions. So we are talking of hundreds of different processes within our global setup where we can work more efficiently, and hence increase by this productivity.</p>
          <p>On the next page 11, you see that HPO is not only a pure cost cutting program, as I already mentioned. It is also about a cultural commitment to high performance and on optimal leverage &#x2013; and optimal leverage of our leading Gases and Engineering setup. For that purpose, we have further intensified the standardization of our air separation units by focusing on a limited number of plant types for classic gases applications. This helps us to significantly reduce delivery times and install costs, thus making offerings of our Gases division more attractive to each customer.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we're also supporting our productivity gains by our HPO initiatives in other elements of the business. This includes, for example, to leverage best practices, to further improve our contract management and also pricing performance. HPO also entails the people excellence dimension. We invest in the personnel development of all our employees to push every single individual to finally be a high performer in his activity field.</p>
          <p>Let me now on slide 12 move over to the structural mega-trends supporting our businesses. I would like to focus today on the emerging market and energy mega-trends, and underscore in particular the business synergies between Gases and Engineering in these growth segments.</p>
          <p>The biggest principle of the emerging market mega-trend is straightforward. As you see on page 13, the per capita usage of industrial and healthcare gases in these regions is still well below European or U.S. levels. We, therefore, expect emerging markets to gradually catch-up by posting higher underlying growth rates and this structural growth in emerging markets is not only related to the above average GDP growth, but also to a further increase of the gases intensity driven by an increasing depth of applications and a continuous trend to outsourcing.</p>
          <p>Now slide 14, we have a strong position in emerging markets just from the combined BOC and Linde Gases setups. As you see on this side, we have further leveraged this leading marketing position through a significant CapEx spend. Out of the total Gases investments of &#x20AC;3.5 billion over the last three years, roughly half has been spent in emerging countries. As a result, the share of sales in emerging markets of total Gases revenues has continuously increased towards 32% in 2009.</p>
          <p>In a local market structure like industrial gases, strong market share are of course, as I already mentioned, a competitive factor in the expansion of the business. This is one reason to remind you of our leading position in four out of five emerging market regions on page 15. The second reason here is to put this Gases setup in perspective to our historic customer relationships in these regions on the Engineering side.</p>
          <p>Now the basis is our historic global setup in Engineering, which you can see on slide 16. This business has been active on a worldwide scale for many decades and has not only served in total Gases projects, but also provided numerous plants to third party customers in the chemistry and energy segments. From this business background, Linde Engineering has been building up customer relationships in emerging markets already for decades. And this is reflected by our Engineering customer relationships highlighted on page 17 for markets like China, India, Russia and the Middle East. I think the synergies that we can leverage from these historic customer relationships are sometimes over looked or at least underestimated by the market.</p>
          <p>Let me get back for one moment to our contract signings in Russia in the fourth quarter on page 18. As you know, we signed two large olefin projects for a total order value of &#x20AC;500 million. We additionally signed a first tonnage contract with one of our long-term Engineering customers in Russia, the Novolipetsk Steel. With this new contract, which is another example for how we can leverage synergies between our two divisions, we will further strengthen our market position in the Greater Moscow region.</p>
          <p>Our complementary Engineering and Gases set-up also offers attractive synergies in the energy and environmental mega-trend from a customer as well as from a technological perspective. Starting from our broad technology portfolio, which you can see on page 19, I would like to deepen just three major topics with you today; existing mega projects or enhanced oil and gas recovery, our positioning for a new carbon capture for new carbon capture projects and storage projects, as well as energy efficiency increasing applications for our traditional Gases customers.</p>
          <p>Now page &#x2013; or slide 20, a segment of the energy market where we have today already Gases mega projects being operated as tonnage schemes is the enhanced oil and gas recovery technology. So on this page we have on the one side the tonnage nitrogen scheme that we are running for Pemex in Mexico already since 2000. This project has seen investments of around $1 billion over the last years, and today it's the largest nitrogen production site in the world.</p>
          <p>On the other side, we are currently building a kind of copycat of this Pemex scheme for our joint venture with ADNOC in Abu Dhabi. Again, this is a real mega project. We are talking of the CapEx volume of around US$800 million for 2 ASUs. Here as well we are generating considerable benefits for our customer and see us well positioned for further potential projects in this attractive market segment in the future.</p>
          <p>Now we move to slide 21. Carbon Capture and Storage, on the opposite, will probably turn into mega projects only in a more distant future. The size of this market opportunity will depend on industrial and environmental politics on a global scale. What we can, however, already do today is to give you some feeling on our good positioning in this new market segment.</p>
          <p>As you see now on page 21, we have all carbon capture technologies in our portfolio. This early involvement in the development of carbon capture technologies is spearheaded by our Engineering business, as mentioned on page 22. Based on alliances with leading utilities like Vattenfall and RWE, as well as strong technology partners like BASF and Mitsubishi, we are a supplier of several unique pilot plants in Europe, notably for oxyfuel and post combustion applications.</p>
          <p>Moreover, we are a holder of the prequalification for the following development step, which will be the large-scale demonstration project. Based on these strong references, we are ready to target projects globally as soon as funding programs or economic value will also trigger Carbon Capture and Storage projects in other parts of the world. Again, we trust that we can leverage our unique global networks in Engineering and Gases to identity and seize these opportunities.</p>
          <p>On page 23, you find one example of how the energy and environmental mega-trend is already driving our daily business and is supporting our growth in very traditional customer industries.</p>
          <p>The basic principle is well known; oxygen increases combustion efficiency and simultaneously reduces emissions in steel, glass or metal production.</p>
          <p>We have so far installed REBOX technologies &#x2013; that's the name for our oxygen application for steel furnaces &#x2013; in already 120 production plants around the world. This has resulted in significant energy savings of around 1,000-gigawatt hour per day. And we see further potential for a continuous rollout of these oxygen applications as energy costs and CO2 emissions will remain a key issue for our customers.</p>
          <p>Just have a look at the example of the Arcelor site in the U.S. A 25% capacity increase at 60% lower fuel consumption is, of course, an exceptionally strong performance. So you can imagine looking at these figures that savings potentials of such a magnitude help to attract customers running steel, glass or metal furnaces.</p>
          <p>Now let me finish with our 2010 outlook on page 24. We see still some uncertainties regarding the future economic development, so we base our guidance on the current consensus view of a moderate economic recovery scenario in 2010. In the Gases division we expect an increase in sales and operating profit. For the operating profit, we expect to be above the record level of 2008. This growth will be driven by continuous ramp-ups out of our tonnage project pipeline, as well as ongoing structural growth in healthcare. Moreover, the expected moderate economic recovery will drive a gradual demand improvement also for our merchant product areas, bulk and cylinder.</p>
          <p>In the Engineering division we expect 2010 sales to reach at least the 2009 level. Our order intake in Q4 clearly confirmed that investment climate for our key plant types seems to be improving again. The strong order backlog provides us with a quite good visibility to steal this business. And on this basis we can also confirm an unchanged target margin of 8%.</p>
          <p>On a Group level, this will lead us to a return to growth in sales and operating profit in 2010. And as you can imagine, our ambition is again to achieve an over-proportionate operating profit increase. CapEx should also exceed 2009 levels as the expected economic recovery takes hold. And as I touched upon in my presentation, we remain fully focused on our HPO program and confirm our target of 650 to &#x20AC;800 million gross cost savings by 2012.</p>
          <p>To summarize my three key observations one year after the low point of a significant global recession. First of all, I think we have shown in this exceptional crisis the resilience of our Gases business. Secondly, there are strong mega-trends offering structural growth potential in our core businesses. And we have the right setup regarding local market shares, technologies and customer contact. And this is true not only for our Gases business, but also for Engineering, and especially for the combination, Gases and Engineering.</p>
          <p>And finally, the third point, we are financially, we can say, very robust. Be it for another unexpected downturn, which nobody hopes to come, but man you never know, in the economy over a sudden acceleration in growth opportunities we would prefer this. Whatever happens, I think we have a robust setup. We have a solid financial structure with strong cash flows and good profitability, and we are fully committed to further strengthen this profile on our HPO path towards the high performance culture.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for your attention. And I now hand over to Georg Denoke, our CFO, for some more detailed financials and we will be available for your questions after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wolfgang, and good afternoon also from my side. I will show you a few more figures on our Gases performance and run you through our key financials, like cash flow, CapEx and net debt.</p>
          <p>I'll start with the Gases sales bridge on page 26, and the different impact on our sales development. The positive contribution from changes in consolidation of 2.9% reflects our acquisitions in Australia and Saudi Arabia. Currency movements reduced Gases sales by 1.4%, with a major negative effect from the British pound mainly. The decline in natural gas prices had a negative sales impact of 2.5% due to pass-through clauses in the tonnage business. And as you know, the natural gas price effect has no impact on our operating profit. This leads us to the comparable sales decline of 5.1% for 2009, or just minus 2.3% when you adjust for currency and the natural gas price.</p>
          <p>You also see in the quarterly development that sales were recovering in the second half year for the fourth quarter we were still compared to a strong pre-crisis level up to mid November 2008, the comparable sales decline was only 1.2%.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize the sales development in our operating segment in the Gases business on slide 27. Sales in Western Europe declined by 8.9%, or 4.6% on a comparable basis, to &#x20AC;3.765 billion. This figure is, of course, impacted by the substantial weakening of the British pound. The negative volume effect due to the economic situation was partly compensated by positive pricing.</p>
          <p>Sales in the operating segment Americas of &#x20AC;1.981 billion were down by 10.2%, or 6.8% on a comparable basis. This decline mainly reflects the recessionary environment followed by a slowly developing recovery in North America. Our sales in South America showed a very good stability in the crisis, supported among others by our strong healthcare exposure in this region.</p>
          <p>Sales in the operating segment Asia and Eastern Europe dropped by 5.2% to &#x20AC;1.836 billion. With the decline of only 3% on a comparable basis, our emerging market segment posted the best sales resilience in the crisis year and has thereby proven its re-ability as a growth engine. While these regions were, of course, also affected at the start of the year, we have seen a quite strong recovery, especially in China and South and East Asia, as of the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe, as you know, has not yet experienced the same recovery momentum as it has been observed in the Asian markets. Our revenue in South Pacific and Africa reached &#x20AC;1.418 billion. The acquisition of Elgas in Australia helped to achieve a reported sales growth of 8.2% despite currency losses. While general volume trends in South Pacific were also affected, our performance in this region was overall relatively stable given the global economic context. This good performance was also supported by positive pricing.</p>
          <p>The business development in Africa was impacted by a significant volume decline compared to the previous year, with some improvements in the second half of the year. When we look at our project pipeline in Gases on page 28, you can easily see that the focus is on the emerging markets. For the first time we present to you the total project investment volume of &#x20AC;2.4 billion, of which &#x20AC;500 million in joint ventures which is here contributed at share. This is against the total number of 69 projects, as you know. 65%, including joint ventures of these investments, are allocated to emerging markets and will further strengthen our leading market position in these growth regions.</p>
          <p>We are also showing you the project amount related to the startups of each individual year. Let me clarify here that this is the investment amount of the projects going on-stream in the given year. It is not the CapEx spent in that year. As you know, the CapEx moves into the balance sheet over the construction period.</p>
          <p>If you look closer, you see that the project amount by on-stream date in 2011 is also close to the high level of 2010, even if the number of project is, of course, lower. And please have also in mind that projects take a certain time to fully ramp up. This is the reason why the sales contribution in 2011 is almost equally strong as in 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me now come back to the year 2009 and our Gases operating profit on page 29 by operating segment. Despite the unavoidable volume reduction due to the global recession, we managed to limit the decline in Gases operating profit to minus 1.6%. Our margin improved by 120 basis points to 26.6%, includes of course the contribution from the pass-through of lower natural gas prices.</p>
          <p>However, even if we clean out this effect, we still achieve the significant margin increase of 50 basis points in spite of the operating leverage from the volume reductions. The early implementation of HPO measures and positive pricing hence more than compensated the operating leverage of the recession. And our Gases margin increase was actually supported by improved profit margins in all our operating segments. Actually every operating segment achieved a year-on-year margin increase.</p>
          <p>Let's run quickly through the recurring earnings before tax line, so that you can put this into context. On page 30, you find our EBT development stripping out the exceptional items. We start with the reported decrease in EBT of &#x20AC;168 million from &#x20AC;1.006 billion to the &#x20AC;838 million. This reduction was impacted by unusual items in both financial years.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we recorded non-recurring items of &#x20AC;59 million, mainly due to the disposal post the BOC acquisition, as well as the impairment losses of &#x20AC;22 million. In 2009, the EBT was impacted by the restructuring expenses of &#x20AC;83 million, which were included in our operating profit, while impairment losses amounted to &#x20AC;49 million. If you just adjust for these non-recurring items, our EBT in the recession year 2009 was this &#x20AC;970 million on the prior year level.</p>
          <p>I'm moving over to the cash flow performance, this is on the pages 31 and 32. Driven by a strong working capital management, we further improved the cash flow generation of our new setup. The operating cash flow in 2009 increased by 14.2% to a record level of &#x20AC;2.142 billion. Let me remind you that this significant cash flow increase was achieved in the context of 6.7% decline in operating profit. This was made possible by a strong contribution from our working capital management. Working capital indeed delivered &#x20AC;160 million of positive cash flow in 2009, whereas 197 million cash consumption in 2008.</p>
          <p>If you look into the quarterly development on page 32, you see that with this operating cash flow we cover all our investments. We have financed &#x20AC;990 million of investments, so that the free cash flow generation in 2009 was &#x20AC;1.152 billion before interest and dividend payment. Of that quarter three and quarter four contributed over &#x20AC;400 million. This strong cash flow generation is mainly due to our successful working capital management and significant contributions from our HPO program.</p>
          <p>Regarding the use of our operating cash flow on page 33, cash flow that we target a balance between growth, deleveraging and dividends. We have been consistently telling you that our CapEx to sales ratio in the Gases business is around 13% over the cycle. In 2009, we implemented a strong discipline in merchant investments, while we stayed committed to our tonnage pipeline. Our M&amp;A strategy is focused on bolt-on acquisitions and attractive growth markets, especially in emerging markets and healthcare.</p>
          <p>Given all the significant free cash flow, we decided to keep the dividend stable and allocated 522 million of cash flow for net debt repayment. This brings me to our net debt bridge on slide 34. Net debt was being reduced by &#x20AC;304 million down to a level of &#x20AC;6.1 billon. As you can see, our &#x20AC;522 million contribution to debt reduction out of our strong operating cash flow was partly offset by adverse exchange rate impact.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, net interest of &#x20AC;301 million and dividends of &#x20AC;343 million increased the net debt. Please note that the net interest figure is around &#x20AC;50 million below the last year figure, which is the result of our successful financing and hedging activities.</p>
          <p>On slide 35 you see that with this positive net debt development, the net debt to EBITDA ratio remained at 2.6 times, staying well within our internal target range of two to three times.</p>
          <p>On slide 36, this illustrates that the maturity profile of our financial debt is well spread and very long-term oriented. 95% of the total financial debt will be due beyond 2010, while 55% has a longer maturity than five years. And let me remind you that our liquidity reserve is close to 2.5 billion, including the 2 billion credit facility.</p>
          <p>Based on the very solid financial position, our stable business setup and our confidence in the future development, we have decided to maintain a stable dividend of &#x20AC;1.80 in our proposal to the Annual General Shareholders Meeting. This is part of our commitment towards a long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Let's move over to the pension key figures on page 38. Our net obligation has increased by 204 million to &#x20AC;848 million, as the defined benefit obligation increased over proportionately compared to the planned assets. There are two major market effects to consider. On the one side, interest rates have in general decreased in 2009. As a result, our defined benefit obligation was around &#x20AC;500 million higher than in 2008.</p>
          <p>On the other side, due to the positive market performance above expected returns our planned asset increased by additionally &#x20AC;253 million. Therefore, the total performance of our planned asset based on the lower risk portfolio was around 13% in 2009. Regarding the portfolio structure, we already started to derisk our pension assets at the end of 2007 and reduce the exposure to equity investments. We saw no further need for additional derisking measures in 2009, therefore the portfolio structure is almost identical to last year.</p>
          <p>Regarding taxes, on page 39, our tax rate of 22.1% in 2009 is again slightly better than in the previous year. Overall, the development since 2006 reflects the positive impact of our ongoing tax restructuring. In 2009, we experienced positive deferred tax effects related to PPA, the purchase price allocation, due to local tax rate changes. On the current tax side, we faced negative one-time effects, which will be compensated in the years to come. For 2010, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24 to 26%.</p>
          <p>So let me conclude. In a very challenging market environment, we were able to quickly implement the necessary measures within our HPO program. This allowed us to significantly strengthen our operating margin. We achieved a double-digit increase of the operating cash flow to more than &#x20AC;2.1 billion. This allowed us to keep investing in our growth projects, especially in the emerging markets. We also further strengthened our solid financial structure through additional debt reduction.</p>
          <p>All in all, we hence weathered the crisis very well and came out of this challenging economic environment with an even stronger set up. This gives us a solid base for our further business development.</p>
          <p>So thank you for your attention. We will be happy to take your questions now and I hand over back to the Operator, Vanessa, please.</p>

          <p>Excellent. I just wanted to ask whether you could talk about the sequential pricing and volume progression that you are seeing in the cylinders business? And whether there were significant differences between the different regions and end markets? And if you see any impact at all to the competitive landscape results from the Air Products, Airgas deal, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we look into the development over the year, of course, as you know we started with some significant price initiative pre-prices. This price initiative was becoming, of course, in the end smaller each quarter, but overall we had a very positive price impact to the full year.</p>
          <p>From the mature countries when we look in the regions where we do have a really very significant cylinder business and then great market position, we experienced of course the volume reductions, and on the other hand we experienced that people were keeping cylinders longer through the crisis because in the end it is their ability to offer services.</p>
          <p>So from that perspective I would argue the market expected an even more significant reduction in the cylinder business than we have experienced this. And this is mainly true for our strong European setup in Nordic, in Germany, in UK, for our very strong setup in South Pacific, so overall I think there is no real big difference.</p>
          <p>When we look into the emerging markets and especially, of course, Eastern Europe here has already a very strong cylinder business developed, as well as South America. And here we see at that stage a difference that Eastern Europe, as I was mentioning, is not coming out of the crisis as aggressively as in the Asian markets. Nevertheless, Asian markets do not have the same scope at that stage to our cylinder business. I think this is the answer to your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon. I have a question with regards to the defined benefit pension obligations. Do you see any risk of the net obligation increasing in the coming years throughout demographics and mortality rates and the respective movements that many expect with increases of life expectancy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you can read out of the presentation of the net pension obligation and how we see this in the future. I think all the details how we see the different markets from a mortality perspective, from an interest perspective, is visible in detail in our Annual Report. Therefore, I think this is how we see it. You know that we have an effect on the one hand in the DBO, in the defined benefit obligations, from the lower interest rates. On the other hand, we had a stronger performance past the level than we presented in the P&amp;L statement. Therefore, the overall performance is roughly 13%.</p>
          <p>When we look into the future you know that we have additional top-ups into the scheme, especially for the year 2010 and a little bit for 2011 in UK post BOC acquisition, which is roughly 70 million on top.</p>
          <p>We have implemented &#x2013; I think this is important to understand &#x2013; a different portfolio since we have the merger with BOC. I think we were moving within 70% equity ratio in the schemes when we executed day one. And I think we have now the risk structure which we would like to see into the future. So from that end we have at least de-risked a little bit the portfolio and we have to live with the parameters as they will come in the years.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Apologies. Not again. So just coming back to the margin progression, it seemed to be most significant within the Americas year-on-year for '09. Just wonder why that would be? Is that the weighting of the HPO program? Is there some other issues within that? And also if I can just sneak another one, CapEx to sales guidance for this year, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are, of course, beside the significant improvement on the HPO side, which we always define as sustainable, right, so what we present as cost savings here we define as sustainable and we do not put other cost items in that.</p>
          <p>From a margin comparison viewpoint, only there are two aspects to mention. One is we have over proportionately more natural gas in the system in North America, so from that end there is this calculated impact. This is one part.</p>
          <p>And the other part is, I think I don't know if you find out already, but it's mentioned in the Annual Report. So we got in the fourth quarter something back which we lost in the fourth quarter 2008 because of the bankruptcy of Line de Basel. So from that end in the fourth quarter there was a one-time.

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think that was me, Peter Clark. Yeah. Here is a quick question on the backlog. I appreciate that the backlog is growing again, and obviously you're signing new contracts again. But if I look at the announcement from Q4 onwards, you do seem to be lagging your best major peers in terms of the announcement. So am I missing something there? Because if I look at the numbers, certainly in terms of the published announcement, you were sort of running at five or six, whereas certainly your French competitor would be at nearly 11 or 12 and the U.S. group somewhere in between the two. So I'm just wondering is there something behind that or I'm missing something? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, thank you for your question. We have two things when we talk about backlog. I think this is very important to understand. I think you were referring mainly to the Gases pipeline here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think, of course, we haven't entered in this presentation at that stage 2012. I think this is something we will add during the course of this year. There are already things coming on stream also for the year 2009. We communicated some of that. For example, the joint venture in Chongqing with Sinopec additionally, which has a significant size. I don't know exactly how you compare it.</p>
          <p>What we really would like to express at that stage is that when you were comparing 2011 and 2010 by number of projects, you saw a reduction of 50%, and when you compare by size of project amount, including joint venture activities here, of course, it's only 100 million less compared to 2010. So we don't see ourselves weaker than the peers to be very honest. And I think overall it's always in quarter that you view only.</p>
          <p>I really would like to add the second part when we talk about order backlog, and that is our Engineering business. And I think here it's important that you see also on that end, which is also an indicator of business coming back when customers are making this decision, that we have experienced order intake of more than 900 million in the fourth quarter in the Engineering business. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Okay. I'd like to ask a question about the HPO program please in two parts. Firstly, the additional savings that you are targeting over the next three years, I wonder if you can give any idea whether those will be front or backend loaded, and some sort of indication as to the phasing of how you expect those to accrue. And secondly, on your slide number 10, picking up one of the examples that you discussed in terms of the process improvements, I wonder if you could give some indication of a proportion of which the current plants are already controlled by these regional control centers, operating centers. Where you are in that process now and how much further there is to go? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I will take your the general question around HPO and the timing of the savings, and then Aldo Belloni will give you some figures, how many plants we already have integrated in our global operating controls, and by the way also project which is running under the umbrella of HPO and which is well on track.</p>
          <p>Now in general I think first, again, I have to clearly say HPO is not a traditional and conventional cost savings program. It is a program which tries to standardize all kind of processes of our company on best in class levels and rolling this out around the world. Now as you can imagine, this is a very complex project and usually the savings you get then out as a consequence of reduced complexity within the company, was the clear intentional of the program that comes as a result of a changed process. Therefore, it takes some time to change processes. That's the first statement.</p>
          <p>So the whole program has a shape of an S curve that we could under the &#x2013; within HPO generate savings in 2009, the first year of the four years of the rollout of HPO, already around 300 million &#x2013; little higher than 300 what was just mentioned. That is a clear signal that we had been excellently and by accident being prepared for the crisis. We couldn't know that this would take that twist, but we started the program in January 2008. So when the crisis hit us, it was November-December 2008. We already had fully defined and structured in all details this complex, all-embracing project, which allowed us to have a quick start, a fast start. And what we then did when we saw the crisis, we just accelerated to the utmost the program which was set up and was ready to go, and what was in some areas already started in autumn.</p>
          <p>So there was a little luck, and therefore in the first year normally you have to prepare yourself and you don't get as many savings and then you ramp it up in the second, third year and in the fourth year it goes, yes, a little slower approaching as in particularly the future flight levels. So this traditional shape was changed by our efforts around the world in accelerating the execution and surely it helped, when we traveled around the world, gave speeches and finally succeeded in pulling in all our people around the world, definitely all our executives. And the tag line for this program is; I take the lead, which already means, it addresses every single person in the company, so.</p>
          <p>Now we already grabbed more than the envisaged 150 million what was our original target for the first year, ramping up to finally the 650 to 800. But we grabbed now more than 300. Yes, we pulled ahead a little, what normally would have been then coming in this year. There is a certain pull-ahead effect, but on the other hand, I think don't underestimate the momentum we already generated and what we want to keep, because we truly believe the crisis overall is not over.</p>
          <p>In Asia, it's a completely different story. We already grow in some countries in Asia, India, China, in the first two months of this year, 20% plus, but in other countries around the world the start is slower and the recovery slower. So we are keeping the discipline and the momentum, generated by the pressure given by the overall environment to us, which was already, also let's say an effect, which let's say allowed us to overcome the last little resistance against change, because HPO means also a lot about changed management in a company, which is not so easy.</p>
          <p>People usually say yes, we need change, but when they are individually, on an individual basis affected they don't like it. So the crisis helped us. So to make a long story short, we grabbed around 300 plus in last year. This year we &#x2013; you can expect a range of 150 to 200. Then let's take 180. Don't get me wrong the accuracy, I don't know. It's the corridor. It depends on so many and dozens of different activities. We can't predict it now in March. But we would say between 150 and 200 that would then bring us already far above the 50% level of the program, which still is targeted in the range of 650 to 800.</p>
          <p>I think we will see then most likely and hopefully in 2011, another 150 to 200, and then we should from the viewpoint of today, definitely be closer to this higher number of the 800 or even if there is a chance &#x2013; we are highly motivated, if there is a chance, we go further. We will not stop should we be in a good run. So all in all, this is the most important project for our company. It is all embracing, all activities, all people, all processes and everything what we now change towards a, let's say best-in-class process will be then mirrored in the new IT system, which is a one template SAP approach. I think, you &#x2013; we will &#x2013; we are in the move &#x2013; on the move from becoming a real excellent company. Now, Aldo, on the remote operating control centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, our footprint is very diverse depending on the regions we are talking about, definitely regions like North America, U.K., some parts of Europe. We are far more advanced and like for instances, the regions South and East Asia or Greater China where we are just at the beginning. We have just established the ROC centers in Singapore and Shanghai. And we are progressively adding up new plants.</p>
          <p>So I think we are north of 50% of our plant population on Remote Operating Centers. One think which has to be also bear in mind &#x2013; borne in mind is that we are not just operating remotely at this time, but we are upgrading the process controls of each and every plant, adding advanced process control and linear planning of productions. So it's very &#x2013; there suites of new algorithms, which we're implementing. So it is not just saving the people at a site, but it's also improving the efficiency of the operations of our plant.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. I just had one question as I understand we need to stick to one question, is about the engineering prepayment. Obviously, we've seen that the working capital was quite strong in Q4. We've always seen that you have spectacular order intake signatures in Q4. And I just would like to know, if you can confirm that you have received all the prepayment related to the contracts signed in Q4 and there is nothing more to expect in Q1 and if there is any in Q1, if you could quantify the amount? And also if you can give what are the amount of the prepayments you have in your balance sheet today? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All these are very detailed questions, Jean, that's considering the geography of where the contracts have been booked in Q4. You can imagine that we have been very careful before booking this contract that the financing is in place that Hermes coverage, for instance, is in place. So this is it &#x2013; I think this will answer your question that these payments have been secured. Maybe Georg wants to add something.</p>

          <p>Okay. Tim this is Aldo again. I think we met a few days ago in Shanghai, so it's a relevant question. Well, I think, as we told you at that round table, our strategy so far has been characterized primarily by the quality of our customers in China. We have a tremendous relations through what we call first peer customers like Sinopec, or let's say foreign investors like Bayer, and also first tier steel companies, which is in China a very important differentiation because there are different categories of steel companies in China as you probably have well understood if you review our visits there.</p>
          <p>So the strategy of Linde and prior to Linde, BOC in acquiring new business in China I think so far been characterized by this. They are selective selections of customers, and secondly also by the joint venture approach, which as you know is very particular for Linde and BOC. And I think this has proven to be a very efficient insurance during the slowdown. Also in China there has been, as you remember, a slowdown and these customers have been the first to reemerge. So I think this is, in a nutshell, why we believe that our strategy has paid out in that part of the world.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, this is Norbert Barth from WestLB. So I don't expect a takeover or merger between Deutsche, Nomura and WestLB, but perhaps related a little bit to that question, I am sure that you're also looking quite intensely or interested what is happening in the U.S. gas market. I only want to ask it in that way around. Would you review your U.S. gas business strategy which you installed two, three years ago, when you sold your merchant business, might there be something interesting for you?</p>
          <p>And so the second question if I may. What guidance will you have a mixture on operating target guidance? Now I would say being somewhat back on, I would say, not to a normal level, but clearly a more stabilized level, do you want to introduce that again to mid-term earnings target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First to this takeover effort of Air Products for Airgas in U.S., I think you are aware that this is a typical unfriendly takeover effort, a process like this where the takeover target is severely, heavily, emotionally resisting that takeover. That process will take a while. And as all gases companies also we are watching what's happening there, but please understand that we don't make &#x2013; want to make any comment on this. And in principle you know, this would finally &#x2013; would Air Products takeover Airgas, that would not change our competitive setup in U.S., because we already sold our cylinder businesses in 2007 to Airgas.</p>
          <p>And we also had to sell our ASUs &#x2013; most of the Linde ASUs after the takeover of BOC. We had to dispose that because of antitrust. So I think we are very relaxed in watching that, whatever outcome we will see, and it would also be not right to make any comment because such a situation is so sensitive. A comment from us could immediately move the share price either on the Air Products side or on our side. And therefore, I think, it's not appropriate to make any comments for us. We watch it in a very relaxed way and whatever happens we &#x2013; it will not change our competitive situation in U.S.</p>
          <p>Now, the second question was our operating target. I mean, as you know, pre-crisis we said our ambition is to have in 2010 to arrive at an EBITDA level of three billion. Now who could foresee what would happen, will this nightmarish crisis force us to finally shift that target. I clearly want to say this is our target; it will remain our target; and we are ambitious to reach it as fast as we can. It will be a little later. It will not be this year. I think you don't expect that. But on the other hand we have that target still in mind and it will be a little later; but we will arrive there. We will make our way to that number. But we are not doing any, let's say, aggressive stupid things in order to move that up. So we will not do stupid acquisitions or things like this and in principle you also didn't expect us to reach that target by a bigger acquisition. But more in a normal organic growth path and so you can clearly see that this three billion target we have in mind we want to reach as soon as possible and we will reach it.</p>

          <p>Fantastic. Just coming back on the question on China if I can, please. Yingde recently released some data from I think a consultancy firm which suggested that they'd actually leap-frogged you as the largest on-site producer in China. And I know that Air Liquide, are sort of talking about quite strong growth in their Chinese activities and sales in 2010 and 2011. I wonder if you just talk a little bit about the &#x2013; well, A), whether you agree with the sort of data that perhaps has been recently released in the market about market positions, but also about the competitive environment in China at the moment, please? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Peter, what you have to take into consideration is that not all of our sales is subsidiary sales and visible in the top line. I think this is important to understand from the strategy as it is implemented at that stage. And of course, when we talk about that we then talk about including joint venture activities because this is an operational performance, and how we entered into China and how we further develop China and we look into the future too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. So, two questions. First is I would like to know how do you spread the contribution of the new commissioned projects in tonnage within the Europe? Is it mainly in Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4? That's my first question. And my second question is on your new projects in 2009 &#x2013; 2010, sorry, and '11. How is it spread by type of projects by end-user market, meaning chemicals, refining, energy and environmental related projects and so forth? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bernoit, thank you for your questions. I think we do not want to give here quarterly guidance on ramp-up of project. We stick to the yearly. It's comes over the year. So because of the ramp-up of the other projects out of the previous years on stream date so there's not one specific thing we would like to mention at that stage from a quarterly development.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I have just one left. Looking back to the 20 start-ups for 2010, I was just wondering maybe, Georg, if you could tell us the split between what could be fully consolidated, what will be recorded as joint venture, and what will be reported as FX for contracts, even roughly? Is it, let's say, a third? Is it 50/25/25? That would be very helpful for modeling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think we decided not have the split at that stage available. I understand fully that business helping to modeling top line sales. I think that's no question. We really have to focus that you understand that number of project is one piece and investment volume against number of project is a different thing. This obviously is the main intention. We leave it a little bit up to you.</p>
          <p>You know from our communication that significant joint venture contributions will come also in 2011 when we look into the new graph. 2011 is, from an JV activity, is stronger than 2010. Nevertheless contribution through the ramp-up can be, from a subsidiaries perspective, quite similar. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you, gentlemen. Obviously strong performance in Q4 of the engineering division. And I was just wondering, assuming that possibly order intake could go down, what are the key performance indicators? How you measure the synergies between engineering and gases, given in gases you have substantial room for growth and you could focus possibly also entirely there. What are the key performance indicators? How do you measure the synergies between the engineering and the gases division for us who are not inside the company so that we could follow that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the key performance indicators, is maybe too strong a statement. I think what we observe of course is the progressive shift from plant engineering transactions to gas transactions. As you know, Linde Engineering is a very strong, let's say, a very reputable provider of technology. So normally Linde Engineering is the first place in the Group where a new project is being communicated by a potential customer. And therefore we have this initial contact. And we are obviously trying immediately to convert this engineering interest into a new gas transaction. So this is something which I am following very closely, how high the yield is of this conversion.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, of course we have a strong population of past engineering and plant transactions where the plants are already existing. And therefore we are looking at what we call the captivation to go back to this customer and try to recuperate these assets for the gas business. I think these are the two most tangible and obvious at KPI so to say.</p>
          <p>But there are of course many other synergies like of course the customer proximity when it comes to petrochemical companies for instance where out of an olefin contract you can develop air gas contract like it happened in Abu Dhabi recently. So it's a mixed portfolio of synergies, but the two ones which I had mentioned at the beginning probably are the more easy to track.</p>

          <p>So thank you that we could answer all your questions and thank you for participating. I hand over for a final comment to our CEO. And thank you for being with us. And next time on our next conference I think we can make it happen as a live conference again and not only a telephone conference. So thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, also from my side thank you so much for your interesting questions, which gave us an opportunity to highlight some additional topics which are important to understand our business, the situation of Linde and how we performed.</p>
          <p>And I think unfortunately today no one is able to forecast what the second half of 2010 will really bring us. Hopefully all the different threats and dark clouds hanging around with finally even the risk of whole countries going bankrupt, I think overall there is a good chance that everything works out fine and that we are coming slowly but steady back to a normal growth situation.</p>
          <p>Fortunately we have that good footprint in Asia where we see this very, very good development. But still we would like to see more tailwind for the different industrial segments in North America and in Europe. But we are optimistic, a little bit cautiously optimistic, but we are overall optimistic.</p>
          <p>And I think we have a very good, let's say, cost structure created last year, which creates the basis for this year and which would allow us to perform, given the overall environment, fairly well. So thanks for following Linde and we will then come back with our first quarter results soon. Thank you.</p>
