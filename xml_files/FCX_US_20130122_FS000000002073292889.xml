          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Our results were released earlier this morning, and a copy of the press release is available on our website at fcx.com. Our conference call today is being broadcast live on the Internet, and anyone may listen to the call by accessing our website home page and clicking on the webcast link for the conference call.</p>
          <p>We also have several slides to supplement our comments this morning and will be referring to the slides during the call. The slides are also accessible using the webcast link on fcx.com. In addition to analysts and investors, the financial press has been invited to listen to today's call, and a replay of the webcast will be available on our website later today.</p>
          <p>Before we begin our comments today, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on this call include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.</p>
          <p>On the call today is Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the Board; Richard Adkerson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Red Conger is here. Mark Johnson and Dave Thornton have also joined us this morning. I'll start by briefly summarizing the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will review our recent performance and outlook. As usual, after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.</p>
          <p>Today, FCX reported fourth quarter 2012 net income attributable to common stock of $743 million or $0.78 per share compared with $640 million or $0.67 per share for the fourth quarter of 2011. Our fourth quarter 2012 net income included net credits totaling $40 million or $0.04 a share associated with adjustments to environmental obligations and related litigation reserves, a gain for insurance recoveries, partly offset by charges for new labor agreements in South America and for costs associated with the pending transactions with Plains Exploration and McMoRan.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated copper sales of 972 million pounds were higher than our estimates of 930 million pounds, primarily reflecting higher production from our Americas operations. Fourth quarter 2012 consolidated gold sales of 254,000 ounces and molybdenum sales of 21 million pounds approximated our October 2012 estimates of 255,000 ounces and 20 million pounds of molybdenum.</p>
          <p>Our fourth quarter 2012 consolidated copper and gold sales were higher than fourth quarter 2011 sales of 823 million pounds of copper and 133,000 ounces of gold, primarily reflecting the impact in the fourth quarter of 2011 of the labor disruptions at PT Freeport Indonesia. Operations have improved during 2012 at PT Freeport Indonesia.</p>
          <p>Our sales for the year 2012 of copper totaled 3.65 billion pounds, 1 million ounces of gold and 83 million pounds of molybdenum. That compared to 3.7 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold and 79 million pounds of molybdenum in the 2011 year. As Richard will be discussing, we've got an outlook for growing production volumes in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Our realized copper price for the fourth quarter of 2012 is $3.60. That compared to a realized price of $3.42 per pound in the fourth quarter of 2011. Our gold realization averaged $1,681 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared to $1,656 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2011. And the molybdenum price in the fourth quarter of 2012 averaged $12.62 per pound compared with $15.08 per pound in the year-ago quarter.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated average unit net cash costs for the fourth quarter averaged $1.54 per pound. This was slightly better than our estimates going into the quarter and lower than last year's unit net cash costs of $1.57 per pound. Our full-year average unit net cash costs for 2012 averaged $1.48 per pound. And again, as we grow our production volumes, we've got an outlook for declining unit cash costs in 2013 and beyond.</p>
          <p>The operating cash flows during the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, which included net working capital sources of $122 million. And for the year, we generated $3.8 billion of operating cash flows, and that was net of working capital use of $1.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $976 million, bringing the annual capital expenditures to $3.5 billion in 2012. We ended the year with a cash position of $3.7 billion, which exceeded our total debt, which was $3.5 billion at year-end 2012.</p>
          <p>We also have included in the release an update on our transactions that we announced on December 5, whereby FCX announced definitive agreements to acquire Plains Exploration &amp; Production Company and McMoRan Exploration. The Plains per-share consideration is equivalent to 0.6531 shares of FCX common stock and $25 in cash. That works out to $3.4 billion in cash and 91 million shares of FCX common stock. The MMR per-share consideration consists of $14.75 in cash and 1.15 units of a royalty trust, which will hold a 5% overriding royalty interest in future production from McMoRan's ultra-deep exploration prospects.</p>
          <p>Completion of the transaction is subject to receipt of the Plains and McMoRan shareholders approval, regulatory approvals and other customary conditions. In late December, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period with respect to both transactions. We expect that the Plains and McMoRan shareholder meetings will be scheduled upon the effectiveness of the registrations filed with the SEC in late December. And we expect the transactions to close in the second quarter of 2013.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to the slide presentation on our website.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kathleen and good morning to everyone. I'm going to start initially by focusing on our global mining business and on copper. 2012 was a year that was abnormal for us, and I want to try to explain why that occurred and what our outlook will be going forward beyond 2012. Later, we will cover the transactions that Kathleen referred to that we announced on December 5 and respond to questions about those. After those transactions, I want to point out that 75% of our business will be represented by our global mining business, and copper will continue to be the driver of our cash flows and profitability.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2012. We executed on our efforts to grow production in North America and Africa &#x2013; and I'm going to come back to that, but we're having success in executing our growth plans. And we have the prospects for very significant growth. In copper volumes, by 2015, our plans would result in higher volumes consolidated for our company of greater than 35% than the volumes we had in 2012.</p>
          <p>2012 was significantly affected by unusually ore grades in Indonesia, and some of that came about as a result of the strike that we had in 2011 and the effect on productivity. Looking back, these are the lowest grades that we've had at Grasberg in 18 years. And we are looking to having higher grades in 2013, beginning near the end of the year. And beyond that, our profitability at Grasberg should be extraordinary.</p>
          <p>We're continuing to advance financially attractive brownfield development projects. The Phase II project at Tenke Fungurume and the Democratic Republic of Congo is substantially complete, on time and on budget, which is a significant accomplishment. In relation to our initial project at our major expansion at Cerro Verde mine in Peru, we've received approval of our environmental impact study. And we expect to begin construction in 2013. And we have begun construction of our expansion project at our flagship mine in Arizona at Morenci. So we are positioned for multiyear growth in copper volumes of significance.</p>
          <p>When we look at the quarter, the quarter was one where we executed our plans. Our consolidated volumes were slightly higher than we had &#x2013; than we had given guidance for. Our unit net cash cost was 5% lower than our guidance. We achieved our targets for gold and molybdenum.</p>
          <p>The cash costs, if we look at Page 6, shows that in North America, we were right on line with what our guidance was going into the quarter. Red Conger's here. He and his team's done a great job in managing cost, achieving production volumes. Our unit costs were lower in South America. They were actually lower than anticipated in Indonesia and in Africa. And overall at $1.54, consolidated costs this year was lower than our guidance of $1.62. Our sales in North America, South America, Africa were higher than our outlooks, as well as in Indonesia and &#x2013; but again, I want to come back to just why this was such an unusual year. And we want to focus on Grasberg as a reason for that.</p>
          <p>We had very unusually low metal production in 2012, both compared with historical levels, as you can see at the charts at the bottom, for copper and gold. And that resulted from lower grades in the Grasberg open pit. This year, we were mining at the upper reaches of that pit. We have included in our reference slides schematics that we have shown for many years that show that. We're now beginning our final push backs for the open pit. We expect the pit to produce through 2016. And as we go forward, beginning late in 2013 and 2014, our stripping requirements are going to drop dramatically and our volumes will increase and our profitability will increase.</p>
          <p>We were also affected by a slower-than-anticipated ramp up of our underground DOZ mine, where panel repairs that we had following the inactivity relating to the strike are more extensive. We expect to get back to traditional levels. This mine has a capacity of roughly 80,000 tons per day. The current rate is 50,000 tons per day. So because of mine sequencing, some adjustments because of geotechnical factors, we just had lower grades this year. And that resulted in having unit cost at Grasberg of $1.24, where we've been averaging $0.13. We will have lower costs next year as we move into higher grades by the end of the year. And then going in the period through the remaining life of the open pit, we should be down to where our gold revenues will fully fund &#x2013; more than fully fund our operating cost. So that had a lot to do with why 2012 was an abnormal year for us.</p>
          <p>Now looking at copper markets, copper is not currently at its all-time highs that we experienced in 2011. But considering the global economic situation, there's no way to say anything other than current price is very strong. And in today's world, we are seeing, in our business, some degree of improvements in markets in the United States, in the Middle East. China shows promise this year for renewed growth as they spend &#x2013; as China spends on infrastructure and takes steps to improve its economy.</p>
          <p>Construction in the U.S. is growing. Automobiles have been strong, and the outlook is for continued strength. There's investments being made by power companies to invest in the grid. There's some short-term effect from the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. And overall, in the U.S., our business and our customers are talking to us about an environment of not significant but moderate growth.</p>
          <p>Europe, of course, continues to be very weak. But in China, the market appears to be picking up from renewed investment in infrastructure. The facts are that there are things that could cause variations in copper prices near term because of inventory levels in China &#x2013; and there's always speculation about that. But underlying today's world is an improved outlook for the global economy, based on where we were several months ago. And that should be good for our business.</p>
          <p>China, of course, remains the important demand driver. Global exchange inventories remain relatively low. And underlying all this marketplace, which is, in many ways unique for copper as a commodity, is supply challenges.</p>
          <p>We talked for years about the impact on grades of aging mines, on impacts on aging mechanical systems that mines developed in the past, the inferior quality of new development projects available to the industry. And around the world today, many companies are reducing capital and deferring projects. And that should be supportive of prices in the long run.</p>
          <p>The strength of our company is the reserves and resources that we have available to us. Page 10 gives our report on our year-end reserves at the end of 2012. And we show proved and probable copper reserves based on mine plans at $2 a pound for copper of 116 billion pounds, and then our 3.42 billion pounds of molybdenum and 32.5 million ounces for gold. We've had significant increases in our reserves since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge in 2007, over 46 billion pounds of copper. You can see in the chart that our reserves are essentially divided equally between North America, South America and Indonesia. And those reserves give us the opportunity for near-term and longer-term growth.</p>
          <p>And beyond the reserves that we have on Page 11 is &#x2013; a significant aspect to our company is mineralized material that contains copper, not yet meeting the standards to be reported as proved and probable reserves. But at a $2.20 copper price, this contained copper is over 100 billion pounds of incremental copper. And these resources, half of those are located in North America.</p>
          <p>We have these near-term projects that are progressing, that should give us this really significant near-term increase in volumes. But what this provides us is a longer-term opportunity for a development project beyond those. And we will &#x2013; we have not lost our enthusiasm about copper markets, our enthusiasm about developing these resources. And these should create really significant values for our shareholders because they're not currently valued in our stock. And to the extent we can create cash flow projects out of them, all of that will come to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now we did not add reserves this year, but we continued an aggressive exploration program. And we have the potential for significant future increases in reserves. The exploration program is a matter of timing. It involves doing exploration drilling, metallurgical analysis, analysis of economic factors related to land holdings, availability of power and water. And we continue to advance those.</p>
          <p>We have a tremendous opportunity with our El Abra property in Chile, where we have identified over the past five years a very large sulfide resource. And we're working to develop the feasibility of a major mill project there to supplement our current sulfide leaching project, our Sulfolix project. Other than that, though, we have growth opportunities in the U.S. and in Africa with our Kisanfu concession, which is separate from Tenke Fungurume. But we're going to continue to target these, do work with a view towards adding reserves but, more importantly, we're looking for how we can advance these reserves and resources into projects.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows a slide that we've been using for many years; makes a couple of points. One, of course, Grasberg is there, as the mine with the largest copper reserves in the world. It also has more gold reserves than any mine in the world. Its production is down this year. Typically is near the top of the copper production chart. But we note the years when these mines were discovered. The point here is, it is very rare to find a world-class copper mine. And mines, when they are found, produce for decades. You see it in the industry for &#x2013; since &#x2013; over the past 10 years, companies have been spending significant money for exploration. It's noteworthy the relatively few successes that have come about through exploration.</p>
          <p>Then, while we have significant resources, the facts are, it takes time to convert those resources into development projects and producing mines. It's just the nature of this business. I call it the double-edged sword of the copper markets. That's the reason copper prices are high and are likely to remain strong because of that time.</p>
          <p>But with our company, we have the opportunity through our near-term brownfield development projects to add this significant volumes. In North America at Morenci and beyond the current mill project that is now underway with construction, we have significant sulfide expansions that gives us a chance to look at a future large mill opportunity at Morenci.</p>
          <p>I mentioned, El Abra, the Cerro Verde expansion is underway. We expect to begin construction next year. Phase II at Tenke is complete. We have additional growth opportunities there with our oxide resource. There's a very significant mixed ore and sulfide resource for future expansion opportunities that we're doing exploration analysis, metallurgical work, processing work and logistics work to see how we could take advantage for it. And then Grasberg, beyond the open pit era, has decades of life in the underground that will result in it being a high-volume, low-cost operation for many years going forward.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 shows this growth that we have on a consolidated basis. Starting with 2012, we're looking for 20% growth in volumes next year; another 15% beyond 2014. And that should be sustainable. You can see that the chart at the top where this growth is coming from. Its' from our global business. These brownfield projects have significantly less risk than projects that are greenfield in nature.</p>
          <p>The infrastructure development, because you're operating in place already, is much less. Technology is proven. It results in efficient expenditure of capital. You get the benefits of scale as you expand. And you understand the risk better, and they're just less significant. And that gives you higher returns off of brownfield projects than other projects.</p>
          <p>So again, I want to just go back and think about 2012, where we got these kind of growth opportunities going forward for copper. In gold, we expect to have 40% higher gold volumes in 2013 coming out of Grasberg than before. We expect our unit cost &#x2013; and this will be coming into play later in 2013 &#x2013; to be down by 10% next year, to go from the $1.50 level to $1.35. And then, assuming continuation of current cost levels, we'd see unit costs dropping in 2014 by, say, another 20% to the $1.15, $1.20 level.</p>
          <p>That's consolidated basis heading towards 5 billion pounds. With that kind of unit cost level, it just shows what a great business. And that translates into higher operating cash flows at current prices, we'd expect our operating cash flows to increase a third next year and 60% over 2012 by 2014.</p>
          <p>The details of our brownfield expansion projects on the next set of slides, beginning with Morenci, where we're expanding our mill to 115,000 tons per day and our mining rate to &#x2013; significantly to 900,000 tons. This is a $1.4 billion project to add 225 million pounds. And you can see the historical and prospective outlook for Morenci which, not too long ago, was viewed as a end-of-life, dead-end asset. And now it's a asset that generates significant current profits and significant growth going forward.</p>
          <p>Cerro Verde, we're going to be tripling the output of our mill there. Completion would result in this being the largest concentrating milling operations in the world. Increased mining rates, more capital, $4.4 billion, but significant incremental production of 600 million pounds per year with moly alone. With it &#x2013; at this stage, we're more than halfway through our engineering work, on line to commence construction in 2013 and complete it in 2016.</p>
          <p>I mentioned the success of our Phase II project at Tenke where we're expanding our mill to 14,000 tons per day, increasing our mining rate, adding tankhouse capacity, $850 million of capital cost to get to 150 million pounds of incremental copper. We're, in effect, complete with this project now. We have to &#x2013; next year, we'll be building our second sulfur burner there to provide sulfur for our operations. And we're already thinking about what our next expansion will be.</p>
          <p>We've announced today an acquisition of a cobalt refinery by the Tenke Fungurume Mining partners. Cobalt's a very small market. We're going to be producing a lot of cobalt. We were dealing with the issues of how to access that market in an efficient way. We knew we needed to make an investment. We found this opportunity to purchase an existing facility and have acted on it.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; this gives us an experienced management team and a direct access to end markets, similar in some ways to what Cyprus Amax did back many years ago in the way that they approached the molybdenum market with the investments that they made, followed up by Phelps Dodge. And that gives us an efficient access to downstream markets in molybdenum. This will do it for cobalt.</p>
          <p>At Grasberg, we have made significant progress with the underground development and advancing this in an efficient way. It involves a significant amount of capital but will be spent over a number of years. The Grasberg Block Cave will be prepared to start up in 2017. This is an extension of the current ore body we're mining in the pit. Same ore body extending down to where we will begin to be mining it underground. And we're also will be starting up, expected in 2015, an extension of our current DOZ mines at DMLZ mine, which will have a capacity of 80,000 tons a day in 2021, and very attractive grades.</p>
          <p>You can see that on the underground era that we will be mining an ore body that'll give us significant metal volumes in relation to our historical metal volumes for both copper and gold. There's a interesting reference slide that we're &#x2013; we've shown back in the back that shows our mine plan and our share of metal production. From 2013 to go forward, you can &#x2013; let see &#x2013; don't have a page number for that.</p>
          <p>Page 38. And you can see what we expect in 2013. And as we go forward in the years 2014 to 2016, just what attractive levels of copper volumes and gold volumes we will have as we complete mining the open pit with very limited stripping.</p>
          <p>There's a transition year in 2017, which is not a terrible year. It's much better than historically we were looking for, as we will have the benefit of the DMLZ mines, some stockpiling material. And then from beyond that to 2017/2021 back to metal and &#x2013; of copper and gold that's consistent with historical levels for Grasberg.</p>
          <p>So our outlook for 2013, on Page 21, is for 4.3 billion pounds of copper, 1.4 million ounces of gold; as I said, 40% higher. Lower unit cash cost. This will come into play &#x2013; I'll show you a slide in a minute. Later in the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, our unit cost will be higher in the first quarter, and just shows you if we average down to $1.35, how low they're going to be beyond that. At $3.65 copper, our modeled operating cash flows would be approximately 7 billion pounds &#x2013; and we're looking to $7 billion. And we're looking at capital expenditures of $4.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Page 22 shows this growing copper sales production profile. It shows growing gold sales based on the Grasberg mine plan. And our molybdenum sales, with taking into account our recently restarted Climax mine. Quarterly production that I referred to earlier is on Page 23, showing that the first quarter &#x2013; this was like the old days at Grasberg when we seemed to have this every year. But we have a lower at the first quarter, with a really strong second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. You can see, looking at over 500,000 ounces of gold sales in the fourth quarter, based on our reaching the higher-grade sections of the mine.</p>
          <p>Our sales by region are shown on Page 24, showing growth in North America, South America; recovery significantly in Indonesia and growth in Africa. And that will result in the unit cost improvement that I referred to earlier. This shows at the bottom of the page, 2013 consolidated unit cost going from $1.48 to a projected $1.35, based on $3.65 copper, $1,700 gold, $11 molybdenum and $12 cobalt. As I said, this will be &#x2013; vary significantly by quarter.</p>
          <p>And this shows a reconciliation of how we go on Page 26 from $1.48 to $1.35. It also shows that if we had the 2014 Grasberg volumes, our cost would go down to $1.15, and that's assuming today's cost levels stay the same. 27 shows the impact of growth on our business. The solid green and gold portions of the chart show what our averages are expected to be for 2013 and 2014, where ranging from $3 to $4 of copper prices, our EBITDA would range from $7 billion to $11 billion and cash flows from $5 billion to $8 billion. As I said, roughly $7 billion at current copper prices for that period.</p>
          <p>Then adding in our growth that would occur from our volumes in 2015 to 2016, you can see the very significant increases of roughly 50%, with EBITDA ranging from $11 billion to $16 billion and operating cash flows from $8 billion to $11 billion. So the effective growth in the mining business is significant. The sensitivities to prices and certain input cost are included on Page 28, for your information.</p>
          <p>Our exploration spending continues to be aggressive, as we show on Page 29, with our budget for 2013 at $235 million, focusing on brownfield opportunities around the world. We have some investments in greenfield. And if that's successful, that would be great. But our opportunities are really significant with our brownfield expansions.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditures on Page 30 are projected for $4.6 billion for 2013. As we complete our major projects over the next three years, those capital expenditures would be dropping. We're working hard to come up with new projects to supplement those on a going-forward basis to take advantage of our reserve and resource position.</p>
          <p>So that's a summary of our existing global mining business and our opportunities in the copper industry. We announced on December 5, transactions to acquire Plains Exploration and McMoRan.</p>
          <p>The board's decision to invest in these assets is explained in great detail in a filing we made with the SEC on Form S-4, right at the end of December. And I would encourage you to spend some time looking at that document. It described the process the board followed in considering the deal and in negotiating the terms of the transaction because of the related party situation involving the three companies. FCX had a special committee of independent and unaffiliated directors who considered this transaction and negotiated the terms.</p>
          <p>The board's decision was driven by its positive, long-term global economic outlook. Our board is real believers in their outlook for commodities, including the commodities in our mining business and the outlook for the oil and gas business.</p>
          <p>Board was faced with the situation that I referred to earlier about limited opportunities to invest in copper beyond our brownfield expansions. Over the years, we've been tracking opportunities to invest outside the company in M&amp;A transactions in the mining business and have not found the opportunities that were attractive to us. And these transactions were provided with the opportunities to acquire high-quality assets in the oil and gas industry, an industry that our board and management team has had experience in, where we understand the risk and opportunities associated with that business.</p>
          <p>Near-term cash flows of these assets are going to be driven by crude oil revenues, and crude oil is a commodity that's closely correlated to copper. So this is something that's consistent with our view about the global economic outlook.</p>
          <p>The assets have current production that generate strong margins and cash flows. We anticipate following a disciplined business plan to use the current cash flows off the oil and gas business that we're acquiring to fund its exploration and development capital expenditures. Those assets provide financially attractive near-term and long-term growth opportunities. It provides geographic diversification exposure to other commodities. It also gives us a enhanced exposure to exploration, particularly in the McMoRan situation, through its ultra-deep gas drilling program. But also with the Plains' assets, particularly in the deepwater, where they have multiple high-quality exploration targets.</p>
          <p>In addition to this exposure to oil markets through McMoRan's Exploration's/Plains' position in the Haynesville Shale, it will give the company an important position in the U.S. natural gas market for the long term. It's not driving current cash flows or economics, but that business potentially has very significant values to our shareholder. And it will give us a chance to achieve long-term returns for shareholders.</p>
          <p>The combined companies have the management capabilities to execute a disciplined business plan. We're going to be &#x2013; we took advantage &#x2013; are taking advantage of low-cost debt financing to fund the cash portion of this transaction. And we're going to be committed to a disciplined approach to de-levering the debt that we'll be taking on.</p>
          <p>You can see on Slide 32 at the bottom that we'll go from a mining company to a company of where mining represents roughly three quarters of our business from an EBITDA standpoint, and oil and gas 25%. And we'll go from a situation of where North America, the U.S. currently represents about 30% of our business to 50% of our business. Credit rating agencies considered this a positive in terms of maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.</p>
          <p>Slide 33 shows what our pro forma combined EBITDA and operating cash flows will be. The solid sections of these charts, the green and red sections, present the combined 2013/2014 outlook. And then the growth from both the mining business and the oil and gas business is represented in the dotted lines above that.</p>
          <p>You can see this is similar to what we saw with just our mining business on a stand-alone basis. And one of the attractive things here is looking at the growth opportunities in oil and gas as complementary to the growth that we have in the mining business and gives us a chance to have significant growth.</p>
          <p>Now Slide 34 presents the way we're going to be focused in running our business. We're going to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit profile. We've had a long track record of doing this, of generating values for shareholders, of managing our balance sheet in the disciplined way. As we talk, we're in the market right now with our bank deals and talk with the banks and the credit rating agencies. Everyone is positive about the way we managed the debt in the Phelps Dodge transaction in 2007 and how we dealt with the 2008/2009 financial crisis. We're going to continue to do that.</p>
          <p>We have developed assets at Grasberg, at Tenke Fungurume in a very aggressive and disciplined way. We've taken advantage of opportunities provided by Phelps Dodge in 2007 to achieve asset and geographical diversity. And then taken advantage of markets to develop assets to &#x2013; that created significant values for our shareholders. These assets will provide us an opportunity to enhance long-term returns for shareholders, and that's what we're going to be focused on.</p>
          <p>I'll just point out, our executive management teams have significant shareholders in FCX, and we're committed to creating values in those shares. But we're going to be sensitive to risk. We're going to do rigorous economic analysis for making investments. We're going to protect our downside and get leverage to the upside. We're going to prioritize and rank opportunities to invest in those with the highest returns as we manage risk. And we look at our overall portfolio, we're going to limit the number of projects we look at. We're going to be really committed to this de-leveraging program.</p>
          <p>We'll begin the process with roughly $20 billion of gross debt, $16 billion of net debt. Our plan will not be to come back to zero net debt as we are right now but to reduce our debt to a targeted level. We're thinking now of roughly $12 billion. After reaching that, we would be back in a position to invest in our growth projects. But given continuation of attractive commodity prices, we would have excess cash that would allow us to return cash to shareholders through higher dividends and potentially stock buybacks.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, we're going to be continuing our current dividend rate at $1.25 share, and we're going to be committed to this longstanding tradition at Freeport of maximizing value for shareholders and managing the risk of our business.</p>
          <p>So with that, Jim Bob's here with me and our management team to respond to questions that you might have.</p>

          <p>Hey, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard. I've got a couple questions here. One, I was wondering if you could update us a little bit with the Contract of Work review and just the process there and the timing again of the presidential election.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The presidential election occurs in 2014. The first round is midyear in 2014. This month begins a process also of electing a new governor in Papua. And so 2013 and 2014 &#x2013; in 2013, a number of provincial elections will be held in Indonesia. And the presidential and parliamentary elections will occur in 2014.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; we began a process in a formal way a little over a year ago in talking with the government about our &#x2013; getting our extension for our contract. For those of you who don't follow us that closely, we operate under a Contract of Work in Indonesia. We signed the most recent contract in 1991. It has a 30-year primary term. And the contract itself provides us the right to extend it for two 10-year periods through 2041. And we have to apply for that. The government cannot unreasonably withhold or delay granting that extension. Indonesia passed a new mining law, and the country has undertaken a review of all contract of works, including ours.</p>
          <p>And what our discussions involved is a discussion around this review of contracts, obtaining the extension for our existing contract. And we are working cooperatively with the government to find ways of being responsive to certain of the aspirations of people in government and the population in Indonesia and protecting the interests of our shareholder by getting our extensions on a way that protects the values of our operations there.</p>
          <p>Confident we'll be able to get that. The election and political situation in Indonesia requires time to go through the process, and that's what we're doing now. And that we've made what I feel is good progress. And I'm confident we'll be able resolve this on a way that our shareholders will be happy with and that the Government of Indonesia will also find acceptable.</p>
          <p>But <mark type="indiscernible" /> (49:03)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me add one thing for Tony. Under normal circumstances, if we didn't have this massive underground projects under which they've seen based a project, some in government would say that we should only ask for an extension two years before our contract expires, which would be 2019. But with us spending, as you've seeing from our spending charts, $15 billion over the next number of years to get to full production with the underground, we went with the idea that you have to have certainty. And the government agrees.</p>
          <p>So that's just another wrinkle that cause us to have to deal with this in a business way. And we're getting good support from the government. But in normal circumstances, as I say, some in new government would say, you should wait until &#x2013; two years before your contract expires. So that's just a wrinkle that we need to be sure and point out.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>I'm not even sure they're aware of it, Tony.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're focused on our business in Indonesia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; and I've had discussions with a number of &#x2013; they read the news releases in the papers and so forth. But we &#x2013; it was like when we acquired Phelps Dodge, you know they were interested in it. We made the point that, that gave us a lot more global resources that we could apply to bear in running our business. Of course, Indonesia, it's a significant oil producer. And so &#x2013; but it's not a factor in our discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the other question I have is one on the copper market. And, Richard, you made some comments that there's always uncertainty surrounding Chinese inventories. And I was wondering if you did have any more specific thoughts on the level of bonded warehouse stocks there, and how you think this may potentially impact Chinese imports in 2013. Obviously, Chinese imports have been so substantial to the market, and just wondered, any additional thoughts you may have there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I wanted to comment on it because it is a factor. And I didn't &#x2013; while we see these emerging, more positive views about the markets &#x2013; and certainly, today, as I talk to people, to our commercial people, to others involved in China, the view about China is more positive than it was, say, at LME Week last fall. But while the copper market, Tony, as you know more &#x2013; better than anybody, is a really pretty visible global marketplace, the one aspect that has less visibility is this issue about off-exchange inventories in China.</p>
          <p>And there's currently different views about the level of those inventories. Our people tend to believe that those inventories are not liquid-like exchange inventories. But we have seen instances in the past of where the Chinese have adjusted buying patterns, and that's the factor that could occur. When that happens, I've always looked underneath that to see what's going on in the fundamental economy because actions on buying patterns tend to be temporary. And the underlying economy's really what's going to drive the copper price long run.</p>
          <p>But I felt that I needed to mention that because those inventories are significant. And the question is the degree of liquidity and how they come into play and affecting imports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's great. And so I appreciate it, Richard, and Jim Bob, too, for your insight as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, on the double-edged sword of copper prices that Richard was talking about, I think it's important to bring up at this point the extensive list of projects that are either being delayed or cancelled in all of the mining business. And, of course, this is because the commodity prices have gone up so rapidly. But unfortunately, as these mines are developed, the cost of developing,  whether you're talking about mining equipment, trucks, all the metal that's used, the greenfield projects have seen, all of you are aware that some of these costs have gone up double and triple. And people are just walking away from the projects, delaying them, mothballing them, doing whatever you call; extensive list, 30 to 40 of these. What does that mean? That means that those projects have been put into people's long-term projections of supply/demand for copper.</p>
          <p>Those projects are not going to happen. And that's exactly why our greenfield projects are being looked at harder than the brownfield. And the Brownfield, as Richard said, we already have the existing infrastructure, so we have a whole way to look at that cost and have an idea of what it's going to cost to make the expansions. But going into the greenfield area, new country, new infrastructure or maybe lack of infrastructure. So those projects that aren't going to get finished, the people we're counting on for supply/demand are going to have a huge impact on the price of copper. So that's why we &#x2013; on our long-term view look at copper as being very positive because the lack of new projects coming on will drive the price of copper higher, which benefits our very active program over the last six years since the &#x2013; six, seven years since the acquisition of Phelps Dodge.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have two questions. Just on Grasberg, you talk about getting back to full rates at the DOZ later in the year. Should we think of a operating rate there of sort of 200,000 tons per day versus 165,000? Is that kind of a ballpark way to think about it? Or are we going to get all the way back at the open pit to, call it 150,000 tons and then get sort of 70,000 tons out of the underground over the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I'm going to let Mark Johnson, who is our Chief Operating Officer for Grasberg, talk to you about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, I think you're referring to total mill rates. And...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we'll be doing is what's been discussed is that DOZ'll get back up to 80,000 tons a day by the fourth quarter. We're going through, as Richard described, a process of repairing some panels that were damaged. Those repairs'll be done by end of the third quarter, and DOZ'll be back at that 80,000 tons a day. The total mill rate is variable. It's very much driven by the material types that we get out of the Grasberg. Some of the material that would be mining in 2013 is a bit harder. Total mill throughput drops as a result of that.</p>
          <p>But the mill is running at full production. We're not cutting back on mill rates. We're essentially milling every ton we can, and we'll average about 210,000 tons a day in 2013. Towards the end of the year, we'll be into the very high-grade stock work of the Grasberg. That material is typically very good milling material, also; we'll get higher throughput, higher recoveries, good con grade. So this year, things'll just continue to get better from the first quarter all the way through the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thank you. That's very, very helpful. The other question I just wanted to check. Just for your guidance for costs on Tenke for the year, I mean I see they're coming down but the copper production's going up. Are those costs before the OMG deal; i.e., crediting at the 60% of the copper cobalt price? Or is it post the OMG deal where I assume you'll ultimately credit the full cobalt price that you realize?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The guidance that we've given, Brian, does not include the benefits of the higher cobalt price that we'll receive. The partnership that is acquiring the assets is &#x2013; are the same partners that are in Tenke Fungurume, but Tenke Fungurume is not acquiring. Tenke Fungurume will continue to sell cobalt hydroxide at market. And then this joint venture will actually own the refinery. But in terms of the numbers that you've seen, that does &#x2013; that includes continuing to sell cobalt the same way we have been in the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So will you have a new like &#x2013; like a new subsection of financials with showing that whole thing, like you do for downstream copper? Is that the way it's going to come out, or is it going to be all embedded in the Tenke sub-financials, if I look at it that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll probably be separate in terms of &#x2013; because of the &#x2013; actually, the Tenke operation doesn't own the refinery. But we'll make it so that you understand it and understand the values that we're getting from the refinery.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second, your labor contract at both &#x2013; actually both Grasberg and Tenke expired this year. Have you had any conversations yet with the labor unions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have ongoing conversations with the unions, you know, and it's different situations in kind of all the places that we operate. In Africa, we've had very positive relationships and have not had any controversy over union situations. We had the very difficult situation, which was really our first time to encounter this in 2011 with the labor union in PTFI. We've made progress in working with the workforce with the union workers, the non-union workers and our staff, which was major problems for us at the beginning of the year and affected our operations and worker productivity. We still have issues to deal with and we are working to achieve that.</p>
          <p>In our discussions with the union to date, both sides have expressed a view of working to avoid a strike. But that is something that we'll have to deal with. In Indonesia, by law, contracts only last for two years. And so that's something that we'll have to deal with. The labor issues are &#x2013; have become a issue throughout Indonesia today. And the government is concerned about it, and we're working our way through that. But that's something that we're just going to have to report to you as we go along.</p>
          <p>And I'm glad you asked the question because, as Mark was responding to Brian, I think it's important to keep in mind that these opportunities are what the ore body gives us. And we're going to have to work to achieve a relationship with our unions to be able to take advantage of them in the way that the ore body provides us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Richard. So focusing on Grasberg once &#x2013; one more time, interested in the capital expenditures that you have over the next five years and beyond. On a 100% basis, you are spending $5.5 billion, about half of that for the next five years. When do you expect the balance, Richard? Is that part of the underground development towards 2020, or does it all...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, it is. That's the nature of underground development is that you have a continuing expenditure of capital as you advance the block caving operation. So, unlike a big open pit and mill facilities, you have a one-time front-end slug of capital. And then you just have maintenance capital as you go forward. With underground development, there's ongoing expenditures to advance the block cave. And that's going to be part of our capital as we go forward. And I think &#x2013; Kathleen, do you have a comment on it? She's looking at...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I &#x2013; no, I think that's right. And we've given what we expect to average. Some years will be higher than the average; some years lower than the average. But as Richard said, it's a long-term development plan. So was not any one year where you've got all the expenditures. It occurs over the course of the long-term development of the asset.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; I'm sorry, that sustaining capital of about $500 million will be ongoing. That's what I'm trying to get at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, that's right. And whether you call it sustaining capital or investing capital, that's just the nature of underground investment. Now this is a &#x2013; Jim Bob referred to this earlier &#x2013; this is a big number for Indonesia, and particularly for Papua. I mean you're talking maybe $15 billion investment in a country that's looking to get investments. We have a workforce of 23,000 people there. And including employees and contractors, we're more than 90% of the economy of the Mimika region where we're located. Between a half and two-thirds of the economy of Papua, which is really important to the Government of Indonesia. We support businesses and infrastructure, development and so forth. So as we &#x2013; as you think about this labor issues and these contract issues, that's the context of where we're operating. This is a &#x2013; it's important for our shareholders; it's important for Indonesia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; no, absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me add a couple of things. There's a standoff here when you go underground. You have to continue to spend these big dollars to advance the underground. What you have to remember is, remember the photos that we've worked with before showing the cross sections? Same thing, what's in the reference slides. When you're in the open pit, you're mining ore, but you're mining waste. For instance, this year, we're up at the very top of the pit, wherever it's extreme, final platform of the open pit. When you go in the underground, because of the block caving method, you don't deal with the waste.</p>
          <p>You just &#x2013; your ore, basically because it's been altered by diagenesis when the ore body was put in place. The reason why block caving works is, the metamorphic rock that surrounds it is a host rock. When you're block caving, it doesn't cave on top of you.</p>
          <p>So you go from a huge open pit operation where you're exposed TO the elements, fog, 150 trucks operating 24 hours a day. When you get underground, all you're mining is the ore itself because that's the way block caving works. So I think it's important for people to understand, that's why your operating costs don't go up. When you go underground, some people have the feeling, well &#x2013; is it going to be more expensive to go underground? What you don't spend on waste &#x2013; and remember, when you haul this waste, you have to separate the waste. And you have to keep peeling it back because you can't get the angle of the pit too high, or you have pit walls that fail on you. So all that waste that we've been dealing with since we started the open pit disappears because you're underground and you're really block caving over. I hope that's understandable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, thank you, Jim Bob. And that leads in &#x2013; nicely into the second part of my question. So you are expecting costs at Grasberg to decline to about $1.15 a pound. I was wondering if you can put into context what you expect for 2014/2015 and as you depleted the open pit, because...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Without any stripping in the higher gold production, those costs must become really &#x2013; become very low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then, more importantly, how do you expect...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oscar, let me just make sure I say something. That $1.15 was consolidated, not for Grasberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The $1.15, going from $1.48, $1.35 to, I say, $1.15, $1.20 is consolidated. In that context, Grasberg goes back to being, as I said, a situation of where for &#x2013; let's say, beginning in the fourth quarter of next year and through the life of the open pit where the gold revenues will totally fund and perhaps more than fund the operating costs. So Grasberg costs will go to zero or below, which is what we've had in some years in the past.</p>
          <p>But for years, we've been talking about this situation as we get to the end of the open pit where you're stripping drops off dramatically. You're down in the lower elevations of the pit where the higher grades are. We'll be retiring equipment and reducing workforce, and cost will go down and volumes will go up. And that's a good direction to go in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; no, absolutely...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:08:25) it's important to use these reference slides. If you look at the reference slides, it shows where we're going to be getting the ore from in the year 2013. You'll see we started up at the very top of the pit at the extreme limits of the push backs. By the time you get to the bottom of the pit, you're in what we call the ring of gold. And that's a good indication because that's basically what you're going to be mining when you get underground.</p>
          <p>So if you can take what you have at the end of 2013 and imagine that you're going to stay in that ring of gold at the bottom of the pit, which is really what you're going to be block caving once you get underneath it &#x2013; that's why Richard says, it's just a precursor of what's going to come in terms of the gold &#x2013; the gold grades and the copper grades. And that's what makes the Grasberg the king of the mines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; no, absolutely. I'm sorry, Richard, I misspoke. But just interested in hearing you, what the cost in Grasberg you expect once the mine goes completely underground. So you had 2013 $0.68 a pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Oscar, in the &#x2013; as we approach the end of the life of the pit, we'll be in a net credit position in terms of &#x2013; as they said, the gold revenues will more than offset the total cost of production. As we get into the underground era and get ramped up, we expect that the unit net cash cost, net of credit at current gold prices to be below $0.30 a pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Thank you very much. That was very help...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's based on today's input cost levels and everything else. So below $0.30 a pound, driven by what happens to input cost, and those are, large part, correlated to copper prices and gold prices. So it's still world class in every respect.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. My question was just following up on the update that you have for your resource estimates, what you refer to as your mineralized material. I did notice that you've recently upped the cutoff grade for copper prices to be $2.20 per pound. Historically, you used to quote about a $2 per pound cutoff. We've not seen an incremental increase in the resource there. And I was just wondering if you could comment as to &#x2013; is that because you're now expecting slightly higher operating costs for those potential mineralized resources? And at what point do you think we're going to start seeing additive or conversion of those mineralized materials to actually proven and probable, as this has been a theme you've been talking about for few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jorge, on the first part of the question, we used the same pricing this year that we used last year. On our reserves, it was $2, and on the mineralized material, $2.20. So that's consistent with what you have seen in the prior year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And years, too. I mean it's been more than just past year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, Jorge, that slide that we showed where the near-term reserve additions potentially can come from with a big element from El Abra and others, that's doing exactly what you're talking about. That's looking at those resources and doing the work that it takes to get it to reserves. And essentially, what that requires is feasibility studies. We have to be able to demonstrate that we can come up &#x2013; we know the resources are there; they've been identified through our drilling &#x2013; core drilling. And now the process of converting them to reserves require that you look at mine plans, access to power and water, which is critical. In Northern Chile, of course, this size of processing facilities, the costs, how you deal with metallurgy and processing and all those factors. And those are major things that require time to work on. So that's where...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard, let me add to that. This is Jim Bob. The most important thing in the mineralized area is that we have a scarcity of data. Mineralized versus resources means what kind of spacing do you have on your drilling? In some of these mineralized areas, it's just a matter of going out and including our &#x2013; increasing our spacing. In other words, where you go in, and we may have drilled holes that are a mile apart. And we just have to project what those &#x2013; what's in between those as we go in and start to close in the grid. That's how you turn mineralized into resource and then into proved reserves.</p>
          <p>And it's a vast area. As you might imagine, with the amount of money we've spent the last seven years to add this 46 billion that Richard already &#x2013; and &#x2013; a lot of that stuff was considered mineralized because we just didn't have the spacing. So that's the definition. What you need to fill in there is how much drilling do you have to get enough data to really be able to call it mineralized versus resource?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And sorry, I did misread the difference. Your mineralized material is at $2.20 cutoff and your PNP is at $2. And just a follow-up question, Richard, maybe on the comments that you made on &#x2013; earlier in the call about your target for net debt under the combined PXP/MMR deal. You said now that you might be targeting to get net debt down to about $12 billion? And at that point would be in a position to either spend on growth, buy back stock and/or raise dividends. Could you just flesh that out a little bit more, why the slightly higher level? Is that in response, perhaps, to shareholder pressure to return cash to shareholders sooner? Or what's driving the thought process there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You're right. It is net debt. And with a continuation of current commodity prices, we should reach that target level in a relatively near term, roughly two and-a-half, three years or so. So we should be down to that in a relatively short period of time, assuming continuation of current commodity levels, price levels. And what that allows to do is kind of all three of what you talked about; continue to invest, have excess cash to shareholders. Kind of be in the situation we've been in recent years. We got down to zero debt...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net debt...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net debt at FCX, not because that was necessarily a financial strategy to get there. It happened &#x2013; in fact, when we finished the Phelps Dodge deal, Jorge, you may recall that we were talking about having long-term debt of roughly $7 billion at FCX going forward. But after 2008/2009, we had gotten to be very conservative because of the risk there about managing cash. And when the markets came back quicker and stronger than people anticipated, copper prices started rising by the second quarter of 2009. We used that cash then to reduce debt.</p>
          <p>And so it was more of a circumstance of those times as opposed to the financial strategy. We, like many of our shareholders have expressed to us, believe that we should maintain an appropriate amount of leverage to leverage our balance sheet for our equity returns. $12 billion would be less than one times EBITDA, and so that's kind of what we're thinking about doing right now. And as I said, getting down to zero net debt was more of a circumstance of the situation as opposed to a financial objective that we were pursuing.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And one other thing, Jorge. I want to go back to this issue of this $2 and $2.20. I want to make sure everybody understands, that is not our projection of prices. That's not our view of any kind of long-term price of copper. It's what we have to do just to comply with SEC reserve determinations. And we view this, it's not something that's easily changeable because you have to &#x2013; if you change the price, you have to develop new mine plans and so forth.</p>
          <p>We actually, as a company, don't have a long-term price projection. We consider a scenario of different prices. When we look at investment opportunities, as I said before, we want to manage downside risk, get exposure to what we believe is going to be a very positive future for commodities. And that way, we can make money and protect our downside risk.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I wanted to congratulate you on the good operations at Grasberg, the permit in Peru and completing the expansion smoothly at 10-K, while other companies have had tougher times in some of those countries. I'm trying to understand what will be normal in the new Freeport. And I'm trying to not think of it in terms of the old company because you're adding the oil and gas and not doubling but significantly increasing the mining.</p>
          <p>In the current year 2013, your sustaining capital was $1.8 billion. And you're saying that, that will fall to $1.4 billion next year and $1 billion in 2015. And in 2015, the total capital before oil and gas will be $3 billion. What's causing the bulge in sustaining capital this year? What will depreciation be when the capital programs are done in 2015?. And what will the &#x2013; is it possible 2016 will be a down year for CapEx?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, this is Kathleen. We've been spending on sustaining CapEx something on the order of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. And as we've shown, particularly during the 2008/2009 financial crisis, we have some flexibility with those projections. The bump in 2013 reflects the &#x2013; some of the timing issues that carried over from 2012 to 2013. We are investing in equipment to assure reliability. We're investing in trucks and shuttles as we're expanding our mining rates. And so we do have some projects that don't &#x2013; we don't have every single year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this issue about getting to the end of the mine life at Grasberg where we're going to be, as I said, cutting back on equipment and so forth. Our sustaining capital at Grasberg will be dropping dramatically as we go forward. So, let's see, Kathleen's looking at this depreciation number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're expecting depreciation for 2013 to be somewhat higher than 2012. We're roughly $1.5 billion in 2013 versus approximately $1.2 billion in 2012. And then as we get these projects on line, depreciation will get up to roughly $2.2 billion in the 2015 time period. And that's just the business that we have today. Of course, we'll have pro forma results, which we'll include in this. And we'll have the purchase price allocation associated with those assets. So we'll update our guidance on that as we go forward.</p>

          <p>Will the $3 billion mining CapEx &#x2013; total CapEx rate you're projecting for 2015 be something that we should think of as a normal level, given that the depreciation is up to $2.2 billion, and there'll always be some projects?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, I &#x2013; that's simply where we are now with our plans. We don't include CapEx in our outlook unless the projects have been approved. We're going to work hard, as we talked about earlier, to find new projects in our mining business to spend capital on because we think that is the way to create long-term value for our shareholders. So as a practical matter, it's going to take time to get these projects to the point of where we can get them authorized.</p>
          <p>We're going to be responsive to the market conditions as we go forward. But we hope to find ways to spend capital. But this thing that we talked about earlier, there's just constraints on how quickly we can spend it because we got to do these feasibility studies and other factors. But there's not really a normal aspect to this. We're going to be very return oriented to see where can we spend capital and get strong, long returns for the shareholders?</p>
          <p>And, John, there's not going to be a &#x2013; this is not a question of having an old Freeport and a new Freeport. This is going to be the long-term tradition of Freeport going forward in terms of the way we run this business and allocate capital and be disciplined about the way we do things. So this is not any kind of transformation transaction that's going to change the traditions that have been part of this company for a long period of time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. The first question, I think, to Kathleen. Tax rate for the quarter was a bit lower than I had expected at about 28%. Any guidance for 2013, please, for tax rates before the oil impact? And the follow-up question is on the oil, I guess to Richard or to Jim Bob. Feedback I've had from Freeport shareholders has been that the &#x2013; acquisitions are somewhat controversial. Given the relative size of the deals and that feedback &#x2013; and you may have had some <mark type="ph" /> real owners (1:24:37), any thoughts on opening up those mergers to Freeport shareholders to those? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Tony, hey. This is Kathleen. On the first part of your question re tax &#x2013; regarding taxes, the effective rate in the fourth quarter was 29% and for the year was 32%. There were some adjustments in the fourth quarter, as we looked at the overall average for the year. As we get improved income, relative to the size of the company, the improved contribution from Indonesia, which has the highest tax rate, we expect tax rates to &#x2013; effective rates to increase during 2013. We've got some disclosure on that in the back of the press release, but currently projecting 35% &#x2013; 34% to 35% for effective tax rate before the transactions in 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>For FCX? I'm sorry, Tony. I was looking at something else. You ask about the shareholder vote for FCX. There will be shareholder votes for McMoRan and for Plains. For FCX, there is no shareholder vote. The requirements for shareholder votes are set by the New York Stock Exchange, and we operate under Delaware law. And the number of shares to be issued in this transaction to Plains doesn't exceed those levels requiring a shareholder vote. And when shareholder votes aren't required, they're &#x2013; I'm told by the lawyers virtually never held because buyers would not be willing to accept a condition in terms of agreeing to sell a business, generally, not in just case, on the basis of having some sort of voluntary shareholder vote.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and thanks for taking my call &#x2013; my question. I guess my question is about your hedging policy. I mean, obviously, you guys don't hedge your copper. But the oil and gas assets that you're going to be buying do have some hedges. And so I was just curious if after the deal closes that you'll be continuing the hedging policy that's in place at Plains, or if you'll let those hedges roll off and sort of approach the oil and gas the same way you've approached copper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well just to comment about it, we &#x2013; Paul, as you noted, we have had a tradition of not hedging in our mining business. We manage our price risk by the way we structure our portfolio of assets and respond to different pricing market conditions. Many of our input cost in the mining business are highly correlated to the price of copper. So if price goes down, input costs go down and so forth.</p>
          <p>Hedging is more common among &#x2013; in the oil and gas business for independent producers. Plains had made a significant attract &#x2013; acquisition of assets from BP earlier, well in 2012, and had adopted a business strategy of de-levering the debt that it took on in connection with that acquisition. And the hedges that they put in place were supportive of that de-leveraging strategy. And that will carry over to our own de-leveraging strategy because their production volumes have a strong history of production. And now, by having prices assured at attractive levels, we'll be able to have a degree of assurance for our own policy of reaching these targeted debt levels that I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Where we'll go beyond that is something that we're going to talk about and consider as we go forward. And that will be part of our review of the strategy of how we invest in the oil and gas business. But that has not yet...</p>

          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Let me just add that the 21% of our costs, as you'll see from the charts, is energy related. So by having the oil and gas hedges that give us good price for oil and gas is a hedge on our energy costs that we have across the board in our mining business.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Sorry &#x2013; if this is repetitive, I'll apologize. But did you guys say &#x2013; would you guys entertain more energy acquisitions at the right price if you saw stuff you liked? And, B), I think you said this, but assuming the MMR ends up being very successful and you really prove out the ultra-deep, could you see separating the oil and gas assets again because they would have a much different cost of capital than the copper and gold company?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Wayne, this investment that we'll be making in the oil and gas business gives us a platform for looking for growth opportunities across a broader range of assets. And so we're going to be &#x2013; first of all, I want to say we're going to be disciplined about it, our business plan of de-levering and where we commit capital. But it will give us an opportunity to consider where to invest for the highest returns. There's not a plan to make acquisitions either in the oil and gas business or in the mining business.</p>
          <p>But we're going to be cognizant of opportunities across the set of assets that we'll have, and we'll make decisions based on our assessments of those opportunities and the discipline factor. And we're focused on achieving success in the investments in McMoRan, the investments in Plains, where there's significant growth opportunities that complement what we have in our mining business. And that's what we're focused on as opposed to any kind of long-term strategy about future restructurings of the company.</p>

          <p>Richard, this is Jim Bob. Why not let me just add to that. When you talk about what we're going to do, I've been Chairman of this company now for over 30 years and CEO for 20 years. For Richard, Richard's been a CEO for 10 years, so you got 30 years of management that you've seen. And nothing is going to change about the style of what we do. What we try to do is to be the best management team in the &#x2013; my &#x2013; for that matter, in corporate. And we think we've done a pretty good job of that. And now <mark type="ph" /> with Ed and the employees, (1:32:08) he's also got a well &#x2013; a well documented record.</p>
          <p>So what we're going to be doing is taking the huge cash flow and resources that you've seen in the pro forma and looking at, how do we invest that? We can look globally because with these acquisitions, we've now leap-frogged. We're bigger than American Barrick. We're bigger than Newmont. We're bigger than Anadarko. We're bigger than Apache.</p>
          <p>Occidental is the only company that's slightly larger in there. So we've got a resource here now, which is basically a major resource that can compete with the majors worldwide. But what that means is, we're going to take the same &#x2013; this board and the management of Richard, myself and now Jim Flores employees, we're going to be looking at best opportunity to grow our assets. And what we do with the capital will depend on what the prices of the commodities are. We're committed to having this financial policy that Richard's talked about. We're committed to return to shareholders. So nothing's changed about this company. As I say, you got 30 years of management that's going to be continuing to manage the company.</p>
          <p>This board has a solid record when it acquired Phelps Dodge. And we've shown our insight into that by taking &#x2013; and taking a company that was a 150-year-old company and tripling the reserves that they had at the time of the acquisition through our exploration expertise. So what everybody needs to remember is, the 30 years that you've had with my and Richard's management and now the addition of Jim Flores and our great Board of Directors, we'll make decisions that will give you same kind of returns that you've had in the past.</p>
