          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intesa Sanpaolo's 2009 Half Yearly Results Conference Call hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera. My name is Phil and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration of this call, you will be on listen-only. However, at the end of the call, there will be the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I am now handing you over to Mr. Corrado Passera to begin today's conference call.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Phil, and congratulations for the way you pronounced my name. Thank you very much to all of you for being with us this afternoon to discuss all together our second quarter results. Let me just say one word before we start and the word is this, the message is the following. Also in this second quarter, the same way it has been in the last several quarters, the key word for us has been sustainable profitability.</p>
          <p>What do I mean by that? I think that always, in any kind of situation, but certainly in a situation like the one we have been living in the last two years, the sustainable profitability means to keep all the management levers in line. Operating performance first and in the case of this quarter, operating performance has been a bit better than expected both in terms of revenues and cost. But cost of credit has to remain in line. Level of risk and the cost of credit in this case has been in line with expectations despite very prudent classifications, but we will discuss it later.</p>
          <p>Liquidity has been better than expected, very strong. Leverage very much in line with our policies that is to keep leverage very, very low. And then capital solidity that has proved to be a bit stronger than expected. So this concept, this model of banking that brings in our opinion in the medium-term to sustainable profitability has had a number of evidences in the second quarter. Let's move to the presentation and let's try to go through it as rapidly as possible, because I know that today you have a number of other presentations.</p>
          <p>Page number three. The first three comments has to be -- has to do with the third quarter results. Revenues that are up across all items, we will see that the 14.4% of growth comes from growth in interest income, in commissions, in trading and insurance business. So throughout all the different items.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, up 31% and that's the combination of the growth in revenues and the good cost control. We'll discuss them later. Net income at 513, if we adjust this figure for the main non-recurring items, it's 653. That means an increase of a bit more than 1%. If we add the second quarter to the first quarter, we get to a net income of 1.6 billion, 1.3 adjusted. And these figures do not include capital gains that we have already finalized; Findomestic is the main one that brings the 1.6 obviously to 1.9 already realized.</p>
          <p>These results in terms of operating performance, as a result of what I was mentioning before, of a management approach that takes all the other levers very much into consideration to sustainable profitability, let me use this word.</p>
          <p>And that is explained, but I will not lose any more time on it on page number four because sustainable profitability is a very practical thing, it's not a philosophical thing. It is first of all operating margin that comes from operating income and structural cost management and then the other four components, the risk profile, the liquidity, the solidity and the leverage.</p>
          <p>Page number five, let us just look at the two bar charts. We will discuss all the details in the following pages. If we look on the left side, we have operating income that after some problems, let's say, at the end of last year, are now growing quarter-after-quarter. Same thing for operating margin and the growth is even stronger.</p>
          <p>Page six is the second phase of operating profitability that is cost management. In the last few years, we had to react to lower revenues with higher cost reductions and this approach is continuing, will continue. And as you'll see on the right hand side of the page, we are now very close to completing the cost synergies provided for in the business plan. We have already added 225 million and obviously we will keep working on the efficiency of our bank in the next years too.</p>
          <p>Page number seven, liquidity. Liquidity has been key and will remain key and in any case we want to keep a very strong management focus on it. On the left hand side top part of the page, we see the usual balance between direct customer deposits and loan to customers. This is our -- one of our main strengths. But we have created a number of others, the amount of eligible assets with central banks. Should we need them, we have well in excess of a 60 billion worth of these kind of assets.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we have practically completed the medium and long-term funding issues. Our network has proved to be as always very capable and very effective in raising long-term funds and the figures prove that we have already completed, almost completed, what we needed for the whole 2009. And the interbank position is positive around &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
          <p>Page eight, Group solidity. First column, the capital ratios at the end of June. On the basis of the foundation, we are very close to seven, 6.9, 7.7 the Tier 1 and 11% the total capital ratio. This figure do not take into account the effect of the planned &#x2013; of our intention, of our commitment to start paying dividends on to this year result, but at the same time do not take into account the benefits coming from the disposal in the acquisitions that have already been finalized or underway. These are 14 basis points. And this is the first column, the situation at the end of June.</p>
          <p>Then we have the other options we have to increase our capital ratios. We have the Tremonti Bonds on the one side; we have the capital management actions, the disposals or the other kind of capital management actions we discussed in several other occasions. Between these two options, we have the possibility and we will have the possibility to bring &#x2013; to increase our capital ratios between one and 1.5% in the next month.</p>
          <p>Page nine, leverage. We have always kept our leverage very low. When we want to get the exact amount of our leverage, we use the tangible net equity on tangible total assets ratio. If we use this ratio, we see that the position of Intesa Sanpaolo is at the very top of the ranking in Europe, and we will stick to this rule.</p>
          <p>Page 10, risk profile. Risk profile is the one you know very well. We are a commercial bank, proud of being a commercial bank. A portfolio of activity that obviously is more than 50%, almost 60% concentrated in our retail banking in Italy, and where the added divisions and business units of the Group play an important role, but in a very balanced kind of portfolio. In Italy that is and will remain our main market. Our positions in terms of market shares remain very strong.</p>
          <p>Page 11, risk profile in terms of cost of credit. Cost of credit in the first half is in line with the figures we discussed also on the &#x2013; when we discussed the first quarter results. On the normalized basis, at the end of June, we have 94 basis points. We have been very prudent in the classifications in the second quarter. All our coverage ratios, we'll discuss them in the following pages, are very safe. And first of all, the doubtful loan coverage, including collateral and guarantees, is stable at 125%.</p>
          <p>If we take our margins, because at the end we have to look at operating margin after net adjustment to loans, we see that the trend we had in revenues and in the operating margin is reconfirmed and in the last three quarters you'll see in the bar charts, the kind of trend that we enjoyed, again after taking into account the cost of credit that is and we expect will remain within the limits we announced with the first quarter results.</p>
          <p>Last point on our risk profile is our presence in Central and Eastern Europe, Page 12 and Page 13. We provide the usual mass of figures to put you in the position to evaluate our figures in that part of the world. Today, we can say that the 7% weight that this region of the world has in our loan portfolio is a good evidence of the low level of risk in our portfolio. I'm sure that this is and will remain a plus, a strength of the Group in the next years, but we will discuss it later.</p>
          <p>Page 15, I will not go through all these items. The only point I had not discussed in the first page is the cost income ratio that in the second quarter fell below 50%, more than six percentage points less than in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 16, the summary of our balance sheet. Loan to customers up 4.2%. The customer financial assets, the one trillion we often mention, is there. In the second quarter, the total customer financial assets have increased by 2.4%. That means almost &#x20AC;24 billion. The assets under management and the asset under administration are down partially because some of them have moved to deposits and partially because of the obvious performance effect.</p>
          <p>Page 17, it's probably the summary of the summary of this presentation, is the P&amp;L of our bank in the second quarter 2009. We see that the revenue lines are all up, 14.4% operating income, but if we look at it, net interest income is 3.4, in terms of net fees eventually is plus 6.8. Profit on trading is very satisfactory to a level that we expected during the year, probably not that early, but that's the situation. And also the insurance business back to a reasonable and satisfactory contribution.</p>
          <p>Cost more or less in line with the previous quarter. In the other administrative expenses, we have to take into account the intergroup VAT that has been introduced and that we are trying to at least partially compensate. And we have a number, a certain amount of development cost that we accelerated, advertising for example, to support the business.</p>
          <p>Operating margin is up 31% and then the provisions, we will discuss them in the following pages. But as you see, the figures are more than in line with the guidance we gave on the previous occasions we discussed our figures.</p>
          <p>Income before tax plus 17.4%, obviously in the second quarter we don't have any more the effect of the intangible detaxation we enjoyed in the first quarter. If we adjust the bottom line figures, we have some increase also in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 18, only the figures you might need to make the adjustment and make the two quarters' net incomes comparable.</p>
          <p>Page 19, the first semester results. On this page we can &#x2013; we have the evidence of the effort we are making in terms of continuous cost reduction and efficiency building, almost 4% less than last year. I think it's a good performance.</p>
          <p>Page 20, now we have the analysis line-by-line. On the quarterly side of the page, we have the increase in our interest income and there is room for growth. There is room for growth for a number of reasons, both in terms of volumes and in terms of spread management. And on the right side, we have the yearly comparisons. You have the volumes on the bottom side of the pages.</p>
          <p>I consider these figures very satisfactory and the evidence of the effort we are making with our customers. Given the trend in turnovers and investments with SMEs, this trend is in our opinion, at least according to our plans, certainly satisfactory. The growth you see are with large corporate, comes mainly from volume growth at the end of 2008 on big projects with international companies and &#x2013; but the main effect has been a spread increase effect in the last six months.</p>
          <p>Page 21, you will find all the data that are necessary to make the analysis on the net interest income possible. You'll see that the hedging facilities we established in the last years are performing very well and they are contributing to the quite satisfactory trend in net interest income.</p>
          <p>Page 22, net fee and commission. We had a trend until last quarter in just one direction and this second quarter is the change we expected. The trend until last quarter and also this quarter has to be evaluated also in the light of the decision we have taken in the first part of the year to distribute and to place only Intesa Sanpaolo bonds through our branch networks. That was our priority and that certainly has created some reduction in the potential for fee creation in the network.</p>
          <p>A good piece of news is that commissions from management, dealing, and consultancy activities has increased for the first time after several quarters. And that is a good sign of what is maybe happening on the market.</p>
          <p>Page 23, the flow in customer financial assets, we always analyze together. What is good about this figures are first, the net total that is positive and the second that for the first time after a number of quarters, the amount of assets under management is a positive figure.</p>
          <p>Let me just draw your attention on the last line, the last notes on the page, the last note on the page. We have almost, we have more than &#x20AC;350 billion worth of asset under administration that can &#x2013; will be turned into assets under management if we are good enough to do it. And even if we reach only a low percentage of these amounts into assets under management, this is &#x2013; this will be one of the main sources of fee increase in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 24, trading profits. The trend in the last three quarters is very clear, it's what we announced and expected at least in terms of direction. The results our people have achieved in the second quarter of this year have not been achieved through an increase of the risk embedded in this activity. In fact the VAR embedded in these results is down 13% in the second quarter vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Most of these results, most of this contribution to the overall results of the Group come from customer activities, as you can see on page 25. The four components of the trading profits are the customer, the directly customer-driven activities that are up to 157 million. Capital markets that to a large extent is also customer-driven is 167. Proprietary trading and treasury is more than 100 million and for the first time after a number of quarters, the structured credit product portfolio is not contributing with a loss, but is contributing with a positive figure to the overall results.</p>
          <p>Page 26, the very summary of the structured credit product portfolio. As you know, we always publish all the details of this portfolio; you will find the appendix all the possible elements for evaluating these set of assets. We are not anymore worried about this portfolio for the reasons that you'll find on this page and in the appendices.</p>
          <p>Page 27, the insurance business contribution to the overall results, good quarter for sure. A strong increase, strong recovery vis-&#xE0;-vis the first quarter. And in this area, as you know, we have a project that will be a value creation project. The fact that we have been able to take the full control of all the insurance &#x2013; the life insurance companies of the Group puts us in the position today to consolidate these four companies and create one single insurance company for servicing all our customers. Then we will have a second insurance company for supporting the financial advisor activity. But we count on the fact that both in terms of revenue synergies and cost synergies, the impact of such a project will be significant.</p>
          <p>Page 28, cost and the structural cost reduction we are implementing quarter-after-quarter. I have already explained the reason why administrative expenses are slightly up in the second quarter, but overall we are talking about a significant decrease despite the cost that could not be planned.</p>
          <p>Page 29, cost of credit. We are, as I said before, well below the 100 basis points we set as a sort of limit for this year. The doubtful loan specific coverage is stable; it's an important item on our balance sheet and it has been increased actually during the last 12 months by 80 million. I said it before, but I want to stress this point, we have been I think very prudent in the second quarter in terms of classifications of loans into substandard loan category, but I think it's wise to behave like that in a period like the present one.</p>
          <p>Page 30, the notes on the right side of the page, as I said, we get to 125% coverage if we &#x2013; of the doubtful loans if we add to the specific coverage all the other collaterals. We have &#x2013; the amount of doubtful loans that have been added to the portfolio in the second quarter is in line with the increase of last year and that is an evidence of something. You know that we have inserted in the restructured loan category a single very large loan on which we do not expect to have any loss and so we do not think it requires any kind of provisioning, but according to the rules it's a restructured loan. And in terms of substandard, we will give you the figures in the next pages. The new flow of substandards, as you will see, is a portfolio of very strongly and guaranteed kind of position.</p>
          <p>Page 31, the analysis of the same figures division by division. We will come back to this page if you are interested. Same thing for page 32, where we have the flow of new substandard and new doubtful loans analyzed at the Group level and in the two main divisions of the Group in terms of size. One comment I can add is the second one on the bottom of the page, we don't see the portfolio in general to get into trouble. So the main problems are concentrated in industries that are obviously suffering from the recession, but this malaise is not spreading throughout the portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 33 is the point I made before. Even if the gross provision on the new substandard loans are a bit lower than what we had in the same period of last quarter, we must say that the kind of collaterals and guarantees that come together with these positions is very much higher and we can say that these substandards are covered almost at 90%.</p>
          <p>Page 34, an analysis you might need in terms of industry portfolio of our loan portfolio and in terms of the usual figure on the mortgages, left hand side on the bottom. The quality ratios of this portfolio of ours that accounts for more than &#x20AC;55 billion remain very healthy and strong.</p>
          <p>Page 36, is the same page we show at the beginning of the presentation on capital ratios. Page 36 is the breakdown of all the Group figures into the different business units of Group. You see that all of them contribute with positive figures to the positive EVA of the Group. The only one that has a negative contribution is obviously the corporate center, where most of the figure comes from items that cannot be subdivided into the different divisions. Goodwill amortization is an example, integration cost, excess capital, these Group items account for more than 450 million and have to be kept at the Group level.</p>
          <p>Very rapidly through the divisional figure, page 37, Banca dei Territori, our retail network division, revenues up almost 7%, cost very much down and operating margin obviously up more than 20% and all the rest as a consequence of it. This division is working very rapidly and is a little bit ahead of schedule in terms of implementing the new organizational model we have introduced at the beginning of the year. It's an evolution we discussed last time, but I'm ready to discuss with you later. That is a further step in the building of the largest in the branch network on a single market that probably exist in the world, that is our network.</p>
          <p>We are putting a lot of emphasis on credit control obviously. We are working very much on all the actions that can move asset under administration to asset under management and as I said before, the bank insurance products in the next month will contribute to the growth of this division.</p>
          <p>Eurizon Capital is mostly working for the Banca dei Territori division and as you see, is suffering on the one side, but is reacting very effectively in terms of efficiency.</p>
          <p>Corporate Investment Banking has enjoyed a very strong quarter, 31% growth in terms of income and almost 44% in terms of operating margin. A very good performance in any respect. I'm very happy about this division the same way I'm very happy about what the Banca dei Territori is doing. As you know Banca dei Territori is suffering very much from the reduction in markdown but is reacting very effectively. For sure, the Corporate Investment Banking has had a very flamboyant, as they say in France, quarter in the last month.</p>
          <p>Public Finance also, page number four (sic) [forty] , performing very well both in terms of growth and in terms of cost reduction. The net adjustment to loans as just one position is reducing the amount of result, but only last -- I mean, given the growth that this division has enjoyed in the last quarters, it can go through this exercise without changing the sign of the bottom line.</p>
          <p>International Subsidiary Bank up, the revenues and the costs are obviously being put under control, a number of development projects that were in the budget and in the plans have been postponed and this combination of revenue growth and cost control allowed this division to have a two-digit growth in terms of operating margin and a net income very well in line with our expectations. Banca Fideuram in line with the budget, certainly were &#x2013; suffered from the market situation, but very good reaction in a number of ways.</p>
          <p>Conclusions, I mean, more or less what we said at the beginning, the growth in the operating performance is showing we called it strategic momentum, that means that the growth we are enjoying is really based on sustainable elements. And the liquidity, the solidity, the low &#x2013; the risk profile of our Group are very much in line with what we wanted to be with the kind of bank we want to be and with the mode we want to respect to manage our Group through the crisis.</p>
          <p>So I tried to go as rapidly as possible through the presentation and I'm now available for any questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question comes through from the line of Alessandro Roccati of FPK. Your question please.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Alessandro Roccati from Fox-Pitt Kelton. A couple of questions from me. The first one is on the doubtful loans, we've seen an increase from eight billions in the first quarter to 10.8 billions. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are that these doubtful loans will not move into non-performing loans in the next quarters? The second question is on the risk-weighted assets, we've seen a 14 billions decrease quarter-on-quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any breakdown? And finally, the last question is on your insurance new projects. Just wondering whether you can give us any indications as to the run rate in terms of contribution. Am I right in saying that roughly we can get 200 millions on a quarterly basis from the new combined entity? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the questions are more or less three, if I understood correctly. In terms of doubtful loan, how comfortable we are that we are not creating from substandard, you're saying how much do we expect them to become doubtful loans? That we will see in the next month. What is really important about the new flow of substandard loans is the amount of guarantees that they bring with them. It's a case where even if these loans become doubtful, and I doubt that the majority of them will become doubtful loans in the next month, they have such a level of guarantees and collaterals attached to them that we really do not expect to change in any respect the expectations we have in terms of cost of credit.</p>
          <p>The risk-weighted asset decrease is rather obvious, given that the... I got the figure from my colleagues. You said, that there is a reduction in 14 billion, of 14 billion in terms of risk-weighted asset. The actual reduction is 8.9 billion, and this comes to a large extent to the volumes of the loan portfolio and to the quality of such a portfolio.</p>
          <p>In terms of the contribution of the new life bank insurance company, it's really too early to say; we expect the contribution to be very significant, but we prefer to complete the business plan of this company before making any announcement, and before giving any guidance on the contribution of this new company.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everybody. One of the key element of surprise of this quarter is probably the trading line, which is more or less three times what I had, something like that. So could you share with us your projection for the full year? I know it's difficult because there is a sort of volatility in this, but any case 48% of the first half trading profits are due to customer related activities so maybe you can add something to this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You practically gave the answer to your question yourself. It's a very volatile world, but the fact that more than 50% comes from customer, very customer-related activities make us quite comfortable on the fact that the flow of this income will continue in the next two quarters. The level is really very impossible to estimate or at least to give guidance about, but all the customer-related activities are continuing the same way and we do not expect any further loss on the structured credit product portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good evening. Also a few questions from my side. Just trying to understand a little bit more the trends on the spreads, can you give us a little bit more visibility on how the spreads are progressing both on retail and on the corporate side and if there is any of these areas where you see some improvement, although clearly you do get the benefit of the hedges. And on your hedging strategies, if you can update a little bit of how much they're still running for, how many more quarters we can see this improvement?</p>
          <p>And also on a broader issue, have you changed anything structurally in your balance sheet with regard to interest rate exposure beside the hedges, or will you actually be in a position when interest rates come up, admittedly maybe a long time, but will you be, do you think you'll be in a position to actually significantly benefit at that point to see a strong recovery in net interest income?</p>
          <p>On the, on your problem loans, you have given us a lot of details, thank you very much. One question, given the large increase on the corporate side, can you tell us a little bit more of, which are the companies that have had problems in terms of are there some specific sectors, are we looking at some large positions or a lot of smaller positions, or is this SME or larger corporates, just to understand a little bit better.</p>
          <p>And if it's possible, a little bit of strategic reflection on these government bonds. It's been a long time by now, there has been a long discussion nearly lasting a year. Is there much point at this stage to still issue these bonds given that your capital has started to improve, you have sold even more assets, clearly the world, if anything, has stabilized and these bonds are quite expensive? What kind of thinking are you having with respect to that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So the first question is about spreads. Spread and markup especially, management is easier with mid and large corporate with SMEs. There is still some work to do in order to make spreads consistent with the rating and always updated the ratings of the companies. But as you saw in the net interest income, the results in the different divisions, the spread management is easier with &#x2013; in the Corporate and Investment Banking division. We see some further room for improvement. Sustainability means also that you stay close to your companies when you know that even if the situation is different, but the companies are &#x2013; have the wings to fly, as we say in Italian.</p>
          <p>Hedging strategy. The facilities we have established in the last quarters and almost years are there to stay certainly for at least two more years. The effect of these hedging facilities obviously will change with changes in the market yields environment. But since we do not expect any real change in market yields in the next few quarters, we expect the hedging facilities to express the same contribution we had in the last quarter.</p>

In terms of industries, I tried to explain before that the industries that are mostly affected by the crisis are the usual ones, obviously very, very, a very limited effect on consumer-oriented industries and much more on investment-oriented industries. If you want, we can go more in detail on the analysis of the different industries, but whatever is investment-related, whatever is intermediate-related is suffering much more than what is mainly consumer-oriented.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon to everyone. I have three quick questions. First in Q3, Intesa increased deposits by about &#x20AC;5 billion and in direct deposits by about three through additional net flows for a total of &#x20AC;8 billion. How much of this is actually driven by market share gains by Intesa across most products? And is this a trend that you see continuing into the second part of the year? Second on residential mortgages, looking at the sector data, there is a pickup in volume growth, which has gone back to about five, 6% growth compared to last year from negative territory in Q1. Do you think this is just interest-rate driven and would you expect this to be a trend, which will also continue into the coming quarters? And finally, you highlighted in the presentation the positive impact from interest rate hedges in Q2. I guess they are still fully in place, but it would be helpful to get a confirmation. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think the first question the increase in deposits, we enjoyed a slight -- a small increase in market shares and most of that mainly comes from our present customers, mostly assets switched from assets under administration to direct deposits. Yes, I personally expect mortgages to pick up momentum and certainly thanks to the very low level of interest rate that make mortgages very competitive vis-&#xE0;-vis leasing contracts -- lease contracts, rent contracts. But the main reason is also because people are getting back to trust in the future. Obviously, the rational decision on interest rates is important, but even if something is interesting, is rationally profitable if you don't -- if you do not have any trust in the future, you simply block all your decisions. The increase in the growth of mortgages belongs to the phenomenon I just tried to explain.</p>
          <p>Hedges are fully in place and we'll keep delivering the effects we enjoyed in the second quarter also in the next quarters. Obviously, given the same market yields environment.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I still have three questions. The first one very quick on your new life bank insurance company. I thought you were still expecting the green light of the Bank of Italy, is there are any potential risk there or it's a pure formality? The second one is regarding the level of the cost of credit on Q2, are you giving any kind of guidance for the full-year or anything different from less than one basis point, I think it was your kind of guidance you gave before for the full year?</p>
          <p>And the last one is your only guidance I saw in your presentation is you say you are going to show a net profit very close to the one of 2008, after having published 1.6 billion for the first half, we can think we will have one billion for the second half of the year because looking at the dynamic of revenues and the cost of credit that would remain in the same region as it did in Q2, that being twice 500 million. Are you considering in this figure the 300 million capital gain that you have booked already for the coming months within this figure or not? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, we must have an authorization for the new insurance company not only by Bank of Italy, but also from the insurance authority that is called ISVAP. It is obviously is not a pure formality, we are confident that this project of ours will be authorized. We also need the authorization of the antitrust commission. So it will take the rest of the year for getting all these authorizations, and the only thing I can as of today that we are confident we will get the necessary authorizations. Cost of credit guidance. We gave a guidance on the occasion of the first quarter result presentation. We said that we expect the cost of credit for the whole year between 90 and 100 basis points, in any case below 100 basis points. And we do not have any reason as of today to change this guidance.</p>
          <p>The last question, if I understood it correctly, we confirmed our expectations of a net result not far from the 2008 results also in the light of the capital gains we have realized on the Findomestic sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'm sorry, I was not very clear, the point is you made 1.6 for the first half, we can consider that you will do at least 500 million in each coming quarter without capital gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean you can make that forecast, I'm not in the position to do it and we cannot confirm anything like that. We are certainly getting to a quite satisfactory pace, but we cannot confirm such figures. The only thing we are confident in confirming is that on the -- for the whole year the net results will not be far from the one of 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Per Lofgren from Morgan Stanley in London. I have one question left that relates to Basel 2. If you look at your model, your IRB model under the advanced method of Basel 2. How does the estimate, the loss value that this model suggests compare to your current level of provisioning? Are we above or below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I understood your question. And I will try to answer, if it is not the right answer, you explain me your question. Obviously, our provisions are perfectly in line with what we expect to be the losses on our portfolio. And these figures are lower than what the Basel 2 provide -- gives as an estimate. We have not applying the advanced model yet. We are still at the foundation level. And what can I tell you, I mean, our estimates are perfectly in line with what we expect to be the losses that are below the maximum losses the model might give.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. Just to make sure I got that completely right. So that the model as it stands today, I'm perfectly aware that this is not implemented yet, but you have this model. So your current provisioning is below that model. What that model suggests?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, I'll try to get as close as possible to your question. Our provisions are much higher than the expected loss of the system would provide for. We are at &#x2013; we are at 94 and the model would say 53. So it's exactly the opposite of what I think you said a few seconds ago.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes through from the line of Arturo De Frias of Evolution. Your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, good afternoon. Arturo De Frias from Evolution. I have a few questions. One of them is regarding those disposals that you have mentioned at the beginning that could help you to improve the core tier 1. My question would be in terms of opportunity cost, what kind of earnings sacrifice are you expecting or inclined to make in order to get to this core tier 1 ratio? That would be one question.</p>
          <p>Second question is in terms of provisions. You mentioned at some point, I think you have mentioned that in the past that this year the loan loss ratio should not go beyond 100 basis points and you are still below that which is great. But what happens in coming years, what happens &#x2013; what's your view regarding a potential limit in terms of loan loss ratio given the substantial increase in non-performing loans, given the potential deterioration in Eastern Europe? So where we are going to be in 2010, or at least what kind of impression do you have for 2010 versus the 100 basis points being made for 2009?</p>
          <p>The third question is a more kind of medium-term profitability one. Obviously we seem to have gone past the worst and you have stabilized your P&amp;L, you show variations Q2 versus Q1. Obviously Q2 versus Q1 look very good because Q1 was weak as with everybody else. But when we look at returns, you are still generating lackluster returns, I would say, looking at the return on tangible NAV for example, we are talking here with a run rate of around 500 million, we are talking here about 8.5, 9% return on NAV, which is obviously better than posting losses as others have done. But this is a low number. Quite a lot of people seems to be assuming that this 500 million is going to be the run rate for the next few quarters. I mean, in fact, I was looking at the Bloomberg consensus, and I think the consensus for next year is around two billion, which are again is around 500 million per quarter. So that's another idea with returns which barely match the cost of equity. Are you happy with that, do you think it's low, do you think that your businesses are going to be able to generate better returns on those and when that is going to happen in your view? Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess Mr. Passera wants to answer the question previously asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I would prefer to answer any questions without accumulating them. So the three questions coming from our friend from Evolution. Disposals and the opportunity costs of these disposals. First of all, disposals are made on the basis of strategic reasons where we want to dispose assets where we believe that the value in the future would be much lower than the value today for us, or where we are not the best owners or in all those cases where without reducing our competitive position, we increase our earning per shares. So the answer to the first question is that we have identified a number of assets through the sale of which we improve our long-term sustainability of our results.</p>
          <p>Provisions, the guidance for the year remains the same. Hard to say what will happen in the future, but I would be surprised if the situation is different in the following years on the basis of what we can envisage today. So we expect this year to be the worst one for us.</p>
          <p>Profitability, as I said to your colleague, we are not giving any guidance in terms of run rate. We believe that our performance today is consistent with the market situation. We believe that we should manage in a consistent way the level of risk and the profitability. So we're not pushing short-term results just for the sake of it. If the question is, are you happy with these kinds of results in absolute terms, the answer is no. We have -- we come from a much better situation, we want to increase and our business plan will provide for an increase. But a retail bank to a large extent has to rely also on the market yields situation and, for sure, our results will improve very significantly when &#x2013; and if &#x2013; but I will say when market yields will go back to normality. Today, we're very much below what I can consider a normal situation. And today we are suffering from the very low level of markdowns. I expect the situation to change not in the next three quarters, but already in the second part of next year, I expect market yields to increase and that will immediately create a benefit in our P&amp;L.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the second part of 2010, you mean?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And where you think that improvement in profitability is going to come from? Is going to be &#x2013; your short-term rates will probably continue to be very low, the loan growth quarter-on-quarter is quite subdued and provisions as you say, probably are not going to deteriorate. But they are unlikely to improve substantially either. So what's going to be the main engine for you of profitability improvement, do you think when we are in second half 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We'll discuss that on the occasion of the business plan presentation, but for sure with the increase in market yields, the very low market markdown situation where we move back to the situation that we would consider a normal one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. I'm back to the discussion on the asset disposals. You reiterate this target for a number of quarters and now finally we have a good deal with Findomestic, long-awaited deal, but very good conditions, well above two times the book there. So given this transaction and the other small ones you mentioned, are you a little bit more confident on the timetable of the next disposals? So you believe that there is a better market at this stage to go on with the disposal and something can also happen in your view by the year-end or not?</p>
          <p>More on the core business, we have seen this pickup of commissions, which is very encouraging, because the second quarter was not still very much working with a positive confidence from retail clients. How you see them behaving, what are the areas where they are already moving and asking for more services and more products? Because the results have been impressive and I'm trying to understand, after the summer, which is typically pretty quiet for retail banking, what are your expectation for the fourth quarter rather than the third quarters in terms of commission?</p>
          <p>Then a little bit on the foreign business, I've seen there is a small loss both in Ukraine and in Russia in this quarter. Obviously there the situation remains pretty tough. What is the strategy of Intesa Sanpaolo regarding your international business, if you want to comment in general or if you have some area, some region where you have some idea in mind? So are you still committed in all the single regions you are present, or you are reconsidering that?</p>
          <p>And last two questions. One again on the Tremonti Bonds. I heard your answer that the decision will be taken by the end of September. It's not clear to me what you wrote about the bridge, considering Tremonti Bonds a bridge against the, waiting for the disposal, the asset disposal. Does that mean that in case you finalize an important transaction, let's say in September or October, you will not ask for the Tremonti Bonds, is that the way we should interpret this message you put in the press release?</p>
          <p>And last, really, last question regards Credit Agricole is a very confusing situation. The yesterday conference call, they were saying is all about antitrust and Intesa, is not about Credit Agricole. So if they will be signed means Intesa will be signed, then they can try to ask Agricole to be refunded, but legally speaking, Agricole is well covered. Can you please help us to understand where this story stand at this point and if you remain confident that Intesa will not be signed for a sort of pact that has nothing to do with your core business, effectively? Thank you.</p>

          <p>First question, disposal. For sure, we have the impression that there is a better market for disposals. As we always said, we will not push these disposals or capital management actions just for the sake of doing them, because we can clearly wait for the right timing; given our capital structure, there is really no urgency. And we will do, we will implement these decisions only when the conditions are the right ones. As I said, the situation is certainly improving and we always, we have been always very confident about the final &#x2013; the results. As far as the timing that we always said not this year. There is no reason for changing this forecast, but the market is better.</p>
          <p>Commissions; commissions have improved significantly for two main reasons: The trend, the very negative trend in asset under management-related commissions has changed. And if the trust in the markets is consolidated, it gets a bit consolidated, we expect those commissions to increase. Another element that will contribute to the trend we have enjoyed in the second quarter is the fact that in the second part of the year, we will be able to be devote efforts from, by the branch network to bank insurance products and the placement of other products, while in the first half of the year, the branch network has been totally engaged by the placement of Intesa Sanpaolo bonds for the medium-term funding policies I mentioned before. So we are confident in the trend on commissions.</p>
          <p>International business strategy, we are committed to the countries where we have subsidiary banks for different reasons, but each of them is important. We are investing in and we confirm all our projects in Central, Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean area. And as I said at the beginning of the presentation, even if today that region of the world is perceived as riskier than the Italian market, for example, the European market, we consider that division, that business unit of ours a strength of the Group.</p>
          <p>I'm not sure about the question, the Tremonti Bonds question. By definition, the Tremonti Bonds are a bridge to disposal, we always said it, because the disposal have always been presented as a way to repay the Tremonti Bonds when we said we were ready to issue those bonds. Obviously given that we are at 7% almost we cannot add Tremonti Bonds and the effect of the disposal. So we have to choose the right time for the disposals and in case such disposals are deferred in the future, the Tremonti Bonds are the best possible bridge to those disposals.</p>
          <p>Last point on Credit Agricole, I don't want to open a discussion, an indirect discussion, obviously, with our shareholders. What is good is that the antitrust commission has given Credit Agricole several months to find a solution because the decision has been postponed to the beginning of next year. The only thing I can tell you is that I'm sure that our shareholders will not create troubles or damages to our bank. But I can certainly tell you that we will not, in case, but I'm sure it will not happen, but in case, we will not pay the cost of behaviors that are not accepted by the antitrust by our shareholders. At the end, certainly our bank would not pay the cost of it, but that's rather obvious. What can we do on the decisions that, on which we do not have any control on? In any case a solution will be found and it will be a solution that will be good for everybody.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. If I can just double check your answer on the bridge of the Tremonti Bonds, that means for example you are going to cash in 0.5 billion for Findomestic that in theory could be deducted from the four billion, something like that? In case you will sell something for 3.5 billion, let's exaggerate for a second, 3.5 plus half a billion makes the four billion, so you will not need the Tremonti Bonds. Is that the right interpretation?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. I'll try to be very, very quick. Considering that you have 7% core Tier 1 right now, and considering that in a bull market period, couple of years ago you had a target core Tier 1 of 6.5 that then was revised down if I remember correctly to 6% and now you are basically telling us, that you need with the Tremonti Bond you would get to 8.5% or something or eight, 8.5% something like that. Considering that everyone is actually paying back this government support, I wonder, why do you need this amount of money, first? And secondly, could this number be revised significantly down? I think the market here really needs a little bit of clarification. Sorry for -- I know it's a bit harsh question, but I need -- I think we definitely need a little bit of clarification here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not an harsh question. Maybe, my answer would be a bit harsher. We are at 7% and we will decide our capital ratio policy on the basis of what regulators and the supervisors will decide. Let me tell you that the market and the analyst community is pushing in that direction, so don't ask me why we should consider higher capital ratios. As we said also in the presentation, we have our own opinions, but we will have to follow what the markets on the one side and the central banks on the other side will decide on the issue. We are confident that the combination of the present capital ratio situations and the reserves we have through the issue of Tremonti Bonds and/or the disposal on non-core asset will keep our bank amongst the strongest banks in terms of a combination of risk profile and capital ratios.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I'm not going to make another question on the Tremonti Bond. I just had a question on net interest income, which was the positive surprise for me in this set of results. Just if you can tell us, if you believe that the second quarter will be the low point for net interest income on a quarterly basis or if we can expect some other seasonal decline in the third one? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to -- to answer your question obviously. We believe that the second quarter is an healthy and structural result. One thing that might in the short-term have a negative impact is the effect of the new laws and regulations on overdraft commissions that will probably reduce -- will probably impact the net interest income in the next two quarters. It will not be quite such a big figure, but might be between 70 and &#x20AC;100 million coming from there. We want and we are sure we will compensate for that effect quite rapidly, but in the very short-term we might have an effect coming from the last rules and the last decrease that the government has taken.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening, Mr. Passera. Most of my questions have been asked. One question, I got on divisional results on the asset quality. I understand the increasing provision on Banca dei Territori and CIB, could you explain what has caused the increase from 4 bps in Q1 to 78 bps in Public Finances? It's just a one position, a few position? And on the foreign subsidiaries, provisions are almost stable, five bps only increase at 215 bps Q1 on Q2. But if I look at the flows on non-performing loans, although not as bad as in the CIB is going up. So why are you keeping stable provisions and see if non-performing loans are still coming through, or am I missing something maybe you got better visibility? I guess Hungary is developing in a much better way than people thought but your thoughts here would be welcome. And second question on asset quality. You gave the guidance on provision, lots of question in '010 and so on but staying short-term, if you could share with us how non-performing loans or doubtful inflows in July or August has been versus the Q2 &#x2013; worse, the same, better? Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try to answer your questions. The only one I would not answer is, the last week provisions that we generally don't give and we will have to wait for the third quarter results to update the provision in the third quarter. First, Public Finance. Public Finance is one position that very prudently we provisioned, but we are confident that our views will succeed at the end, but yes, it's one position.</p>
          <p>In Central Eastern Europe, the trend is very consistent with a very high level of provisions we already have, with a very high level of collaterals, guarantees we are enjoying. And with the fact that in a number of cases, the expectations on those countries are proving a bit more negative that actually they are.</p>
          <p>Let me just check one thing. And one point that my colleagues are making that is very important. The net flow of new substandard and new doubtful loans in Central Eastern Europe is very much in line and there is no increase in the flow. So there is no -- there is really no reason, no structural reasons for increasing the provisions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. If I could make a suggestion, I mean, just on the terminology, if you would call doubtful loans in the presentation non-performing loans and substandard, watch list, it would be easier to understand. I'm telling, sorry, because it's a bit confusing, we need to translate. So it's just a suggestion, obviously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. Let me understand the, I'm not sure I understood. First, we call, the general category is non-performing loans. Within the category of non-performing loans we have the different layers. The worst is the doubtful loans, the Sofferenze. The second is the substandard, the incaglio and then we have the restructured, the [foreign language] in Italian, and then we have the watch list and bad news are the bad news. So your suggestion is to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My suggestion is to call the Sofferenze, the doubtful non-performing loans and since the substandard to call the incaglio the watch list, and maybe you can change the names to total problem loans to the total. It's just something, but I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I still have two questions. The first one refers to what you just said, answer to a prior question on the impact of the commission in [foreign language] I just wanted to clarify whether the impacts you gave, 70 to 100 million, is for the full year or for the quarter, and whether there is any fee already in place to offset part or all of these amount in the commission income line, commission [foreign language] .</p>
          <p>The second question refers to the outlook, because I'm a bit puzzled as well by the fact the terminology, the wording of the outlook hasn't changed since what you gave us in May, you following Q1. So I'm going to phrase the question a slightly different way. Did the previous outlook in May already include the 300 million capital gain on the disposal of Banca Generali, Findomestic that were not known officially then? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the overdraft commission, the so called [foreign language] in Italian. The estimate I provided is on a quarterly basis. It will probably have such an impact on the next very few quarters, and we expect to compensate for it in other ways from next year. For sure as you mentioned one of the -- one way that is not a direct compensation but it's something we should consider as banks, that is to charge for the credit lines we give -- for the affidamenti, for the opening and availability of funds. That's one of the possibility and we are considering a number of them, but not directly and not necessarily as a way to compensate for the commission, [foreign language] , to make as transparent as possible the terms and conditions with our customers.</p>
          <p>We have not changed, now the second question, we have not changed the guidance in terms of net income because we want to be as prudent as possible given that forecasting the future in the present world is very difficult. So do consider what we have said and what -- on the previous occasion and on this occasion as an evidence of prudence.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We have another question from the line of Luigi Passerone of Intermonte. Your question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I think there are a few question left. One if it's possible a clarification on your hedging policy. If I'm not wrong, you stated, answering before, that such policy is going to be in place for the next two years. But if I remember correctly, at the end of the conference call commenting first quarter results, you said that such an hedging policy was going to play in favor of your accounts till the end of first half of 2010. So I would like to get at a clarification on the timeframe for this hedging policy.</p>
          <p>Again on the hedging policy, just to better understand how it works, is it correct to say that the impact that you are going to benefit each quarter is somehow directly correlated to the evolution of your <mark type="inaudible" />. So in the third quarter, we should expect a positive impact coming from the hedging, which is even higher compared to the second quarter?</p>
          <p>Second question, very briefly on the repricing process, just to understand at which stage you are, can we say that you are ready to price let's say up to 80, 70% of total potential repricing? And third and very quick, I know you didn't want to give guidance on this, on trading I mean for the volatile, I mean as far the item is very volatile. But just briefly on third quarter, we're already at the end of August, just to understand if you can assume that at the end of third quarter you would come up with a figure, which is somehow comparable to that exceptional second quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far the hedging policies, I confirm what I said before, we expect our facilities to be fully operational at least for the whole 2010. So a bit longer than we expected before. In third quarter, the effect of the hedging might, will probably benefit from the reduction in the LIBOR rates. And I said in fact that the effect would be comparable with, comparable in the, with the market yields we had in the second quarter. But yes, we might benefit from what is happening on the LIBOR market.</p>
          <p>Repricing, repricing is impossible to say, if it is 70 or 80, a never-ending effort. I can tell you that there is still room for improving the correlation between rating and spreads and markups in particular. But making any other quantitative estimate would be unwise. Trading remains such a volatile activity that I do prefer not to give any guidance not even after the two months of the quarter. Sorry, but I think it's wiser in any respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand. And if I can, just a follow-up on your facility, I mean your hedging facility. Probably I did not understand properly at the end of first quarter, but you said at the time that such a facility was going to expire by the end of first half 2010. Now you said that is going to be in place for the whole 2010. Is such a facility being extended in the last month or just maybe I didn't understand properly what you said during the last conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not one facility, the number of things that are continuously updated and worked upon, it's a matter of roll over facilities, and I'm really interested in your interest in this. In any case, be sure that at least for the whole 2010, the hedging will work.</p>
