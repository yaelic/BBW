        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome everybody here in the room and of course those viewing in online to our analyst conference. I am pleased that we are back in London where around six months ago as you might remember Siemens embarked on a new course stressing transparency, accountability, and performance.</p>
          <p>This morning, we announced our results for the second quarter of fiscal '08. During today's session, our President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher; and our Chief Financial Officer, Joe Kaeser will provide some context on the performance of this period, cover the progress on the management review of projects and will give you an update on the execution of our strategic agenda. After that we are happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>With that introduction, I would like to hand it over now to Peter to get it started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michael. Welcome to everybody. The second quarter was an eventful quarter for Siemens. I would therefore like to go straight into the first chart please. The execution of our TAP, of our strategic agenda is fully on track. The quarter as we have communicated to you on the 17th of March with our project reviews which Joe and myself have initiated with the incoming CEOs. We have now completed 100% of our PG project reviews. At the same time without any additional charges, we have also completed 80% of our project reviews on Transportation Systems and the former Transportation Systems division, today's Mobility division and again here as well we have no significant new charges, but we also would like to use today the time to update you on the key program, which we have started and this is to bring our cost position in line with our key competitors, our SG&amp;A program which Joe will highlight in detail in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>Let me start quickly with the financial highlights of the quarter. We have delivered a very, very strong order growth 15% with the book-to-bill of 1.3, which clearly indicates that the growth path of Siemens is fully on track and this should also help us to convert the second half of 2008 into a strong sales growth. So we are fully committed for 2008 to deliver our two times GDP growth for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our revenue for the quarter rose 2% organically against the tough year-on-year comparable basis. If you remember last year it was the end of our Fit4More program which was presented by Claus. As a result of the project reviews mainly at PG, our top line was actually reduced by 250 million, which equates to 1.5% growth in the quarter for Siemens overall; or for Power Generation, it actually converts into 7 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Looking in a little more detail at the business, we have outstanding organic revenue growth at PTD plus 13%, A&amp;D plus 11, and Osram plus 6.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the project charges which we have announced on March 17th, the final charges are reported in our Q2 numbers totaling 857.</p>
          <p>Again looking at the businesses A&amp;D, Med, and PTD showed excellent earnings conversion. Group profit from operations came in at 1.203 billion and I am actually encouraged by the underlying margins across our businesses. Income from continuing operations was 565 million with Corporate Items increasing year-on-year to 506 million, impacted by increased expenses for compliance, investigations, and Siemens' transforming programs and Joe will go into more details on these numbers as well.</p>
          <p>Turning again back to the order book, new order growth was excellent. Growth drivers as you can see here on the left hand side on a regional basis, we see strong regional order growth across the globe. Germany, actually at 21% driven by major orders for PG and A&amp;D; 54% by Near Middle East; and Russia and China 23% driven by major orders for industry which is also encouraging against the backdrop of the economy. We also saw solid organic growth of 8% in United States.</p>
          <p>Industry, particularly driven by A&amp;D and I&amp;S generated strong double-digit order growth as did the energy sector which continues to benefit from sustained global demand. Besides the numbers, let me give in a couple of highlights key customer wins for the quarter.</p>
          <p>In the energy sector which continues to enjoy strong global demand; our Power Distribution division won the largest ever order from China Light &amp; Power. Our Healthcare sector as part of a consortium won the order to build and operate the first particle therapy center in Germany at the University Clinic of Schleswig-Holstein; and finally in our industry sector, Siemens PLM software was chosen by Volkswagen and Audi as the global software platform to be used throughout the entire vehicle design and manufacturing process.</p>
          <p>Clearly while there may be ups and downs in particular times, the fundamentals of our key value drivers, industry, energy and healthcare continues to be strong. If we look at the profit margins of our businesses in Q2 as you can see on this slide, we see strong underlying margins; on the left hand side A&amp;D, which continued to deliver excellent performance with 310 basis points improvement actually operating at full capacity.</p>
          <p>Our Healthcare sector, formerly Medical Solutions, also delivered sound double-digit margins and increased the underlying margin by 100 basis points despite the well-known and ongoing challenges what the healthcare businesses faces in the United States.</p>
          <p>And finally through strong execution and favorable product mix, PTD delivered 350 basis points margin improvements. Please be aware that this is also the last time that we will report under the old format so from the next quarter onwards we will actually give you a full report in the new structure of the 15 divisions and 3 sectors.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the key challenges what they face in our legacy projects in Fossil Power and in Mobility. As you are well aware in March, we <mark type="inaudible" /> 80%, in the meantime we have completed the project review, the final number is 559 million and there will be some additional margin impact in the coming quarters; not new charges but from the first identified charges, and Joe will give you more details on this.</p>
          <p>We've put in place actions to improve the positioning of the performance in these areas, increased the scrutiny of our project risks, the pricing, the partner management, we moved to centralize the project management systems globally. We expanded our trainings, we have recruited in this quarter alone 500 engineers, and these steps are just a few what you see on the right hand side in terms of actions that's how we have corrected in key milestones the identified risks what we have shared with you on the 17th of March.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you can see if you remember when we have met for the first time, I told you that the turnkey projects are roughly between 40 and 50% of the sales mix within Siemens that we've tried to ramp them down even before we have identified the project risks, so you see on the left hand side; on the top of it the backlog actually, which we will provide you from now going forward in full transparency. As you can see, the current backlog, end of March, &#x20AC;22.5 billion. You can already see that the turnkey mix only represents 29% and the Products &amp; Services part actually is 71%. So we are well in our target range what we tried to accomplish. How has the business executed against the target of having a third in service, a third in components, and a third in turnkey for the quarter, which you see on the lower left hand side. The quarter order intake was 4.2 billion, again, we are exactly executing as we intend to execute.</p>
          <p>So the backlog is actually going in the right direction. The order intake we're executing exactly against we tried to execute and as you can see from the business mix, how this is changing over time. By 2010, we actually would like to see exactly this mix happening also on the sales side.</p>
          <p>As a key part of the new strategy is also that we will continue to focus increasingly on the component parts of our business.  We have therefore initiated an investment program where we'll double our gas turbine capacity, solidifying the strong number two position globally what we have behind GE. So the Power Generation business is clearly executing against the strategy what we put forward. And Wolfgang Dehen and his leadership team will actually give you an update on the forthcoming energy day June 30th and July 1st.</p>
          <p>If we now move on to briefly touch on our former Transportation System group, the Mobility group of <mark type="audio gap" />. We have also a new management team in place. We have reviewed the risks. The last time when we have communicated to this, we were through with 20% of the order book; we have now completed roughly 75% of it. As I said earlier, virtually with no additional charges in Q2.  Again, Joe will give you a couple of highlights in terms of the way going forward in this business as well.</p>
          <p>We have in this business as well on the right hand side as you can see the key actions what we have taken in the quarter, we have strengthened the limits of authority, we have tied the contract management, and we have also adopted more standard platform designs across the unit.</p>
          <p>We have initiated as part of this review, a productivity program where we try to accomplish two things; one, position this business taking full advantage of the underlying growth pattern of the industry. It is an attractive business from the standpoint of secular growth trend. We have an order book of 37 months in Mobility, but we have to position this business from the standpoint that there are no longer the quarterly surprises, what we have seen so many times in the past. And we also try to position this business in the way that we are able to attain sustainable profitable growth from a leading market position.</p>
          <p>The other issue what we have promised to you to update you on a quarterly basis from now forward is the Combino part of our business. Last time, March 17th, we have shared with you that we have actually &#x2013; that we are through with 241 units out of 475. End of the quarter, we have completed 260 units without any additional charges.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the key program of how we tried to bring in line our cost structures with our key competitor or competitors and this is our SG&amp;A program. With the SG&amp;A program, as we have communicated to you, we tried to reduce in absolute terms the SG&amp;A costs by 1.2 billion. In the mean time, we had multiple project teams working on detailed project designs. Joe will give you a further break out in terms of how it actually &#x2013; the key action stands what we will take and how we have framed this whole project design. As you can see on this slide on the right hand side, we intend to decrease the G&amp;A costs by minus 22% and the sales costs by minus 6%.</p>
          <p>And with this I would like to hand over to Joe for your further details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you Peter. Thank you very much. Also a very warm welcome from my side to today's conference. I think as we have outlined a couple of times prior to this conference the path that we have set on SG&amp;A we believe is very ambitious, especially taking into consideration that we continue to grow at 2x GDP going forward till 2010.</p>
          <p>In order to get to those savings, we have been outlining here on the SG&amp;A part, this requires a structural change in the way we are organized and how we go to market, in order to enable us to get things done more efficiently and especially faster.</p>
          <p>Let me now, for a moment, talk about the main drivers. We will eliminate duplications on all levels, that means within the sectors and divisions, as well as sectors to corporate, and of course also from sector to regions and corporate to regions. The simplification of the company's structure and the corresponding sector accountability has really exposed where and how duplication can be eliminated.</p>
          <p>We have given you the split into G&amp;A and the marketing and sales. On this slide now, you see on how the breakdown of the base line along the sectors and corporate looks like. That means what our accountability structure is all about. Every sector's CEO is very aware of what has to happen and has taken full responsibility on executing on the program which in essence is based on their bottom-up plans.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to talk a little bit about the functional areas, where we will generate cost reduction and where we do want to deliver organic growth. Again, the consolidated sector organization plays a very big part. Let me highlight some of the measurable actions which we are taking.</p>
          <p>Let's first talk about G&amp;A and how we pulled 700 million in absolute cost terms out of the system. The 700 million certainly is a stretch goal by the same token, this is important and necessary to cover the perceived shortfall in sales and marketing, and I'll cover the sales and marketing area in a minute. The first obvious area for saving comes from the consolidation of the support functions as we move eight divisions into three sectors.</p>
          <p>In addition, further savings will come from lower infrastructure cost as we move from roughly 70 regional companies into 20 regional clusters. To give you some more color here, many of those regional companies in essence do have the same structure in their country as Siemens corporate has. So, with the cluster approach, savings in the infrastructure costs are obvious in the entire back office as well as in the administrative functions.</p>
          <p>The country later on will have time to fully concentrate on demand creation only while we concentrate the back office and support functions on the cluster country level. With a very clear sector accountability comes the enabler for less corporate overhead, leading to streamlined corporate headquarters with a clear focus on governance activities.</p>
          <p>For example, we'll be cutting the number of legal entities from roughly 1,800 today down to below 1,000, which in turn will save us significant resources in accounting, planning, legal and reporting. Further incremental savings come from the bundling of shared service, particularly in IT, finance, accounting and real estate management into a global shared service organization.</p>
          <p>Marketing &amp; Sales makes up a far larger portion of the cost structure. And here too, it's pretty clear what needs to happen. By refocusing our go-to-market approach by sector, we will increase the overall sales force efficiency. For example, we will reevaluate our sales representation in smaller countries. In addition, we will have a much stronger orientation towards the Siemens verticals such as automotive and food and beverages or others with a strong account management structure, which acts globally for those key accounts.</p>
          <p>We do not intend to reduce the feet on the street, the people who go in search of the customers to create demand as long as profitable growth is maintained and targets are achieved. We will continue to invest in growth areas while we cut back office and sales infrastructure cost.</p>
          <p>In summary, our target scenario for the 2010 SG&amp;A cost in absolute terms will be 1 billion euro lower than in 2007. The feedback I've got on the 10% reduction in essence has a wide spread, from disappointing all the way up to overly aggressive. I think it is important that everyone in the company as well as externally understands that we are cutting costs while growing at the same time. The margin effect of our plans is substantially larger than the 10% at face value.</p>
          <p>And let me now try to explain what is meant by that, what the slide which is now on the screen. Let's just assume for example, that GDP growth at 3% per year and that second we grow at GDP as we have outlined and confirmed in our Fit42010 goals. But in essence, that means that the SG&amp;A in percent of sales will go down from 16.7 as we had in 2007 to 12.6% of sales.</p>
          <p>This is a 400 basis points reduction of SG&amp;A cost which is equivalent to 24% reduction in relative terms. 400 basis points in percent of sales. I think it's worth remembering that impacts such as increasing wage inflation, particularly in Germany, make the real effect on the SG&amp;A cuts even more significant.</p>
          <p>From now on we will give you quarterly updates on the progress of our SG&amp;A reduction and I want to reemphasize again that this is not about moving cost from one function to the other. This is about eliminating costs for good.</p>
          <p>Now I would like to move on and update you on the project of other operations. Back in November, we said that this line item in the P&amp;L would mostly disappear by fiscal 2009. Other operations, our businesses that do not fall into one of our three categories, our three sectors and therefore are not aligned with our global vertical strategies. We have made significant progress, and the process consolidating other operations either by integrating them into the sector, sale, partner or close, is well underway and we are on schedule.</p>
          <p>About 250 million of revenues already found a home and will be integrated into the sectors' businesses. About 85% are still under evaluation and solutions to some of those are underway.</p>
          <p>For now, we do expect the proceeds from divesting to cover the costs for potential ramp down costs of other businesses.</p>
          <p>So now, let's turn to the status of our share buyback program. As you know, this has been announced in November 2007 as part of our capital structure target. We successfully competed the first 2 billion tranche. Since starting the program on January 28th we have acquired about 25 million shares at an average price of 80.47 per share outperforming the average daily relap by about $0.10 per share which brings down our total shares outstanding from 914 million to 889 million shares.</p>
          <p>Many of you have mentioned that based on the current share price, this should be a buying opportunity and therefore would expect us to accelerate a share buyback program. While this is an important aspect, we will also of course need to consider the overall market environment as well as the refinancing environment we are currently in. We will give regular updates on the next steps. I think one important aspect to the share buyback program is also that we need to look at the development of our net debt in the company and that I would like to explain on the next slide.</p>
          <p>In the last six months, we decreased our net debt position by 5.5 billion. Out of the portfolio transactions, I would like to highlight the successful exit of Siemens VDO which in essence brought 11.4 billion into our pockets and the payout for the Dade Behring acquisition in the amount of 4.4 billion.</p>
          <p>On the right side of the chart, you'll see that by the first tranche of our share buyback program together with the dividends paid, we returned 3.5 billion to our shareholders already in the first half of the current fiscal year. On operating level, we invested 1.5 billion in property, plant and equipment and into intangible assets.</p>
          <p>Looking at the 1 billion in asset management, I think this is in essence the networking capital management where we have increased our efforts going forward. And the result you see on the next slides, where we see the net working capital turns which further have improved from 8.0 at fiscal year end 2007, now from 8.0 to 8.3 in fiscal Q2, 2008.</p>
          <p>We also do continue to take a very disciplined approach on CapEx spending. If and when the financial sector turmoil hits the real economy, we believe it's very critical to be prepared and maintain a tight control on CapEx. I think we are on the &#x2013; we are one of a very few companies that manage to continuously decrease the CapEx to deprecation ratio, already in times we are marketing organic growth forecast, we are still very bullish. We will maintain this discipline during the fiscal year 2008, and expect a further decline of the CapEx ratio as compared to last year into the ballpark of about 110 to 115% of depreciation.</p>
          <p>Finally, where do we stand on our Fit42010 targets? As you know we have laid out five targets. Four targets related to the Group and one of course related to the performance of the divisions in terms of margin goals.</p>
          <p>First of all, we have for seven out of ten groups or ten divisions in the target margin range, especially if you consider the 350 plus basis points impact of PPE and one time cost in the healthcare sector. This is what we believe a positive development.</p>
          <p>With regards to profitability going forward, I think I said before that you will like what you see at A&amp;D and PTD. A&amp;D currently acts and operates at capacity. So I think it would not come as a surprise to me if earnings conversion slowed down when new investments came on line.</p>
          <p>As Peter already mentioned, PTD clearly benefited also from a favorable product mix in fiscal Q2.</p>
          <p>Healthcare in our view has done a very decent job in integrating diagnostics, which is performing to plan, but given the direct effects on DRA from the imaging business, we expect this will continue to operate in a very challenging environment for some quarters to come. This will be true for the top line as well as for the bottom line.</p>
          <p>PG was clearly affected by the product charges and you can expect negative earnings impact in the coming quarter in the neighborhood of about 100 million for Q3 and Q4 and maybe a bit into fiscal Q1 2008. This is not charges, this is a reduced profit impact from the project review we have done in the last fiscal quarter. As a result of the project review Mobility, will realign its organization to adjust its cost structure. And with its Mobility in Motion program, we do expect that significant productivity improvements will come by the same token, however together with the impact of the results of the project review. We expect also up to about 100 million additional cost impact for the second half of fiscal 2008.</p>
          <p>As far as capital efficiency is concerned, this year's ROCE certainly is being impacted by our significant investment in the acquisitions of Dade Behring as well as Bayer and UGS where we do see, of course, the impact on capital employed but not yet the expected profitability, which we do certainly get in the quarters and the years to come.</p>
          <p>I think that will conclude now my presentation and Peter, back to the summary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. So, overall, let's summarize with the strategic roadmap. I think, overall, I'm very pleased how we're executing against the roadmap what we have set out for ourselves. I think we have the leadership teams now in place, what they have to have in place from a global responsibility as well as regional responsibility. We have the target margins increased. We have given you the first update on the SG&amp;A programs, so you could expect from us every quarter now receive obviously from quarter-to-quarter in more detailed SG&amp;A update as we move forward.</p>
          <p>As we have outlined, we will report from July onwards in the new structure for the company. I will give you also an overview in terms of the new compensation scheme, how we tried to align incentive systems going forward. You will receive for the first time from Siemens a guidance on EPS for 2009.</p>
          <p>As you can see, from October onwards we intend to put the compensation system in place. Joe just gave you an update in terms of how we are very successfully progressing on the other operations part. So I would say from &#x2013; I am very pleased in terms of how we execute against the roadmap what we have set out. And I would just like now to complete with the forecast for 2008. And let me start with the overall outlook in terms of the overall economy.</p>
          <p>I think everybody is reading that from months to months and week to week forecasts are coming down. We strongly believe that the economy in 2009, we are moving into a phase of slower worldwide growth. It is only dependent in terms of will we have sharp V shaped recession in the U.S. or will we have a prolonged slowdown.</p>
          <p>We feel confident based on the order book, books what we have in our businesses and the long cycle infrastructure projects what we are serving in terms of our customers that we are confirming our 2X GDP growth for 2008. From a profit perspective, we will have the group profit from operations will match our prior year level and the income from continuing operations will match also our prior year's level.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to conclude the presentation and we obviously will also, the long-term Fit42010 program is clearly on track. We have identified the major projects risks. We put remedial action steps in place. The story is fully intact.</p>
          <p>And with this, I would like to open it up for any type of questions which you may have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now let's start with the Q&amp;A, I would say let's start with Andreas Willi [JPMorgan], here in the third row, the gentleman in the third row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have two questions please. The first one is just a follow-up on your outlook statement. Looking for flat operating profit if we use your first half performance and what you have said about the second half just now, it still leaves a &#x2013; quite bit of a gap for &#x2013; or let's say headroom for additional things, charges that could go wrong.</p>
          <p>Could you maybe give a bit more guidance, how you arrived at this guidance and how we should look at that? Should we look at it as a minimum or should we look at that as what you aimed for the second half of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question on your medical business, you had 1% order growth. Given your mix geographically and from a business perspective, I would have expected you to do better, also given that you had a very large order in there. Maybe you could give the breakdown for just imaging equipments order, what they did in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If I start off with medical first. Obviously medial had a &#x2013; had a tough quarter, I mean, there's basically no news. I mean we have communicated this over many months and quarters now that the program in the U.S., the cost reduction program is very much impacting the overall market growth. We see in 2008, a flat-to-down market overall, obviously when you look into the imaging modalities, it looks slightly different. CT is still impacted more than for example MI. We are in the good position overall that &#x2013; so we see a market recovery not before 2009 in the U.S., and this obviously also impacts the overall order growth.</p>
          <p>The market in Japan is also a rather difficult one so overall the business is currently below the secular growth trends. What you would expect from the healthcare business. We are benefiting from the standpoint that we are introducing numerous new products and also the in vitro diagnostics business, I just would like to remind you that 75% of this business is a pure consumable business, which obviously in this environment we are in also helps in terms of the growth. So we anticipate that for the second part of 2008, you will see an increase growth pattern for our healthcare business, and maybe the second question I'll pass on to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the outlook Andreas, this is the outlook of the company now of course I understand that there is the desire to get a little more quality to it.  As Peter has outlined earlier, you could say there is a lot of uncertainty.  There's been a lot of management change in the company. So that's why we see this year as a year of transformation.  And that Siemens has been the reason why we &#x2013; we will kind of stick to the guidance that we want to meet last year's level, that would be the 6.5 billion on operations and the 3.909 billion on net from continued.  We just outlined that there could be up to 200 million on profit impacts about 100 million each, on Mobility and Power, which is not a charge per se, it's just a reduction on the &#x2013; if you wanted the gross margins due to the evaluation of the cost basis during the project review. I guess that that's how I would rather leave it at.</p>

          <p>Just to come back on medical, if I take out the large order you had and on continued growth in, in vitro, your equipment orders must have been down 15% or more in the quarter. Is that wrong? Imaging equipment orders.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just gave you by modality the growth rates, what we have seen.  That means the CT business was the largest impacted and obviously the overall equipment part of our business is more severely impacted than the in vitro business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Lisa Randall from Lehman Brothers. Three questions please. Firstly, just on the SG&amp;A program. Can you give us some indication of when and what cost &#x2013; the cost reduction program will entail?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just on Power Generation. You briefly mentioned pricing but how much do you think of the current difficulties, i.e. what's running through the revenues now and in the order backlog is as a result of more aggressive pricing perhaps in the past. It's certainly been a comment that's been made by some of your competitors in the past. And if that is the case going forward, what have you put in place to ensure that effectively you leave yourself some more room in terms of the margins on projects at the outset?</p>
          <p>And then just thirdly on transport, could you just give us a bit more &#x2013; in terms of what the cost realignment will entail? Is it primarily around the rolling stock business and is it around a geographical relocation i.e. outside of Germany and to some of the other emerging markets? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with Power first. Indeed our order book what we have also communicated to you on the 17th, the older order book has obviously is the most problematic order book for us. So, when you look in to new orders from 200 mid 2007 onwards, we see a different trend. What we have done to actually facilitate that this is actually not happening. One &#x2013; number one we have &#x2013; we are decreasing the overall number of our turnkey programs. We've put a system in place where each single one new turnkey project will be signed off by the sector CEO &#x2013; by the sector CFO and by the CEO of the division. What we are also putting in place is &#x2013; and this is also part of our new management culture, is we have a new CEO for the turnkey program coming from the outside from May onward, so we put new leadership team in place. We put the new CFO in place. So we are taking all the remedial action around people and their responsibility.</p>
          <p>We have also globalized the project management approach as I said earlier. We have now significantly enhanced the contracting aspect from a leading support perspective. So I feel confident that we have now an overall program in place that from now going forward that we are tackling the risks what we have identified.</p>
          <p>Now this is by definition, a high risk business. So there will always be, you can never completely eliminate the risk, but I think we put everything in place in terms of the leadership of this business to really make sure that we focus on the profitable part of the turnkey programs and also there is a significant different approach towards taking fix price guarantees to our customers versus open order schemes and different pricing schemes where Siemens is no longer willing to take the complete risks and also trying to align with our suppliers the timelines in a very different way and the collaboration what we have between suppliers and ourselves. So this is just a number of steps what we are taking place, so I feel confident about this.</p>
          <p>The second one on TS on the TS program, the mobility motion program is a very, very comprehensive program, so it's not tackled around a singular aspect. It goes across functions. It tackles how we deal with creating a more standardized approach in the business. How we create a platform approach. It tackles functional aspects in terms of purchasing. It tackles also locations. So it's a comprehensive program to ensure that we take advantage of fundamentally secular growth business, but also position this business as I said earlier that we A, are able to generate leading margins what this business is generating and B, that we minimize the risk profile of the business in terms of the risks of quarter prices. So that's a very comprehensive system. And Joe maybe you can...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The SG&amp;A program and the cost reduction program on SG&amp;A is a very comprehensive and a very widespread program. In order to initiate the charges for restructure, because obviously there's head count renewals, we need to go side-by-side and agree with the unions and workers' representatives about the programs on how to set the severance. So therefore it's going to be extremely challenging to get the maturity, if not all of the charges into the current fiscal year, which is, of course, we are up to and try to achieve. By the same token we are, we'll follow the rules in terms of what we can account for and what the prerequisites are.</p>
          <p>Only if the company has an agreement with the workers representatives about the terms and conditions and has made a variable couple offer to a number of employees which we do not need to know by names, but we need to have the numbers and the conditions, then we can book the charges under IFRS. So therefore this is a very, very challenging undertaking, to fit everything into 2008, which we certainly would like to see. But then again we need to go by the facts and by the correct methods. The number of charges certainly is open since we do not have the agreements yet, we don't know of course the magnitude, so we keep you updated as soon as we know about the agreements.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's move, I would say Peter and then Colin, gentleman in the second row.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please, firstly in the past Siemens have said that the margin in Automation and Drives was held back by process automation. Can you tell us, is that still the case today or is the rapid margin increase because process is now coming up to speed?</p>
          <p>Secondly, a question for Peter. What level of confidence do you that the charges in Power Gen are going to prove to be adequate, given 20 contracts. So the how would have stringing further analysis process?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, can you give us an update on where we are with the forward investigation? We obviously had the unexpected surprised at medical recently, was that just a big one off surprise or are you finding deeper problems that you anticipated three, six months ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, the first part and just repeat the first part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which question? The first one or the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the last question the first...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you update us on the forward investigations? In fact the final touch is medical, was it just a big one off or have you found more things than you anticipated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you start with the A&amp;D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, maybe I start with A&amp;D, Peter. So, historically A&amp;D has taken a strong margin, positive margin impact from the factory automation from the discrete pair. Process automation used to be somewhat bigger in terms of margin that has to do with the amount and that depth of installed base. So, if you look at the business now, we do see continued strengths also in order intake, as you have seen as by the numbers of Q2.</p>
          <p>I think I also mentioned in my presentation that while the division operates at capacity, it could well be that the aggressiveness of hoardings conversion going forward could be a little slower since we do also invest into new capacities there. As far as the outlook on the process automation versus factory automation is concerned, it will see some caution on the discrete while process continues to be strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I feel confident about the investigation, what we have done. I'm referring to the risk profile what you are referring to in power generation. We have to recognize at the end of the day this is a risky business. For this reason alone we have decided to be far, far more selective in terms of taking turnkey programs and product on board. So one key element is that we actually decrease the number of turnkey programs what we are running. And the second one as I've outlined, we have now a very comprehensive program and I feel very confident that the team is actually approaching this with the right mindset, with the realign processes and with the accountability, what you expect from a leadership team to happen.</p>
          <p>And with the new CEO which we are bringing on board which is an absolute expert in terms of bigger projects and power projects having experience with ABB outs from Lurgies, the COO of Lurgies. I fell very confident about the new CEO which we are bringing for the business as well. So overall I'm far more confident than I was a couple of months ago.</p>
          <p>On the compliance investigation, I would like to refer here to the leading proceedings what we have shared with you. We are doing &#x2013; this is the process what we are using. We are sharing this with every quarter. I think we are making great progress that you have also seen that this is an issue which is far more widespread as we have initially anticipated. But we're tackling this with the compliance program in place which is absolutely &#x2013; we are doing everything on one side to help the authorities in their investigation. But on the other hand, to make sure going forward that we have the compliance programs in place to absolutely make sure that this cannot happen again.</p>
          <p>And this is what we're focusing on the increasing the compliance resources. We have realigned, as you know, we have now for the first time as a German company the function actually at the management board. So I feel very confident going forward that we're doing the right steps and we'll do everything that we can, please be assured, that will try to help the investigation to conclude, but when this will happen, how it will happen, I just ask for your understanding that I cannot comment on this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then Colin would be next.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's Colin Gibson from HSBC. Three questions please. In the past, I think you've described the SG&amp;A reduction program as an enabler for the year, fit for 2010 program. And yet on slide 17, you say the SG&amp;A reduction program won't be completed until October 2010, does that mean fit for 2010 is effectively already fit for 2011, if the enabling program isn't finished till the end of that fiscal year? That was question one.</p>
          <p>Second question on the same sort of theme. Joe, perhaps the master of understatement by saying that you won't get all of the SG&amp;A costs into fiscal '08 &#x2013; will you even get half of them into fiscal '08? I would have thought surely you're looking at the majority of SG&amp;A program related costs in fiscal '09 rather than fiscal '08, can you confirm or deny that?</p>
          <p>And then last question, referring to slide nine, talking about the PG business &#x2013; very helpful breakdown of turnkey versus products and service. Can you also comment on the breakdown of gas versus coal in the order book, whether that's going up, whether gas is going up as a percentage or coming down as a percentage? And do you see the turnkey risk in gas business as a greater or less than the turnkey risk in the coal business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'd probably start with the first one. We're absolutely committed to the fit for 2010 program, okay. So we couldn't care less if some enablers are working better or not. Of course we would like to see that the enablers are working better, so that the overall program will be achieved in the most effective way. So we're fully committed, but we're also committed to deliver the 1.2 billion which we are outlining in terms of SG&amp;A programs, in terms of costs. Joe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely, I think we need to be very clear. We do want to have the 1.2 billion, in essence the 10.9 billion SG&amp;A achieved in our P&amp;L of fiscal 2010. So as far as the charges, the SG&amp;A charges are concerned &#x2013; and I think Lisa asked the question &#x2013; that was only related to the charges. The question I thought I heard was that how much will the charges be, which I certainly wouldn't know at this time and then would we consider book them into the P&amp;L? And I said that of course this depends on how far we get with the workers' representative to get agreements in place. Our goal certainly is to book the majority of the charges as related to &#x2013; enable us for SG&amp;A savings still in fiscal 2008, however, as we said we go by the rules and we need to get the prerequisites first and then we will do the accounting for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So what we tried to show you on page nine, this is the format which we try to use to really share with you in all transparency in terms of, did you have the sense in terms of how the higher risk orders are actually converting into sales. I don't have the breakdown what you asking for. But I think with this one you can actually clearly see how we are A, number one are focusing not just from an order backlog, how we are executing on a quarterly basis, that we are focusing on high margin service businesses. As I said earlier, I think the key element is that we try to participate in higher gas turbines and therefore we are doubling our capacity, so all of these are measures to really making sure number one, that the profitability of the overall segment is increasing and the risk profile is actually mitigated in managing the best way. So that's the format that you will see now going forward, I don't have the further breakdown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, can I very quickly ask another question instead then, which is that looking at the reduction in the percentage of turnkey on slide nine, it could be said that 39 down to 33, 34% is not that massive a mix shift. Should you be targeting a more aggressive mix shift, should you be looking at no more than say 25% turnkey, given the risks that you yourself admit the turnkey business brings with it, and the historic problems that Siemens has always had in turnkey, particularly in coal fire.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but let us take a different tack on this question. I think the solution business is always, should always be a core competence of Siemens. What they have to make sure is that they focus in a far more selective way on the most profitable business opportunities and that we share the risk in a way that we are not left alone with a risk profile which we are not able to share with our suppliers and with others, and with the customers. So I think the &#x2013; what we try to convey to you is we will continuously monitor this one. I think this is the strategic aim that we've put forward for the business and we believe that's the right approach. Could it one day be 25 or, I mean, the question is how many profitable turnkey opportunities do we have? But on the other hand, what we have to ramp up is quickly as possible is our component business. So I am focusing actually on the other part as well that we are actually really, really making sure that we, as I said earlier, are strong number two position behind GE in the gas turbine business because this will be a business which is in a significant up swing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I would say Tim in the back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tim Adams from Citi. Can I just come back &#x2013; two questions, one is on the gas turbine ramp up in productive capacity. I mean, I think at the moment you have got a capacity of 55, 60 turbines in Berlin and about 20 or so in Canada. I mean is it, are you proposing to double capacity across both &#x2013; across the whole of that base? The second question is really on the sales number for Q2; can you give a little bit more feel for why the organic growth was quite disappointing in the quarter? I mean, I noticed that a couple of the divisions packed PTD, maybe the progress wasn't quite as strong. In TS, the sales number was quite week, were there any bottlenecks in getting large orders out of the door, was there any impact from Easter? I mean, obviously, you've told us about the accounting issues in PG as knocking some out of the revenue line, but is there anything else you can tell us about the sales number in Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think organically it was 2%, which certainly was I think disappointing. If we consider the impact of about 200 million top line impact from the project review that would translate into 1.5 percentage points, so that would make it 3.5%. It's difficult to really, let's say, quantify the fact that the organization has been, I think, pretty busy in TS as well as PG with its project review. So, I would not suggest that had a big impact, it certainly had an impact. Now referring to what you said Easter &#x2013; I mean on our global business that shouldn't make too much of an impact. If it had been Germany alone that would have been three percentage points impact. However, the project suggests that revenues become more favorable in the current fiscal Q3. So, we recognized that the organization was very busy with a lot of topics and searches across the board. And I think we look forward to a fiscal Q3 which is supposed to show incremental growth as compare to Q2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on GT capacity, when you say you are going double that, I mean is it the total capacity base that we are looking at there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A few questions on Power Generation. You already have, looking at your backlog today, 11 to 15%. Is that already in the numbers because again, I would assume these orders should already have been booked for 2010. And then looking at the SG&amp;A program what kind of inflation, wage inflation you are factoring in to your program? And then looking at slide number 12, there is a quite a big position 1.7 billion of costs for cross sector businesses and other. And then finally just on the share buyback, what are you waiting for? Are you waiting for more proceeds to come in? I mean essentially you're still comfortably within your target range on gearings, what's going to be the catalyst to start that up again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Now, let's maybe start with the share buyback program. I mean the only one thing that is decided upon yet is when and how our much we are going to do, and that will be decided upon on the Managing Board and they will take it from there. Much of the share buyback program on slide number 12, that they issue their reduction, James?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That 1.7 billion, just cross-sector and other.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's SIS, but SFS and the other operations related topics. So that's the 1.7 cross sector...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This seems quite a big number compared to the other divisions, does it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct. On the SFS, so we've put a lot of, let's say, cost to the SG&amp;A portion and much facing to the cost of goods sold. So, I think that's a fair financial business type of difference between the usual industrial business. And then the first question again was the inflation, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wage inflation, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if one calculates, it's about 3% on average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in terms of margin power generation, do you already see that on the backlog today, 11 to 15.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think 2007 and the current year-to-date certainly shows a much more favorable order intake calculation, as it used to show, and also the contingencies have increased. By the same token, we still can execute on the order intake calculations. So therefore, yeah, we have been benefiting from a more selling, sellers market environment &#x2013; by the same token though, execution is key.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Then I would say Timm Schulze-Melander on the left side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Timm Schulze-Melander of Bear Stearns. I just had two housekeeping questions, actually. The first is the change in your pension funding status &#x2013; markets haven't been fabulous, just if you could explain that? And then secondly on SCN you talked about, I think, you chose the word significant loss &#x2013; just if you could give us some idea of the size and how much of that would be cash? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the pension &#x2013; funding the sole reason why the gap has been closing further was that we have a significantly higher discount rate due to the increase interest rates. So it was not a matter of performing in terms of asset management, it's been nearly a technical impact. So that's why, I think, it should not be taken for granted, that could go the other way around if interest rates went the other way.</p>
          <p>On the SCN topic, we do negotiate with potential partners. We are in a material stage of those negotiations and all we wanted to do at this point in time was to inform investors that they should be prepared that this is not going to be a big <mark type="inaudible" /> business transaction, the reason being as you know that the losses have been significant in the last two years. So therefore we felt it was important for our investors to know that this will be a material progress. Let's say bouncing around numbers and also cash or book or losses that would certainly not be very helpful for the negotiations with our related partners, so therefore please bear with me if we convey those numbers when we are done with the contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then I would say Mark Troman [Merrill Lynch], the gentleman in the back on the right side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. Three brief questions please. Firstly on legal charges, I think there were 175 million in the quarter or something like that. Is that &#x2013; should we assume that run rate going forward or is there a direction up and down in that we should assume in coming quarters. Secondly, the charges and provisions that have been taken particularly I'm thinking here in the power division, is there scope for some recovery of those charges say &#x2013; with strong execution by the new management team and are there any incentives for them to do so. And thirdly as part of the SG&amp;A program, could you just outline whether the scope for property sales as you rationalize your structure is significant or not. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the legal charges. As you know the first quarter of the fiscal year was 127. At that time we've been assuming that this could be about the level and from then to ease out, but as I've spoken though on the (current &#x2013; on the fiscal Q2 one needs to take into consideration that our independent investigators took a real effort to looking to the results and the impact from our amnesty program. So that we can rather believe that it should be investigated into we also installed the new compliance and anti-bribery kit in more than 100 countries of this world.</p>
          <p>And then also with the new organizational structure each and any one of the Senior Managers getting a new job as a CEO and CFO from the sector to the business to the divisions to the business units had been screened. So there was a lot of additional efforts which fell into the current or the fiscal Q2. Going forward you know we do all it takes to get our runs around and to get micro standards quickly as we can and whatever it takes to fully cooperate with the government on the investigation. So therefore it's very difficult to really give a meaningful forecast on what the quarters will look like. And so therefore I would not feel compelled and comfortable to put a number out here for Q3 or Q4. So, our approach is co-operate as much as we can and best as we can and get matters done, the sooner the better.</p>
          <p>On the SG&amp;A, SG&amp;A program, that was about property right? Property disposals do not &#x2013; are not part of this year in the program. We have guided that we do intend to have a large three digit number of proceeds for the current fiscal year of that one remains in place, but we of course to look in to the conditions of the real estate markets.</p>
          <p>On the charges, on the 857 and than particularly in Power, I mean that was the most likely case. If you had come to different conclusion on the most likely case we would have considered than in our books and records. So therefore that's what we do expect by considering all aspects we have been looking into.</p>
          <p>As far as incentive is concerned to come up with less charges, that's been something Peter and I have been discussing on how we manage that because one could say this is having full till 2010, by the same token the management team also be rewarded if they get the job done better than we have originally been anticipating. So we haven't made up our mind on how we &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> management team by the same token you can be rest assured that any number which will be a release of provision contributed to the 2010 will be discussed. We do not rely on favorable impacts from provisions, we do rely on performance, underlying performance and everything else will be disclosed and the incentive topic will be agreed upon in due course.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Than I would say sticking to the back Mr. Uglow [Morgan Stanley] please, right gentlemen next to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of question, first of all the just on the environment, the business environment in Germany, I guess this comes back to the issue of organic growth, you had sales down I think around 7% organically in the quarter and you had order intake up 20%. So, I guess, I wanted just a very general sense from you in terms of which of these items, I guess, is extraordinary.</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the SG&amp;A program you expect to book the majority of the costs in 2008, given you're going to be providing an quarterly update in terms of SG&amp;A reduction. I wondered if you would hazard a guess as to when we might begin to see SG&amp;A cost coming down. I would suppose this probably isn't going to be until the second half of calendar 2009, but are you any more optimistic is to when we begin to see SG&amp;A coming down in absolute terms. And the final question just on your selling expenses, 5 billion euro of selling expenses are in the industry division. The unit within there which I believe has the biggest amount of sales people et cetera is Automation and Drives. Are you planning to cut back significantly on selling within the Automation and Drives division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May be start with the SG&amp;A, again, it is very important that we need to follow the prerequisites and then we book the charges. We would like see them as early as at all possible, but we need to stick to the rules. So this is not something we are able to just do on our own in terms of accounting. Now if you look at SG&amp;A costs, so predominantly the G&amp;A costs, we see that those are of course head count related aspects and those also are cost components which are more consulting or related &#x2013; that means third party consulting. So that one you know one could expect a more direct and short-term and front end impact. Certainly, any head count related savings would probably more back end loaded.</p>
          <p>On the selling cost on the industry, it's absolutely true that the majority of the sales and marketing costs are in industry, because industry is mostly mass market. And I think it is very important to reiterate that we hardly do want to touch the denankuration fees of the organization. Denankuration  is the front end that are the feet on the street. You want to be closer to customer, you want to make sure that this is not being impacted in a way that would negatively impact the top line. Especially, not in A&amp;D. So we're going to be close to customer on the denankuration of the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>The vast majority of savings from sales and marketing will either be the reduction of consulting cost in marketing and marketing communication and such, but also on the back office, and infrastructure side of our sales offices and the country center regions. That's where we put the vast majority of our efforts into and here we do need to see the consolidation of those back office activities from regional from countries overlap to <mark type="inaudible" /> or even maybe one level higher into shared services globally. So that's the focus of our drive down the cost on sales and marketing; it is not going to be the feet on the street that will run the risk of impacting the top line adversely.</p>
          <p>Germany which one was extraordinary, well one, one we like, the one we didn't. I think it's fair to say at least in terms of common sales that this indeed did have an impact that at this time the number of work days was less than usually and so one would need to expect to see a recovery on Q3 and Q4. The order intake was affected by larger projects, but even large projects are to contribute to the order intake and to the business. So therefore I think neither one has finished ordinary. They have been seasonal and that's where we would probably need to leave it at.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow-up. Just in very general terms, Joe or Peter, are you sensing any slowdown in the business environment in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The answer is absolutely yes. We are definitely sensing this issue. If you strip out the non-project business in Germany, we sense a slowdown in Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I must say, I mean, can I just go one back I mean &#x2013; we're not saying we're sensing a slowdown. What I am referring to when you talk to our customers, you actually &#x2013; what I try to understand is in terms of where is on the value chain, the first sentence when you talk to our customers you sense a greater sense of caution. And we also see it in some parts of our businesses. So for this reason I actually said it within the next 6 to 12 months, there is no doubt in my mind that we will see this slowing economy also in our business and we have early indicator businesses like building technologies and others where we have first signs that the environment is actually reflecting this.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just make a follow-up on that. Is Germany the main place where you might notice a slowdown? Have you noticed it in other European countries particularly in France, UK and rest of European Union, and second question if I may which is do with the compliance costs. I read that you now have 450 compliance officers. Do these gentlemen, are they carried under corporate expenses or do they get expensed in the individual divisions. And what should we expect the underlying corporate expenses to be going forward. I noticed last year 200 million, 210 million. What would be the underlying corporate cost going forward would you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the compliance officers and yeah they are being considered that, that depends on if they are part of corporate, then of course that will be corporate items. If they work in industry or elsewhere that will be part of that sector or that country. So it will depend on where they are doing their job. And on the underlying &#x2013; on the underlying scheme of corporate items, we have two major impacts here one is certainly a one-off and that was the first restructuring input on the regional sales in Germany &#x2013; the regional company in Germany that it booked about 64 million write down of IT systems, so that will be first charge on the SG&amp;A project that we literally earlier taken in the rest of the world. So then also of course, the comparative charges are significant, so as underlying number for corporate for the next quarters to come. It's probably helpful to use about 180 to 200 million number.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you exactly the &#x2013; I mean I have simply don't have it, the numbers, Adrian. I can't tell, but I can tell you that the overall region &#x2013; I mean in Europe, we still see growth, but I can't give you the breakdown in terms of what you are asking for in terms of France or UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That as a matter of fact if you look in to the earnings release and the subsequent attachments, there is a regional breakdown in terms of the major regions of the world and there you will see the Germany have been somewhat weak in terms of revenue, but strong in order intake. Europe except Germany has not enjoyed the growth rates which we have seen last year, by the same token though Asia and Middle East has been extremely strong. So, it really goes business-by-business. And we mentioned earlier on the outlook of our sectors that this is a different &#x2013; that those three are different. Why we believe that Healthcare is probably rightly overreact, the all time low, I would say, all time low but fit the cycle to cycle low. On industry, we do on the short side where we do see some slowness absolutely on the more long-term cycle such as &#x2013; for this industry, there is still very strong demand. Energy, we expect that to belong &#x2013; that hasn't changed in a recent terms.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Okay just talk a little bit more about the Healthcare business, clearly you are quite a &#x2013; got a quite cautious outlook and I think you are suggesting that the market is now flat rather than typical 3 or 4% growth, what if you assumed will happen in June in U.S. when you get the Deficit Reduction Act and review and also is there any chance that we see some growth in Japan eventually?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I mean one aspect is the 10% in July, but the other aspect is obviously what will happen in the U.S. political environment, I mean when you look just how the different candidates are pronouncing themselves in terms of what their healthcare initiative are. So at this moment it's very difficult to really, really get a good sense in terms of our &#x2013; the business will evolve. What we are seeing is that the difficulty in U.S. market of the DRA program will continue also with the second phase which you are just highlighting and that's why I said earlier we anticipate actually a change as early as 2009. Japan we will continue to have to &#x2013; I think to be a difficult market. As you are aware Japan has every two years a cost reduction measure in place as part of their old healthcare reform scheme. This will continue, so the business and this is why I said earlier the business, I believe, is actually at this moment in time below the secular growth trend what you actually would anticipate for procedures. And we personally believe that for the second half of 2008 based on our product portfolio that we will actually see an increased growth panel but the overall market environment I don't anticipate that this changes significantly for 2008.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Four questions. One strategic. First of all, are you able to update on where you stand on integrating potentially Osram and SBT. You were previously discussing potential strategic options for those businesses. Specifically in PTD, should we expect a continuation of the strong volume pass-through, is there more upside to the margin? And then very specifically when in A&amp;D, do you consider the UGS business you bought as perhaps an early indicator on demand and how is that business &#x2013; UGS, I beg your pardon, how has that developed in the quarter. And perhaps the ups and growth in North America, was there anything particular that stood out to drive the ups and growth and order intake you saw in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll start up with the U.S. What is probably standing out is that we continue to see great order growth in the energy business. We had some big wins in the wind business for example in the U.S., so the energy cycle is certainly standing out when you look into something standing out and for the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the UGS business that turned out to be a positive impact much earlier than we original felt when we acquired the assets, so that goes very well and it does &#x2013; it is same level to work our original business plans had been calling for. In terms of the indicator, I'm not so sure on a state because that actually is, in a sense a new way of being cost down for up to nice being design and in fact for the automation. So that would actually go for further more structurally innovative approach. So now real clear sign of that business a bit all indicator and if that was it would continue to be strong. So that our &#x2013; don't see a correlation.</p>
          <p>On the PTV, I think that was according to the guidance we had a very strong quarter on PTV, following also consistent revenue growth and also consistent cost reduction in productivity. I would not see any increase margins in the mix too couple of quarters in that particular business, I'm not sure at a closure close to peak margins but we do believe that the last quarter was an outstanding business, outstanding margin on PTV. And the last one was the Osram, Building Technologies, I think that was little more related to the discussion on, would it be possible for Siemens or to look more into the Building Technologies side and at greater angle such as combining all Siemens business as an asset to make a very powerful billing automation part, it is something we have been considering our elaborations going on and we will keep it update as we it's a no news on this one Osram is a very, very strong business in terms of our capabilities and innovation particularly not <mark type="inaudible" /> and SBT has its challenge its on the top line, however, we have a clear focus on SBT in terms of quality and margin, but other than top line growth at any cost.</p>

          <p>When we start it actually looked a number one. We looked across the ISS, we looked into our IT business, so we looked into several business in terms of logic review on going.

Apart from a continuous category, which is happening in the business anyhow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right so the &#x2013; no specifics no yellow or red flags as allowed at the same time I think that conclusion we have one of those we've made out of the &#x2013; the events on those last projects was that we focus our corporate audit more on continued project reviews getting the mandatory or the program going forward just to make sure that corporate is close to those type of operational environments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I would take the last few questions Crystal please the lady in the front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two question if I may, the first one is again on SG&amp;A on the cost saving on SG&amp;A. Given all the M&amp;A you have conducted in Healthcare we could have expected a bit more savings on SG&amp;A in this division so west few year and also on the fact that you don't planned to accelerate share buyback do you want to keep I would say some financial flexibility given some valuation in the market have come down and what's your view basically on further acquisition going forward or would there be some opportunities that could arise from lower valuation in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Crystal very healthcare I think one is to consider that Healthcare in its sense was nothing but Siemens Medical becoming Siemens Healthcare. So there is no real consolidation potential here by taking a couple of divisions together to one sector, but that's very different so the consolidation potential of Healthcare is very minimal whereas, for example, in industry there five divisions have come down to one sector or all energy that PG and PTD will combine at all the support function at the back of functions could be consolidated &#x2013; that potential therefore is relatively less than in the other sectors, but a same.  I think we'll break into consideration that health can had all ready been pretty streamline in terms of its back office operations in the division and if we benchmark ourselves healthcare is more a matter of installed base rather than anything else in terms of SG&amp;A. So therefore the Healthcare SG&amp;A is always comparatively lower than in the others. On beside of that program, as I said you earlier there is not much to do after that we are looking to the topics we need to consider, one is the fact is refinancing topic on forms and all kind of matters and the splits we have there of course that is share price is a topic also the net debt of EBITDA and it important to us. So therefore that will all be the matters we take into consideration to continue to shareholder program but at this point in time we have yet made a decision on how much it is going to be for the next several months.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes certainly. So we have our overall strategies organic growth we are looking into capital efficient growth, we are looking for really narrowing the performance GAAP what we have with our key competitors that's the overall strategy and really have &#x2013; we will obviously continuously evaluate and explaining our environment in terms of if they are any add on acquisitions which make sense from a shareholder perceptive we are &#x2013; we will certainly have a look but the primary focus of our whole strategy is actually organic growth in driving capital efficiency growth in our business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We'll take the last question from Tim in the back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just give us an update on when you think the final Combino units will be finished by the retrofitting? And of the tentative of provisions that you've taken for Combino, how much have you still got left, because I imagine that we took the original provision three or four year ago, you have talked about more surprising, obviously more notably, back in March, I mean how much of you actually got in hand to finish the job off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well on Combino we have prepared 460 out of 725. That's the rate. The complexity has come in. It's due to the fact that our cars are coming on 33 different lots and those 33 different lots are not necessarily showing a very close correlation to each other. So that's why the uncertainty came and that's why we have faced continued unpleasant surprises. With the number we have booked now as a charge of the organization believes that they got their answer around it. That's much as you can say at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But this is actually a great example what we actually have to change. When you look into the terms of that we look into new platform aluminum based and you had 32 lots, we are not talking about actually almost four but multiple of car even within the customer you have different loss. And that's why this is just such a difficult job in terms of really analyzing and say okay we are &#x2013; although we are done and we through, so this where we have decided going forward to actually give you the full transparency and an update exactly as we go along. I will see 2010, 2011 will probably be a good timeframe and this whole thing will be over.</p>
