          <p>Good afternoon. This is Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer speaking. On behalf of Daimler, I would like to welcome you on both the telephone and the Internet to our full year results conference call. We are happy to have with us today the Chairman of the Board of Management and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars, Dr. Dieter Zetsche; the CFO, Bodo Uebber; and the Head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler. This morning, at the annual press conference, Dr. Zetsche and Bodo Uebber presented our figures in detail. The speeches and charts are available on the Daimler website.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we'll start the conference call with a short introduction, focusing on our Q4 results, to have more time for Q&amp;A. Now, I would like to hand over to Dr. Zetsche.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Michael M&#xFC;hlbayer. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let me start off with a summary of our 2011 full-year results and our fourth quarter figures. Next, I'll briefly discuss our long-term strategy and targets. And I'll end with our outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>You'll recall that last year, at this time, we promised record sales of Mercedes-Benz Cars, higher van and truck sales, portfolio growth at Financial Services, as well as an EBIT significantly above the previous year. Our team not only delivered on those promises but achieved the best financial result of Daimler in terms of revenue, EBIT and net profit. We posted revenues of &#x20AC;106.5 billion, EBIT of &#x20AC;9 billion from ongoing business and net profit of &#x20AC;6 billion. As a result, our earnings per share rose to &#x20AC;5.31. Those very good earnings are also reflected in the significant increase of value added to &#x20AC;3.7 billion in 2011.</p>
          <p>In the full year 2011, we delivered an industrial free cash flow of &#x20AC;1 billion after a &#x20AC;2 billion pension contribution and a &#x20AC;0.7 billion investment in Tognum. Accordingly our industrial net liquidity remained at the level of &#x20AC;12 billion at the end of December. Summing up, these excellent results and given our very solid business performance, we will propose a dividend of &#x20AC;2.20. That equates to more than 40% of our net profit. In this way, we want our shareholders to participate appropriately once again in our financial success. And we anticipate a continuation of this dividend development in the coming years.</p>
          <p>As you already know, our full-year results pretty well, let's take a closer look at the fourth quarter of 2011. To make it short, due to the successful conclusion of a record year for Daimler, our unit sales rose by 14% to 596,000 units. All of our divisions contributed with double-digit sales increases. Our group revenue increased by almost &#x20AC;2.7 billion to &#x20AC;29 billion. Our EBIT from ongoing business was &#x20AC;2.2 billion, up 22% over the previous year's result. Despite our ongoing high level of investment in the fourth quarter, we posted an industrial free cash flow of &#x20AC;1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the major developments at our business units. Mercedes-Benz Cars, sales rose by 11% to 376,000 units in the fourth quarter. Revenue was up 7% to &#x20AC;15.1 billion, slightly lagging our sales improvement. We posted an EBIT of &#x20AC;1.2 billion, which corresponds to a margin of 8.2%. Fourth quarter EBIT benefits from higher volume and better pricing, however, it was also influenced by higher material and R&amp;D expenditures, as well as product launch costs.</p>
          <p>Developments at Daimler Trucks are also compelling. Sales were up more than 20% during the last quarter, as well as the revenues at &#x20AC;8.2 billion. Order intake in Q4 2011 was 118,000 units. That's 13% higher than Q4 2010. Despite triple-digit million euro burdens for the launch of the new Actros, Daimler Trucks still reached an EBIT from ongoing business of &#x20AC;554 million with a corresponding clean EBIT margin of 5.5%. All regions of our Truck business contributed to this result.</p>
          <p>At Vans, sales improved by 22%. The division posted an all-time revenue record of &#x20AC;2.7 billion this quarter. EBIT of &#x20AC;256 million was very much supported by strong sales with a return on sales of 9.4%. Thus, the division again exceeded its target margin of 9%. While Buses delivered a very strong quarter with a 13% increases in sales and an EBIT of &#x20AC;109 million, which corresponds to a profit margin of 7.9%.</p>
          <p>For Daimler Financial Services, it was another very good quarter with new business up 21% and contract volumes 13% higher. EBIT from ongoing business improved to &#x20AC;295 million.</p>
          <p>In sum, 2011 proves that we continue to make further progress toward our targeted return rates despite our high level of investment in new products, technologies and markets. With the exception of Daimler Buses, all of our business units improved on their margin of 2010 in 2011.</p>
          <p>Vans and Financial Services have even already reached or surpassed their targeted return for 2013 and there's more to come in the future. We're targeting sustainable growth and top position in all our business areas.</p>
          <p>In doing so, we rely on our key strengths of the Daimler Group namely a unique full-line product portfolio of premium cars, trucks, vans, buses and services, the world-famous Mercedes brand, the anchor of our overall sales success and our competence as the technology leader. We'll bring the potential that results from combining those strengths to bear in the coming years.</p>
          <p>For that, we have defined four strategic growth areas for the individual divisions and the group. First, strength in our core business in traditional markets; second, developing new markets; third, building on our leadership position in green technologies and in safety; and fourth, developing and implementing new mobility concept. Implementation of our strategies in progress in all areas and we will pick up even more speed this year. A key success factor will be the ongoing renewal and extension of our product portfolio. 2012 will show further increases in sales and revenues. At the same time, we keep going with our excellence programs in all divisions. In short, we're staying on track towards our 2013 profitability targets and we continue to invest in the future.</p>
          <p>Next, we expect to accelerate growth due to our full product pipeline with continuous driving for operational excellence at all levels of the value chain to sustain our profitability level. We have set clear, medium and long-term sales targets for each business unit. For MBC, our sales goals are at least 1.6 million cars by 2015, excluding smart and sales leadership among premium manufacturers by 2020.</p>
          <p>At Daimler Trucks, we want to sell significantly more than 500,000 trucks by 2015. For Vans, we are aiming for global sales of more than 400,000 transporters by 2015. For Buses, we are targeting sales of about 40,000 buses by 2015. And for Daimler Financial Services, we plan for growth in line with our industrial business.</p>
          <p>Our group strengths, along with the sound strategies defined in each division such as Mercedes 2020 for MBC and global excellence for Trucks, will help us to meet our ambitious targets. We are confident we have the plans, products and people to get the job done.</p>
          <p>To hear more details of our plans at Mercedes, I invite you to join us at our Mercedes Division Day in Hungary on March 29, where we'll also celebrate the start of production at our new plant.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our outlook for 2012. We expect modest growth in world economy of only about 3% this year. That's mostly due to economic uncertainties in Europe, which affect the auto and commercial vehicles markets. The good news is that U.S. economy is on the mend and growth is still sound in the BRIC countries.</p>
          <p>As outlined this morning, we expect a further sales increase of cars, trucks and vans and ongoing growth in contract volume and new business at Financial Services. At Daimler Buses, we anticipate a slight decrease in sales primarily due to lower demand in Latin America. Furthermore, we will continue to invest in our future in 2012 in new products, new markets and new technologies. Of course, there will also be constraining factors such as higher material costs.</p>
          <p>That said, in the full year 2012, we expect Daimler Group EBIT from ongoing business to be in the magnitude of our record breaking 2011. At our divisions, this means, for Mercedes-Benz Cars, EBIT at the same level as 2011; for Trucks, Vans and Buses, EBIT at or above the 2011 level and for Financial Services, EBIT slightly below the 2011 level.</p>
          <p>All these outlooks are, of course, based on current market expectations and exchange rate environment. Now, we will be happy to answer your questions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry. Good afternoon. Three questions from my end. First of all, could you help us understand on your guidance of flat profit, how you think this will play out through the course of 2012 maybe first half versus second half development knowing that historically, at least, Mercedes typically starts the year rather on a weak side. Now, you are facing a relatively high comparison base in the first half. Is this really in both key divisions Trucks and Mercedes, more optimism on the second half development or is this flat profit development something that you are already seeing in the first half of the year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the truck side, on the Latin American market, you noted minus 10%, minus 15% assumption for the current year. Also here, how big is that going to be a drag for the truck profitability? I think in the last two years, this was one of your most profitable markets. Where do you stand with inventories in the market with Euro III trucks and how do you see the transition going?</p>
          <p>And then finally a question for Mr. Zetsche. You noticed &#x2013; you noted today that Mercedes should be the number one volume &#x2013; sorry, number one premium manufacturer by volume. Now that was stated many times in the last month. Could you help us understand why this is such an explicit goal and is something that Mercedes should be striving for, to be the biggest? I know that you have several side targets at the same time, but don't you fear that three German car manufacturers shooting for the same volume is actually contradicting itself with regards to profitability in the years going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the questions. As you've mentioned for the third question specifically that I should answer it, I guess that the first one should be answered by Bodo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (14:32) to your question, first, I would like you to &#x2013; Mercedes-Benz Cars, of course, you know we have a normal seasonal pattern each and every year. I mean second &#x2013; first quarter is normally the weaker quarter in the year and that holds true also for the year 2012. So, we don't see any specific developments than the ones you see normally in Mercedes-Benz Cars. In trucks, it's a bit different. In trucks, for Europe and for Latin America, we see a soft start. So, the first half of the year should be softer than the second half. Of course and that is something which you will also in the development of the EBIT. Besides this, of course, the NAFTA region is strong, as we also said from a market point of view, 15% to 20%. There, of course, we see a normal pattern also in our market development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding &#x2013; in addition to that, in Brazil, you asked about the inventory, there is a change from the Euro III engine to Euro V from January on. In December, we saw some <mark type="ph" /> prebuy (15:35) effects mainly from the dealers. Now, we see that the inventory of the dealers is going down. So, the first half year will be a little bit softer because now the question is when the Euro III overall stock is gone at &#x2013; from all manufacturers. So, our expectation is that the Euro V demand will start more or less than later, I would say beginning in the second quarter, middle of the second quarter and the effect will be then in the second half year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, in addition, we had a break in our plan because of the final implementation for the Actros new, as you may remind &#x2013; or I can remind you that we are making close launch of the new Actros. We are not &#x2013; we are building the Actros in the same production lines. So, we had to make a shutdown from December until January. So, this will also affect, of course, at least the first model.</p>
          <p>Now, to the third part of your question, I try not to make a long story out of this answer. There, the main issues are that first of all obviously the market value of a company is defined by its profitability and its growth potential, so it's both. And I think in recent years, we were lacking a little bit on the latter part and that's what we are addressing. Technically, when our claim is to be the number one premium manufacturer, it is very difficult to argue how you can justify this position if you make a footnote except for sales. In the end, the customer is the ultimate judge on your competitiveness and as long as we can't define the different segments to be active in them from our peers, which is unrealistic, we then have to be statistically chosen more often by our customers than our peers are on the sales side.</p>
          <p>And there is another aspect, we are talking about B2C business, not B2B, and especially in the premium segment, the customer wants to be associated with a winning brand. And for good or bad reasons, the number of units being sold is the monthly Olympics, which go on in the media, who is the winner or who is the loser, and it will be very difficult to have an ongoing third position in this regard and still suggest to your customer that you're the leading brand to be associated with. Now, to make it very clear, we have no intention whatsoever to buy volume or market share. But we want to further increase our competitiveness. I think we are on a good path to do so and the volume will be an automatic result out of being more competitive than your direct peers. And therefore, you should not be concerned about our profitability targets, which are at the same level as our volume targets and one will not be sacrificed or compromised for the other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I just may &#x2013; may I add on, Mr. Uebber, what you said. Now, a weak first quarter and then profitability building over the year used to be the old Mercedes pattern, and 2011 proved different. So, is 2012 going to be again the same historical pattern in your planning, or in other words, your flat Mercedes guidance really banks then therefore on a much stronger second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jochen, last year, we gave you the example for third and fourth quarter, why they were weaker. So, next year, it will be the traditional pattern that the second and the third quarter are the stronger quarters than the other one &#x2013; the other two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But that does not necessarily mean that the first one is the special weak one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Philippe Houchois [UBS Ltd.].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi ,good afternoon. Two questions, please, or it may be three. The first one is, can you do some discussion in the market about the manufacturing cost of the new Actros? Could you tell us honestly whether this manufacturing cost of the new is actually lower than the replaced model or should you have to struggle with a higher production cost for that vehicle?</p>
          <p>Two, am I right in understanding that if I look at the Q1 production outlook for Trucks, it's going to be down sequentially maybe something like 10% compared to the Q4 volume that you had, but still remain higher than the Q1 2011?</p>
          <p>And the last question would be on dividend, I think you are the only company who does that, we see a dividend from the &#x2013; or a significant one, a number of times in the past, payment from the FinCo to the parent that you use to pay out the dividend to the Daimler shareholders. Let me understand that, is it just a transfer back of liquidity that you &#x2013; an industrial cash you lend to the FinCo when you repatriate to pay the dividend, or is it basically that the  &#x2013; FinCo has only to grow and <mark type="ph" /> not borrow cash (21:12) and is cash negative. So, are you borrowing from the market to pay the dividend? Can you just help me understand that mechanics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do think I'll start with the third question, Philippe. It's a pure equity and profit-related aspect, we steer the Financial Services business with a &#x2013; with roughly a 7% equity ratio, means when the net profit of the Financial Services arm is so high that our equity goes over and above this ratio, including the growth we had in the portfolio, we are separating this equity and return it to the industrial side. That is the case what we are doing. It's not a &#x2013; as we always did over the years, we saw that always and you see that in our bridge, the liquidity bridge, you see this nice element, of course, because it's good to use it for, of course, for the equity and for the industrial part of the business. We do that every year, so it means next year, if we do see another very good development of Financial Services, which I do think we will see, so the &#x2013; over and above, we will generate &#x2013; we will even return next year then to the industrial part. It will be not as high as in 2011.</p>
          <p>There have been moments in the past where the flow was the other way around when we were below this threshold of 7%, but this hopefully should be the exception.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about the new Actros, very short, if you compare Euro V to Euro V, the new Actros is, when it comes to the production cost, lower. Of course, now, we have start-up costs because the volume is very low. But if we then come into full production, the cost will be lower. If you compare Euro V to Euro VI, then you have to add the additional cost, of course, for Euro VI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, of course, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Production volume is in different regions differently. In the U.S., we are much higher compared to the first quarter in 2011. In Europe, it's a little bit lower. But through the inventory we built, sales will be okay at least when I'm looking to January. In Asia, it's also a higher production blend in the first quarter than compared to last year. And in Brazil, it will be also lower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But sequentially, should we be looking at what kind of magnitude of decline in Q1 2012 versus Q4 2011?</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, you've been quite clear about changeover and expansion costs for the whole business in 2012. I mean, one of the reasons it's a transition year. I just wondered whether you'd envisaged those costs falling away to any material extent in 2013 or is the difference that we should think about for next year really mostly predicated on the full availability of new products.</p>
          <p>And second question on trucks, NAFTA is a very big component of your truck business, it was already hitting almost 30% of units and I guess it's getting bigger. Historically, the profitability was quite a bit lower at all stages of the cycle in the U.S. So, I just wondered if NAFTA still &#x2013; is a high NAFTA revenue share still a negative mix issue for the trucks business? How are you getting on with your attempt to sell more in-house components like automated manuals in North America? And I just wonder whether you really see a time when the NAFTA truck market could actually approach or even exceed the profitability of the European market? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your first question, certainly it's correct, we will continue to launch new products at a high cadence, and have high R&amp;D costs to safeguard our future product pipeline. But at the same time, we are clearly benefiting more from the newly launched vehicles, and secondly, the growth of course puts the relative levels of spending into a better or a lower level as far as percentage of R&amp;D spend and CapEx are concerned. In this regard we can consider the 2011-2012 as the peak years of investments into the future on a relative basis, and easier situation in the years to come as far as the bottom line is concerned.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question with NAFTA, after the restructuring program we went through the last couple of years, we have positioned our brands there totally differently and we are on the way to achieve our mid-term profitability target.</p>
          <p>When it comes to 2012, we will see the first effects because thanks to our global footprint, NAFTA is growing, Europe is maybe weak or zero to minus 10% and so NAFTA should be able to compensate the overall situation much better than in the past. So NAFTA has a good chance, it depends of course on the market development like we see it today. With the growth potential, we have a very good chance.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next in line is Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from HSBC. I have got two questions. First of all in your guidance you only referred to the global light vehicle sales, but not specifically to the premium market. So maybe could you give us some guidance what you expect in terms of premium market growth globally for 2012 and could you also say if you aim to outperform the global premium market even in terms of growth?</p>
          <p>Then second question that I have is with regard to price rebates. We heard recently that you have stepped up a bit the incentives on the B-Class and I think also on the E-Class you provide some higher incentives now. So I would like to ask if that is just related to the launch effect at the B-Class that you provide already now somewhat higher incentives here on the B-Class and will that disappear again in the future or will it remain as high as it is now? And maybe you can elaborate in general then on the pricing environment in the premium car market.</p>
          <p>And the last question that I had is you announced yesterday that you have now &#x2013; I mean that Aabar has even increased its stake now in your company. So, will that change anything in the Supervisory Board, so will Aabar be represented in the Supervisory Board now? And can we expect a further increase of its stake maybe to a blocking minority level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Before the last question might create any confusion, I would suggest that Bodo first answer the last question and then I come to the other two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Horst. It's the other way around. Aabar notified that the number of Daimler shares is physically owned by them had decreased to approximately 32.7 million shares, it's equivalent to a shareholding of 3.07% and that is in connection with the respective shareholding notifications we need to have. Aabar also informed us that it has the right to redeliver of the difference between the approximately 32.7 million shares it physically owns and the 96 million shares it originally acquired.</p>
          <p>And in connection with its shareholding, Aabar entered into a series of financing transactions that I do think leads to that confusion. As of February 1, 2012, the new rules require separate incremental disclosures of certain elements of these transactions, which led to double counting with respect to part of the Aabar's total shareholding. Aabar's overall investment remains as it was at 9.04%. They today have no Board seats in the Supervisory Board and of course this transaction will not need that they will be in the Board.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, the first two questions, as you rightfully mentioned, we foresee growth of the total market of about 4%. We expect the premium market to grow at least at this level without quantification, if and to which extent it would be more. What we have said is that we intend to outperform this market growth and that applies to both the volume and the premium market.</p>
          <p>As far as incentives are concerned, overall in 2011, we have seen a lower incentive level than in 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2011 we have seen a lower incentive level than in the third quarter, and our plan for 2012 is to further decrease the level of incentives. And when you go to specific markets, for instance, where they are publicly &#x2013; at least the portion which is publicly seen, noted in the ads, you can see that for instance in the fourth quarter and in December again, we are below our direct peers as far as incentives are concerned in spite of a very strong growth pattern. For instance, January was 25% in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:56).</p>
          <p>So, I think, overall, our incentive development is a very positive one in the sense of declining incentives. Our plan is to continue to do so. That is always related to the lifecycle of the specific vehicles, and when you have a run-out situation in B-Class, you typically will see some pick-up in the specific area, but with the introduction of new B-Class, incentive level will significantly decline, and the improvement in the fourth quarter and the foreseen improvement in the first quarter 2012 relates for instance to the introduction of the new M-Class and the B-Class specifically. So, overall the situation looks pretty encouraging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could you might quantify to which extent incentives have moved down in 2011 versus 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not specify these numbers because they are highly competitive, I wonder if that would even be an antitrust issue. So you won't get an answer there. I can tell you that our net pricing in 2011 has increased.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next in line is Stuart Pearson, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Stuart Pearson at Morgan Stanley. Just to come back to Mercedes, just to help us understand that guidance, a couple of questions, just firstly, while we are on the topic of pricing, just I was a little surprised to hear that you expect to improve pricing again in 2012, especially given the increased competition that you will see on the C-Class from the new 3-Series and I guess <mark type="ph" /> with the A4 (32:28). So I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what you assume on pricing on that car segment, also the E-Class, I can understand it'd be positive on some of the newer models, but just how conservative you are being on pricing on those models?</p>
          <p>And following on from that, what you are seeing in terms of the European demand and European orders? I know Audi this morning saying having record order backlog in Germany, so just a little bit of color there. And then of course, over to China, obviously we saw your sales flat in January, easy to understand the local production sales being flat, but it looks &#x2013; although we don't have the full data, but it looks roughly like import's flat as well. So maybe you could share with us what you are assuming for China for total growth there and also for the imports part of that business?</p>
          <p>And then finally just on currency, or maybe just update us on where the <mark type="ph" /> long (33:15) dollar and renminbi position you plan on for 2012 and 2013, how much of that is currently hedged and when that hedging was most recently done? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, starting with the incentives again, of course, we are not talking just about a top-down target and then wonder whether it will happen, but on the other hand, just the opposite, we collect, with a general guidance of trying to decrease our incentive levels, the bottom-up data from all markets relative to all product segments. And therefore, of course we are aware who will launch, where, what product against us and what's the kind of impact that might have on our competitiveness and pricing capacity.</p>
          <p>Talking specifically about the C-Class, we see the react &#x2013; the market react to the facelift of our C-Class like to a new product. So, we have excellent demand for the C-Class across the board; that applies to the sedan, to the station wagon. We never had shares of the station wagon compared to our sedan and compared to the station wagon sales of Audi and BMW, which were specifically high in the case of Audi, as good as they are today, and the new Coup&#xE9; has been a very strong pull from day one. So at that point of time, our sales performance in the C-Class is defined by our plant capacities, which is a good situation and certainly diminish the impact of a totally new 3-Series, but it's existing and we calculate it within our forward planning.</p>
          <p>The second topic was the European situation, as far as order backlog is concerned and so on. We have altogether obviously had a strong position in Germany in December, as far as market share is concerned, and we see a good position in Germany going forward. You know, we explained that to you in the past, that we are in a three, four-year strategy of addressing our sales channels in Germany. We were by far too much dependent on rental business and on employee sales, company cars, and not sufficiently on company fleet and retail private business. We have addressed that; we have grown significantly the latter channel and diminished the first ones, which of course altogether had some limiting factor on our overall market share development. But that's intentionally, and it's a good thing because it improves our resale values and our overall pricing capacity in Germany.</p>
          <p>As far as China is concerned, we do expect the market to again show double digit growth at lower level than in the past year especially as far as the premium segment is concerned. So we still see an over-proportionate growth in the premium segment, but it was extremely high in the last year compared to the volume growth. In this environment we plan to have at least this growth or better and we think that's realistic market share gain, that's what we are shooting for in China. We had relatively weak January as you have noted. But this was no surprise to us whatever because of a number of one time effects, fantastic December shutdown in our plants, so no supply, some custom issues. So a number of specific issues for January and we expect February to be in line with our overall expectation again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Coming to your last question with regard to currency and how much we are hedged, in 2012 we are 85% hedged for the U.S. dollar, for 2013 45%, and we have a base hedge for 2014. The 10 percentage point of the 2012, 85% we hedged in the last four weeks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question we take from Thierry Huon, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. It's Thierry Huon speaking from Exane. To come back to the forex situation, I noted this morning that you said that your forex impact was negative in 2011. Could you quantify this impact? And could you tell us what you are expecting for 2012 given what you just said? And I also wonder what would be the trend for the capitalized R&amp;D in the next two years, for &#x2013; I mean for this year and for 2013? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thierry, to your question, for the total year, the currency effect was and we disclosed it in the presentation in the breakout for total Daimler negative minus &#x20AC;194 million, thereof Mercedes-Benz Cars &#x20AC;243 million. That is with regard of course to many currencies, but the main impact is coming by cars from the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>For 2012, we've said we have based our guidance on the current exchange rate environment which is currently 1.32. So, as we did our guidance, honestly it was 1.30 around. If it would stay with 1.30, the currency we would &#x2013; we would see on the current hedge book of 85% and having 15% open, we would expect a positive development of &#x20AC;300 million to &#x20AC;400 million. If you take 1.35, we would see &#x20AC;100 million positive compared to the 2000 &#x2013; to 2011, but there is current sensitivity.</p>

          <p>Okay. Next question comes from Daniel Schwarz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. First question on trucks, order situation at Daimler in Europe seems much better than for your Scandinavian peers. Is it mainly a currency effect that gives you a competitive advantage, the same maybe for <mark type="ph" /> pickup, (40:44) where also order picked up in Q4 that had to relative to your Scandinavian peers?</p>
          <p>And second question on U.S. trucks, you recently announced hiring of additional employees in the U.S. In which quarter do you expect production to peak in 2012, or is it a sequential increase quarter-by-quarter? And this morning in the press conference, you mentioned a Chinese investor has above 1% in Daimler, below 5%. Is it &#x2013; did that happen lately or is it far away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, maybe to your last question, the investor, that's half a year ago, roughly the period after <mark type="ph" /> the stake (41:29).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Schwarz, your questions toward order intake situation, indeed, we have, from our point of view, a more sustainable development there. And, of course, in these numbers, order intake for Mercedes-Benz Trucks is also the order intake of rest of world, where we have all &#x2013; we had in the past, and we have now a very good position in some other markets that helps us here. So, we see there also in January the same trend. It's not that I'm satisfied totally, but I'm not unsatisfied with the order intakes in Europe.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the U.S., when do we achieve the peak in the production? It's more or less a sequential increase over the quarters because we have to ramp-up all the things when you hire new people that go on. So this will be, over the quarters, a ramp-up.</p>
          <p>And there was one question before. I forgot to answer the penetration rate, I hope the caller is still is still on the phone. The penetration rate in the United States is for heavy-duty engines around 90%, very successful. In Actros, we are between 30% and 40% in an increased mode. And we have still some potential for the upcoming years in transmissions and, of course, in the medium-side engines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's &#x2013; in Europe, it's not that you experience that Volvo and Scania are much less competitive on the pricing side than they were in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if I'm able to answer any pricing question <mark type="ph" /> about those two trucks (42:52). But it's very clear that the pricing pressure here is in Europe still ongoing, what surprised us in the development of last year, at least. We had in the first half of the year, some loss in market share <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:15). And so, it's &#x2013; the pricing pressure and the competitor &#x2013; competitive situation is still very severe.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, we take Fraser Hill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. It's Fraser Hill from Bank of America. I just wanted to return to the trucks that you talked about NAFTA compensating for &#x2013; from a margin perspective for the weakness in LatAm and in Europe. What does that, therefore, imply in terms of the NAFTA margin relative to your target for that business? And is all the improvement in the profitability level in NAFTA in 2012 in your mind just coming from the operational gearing or are we actually seeing some benefits from your restructuring coming through there?</p>
          <p>Further on trucks, looking at Fuso, where did you get to in terms of margins on Fuso? How close are you to this I think it was 5.5% margin target? And do you still reiterate your intention to deliver that margin or take a more radical strategic approach to Fuso later in 2012?</p>
          <p>Second question, if I could, just on vans. Obviously very impressive margins and the revenue growth has been surprising positively. So what's actually driving the margin up to this 9.5% level? Again, is there a mix dynamic here or is it, again, just a very strong volume coming through? And how should we think about the further revenue growth in 2012 from a product and geographic perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question about NAFTA truck market, very simple. It's, of course, the result of our restructuring or realignment program that we put through the organization in the last couple of years. Without that we would be not in the situation where we're in. This is not only the cost question. Cost is one thing. We decreased it. If you remember, we opened a second facility in Mexico and a lot of other things.</p>
          <p>But it's also the question how we position our trucks there. In the meantime, we are very clearly the fuel-efficiency leader. That means we put also investment into our products. And in the same mind, we increased our after-sales business including our increased penetration rate. So, all this together, opened us the potential to have of course a higher volume, that helps, but with a total different cost basis. So, the question there is very simple and the challenges that we are able to make it sustainable and to have a sustainable profitability over the years. And we will see now in the year 2012, when we are coming close to a normal year condition, that we are going to achieve step-by-step in the midterm our regional benchmark position in the United States.</p>
          <p>Fuso was, despite the big disaster we had there, positive, very simple. The fourth quarter was very good. It was of course something that &#x2013; if you &#x2013; when you stop &#x2013; when you have to stop three to four months' production, then you are ramping up again. So, you can see it also in the Japanese market development. We have a very good position in Southeast Asia with Fuso, Indonesia and other markets. And we will see this year, we are not disclosing, as you know, the results or our forecasts on division level, but it will be profitable and on the way to achieve the margin you mentioned before.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as vans are concerned, let me state two main issues. One is in the van business, we have a cycle which is about 10 year rather than six, seven years in major renewals, which based on two main product lines now give you longer phases of strong harvesting with good cash conversion rates and so on. We are definitely in this phase after the last facelift of the Vito and Viano. We are now in a very, very competitive situation product-wise. Quality is finally perfect from our plant in Spain. So, we were able to gain almost two percentage points market share with Vito and Viano while maintaining our pricing discipline, perhaps even improving it.</p>
          <p>At the same time, this enabled us to be even more selective on the Sprinter side, again based on a very strong product, accepting a slight market share decline, which we will recover this year, and at the same time, further improving our sales contribution with these products. So, strong product, good timing in the cycle. That is the one answer to your question.</p>
          <p>But the other one is that van is the perfect example for the benefits of Daimler. The van business strongly benefits from the overall modular strategy on the car side. And uses, of course, with its driveline components but beyond the overall box we have for components for our Mercedes cars. But on the downstream side, it has basically the unique opportunity versus their peers to use a strong car sales network and a strong commercial sales network to address the private and the commercial customers. And that is the absolute unique situation. That's why I'm convinced that our van business is, by far, more profitable than the one of any competitor.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question we take from Christian Breitsprecher.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Macquarie. I would like to go back to the fourth quarter result in the truck business, which was at the face of it rather weak in terms of margin. I know most of it is &#x2013; that is related to the Actros switchover. But could you put again some numbers behind it? How much was the burden in the fourth quarter, how much of it was related to the shutdown of the <mark type="ph" /> Wert (49:34) plant, and how much of the headwind do we face in the first quarter 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like we said already, I think it was the third quarter as well. We have &#x20AC;300 million impact of the launch of the Actros mainly in the second half year and two-third of it was in the fourth quarter. And you'll see the same &#x2013; we will see the same dimension of cost in 2012 through the year because we are launching a whole family. And this is done every &#x2013; whatever, 10 to 12 years, so <mark type="ph" /> to clash the two (50:18), like we call it internally, that means the delivery truck will stop this year and then we can see the effects also through 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And this &#x20AC;300 million in 2012 is been evenly spread out over the year or is it primarily hitting the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It will be spread out through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the shutdown of <mark type="ph" /> Wert (50:31) from mid-December to mid-January, is that included in this &#x20AC;300 million or is this the lack of contribution of that phase coming on top?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The impact in December was not as high because we produced the trucks before. Like we said, the production outcome in January as compared to last year for example a little bit lower because we had to start production two weeks later. So, the impact, like I said before, will be in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then that's kind of coming on top of the &#x20AC;300 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because of this large contribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question, we take from Stephen Reitman [Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of <mark type="ph" /> unifying (51:26) your overall retail distribution activities there between the import organization and the domestic manufacturing organization?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a question on the guidance on Mercedes passenger cars. You &#x2013; I've noted what you've about you expect to grow your unit sales faster than the 4% growth you expect for overall vehicle sales growth worldwide. You also mentioned that you've also quantified the impact of currency if we have the planning rates of 130. We know you have headwinds of about &#x20AC;200 million or so over and above the headwinds you booked in 2011 relating to the sort of likely change over the whole A&amp;B story and the like. So, I'm just wondering if you could just give us some more granularity in your thinking of where the risks are or what actually prevents you being more positive on earnings developments for 2012 for Mercedes passenger cars? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you please give us the first half of your first question? I only heard something "respective our owned and third-party retail business," but I don't know what your question really was. It started &#x2013; the translation started only later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course. My understanding is that there had been some issues relating your distribution strategy in China relating to some lack of discipline on pricing between imported vehicles and locally manufactured vehicles. And I know you've been working quite hard to try to fix this issue. I just wondered if you can give us some updates on your progress in that respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. As far as China is concerned, you know that we had two total independently working sales organizations for imported cars and for locally produced cars. They were obviously working with the same brand and the same dealer distribution but on different channels with different agencies and not aligned processes and targets.</p>
          <p>That was not a good situation. We've addressed that and have been able to form a virtual integrated sales organization which is now much better aligned. This has helped us already considerably to work on the pricing capability, on the discipline, and the dealer network, on the right mix between the different products and all of that. So, the development in the second half of 2011 was very promising, doesn't mean that we totally overcame this issue by now but we are very optimistic that we will see further progress in this regard. Ultimately, we are targeting a legally unified sales organization. But that's obviously, in this environment, a task which takes some time to be realized.</p>
          <p>On the second part of your question, we have said that, yes, we see good growth potential for 2012 for the pass car business. On the other hand, and we mentioned this since quite some time that in our own cycle, seven-year cycle, 2011 and 2012 are the most challenged <mark type="indiscernible" /> (55:04) years that we have, lots of spending into further expansion of the product portfolio of CO2 reduction, all of that, while the benefit, the harvest of the spending we made is not fully available. This will then be much better in 2013, 2014, years to come. That's why we called 2012 a transition year. We do believe that shooting for a flat earning at this high level of &#x20AC;5.2 billion is an ambitious task to go for. We see &#x2013; and I don't want to go in too much detail, for instance, the incremental burden on the raw material side which we think we can offset with the commercial productivity gains. But, on top of that, we have content increases, mainly driven by CO2 activities &#x2013; CO2 reduction &#x2013; reducing activities, of course and some further value enhancements of the vehicle which we will not be able to fully compensate by our continuous improvement on the technical and commercial side on the bill of material. And, you mentioned already the forex aspect which in spite of all our hedging will still be some burden. So, putting all of that together, we do believe that we can repeat the strong earning of this year and go for 10% return in 2013, which was our target all the time, which we confirm.</p>

          <p>So, next in line is Arndt Ellinghorst [Credit Suisse].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I thought that was a positive.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, everyone, and good afternoon. Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Just a quick question on your actual &#x2013; yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Arndt, would you give me just one chance? I was not quite correct as far as forex is concerned. With the more recent incremental hedging which was already mentioned, we are now rather able to have a slight benefit from forex compared to 2011 than a disadvantage. So, I didn't want to leave that in the room. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Dr. Zetsche. My first question was on your actual visibility in your order book and whether you could give us probably by division how much of a visibility you actually have in Mercedes Trucks, Vans, and Buses if you look at your orders. And, then secondly, I think the surprise of the day is how confident you are on Mercedes, especially you mentioned positive net pricing, positive volume effect for this year. Your mix should also be quite positive this year. So, what was it really that let you to go for a flat earnings performance of Mercedes in 2012? Thank you. These are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the questions. As far as the first question is concerned, the visibility based on orders is especially high on the Truck side because almost all sales are related to orders, whereas in the &#x2013; I'm not talking about assessing the order level but just how much do we learn from order income. On the Car side, the portion of cars being sold basically from stock from the dealer is increasing for the whole industry over the world. And, therefore, orders give us less and less clear indications. Still, we see a strong confidence of our sales organization based on the order intake, the new products as I mentioned already, B and M-Class but as much, for instance, the strong C-Class and other segments clearly contributing to that level of confidence which definitely supports our positive attitude towards 2012. Andreas will, in a second, add to Trucks and Buses. I could add for Vans still that we had very high order intake in January and the very positive story of 2011, at least for the time being, seems to continue in 2012.</p>
          <p>Your second question, I think I partially tried to address by answering the question before. But, I can try to briefly repeat. We have volume increase. We are confident that we can overall improve, not dramatically but slightly, our net pricing capability. We do not see a positive mix development because we see now increase based on, first, the B-Class and later in the year the A-Class availability, increase of the compact segment in our total sales. But, as I mentioned before, mostly the very high R&amp;D levels which contribute a significant piece of incremental cost in 2012 versus 2011; secondly, the content increase in 2012 versus 2011 per vehicle; and thirdly, to a lesser degree, raw material increases which we still see in &#x2013; for the total company in a magnitude of up to &#x20AC;400 million, major building blocks of this cost pressure which we have to overcome by higher revenues and, of course, by productivity gains we are working on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your question in addition on the Truck side and Bus side; on the Truck side, more or less in all the different regions, where we are looking into orders from customers that means besides Brazil because there the wholesale is the same thing like order. We are looking into April already in all the divisions. In the U.S., it's between May and June already so that's the reason we are increasing there the capacity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The question &#x2013; okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as in the Bus side, it's traditional, a very slow start because, as you know, public &#x2013; or cities overall are ordering buses mainly through the end of the year. But, it's more or less the same. The lower production volume &#x2013; the <mark type="ph" /> blend (61:48) lower production volume in the first quarter is also already filled.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I'm asking this question because, obviously, you came out with a pretty confident guidance for the full year and it's becoming clear that it's geared towards the second half of this year. And, I'm trying to understand how much is actually really already filled with orders that gives you that confidence for a relatively high hurdle to beat for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Arndt, if you look to the whole world, it's driven by the United States because there we have, of course, very order intake when you look to the first quarter. It's &#x2013; also in Europe, it's not as weak as a lot of whatever colleagues have expected. So, we see us on the way that, with the order intake, we can fulfill what we told today in the morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have time left for one more question here. We'll take Kristina Church, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. It's Kristina Church from Barclays Capital. Just a couple of questions; firstly, just coming back to the Mercedes walk-down. Obviously, with revenues up significantly and EBIT flat, you're assuming that EBIT margin will be down year-on-year. I was just wondering how much growth you do need on the revenue side in order to achieve that flat EBIT given all the costs that you're talking about? The second question is back to Stuart's point on China, but more specifically just on the China Financial Services business, I was wondering what your growth expectations are there. Are you expecting Financial Services to become a much more important part of China &#x2013; the China growth story or will it still be very small in the early days? And, then finally, on Trucks, I just wanted to clarify whether your guidance &#x2013; or your outlook for the market in Europe was for it to be flat &#x2013; or for it to be flat to down 10%. And, if the European market were down percent &#x2013; were down 10%, would you still expect to have a flat Trucks EBIT? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To your &#x2013; to the first part of your question, as we said, our flat earning guidance is based of &#x2013; on the assumption of market development of about 4%-plus and sales performance which is at least at this level, with the ambition to slightly improve market share. So that's our top-line assumption we are making, certainly on top of that, defined by our forex assumption which we mentioned as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kristina, coming to your question of China Financial Services business; of course, it's decisive that we are supporting in this market &#x2013; in this growing market, also the industrial side, no doubt. We will grow in the vicinity of more &#x2013; I expect more than the growth &#x2013; more than the industrial side because we will also increase our penetration there &#x2013; it's a young market &#x2013; where we developed 2010 to 2015 from 10% penetration to roughly 50%. And that will of course further grow. To keep it going, of course, we need to organize our financing. Financing is something which you know that in China got regulated, so to say, last year. We have some ideas how to work together with some other banks on the one hand, and we were starting off our leasing business, again, with a different structure would give us a possibility to even grow in that segment even more.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kristina, to your other question, when European market is going down 10% and you said flat EBIT, it's the target and it's included in this kind of statement.</p>
