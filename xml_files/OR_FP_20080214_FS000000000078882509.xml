          <p>Good morning, to everyone. The presentation of L'Oreal's 2007 Financial Results includes some figures relating to our sales as already presented on the 24th of January, as well as information on our financial results, cash flow situation and balance sheet and dividend.</p>
          <p>Our consolidated sales amounted to &#x20AC;17.63 billion, up 8% like-for-like, 8.1% is the reported sales figure and 11.6% is the growth figure excluding the exchange rate impact. The favorable external growth impact of 3.6% resulting mainly from the full year consolidation of The Body Shop and the acquisition of distributors of professional products in the USA, Beauty Alliance and Maly's West.</p>
          <p>The external growth impact was almost entirely offset by a negative exchange rate impact due to a strong euro.</p>
          <p>Sales by branch and division, Professional Products first of all, grew by 7.5% like-for-like, Consumer Products up 7.9%, Luxury Products grew by 8.4%, Active Cosmetics plus 10.8%, The Body Shop plus 5.7%. Dermatology &#x2013; Galderma which is a 50% consolidated company in our financial statements increased it sales by 12.7%.</p>
          <p>Per geographic zone in Western Europe, growth like-for-like was 4.1%, in North America growth was 4.8% and the Rest of the World Zone experienced another year of very sustained growth at plus 17.9%. We should note that the Rest of the World now accounts for 29.3% of our overall sales figure in cosmetics.</p>
          <p>We are now offering more detailed analysis of the sales figures in the Rest of the World zone. Cosmetic sales in Asia excluding Japan grew very strongly at 17.8% like-for-like. Japan this year has grown by plus 1.8% and Latin America the growth figure was 14.6%, in Eastern Europe growth grew faster to reach 29.4% and in the other countries growth exceeded 15%.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to consolidating the P&amp;L accounts. The L'Or&#xE9;al group included for the first time on a full year basis Body Shop, as well as distributors of professional products in American hair salons.</p>
          <p>In order to facilitate the analysis and compare ability of the group's performance in 2007, we have chosen to present first of all, the P&amp;L account, to consolidated the P&amp;L accounts on the &#x2013; with the same scope of consolidation excluding in fact, the full year consolidation of The Body Shop and the introduction into the consolidation scope of American distributors of professional products, because in fact, these two activities are very different by nature when it comes to the structure of their income statements, very different from the L'Or&#xE9;al Company.</p>
          <p>We have also seen that there were a number of profits to be derived from distributors' stocks that had to be eliminated, so &#x20AC;21 million we're talking here of course, of one-time costs. You can see on the first line of the table that the sales amounted to &#x20AC;16,110 million. Gross margin was established at 71.5% of the sales, up 20 basis points compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>Before we make comments on the accounts, we should first of all, focus on the gross margin. In 2007, the gross margin was particularly impacted by the negative exchange rates. We've calculated that a bit over three quarters of the exchange gains and losses recorded a bit lower down on the table and the penalty on that line 78% to be precise are impacting the gross margin.</p>
          <p>If we restate this factor, if we reallocate to the gross margin in 2006 and in 2007, the corresponding amount of exchange gains and losses, it appears very clearly that the gross margin improved quite a lot. There was an increase of 50 basis points between 2006 and 2007 for this gross margin.</p>
          <p>And this analysis in fact, shows that the gross margin has been improving regularly, as a result of our continuous efforts to enhance the product value to keep ingredient purchasing and packaging costs under control and to increase the productivity of our plants.</p>
          <p>Let us now talk once again about the consolidated P&amp;L accounts. The research and development cost has remained stable as a percentage of the sales at 30.5%. Promotional and other advertising expenses accounted in 2007 for 30.7% of the sales &#x2013; an equivalent figure. We have the same for 2006. This stability factor corresponds to an increase in the volumes invested and this is fueled by an improvement in the costs, management methods, and in particular, this is due to better sales conditions in this media.</p>
          <p>Sales and administrative costs amounted to 20.2% of the sales to be compared to 20.5% in 2006. So, this is another year of gradual improvement and this is the outcome of the efforts we've made to curb our costs, to group our teams and optimize our purchases in terms of exchange gains and losses that we saw again of &#x20AC;10 million in 2007 after a loss of 56 million in 2006.</p>
          <p>Let me remind you, it's an important factor, our currency hedging policy is not speculative, it's only purpose is to ensure to business units and plants a fixed transaction rate, which is known a year in advance, which is a fixed rate. And that helps our businesses to keep operations under control. Just as an indication, L'Oreal on average coverage its dollar flows in 2007 to the tune of 1.25 and for 2008 the fixed rate is 1.36.</p>
          <p>Lastly, the operating profit was $2.762 million, up 11.3% from last year. It amounts to 17.1% of the sales, and this is a considerable improvement, up 90 basis points this year.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop now. The overall sales figure for The Body Shop in 2007 amounted to &#x20AC;787 million. The Body Shop was consolidated only as of the 1st of July, 2006. So, we do not have to date a full 2006 year of operations that could be compared to 2007. We consider, however, that the 2007 profitability figure which is 8.1% of the sales is stable if we look at our estimation of the full year 2006 level.</p>
          <p>Now, for the sake of exhaustively, we should now look at the consolidated P&amp;L account, including The Body Shop and the distribution of Professional Product. In the USA, the sales is up 8.1% and the margin grew by 8%. Let me also remind you that the evolution of expenses as a percentage of sales is not significant because we can't really compare the two years. The operating profit has increased by 11.3% which is an improvement of 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>Let us now look at the operating profits by branch and by division. Each of our divisions, first of all, experienced a strong increase in the profitability in 2007. Professional Products, first of all, from 20.8% to 21% of overall sales and the figure excluding American distributors is 22.5%; Consumer Products from 18 to 19.1%; Luxury Products from 20.6 to 21.5%; Active Cosmetics from 19.6 to 20.5%.</p>
          <p>The Body Shop. It is very difficult to compare year-on-year because &#x2013; for 2006, we only included the second half and also, as you know, most of the business' profit is achieved in the second half every year for this type of business. If you look at the Dermatology branch, Galderma &#x2013; Galderma has experienced a slight decrease in its profitability in 2007 at 16.9% of its overall sales and this is due to sustained investment in the R&amp;D area, especially in the first half.</p>
          <p>Now, the rate of return or the profitability of each geographic zone has also increased significantly in 2007. In Western Europe, from 21.8 to 22.5%, in North America from 18.8 to 19.3% and even 20.1% excluding American distributors, and the Rest of the World Zone continues its very swift growth from 14.5 to 16.6% of the sales.</p>
          <p>You will note that it is the profitability of this Rest of the World zone, which once again has grown the most in 2007. And for the first time, this year in absolute value it even reached the level of North America at &#x20AC;773 million.</p>
          <p>From the operating profits we're now moving to the net profit excluding non-recurrent items and you know, that this in fact, has always been at the basis for the calculation of our earning per share.</p>
          <p>The cost of our financial debt has increased from 116 million to &#x20AC;174 million in 2007. And this is in fact, the outcome or the consequence of the funding of the acquisitions that we've made the increase in the interest rates both in the United States and in Europe. And this is also the outcome of the continuation of our share buyback scheme. The Sanofi-Aventis' dividend amounted to &#x20AC;250 million, up 15% compare to 2006.</p>
          <p>For 2008, you will have noted that Sanofi-Aventis announced on Monday an increase of its dividend per share of 18.3%. The result before tax increased by 9.8 %, the tax burden amounted to &#x20AC;855 million as a whole. The tax rate in 2007 was established at 29.5% down from 2006, where the figure was 30.4%. For 2008, we may anticipate another slight decrease in the over all Group tax rate.</p>
          <p>In total, excluding minority interest, the net result excluding, non-recurring items exceeded &#x20AC;2 billion to reach &#x20AC;2.39 billion, up 11.2%. And by, including the accretive effect of the share buyback, the net earning per share amounted to &#x20AC;3.36, up 13%. And at the end of the P&amp;L account, after taking into account the non-recurring items, particularly the capital gained from the sale of the Sanofi-Aventis shares that took place on the 14th of November 2007.</p>
          <p>The net results for the group share reached &#x20AC;2.656 billion, up almost 29%. The negative exchange rate impact on the result was rather large in 2007, and we would like to present here the evolution of our different result levels with the same exchange rate; in other words, we will have 2006 restated with the 2007 rates. On this basis the sales increased by 11.6%, the operating profit grew by 14.5% and as you can see on the last line, the net earning per share increase by 15.9%, which is a growth of almost 3% more than the reported figure.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the cash flows, the cash flow amounted to &#x20AC;2.720 billion, a growth of almost 13%, slightly higher than profits &#x2013; the profit level. The change in the working capital requirement remained very limited at &#x20AC;76 million. Investments to the tune of &#x20AC;776 million have decreased slightly as a percentage of the overall sales, 4.5% against 4.7% in 2006 and after payment of the dividends, which have grown by 14.5%, after buying stakes to the tune of almost &#x20AC;604 million, after selling Sanofi-Aventis shares to the tune of &#x20AC;1.465 billion, and after the share buyback scheme for &#x20AC;1 billion, our cash flow has improved by &#x20AC;1 billion.</p>
          <p>Let us look at the balance sheet. The balance sheet is particularly robust. Shareholders' equity account for 59% of the total assets. It's a slight decrease compared to 2006, minus 7%, and this decrease results from the statement of the Sanofi-Aventis, the market value, the impact of the shares buyback plan, and also the currency exchange rate impact.</p>
          <p>Now, let us look at the gearing, the net debt amounted to &#x20AC;2.273 billion on the 31st of December, 2007, down almost &#x20AC;1 billion compared to the 31st of December, 2006. Our gearing ratio has decreased significantly to reach 17.4%. And the dividend, plus point, once again, we have a strongly growing dividend that will be presented to the general shareholders' meeting at &#x20AC;1.38 per share. In other words, it's an increase of 17% compared to 2006. And the dividend distribution rate will continue to grow regularly to reach 41.1% after the results.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. I think this was very clear. Now, we are going to innovate a bit, before I give the floor to the people in charge of the divisions. For the first time, we will be talking about a cost topic, i.e. operations.</p>
          <p>And I told you that we would be talking a bit about the reorganization of our supply chain. In fact, with Jean-Philippe Blanpain, we thought it might be more interesting to speak about operations as a whole, because he joined operations at the end of the year. So, Jean-Philippe Blanpain is the new President in charge of operations and supply chain, charge of the industrial part, to speak about our projects, what we've done and our prospects in the area of operations at L'Oreal.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jean-Paul. Good morning to everyone. For me it's a first and the enjoyment of a first meeting, so it is with special pleasure that I will be sharing our ambitions in the area of operations.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we sold 4.3 billion units of which 95% were produced in our 34 cosmetic plants and distributed through our 150 distribution centers. Up until '95, these sites were organized per country, whatever the technology. Since 1995, we have been specializing our plants per technology in each of the divisions, while the distribution centers remained under the authority of each country.</p>
          <p>The simplification of production associated to the productivity of logistics has given good results, because we multiplied by three the number of units per plant and you'll see that 2007 was also a very good year. But the globalization of our brands has led us to strengthen the central role of operations structured around 3 very simple principals.</p>
          <p>Operations are deployed in four geographic zones to assist the specific development of each market: Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. In each of the areas, operations are integrated from the client to the supplier under the sole authority of an Operations Director within each division. Operations are optimized everywhere along three major activities: procurement, production and distribution.</p>
          <p>You will have understood that we remain faithful to our permanent restructuring method. These principals are in line with the industrial policy which has made us successful. But it opens up new and durable prospectives for each of the activities.</p>
          <p>Procurement, first of all, in 2006 as you know, packaging purchases were centralized in seven sourcing centers, which enabled us to compensate for the increase in raw material. We will reduce their number from 7 to 4 and increase their parameter to other categories of purchases: industrial equipment, raw material and promotional articles and subcontractors.</p>
          <p>And we are preparing to apply the organization, which has proven successful for an amount of 4.3 billion, three times the present parameter. And a new procurement center located in Asia will be responsible for trading of our supplies in this area. We will be able to better enhance the value of growing opportunities in this area that we have just begun to develop with new suppliers in China, of course, but India, also Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In production, the main leverage remains the specialization of the sites, which was begun several years ago. If you consider the number of technologies per plant, we estimate that the ratio should tend to 1.8 in the long-term. You understand that the simplification process can continue in all the areas and the associated profits are far from depleted.</p>
          <p>Beyond this specialization, the intrinsic productivity of our sites remains very solid, supplied with a succession of innovative processes in all of the areas: care, make-up, coloring, shampoo. For shampoos, for instance, we told you about a new process, which increases productivity from 42 to 100 tons per day on the same tank. This new process has not been deployed everywhere yet. And we already have a new process, which will soon produce some 200 tons a day on the similar tank. So, this production spiral is not due to chance. In three years we were able to improve productivity per person by 22% and we keep very promising prospectives in this area.</p>
          <p>Finally, we are looking into possible targeted partnerships with a limited number of subcontractors when they represent an opportunity for our old sites. In fact, we're looking at subcontracting as an additional opportunity to simplify our plans to increase their productivity and their capacity and in the end, to reduce our internal cost and this is the case, for instance, for small make-up series.</p>
          <p>In the area of distribution, optimization involves integrating information flows. This is what specialists call swapping inventory for information. The good news is that we launched at the end of 2005 a major IT cooling project for our operations under SAP. The ISIS project standardizes 90% of production and flow functions on a same platform in each zone.</p>
          <p>We already cover 30% of volume in the USA and Europe, and we will reach the 50% mark in 2008. ISIS is an essential factor in standardizing our practice, integrating with our clients and suppliers and simplifying information flows.</p>
          <p>To illustrate this, I have represented present information flows between the consumer products, subsidiaries in Asia and our plants in Asia, in Europe and the US.</p>
          <p>The association of integrated IT and our operations organized in four zones will bring greater simplification of our trade and we will move to an era where each subsidiary deals directly with each plant and this will lead to major benefits in terms of service cost and inventory.</p>
          <p>But the creation of a cost cutting operations directorate also enables us to globalize our physical distribution. In Europe, for instance, we had 72 distribution centers in 2004, in 2008 we have 49. This means a cost reduction and better service, of course, but it also means less mileage traveled and hence a better environmental footprint. As for the specialization of the plants, we will also continue the simplification of our distribution in each zone.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, as you see, we are working simultaneously on all issues in all zones and we have improvement prospects which are major and durable for each of them. And we are confident in our ability to further optimize operations, further reduce costs, improve our gross margins, strengthen our driving resources and control costs. And I would like to thank you for your attention and thank all of the operations people without whom nothing would have been possible.</p>
