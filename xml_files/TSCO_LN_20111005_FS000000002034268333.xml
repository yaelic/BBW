          <p>Right. Welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining us today for our interim results. We'll be starting this morning with Philip Clarke, who will be giving an update on the six immediate objectives we set out in April. And Philip will be followed by Laurie, Laurie McIlwee that is, who'll be taking you through the numbers. And after that, we'll be pleased to take your questions.</p>
          <p>I'm delighted that today we've announced record sales and record profits. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for coming.</p>
          <p>My presentation today is a progress report. Six months ago, I was just a few weeks into my new job. I already had a strong sense of what we needed to focus on, and I set some immediate objectives for my team. I said those objectives, those six, would be what we expected to be judged upon in the future. Today, I think we can point to tangible evidence of progress, of change in the business, and a willingness to take firm action where it is needed. There will, I can assure you, be more to come.</p>
          <p>The economic and consumer background, of course, has been pretty tough. It's an achievement to have made top-line and bottom-line progress against some strong headwinds, particularly at home here in the UK. I have been most pleased with the way the Tesco team has focused on customers, getting on their side, doing what we can to help hard-pressed families. It's also a time when the geographic breadth and diversity of the Group is a real strength for us.</p>
          <p>To begin my update, first of all, let me remind you of what those six objectives are. First, keeping the UK strong and growing, it's top of the list. Second, we want to be outstanding internationally, not just successful. Third, as the combination of stores and online becomes compelling for customers, we aim to become a multichannel retailer wherever we trade.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we'll deliver on the potential of Retailing Services, of which the bank plays a very big part. Fifth, we'll be applying Group skill and scale because this can add more value and competitive advantage to our businesses wherever they are in the world. And sixth, after a decade of investments in building the platforms for growth, we're targeting higher returns on capital for our shareholders. It's already begun, it's arrived and expected to continue, even in the current challenging environment.</p>
          <p>These then are our immediate management objectives, the things we're putting focus on in the business right now. I'll go through each of them in turn, starting with the UK.</p>
          <p>Market conditions here remain challenging, reflecting the <mark type="ph" /> wellingness (2:57) of pressures on household finances. These pressures have not abated in recent months. In fact, in some respects they've intensified. For example, customers are consistently highlighting that the rising cost of living from foods to fuel to utility bills is putting further pressure on their disposable incomes. Although customers have proven resilient and creative in coping with these challenges, the effects are clear on their willingness and their ability to spend.</p>
          <p>For our industry, high petrol costs remain a stress point. The striking difference between our own petrol-inclusive like-for-like growth and our ex-petrol growth of almost 4% in the second quarter reveals just how much customers' spending has had to be diverted into filling up the car. Our petrol sales grew by over 20% in the first half, which means three-quarters of &#xA3;1 billion more spent on petrol in Tesco than in the same period last year, much of this at the expense of customers' regular shopping.</p>
          <p>The consequences of these pressures are visible in both the food and the non-food markets. In food, headline growth picked up through the spring and early summer with inflation, but volumes have taken the strain. Some beneficial mix effects are still in evidence; for example, many customers are still trading up into Finest, looking to save money by staying in, or buying better to reduce their waste. Overall, though, the picture is one of low growth.</p>
          <p>The non-food market continues to be much more adversely affected. Despite this, our second quarter like-for-like sales growth in general merchandise, clothing, and electricals was stable. And building on this, the changes I said we were working on last time are now starting to come through. Our clothing performance is showing early signs of improvement following an introduction of new ranges, and our electrical sales, while still subdued, are delivering share growth.</p>
          <p>Our early trials aimed at driving more trade in our Extras are encouraging. We've simplified the presentation and display of clothing and electronics for customers, reduced the space in entertainment, improved the sightlines <mark type="ph" /> allow (5:22) and fixtures, and we're getting more impact from our promotions. We've also been working on more substantial improvements to product and space allocation, which have longer lead times, and these will begin to roll out through the autumn and into 2012.</p>
          <p>You will recall that in April I said on almost any metric, the UK is an outstanding business &#x2013; market share, sales density, margins, and returns &#x2013; but that they haven't been leading. I said it needed to get back to doing things first for customers and executing better. And I'm pleased to say that's now begun.</p>
          <p>Last week, we made the most significant changes to our pricing and our promotions strategy for many years. With The Big Price Drop, we've lowered over 3,000 prices, introduced <mark type="ph" /> shopper (6:13) promotions, and are putting much more emphasis on the great value of Tesco brand products.</p>
          <p>Here are some examples of the scale of the price cuts. These are reducing the costs of the nation's shopping list because they're all staple items, the things that people buy week in, week out.</p>
          <p>And here are some examples of the size of the price difference now between branded and Tesco products on really popular lines. Fewer, simpler, deeper cut promotions will have more impact, too.</p>
          <p>These are important lasting changes, and the context here is also important. We could've carried on, waiting for things to improve, for the economic recovery to take a stronger hold. But we haven't been happy with our growth for some time now. We haven't been on the front foot enough, and this is the right time for us to get back to doing what we do best: being first for our customers.</p>
          <p>Of course, value is about a lot more than just price; it's about the whole shopping trip. That's why after successful trials, we're putting more staff hours into stores to make sure we continue to set the standards on service availability, particularly in fresh foods. This work is very important. We're delighted with the way our fresh food departments have strengthened during the trials, which began in July.</p>
          <p>We're also putting more into quality. As I've said, Finest continues to grow well. Sales were up 12.5% in the first half, and I'm delighted with our innovative early work on venture brands. They're allowing more of our customers across Europe as well as the UK to access premium quality at affordable prices, and only at Tesco. As an example, 43% of customers who bought ChokaBlok ice cream hadn't bought premium ice cream at Tesco in the previous six months.</p>
          <p>Now, these changes require investment. Well over &#xA3;300 million of that will come from Clubcard moving back to single points. Whilst it remains very popular and very valued, right now customers tell us they want immediate savings.</p>
          <p>We're also putting extra funding in which will take the total investment to over &#xA3;500 million. To scale this view, we expect Price Drop to halve the rate of food inflation in the UK business. So it's a substantial change.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our business outside the UK, the performance was strong in Asia, in Europe, and in the United States. We're going to start, though, as I said I would in these updates, with what wasn't so good, slower growth than we would've liked in Poland and in Korea.</p>
          <p>In Poland, two things temporarily held us back. First, we put more hypers into the Extra refit program in the first half, particularly in quarter two. The results are excellent; 20% like-for-likes in the stores competed, but we've still got more of them going into refit than coming out of refit. Second, we've been building additional distribution capacity so we can add more range to our smaller stores. It's in place now, so a wider program of remodeling, starting with our 230 1K format stores, will also pick up pace rapidly from here. We expect like-for-like sales growth in Poland to strengthen in the second half as a consequence.</p>
          <p>In Korea, Homeplus saw only a small rise in like-for-like sales in the second quarter; wasn't helped by a bout of short-term promotion activity linked to the acquisition of Kim's Club by E-Mart. But it's worth emphasizing that our comps were 5 points harder in our second quarter, so steady sales growth during the half was a pleasing outcome. Neither of these things, though, detracted from strong overall financial performance in Poland and especially in Korea. In fact, each contributed significantly to growth in Europe and in Asia.</p>
          <p>What's good about our international performance is, I think, pretty clear from the numbers. For me, the things that stand out are continued excellent growth in Asia, strong underlying progress in Europe, Fresh &amp; Easy's trajectory, and overall international profits growing nicely faster than sales, all done in the characteristic Tesco way with a focus on doing what's right for our customers.</p>
          <p>Asia saw a strong growth with profits up 19%. Thailand, in particular, and Korea and Malaysia delivered good growth. The decision to exit from Japan is a seminal moment for the region too. We tried hard there, but we've taken action because we couldn't see our way through to a scale of business and because it's right to focus on opportunities elsewhere.</p>
          <p>China is one of those opportunities. There, our sales grew rapidly, affecting a fast rate of new store openings as well as 6% like-for-like growth. We've got six Lifespace malls trading, and given the scale and the growing complexity of these projects to meet our plans for growth, we've decided to increase our focus on leasehold expansion together with some freehold.</p>
          <p>We're opening 17 leasehold hypers in the second half alone. With only a small market share, and yet, with our mature stores today delivering shop-door profitability, we're confident in developing a successful and a substantial business in China.</p>
          <p>Our performance in Central Europe was excellent, and growth would have been stronger in Europe overall had the background in Ireland not remained tough. Our second quarter comps were challenging. So it was good to come through that with positive like-for-likes for the region. We've got good momentum in Europe, with our work on skill and scale giving headroom to improve competitiveness further. And after some challenging years for hypers, Extras starting to drive performance. Europe profits grew 12%, with margins holding up well. Profit growth would have been over 20% without the taxes that you all know about in Hungary, as a better guide to the pace of underlying improvements in performance.</p>
          <p>I've enjoyed the time I've spent with the Fresh &amp; Easy team in my first six months. They have a demanding plan, and I'm delighted to say they're hedging it. As a result, I'm even more confident that we're on track to break even than I was when we last spoke in April. There's a long way to go, but to see losses come down 23% in the first half is an important milestone. That performance was built around strong sales growth, improving operating ratios in established stores, higher sales densities in new stores, and increasing supply chain efficiencies, particularly in our manufacturing facilities. Buying out our campus partners has delivered strong synergies and also enabled a faster rate of new product development.</p>
          <p>We haven't had any help from the economy either, but we delivered our seventh consecutive quarter of strong like-for-like, and our two-year increase during our second quarter was 28% on that measure. Importantly, while over half of our current growth came from increasing customer traffic, the really pleasing thing is the way the offer and the stores look for customers. And recent changes such as in-store bakeries, loose produce, stronger flow of the space, much better grocery assortments, and faster new product development on Fresh are making a big difference. There's more to come, with the Friends loyalty card doing well in our seven Bakersfield stores; 43% of sales already on the card. We roll out the Friends loyalty card starting next week.</p>
          <p>Our international success is driving Group growth now, and while we still have some way to go before we can define all our businesses as outstanding, I'm confident the gap continues to close.</p>
          <p>Moving on to our third objective, matching our Internet capability with our strength in stores to become a truly multichannel business. I've said before that we think the combination of stores and online, on clicks and bricks, can have compelling appeal for customers who want alternatives in terms of how they shop and how their order fulfillment is done. We're well placed given our scale, our supply chain, and our physical footprint, and our plans for a more integrated offer in both food and non-food for customers are starting to come together.</p>
          <p>Our grocery dotcom business is continuing to grow well. Customers appreciate the extra one hour time slots and the extended Sunday deliveries we've introduced. And our range of apps for mobile devices are also very popular. We've added 18% to our capacity in the last 12 months, and our new Enfield dotcom-only store will add more. It opens in January, and as you can see here, it starts to complete our network around London.</p>
          <p>Importantly, it will also mean we can offer most customers within the M25 a range of products over and above those our stores currently stock. We expect these investments combined with our upgraded website to drive faster growth during the second half in the UK.</p>
          <p>Tesco Direct continues with double-digit growth, with newer categories such as clothing up 45% from a modest base, a great improvement. A significant upgrade to the Direct website, which is a big step forward in range and functionality, and which will include more major brands, will go live in the first half of 2012. It will also feature the first phase of Tesco's Marketplace, enabling customers to buy from selected online vendors at Tesco.com.</p>
          <p>We've extended Click &amp; Collect to well over 500 stores, and half of Direct order fulfillment is now done this way. And I think this demonstrates powerfully how appealing the combination of online and stores has already become for many customers. And there's more to go for. Our grocery Click &amp; Collect trial is doing well. We've recently extended it to 15 stores. Internationally, we're taking early steps in the same direction. Dotcom grocery is established and growing well in Korea and Ireland with annualized sales now over &#xA3;150 million. And we'll be starting in Prague in a few weeks and Warsaw early next year. It's just the start. We plan to put dotcom into the big cities in all our major markets over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Our fourth objective, delivering on the potential of Retailing Services, is mainly about the Bank. We've made progress in the Bank, but the first half performance is headlined by two things. First, we've chosen to slow down the final phase of banking systems migration. Our 2.7 million credit card accounts are the last thing to move over to our platforms. Now <mark type="ph" /> the emergence of issues (18:02) with the savings and loan migration in June. I want us to make sure we avoid any further disruption to our customers or our staff.</p>
          <p>As we build a good, reliable and trustworthy bank for Tesco customers, I think it's essential that we complete this last stage well, rather than do it quickly. We're ready to go with mortgages. But until we have completed migration, I've decided we won't, and it'll mean we'll push on with new products, starting with mortgages early in 2012.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we've taken a decision to increase our provision against potential PPI claims by &#xA3;57 million. We've a small exposure to it, but in line with the steps taken by all the other banks, it's the right thing to do. Behind those headlines, we've made good progress in key areas at the Bank. Baseline profits in the Bank grew well, up by 24%. That's the growth excluding the main provisioning and fair value movements this year and last year.</p>
          <p>Customer account numbers grew across our range of products, with credit card spend, for example, up by 14%, well ahead of the market, and our Fixed Rate Saver deposits already reaching &#xA3;1 billion on deposit. All of our major products except credit cards are now fully operational on our new IT and call center platforms. And as a result of this, we're introducing important customer service innovations, which is instant loan application decisions and just 10-minute lead times to set up savings accounts.</p>
          <p>We also welcome the main competition findings of the Independent Commission on Banking, particularly their commitment to make it easier for customers to switch between banks. For a new challenger like Tesco, this can only be helpful and timely, as next year we launch key new products and we move into growth.</p>
          <p>The fifth objective is to add value and competitiveness by applying our Group skill and scale across all of our businesses. In times of austerity and subdued demand growth, I believe the potential for self-help here assumes even greater importance, because this is about structural cost improvement not just efficiency savings. In the past, we described these programs as step change, but it's much bigger now; it's much broader than that. The key elements of it really are twofold. Better buying across the Group, our new global sourcing team is enabling us to lower our cost of goods, improve quality, and to sell more. This year we plan to double Direct food sourcing from &#xA3;1 billion to &#xA3;2 billion, rising to &#xA3;5 billion over the next few years.</p>
          <p>Secondly, applying the Tesco operating model globally is already yielding substantial savings, from sharing infrastructure in Central Europe, to each country having its own step-change productivity programs. These are already material benefits and they're rapidly increasing. Central Europe is a live example, where we're creating over &#xA3;100 million of headroom to invest back into the shopping trip for customers through the virtuous cycle of productivity, margin, and volume.</p>
          <p>And finally, our sixth objective is to deliver higher returns to shareholders by capitalizing on the platforms built and the investments made. By capitalizing on the platforms built, we described to you in April what the key components of the increase in returns would be; this chart shows them. And in June, we also added some detail in respect of the potential for our important Central Europe markets, showing our investiture there. Despite the more uncertain global economic outlook and the specific measures we've announced in the UK, we're confident that we'll demonstrate further good progress towards our returns target when we report our full-year numbers.</p>
          <p>So to sum up our six immediate objectives. Some are about driving forward growth; that will continue. Some are about sharper execution, and we're taking decisive action in some key areas that I talked about, with more to come. And the last is about a very strong focus on delivering increased returns for shareholders. We've made good progress there, and we're on track to meet our 2014, '15 objective.</p>
          <p>Tesco's success has been built around serving our customers well, the loyalty and commitment of our staff, and putting communities at the heart of what we do. Shareholders can only benefit if we keep up our unrelenting focus on these things. The first half has been both challenging and rewarding for Tesco.</p>
          <p>We've made promising progress at Fresh &amp; Easy. We've taken the decision to exit Japan. We've slowed down the Bank's near-term growth to focus on quality. And we've reset the UK business and got it back on the front foot. There's much more to come. The sense of energy and momentum is growing as the new team adjusts to the new conditions and to their new responsibilities.</p>
          <p>Thank you for listening, I'll now hand over to Laurie. Laurie?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Philip. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my presentation with a summary of the Group results.</p>
          <p>We're pleased with the overall performance in the first half. We've delivered a strong, broadly based profit growth and top-line growth. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're making good progress towards our return on capital employed target. The Group sales for the half were &#xA3;35.5 billion, up 8.8%. And Group trading profit rose by 3.7%, underlying grew by 6.2%, and the PBT increased by 12.1%. Underlying diluted earnings per share increased to 18.30p, benefiting from a further rate reduction in the corporation tax. Consistent with our policy of growing dividends broadly in line with the underlying diluted EPS on a constant tax-rate basis, the interim dividend is 4.63p per share, up 5.9%.</p>
          <p>We made good progress despite a couple of issues holding back our profit growth. First, our reported trading profit grew 3.7%. That has been reduced by 1.2% by the inclusion of the Hungary crisis tax. And as you may remember, we reported this as a corporation tax last year as the Hungarian government applied it retrospectively. This year, we've accounted for it as an operating cost, resulting in a &#xA3;20 million charge to the trading profit.</p>
          <p>The second issue is the increase in the provision made by Tesco Bank relating to Payment Protection Insurance. And I'll discuss the bank in more detail later on, but as you can see, PPI has reduced our Group trading profit growth by &#xA3;57 million or 3.3%. Without these issues, our headline rate of trading profit growth would've been 8.2%, ahead of our Group exc. petrol sales of 6.6%. Underlying profit growth has of course been similarly affected and growing by 10.4% before PPI and the Hungary tax issue.</p>
          <p>Following our announcement that we intend to exit Japan, we've treated it as discontinued and showed a &#xA3;65 million charge below the profit-after-tax line.</p>
          <p>This includes a small first-half trading loss of &#xA3;15 million, a store impairment charge, restructuring costs, and tax. We expect to incur a further restructuring charge of &#xA3;16 million in the second half relating to the closure of 12 stores. Stripping out the trading loss, this had little effect on the trading profit growth of the Group as the amount is similar in both years.</p>
          <p>Our sales growth in the UK in the first half reflects the difficult trading conditions with continued pressure on household budgets, particularly from high petrol costs. Whilst inflation is a feature of the first half, our inflation as you know is consistently lower than CPI. Part of that is about mix, what Tesco customers actually buy, as opposed to rather than a fixed basket, which they don't buy.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, underlying inflation should fall as commodity price pressures ease, and our price drop initiative has already accelerated that reduction. New space continued to perform strongly into the second quarter. In total, we opened 700,000 square feet in the first half, with sales from new space contributing 3.9% of the 4.4% total exc. petrol sales growth.</p>
          <p>We're delighted with the performance of the new stores, which are beating capital appraisal targets. Importantly, we continue to see little self-impact from new space, only at around 0.5% of UK sales. And even when you include the competitor openings, the impact of all new stores on our sales is still remarkably low, well below 1%.</p>
          <p>We grew trading profit by 4.5% in the first half, a robust performance, particularly considering the tough economic background. Margins edged down as a result of the diluted impact of petrol, which now represents nearly 19% of our total inc. VAT sales in the UK. Profit growth would've been 6.2% but for the impact of the sale and lease-back program.</p>
          <p>Phil has described our actions to increase competitiveness in the UK. We've delivered excellent productivity improvements to support the bottom line, but now we're doing more to support the top line as well.</p>
          <p>Price Drop represents our biggest investment in shelf-edged pricing for customers for many years, an annualized amount of &#xA3;500 million in branded price and unknown label. We have further investments planned including an increased staffing and improvement in store environment. These are important initiatives which will help build confidence for consumers, easing some of the pressure on weekly household budgets, and investing more in staff hours, which ultimately means more jobs and supporting the UK economy.</p>
          <p>Some of the investment is funded by returning Clubcard points back to 1p, with the balance coming from smarter promotions and step change. The bulk of the investment is into everyday low pricing, core items, and this will of course reduce inflation. We expect customers and therefore volumes to respond well. We are not assuming that this will happen immediately but build as other revenue investment takes place.</p>
          <p>Consequently, we're planning for UK profit growth to be broadly flat in the second half. We're particularly pleased with our performance in Asia. First half sales grew by nearly 12% and profits by nearly 19%. Margin strengthened to 5.6%, which reflects a strong underlying improvement of 30 basis points in our margin. We've also delivered very strong growth in both sales and profit in Europe. Customers in Ireland continue to be under real strain as we saw like-for-like of minus 3.4% for the first half. But despite this, we increased our market share and broadly maintained profits aided by continued benefits from alignment to our UK operations.</p>
          <p>Profit growth in the other countries in our European segment &#x2013; that's Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Turkey &#x2013; was particularly pleasing, averaging in excess of 20% even after the Hungary sales tax.</p>
          <p>In the United States, Fresh &amp; Easy has continued to deliver very strong sales growth, including another quarter of double-digit like-for-like. We've reduced losses for the first half by over 23%, delivering on the first part of our commitment to reduce losses sharply for the year.</p>
          <p>Progress at Fresh &amp; Easy is coming from sustainable improvements across a range of important metrics. As these charts show, the reduction in trading losses has been driven by leveraging our fixed costs together with improved productivity in distribution and payroll costs. Gross margin has continued to improve as we now capture more of the manufacturing margin following the acquisition of 2 Sisters Food Group and Wild Rocket.</p>
          <p>We're on track for approaching 30 stores in the U.S. to reach shop-door profitability by the year-end. This is an important indicator of success in any new market as it demonstrates that we have a format that can drive forward profitability once the business is at scale.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Bank, our headline trading profit number for the first half for the Bank shows a reduction of 65.9% to &#xA3;44 million. The biggest single driver of this reduction is the increase of &#xA3;57 million in our provision for alleged misselling of the payment protection insurance.</p>
          <p>Whilst the actual level of claims to date has been modest, &#xA3;16 million, following the High Court ruling, we've conducted a thorough review of the PPI issue. As a result, we now intend to take a more proactive approach to customers who may have been affected. And this is consistent with the action that's been taken by other banks.</p>
          <p>This decision is a material change to the assumptions used to calculate our provision last year and results in an increase in the provision to &#xA3;92 million. Baseline profit for the Bank &#x2013; that is, before the impact of PPI and the fair value releases for both years &#x2013; increased by 24% to &#xA3;89 million. This growth is driven by increased customer account numbers, particularly strong motor insurance sales, and increased market share in both ATM transactions, up 8%, and credit card spend, up 14%.</p>
          <p>Our decision to delay the next stage of migration of the Bank results in a temporary extended period of double running. It will also mean we defer the active marketing of existing and new products, and it will therefore impact trading profit for the second half by around &#xA3;40 million. And that's against our own original internal target.</p>
          <p>The bank's balance sheet is in good shape, and we've seen further cash inflows from the continued success of the Fixed Rate Saver account, which was launched last year. The bank's capital position has strengthened in the period, resulting in an improved risk asset ratio and an increase in the core Tier 1 capital ratio to 16.2%.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Group balance sheet, Group capital expenditure in the first half was &#xA3;2.1 billion. We now plan to invest around &#xA3;3.9 billion for the full year in total, consistent with our guidance of CapEx being between 5% and 5.5% of sales.</p>
          <p>We opened 3.3 million square feet of new space in the first half of this year; that's 15% more than the same period last year. We're on track to deliver a further 7.5 million square feet of space in the second half. Our operating cash flow for our retail operations was &#xA3;2.3 billion, ahead of CapEx and slightly higher than the first half for last year. We provided a detailed cash flow in your packs splitting out the impact of the Bank for the first time.</p>
          <p>A low net debt has shown an increase to &#xA3;7.6 billion. It is stable year-on-year. We still expect to see an overall reduction in net debt by the year-end to around &#xA3;6.4 billion, and in line with our plans to deleverage further.</p>
          <p>The increase in the first half is due to the normal timing of cash outflows relating to dividends, which is much larger in the first half than the second. We also purchased nearly &#xA3;300 million worth of shares to offset the dilution from the employee share scheme, and invested around &#xA3;200 million in small acquisitions. These included the Mills Group, Zabka in the Czech Republic, Blinkbox <mark type="ph" /> and both Asian (35:01), and the final 6% share of Homeplus in South Korea.</p>
          <p>We generated just under &#xA3;0.6 billion of proceeds from our property program in the first half, delivering profits of &#xA3;245 million. And two weeks ago, we announced plans for a PFPO in Thailand, seeking to raise more than &#xA3;300 million by releasing the value of a small number of Thai malls.</p>
          <p>Mixing the fund in this way enables us to realize the full value of the malls while leasing back our own Tesco Lotus hypermarket for an attractive anchor tenant rent. This move's in line with the property strategy we described in April, and highlights the significant value we create through property development not just in the UK, but also internationally.</p>
          <p>As for our previous guidance, we will report a year-on-year reduction in property profits as we move towards our objective of delivering a sustainable level of between &#xA3;250 million to &#xA3;350 million. And that's from 2012, '13 onwards.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the balance sheet, it will come as no surprise that our IAS 19 defined pension deficit increased from &#xA3;1 billion to &#xA3;1.2 billion; that's after tax. This increase demonstrates the volatility of IAS 19, and of course our actuarial valuation has a deficit that remains much lower than that.</p>
          <p>I spoke in April about our increased focus on four key financial metrics. I'll set out first the target for increasing our return on capital employed to 14.6% by 2014, '15. Second, our moves to increase fixed charge cover to 4 time to 4.5 times. The third, a reduction in net indebtedness to 2.5 times. The fourth, our commitment to maintain capital expenditure at between 5% and 5.5% of sales. We're making good progress on all of these measures. And as usual, we'll update you in detail at the prelims.</p>
          <p>Individually, these measures are good indicators of balance sheet strength and financial discipline. Taken together, they provide a framework which gives you a very clear sense of our financial strategy, priorities, and long-term performance outlook.</p>
          <p>In summary, a solid first half which demonstrates how the breadth of the Group has helped us to weather tough conditions in some markets. A good trading profit result despite some significant impacts, and very encouraging performance in Asia, Europe, and the United States.</p>
          <p>Significant action has been taken in the UK which will help ease pressure on household budgets, build consumer confidence, and support the UK economy through the creation of new jobs.</p>
          <p>We've decided to go more slowly on the Bank in the short term, continuing to put customers first and safeguarding the long-term opportunity for Tesco, which remains undiminished.</p>
          <p>A strong balance sheet and a clear financial framework, which underpins our determination to drive growth and returns. Our increased focus on returns is delivering, and I'm confident that we'll be able to report another year of increased return on capital employed when we meet again in April next year.</p>
          <p>Thank you. We'd now like to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Just to say, we've got some technology here, so just in terms of the questions, if you put your hands up, I'll choose who's going to speak. Please limit the number of questions you ask so that everybody gets a chance to ask their questions.</p>
          <p>So you raise your hand, I'll choose. You have microphones close to you on the back of the seat in front of you. So when I indicate you're on, then press the microphone and we'll all be able to hear each other. A red light will come on. We can then answer your question.</p>
          <p>I think you'll have to turn that red light off when you start because I can't turn you off from here. So it's always tradition that Philip Dorgan ask the first question. Just one, Philip, thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Is that working? Yes. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (39:40)</p>
          <p>And I do have a couple of questions, but before I ask them, I can hardly let the retirement of David Reid go without saying a few words. Two words, actually. About time.</p>
          <p>But seriously, I will remember a young Finance Director-elect over 26 years ago sitting at the back of a Ralph Temple-hosted Tesco meeting. I know some of you might think that Terry Leahy  was a bit hard to get information out of on these occasions, but Ralph Temple was like getting blood out of a stone. And David sat there and recognized that this needed to change, so he dragged the whole of Tesco IR back into the 20th century when he took over as Finance Director the year after.</p>
          <p>And since then, he's had a remarkable career at Tesco. He oversaw the overtaking of Sage for his market lead in the early 1990s. And really, without him the international business would not be what it is today. And that often isn't remarked upon because people remember him as Finance Director and as laterally as Chairman. That was a great achievement.</p>
          <p>Most recently, he's provided some great counsel for Terry, and I'm sure for Phil as Deputy Chairman, and Chairman over the last few years.</p>
          <p>On a personal level, I've always enjoyed his company, especially after England have beaten Scotland at rugby, which he's generally borne with good grace.</p>
          <p>His departure at Tesco will leave a big hole, but I hesitate to wish him a happy retirement because I know he's going to keep busy. So as the only surviving analyst from that time, 25 years ago, I would like to wish him good health, happiness, and an easier World Cup draw in four years time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But equally important, I do wish the team that you see here today and with my successor, Richard Broadbent, many more successful years of the Tesco story. So that's my wish, and I'll be cheering them on from the side. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my first question is, now you've got rid of the old guard &#x2013; no, I'm joking. Two questions, one on non-food. Why is the performance still so poor? Your brand seems to be quite weakened. It's not just Tesco in non-food in the UK, but it's all the food retailers. What are you doing about it, and when will we see the results?</p>
          <p>Secondly, something you said on Price Drop slightly puzzled me, because if it's so good and so it's the biggest thing you've done shelf-edge prices for years, and it's &#xA3;500 million, why will it take time to build? I mean, won't customers recognize a great value straight away? You've got an advantage over your competitors; you're in there. Why is it going to take so long to come through the numbers? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Non-food required a lot of work, and the lead times for these things are very long. But we will in the second half of the year be able to demonstrate real progress, because we've &#x2013; I've worked one of the stores that's had the changes. Customers are voting with their feet and putting their hands in their purses. And we're going to do quite a few of them in the second half of the year. We're going to do all of them during 2012.</p>
          <p>We also have this terribly pernicious effect of fuel prices. We've got more out-of-town, edge-of-town hypermarkets with a bias to non-food than anybody else. &#xA3;750 million were spent on fuel at Tesco in the first half of the year, &#xA3;17 million more than was spent in the like-for-like half year. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (43:26) similar. I heard this morning 15% of customers &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; people in the UK are saying, I don't want to drive this far. They're trying to reduce their mileage.</p>
          <p>So the Extra format has taken the brunt of that. But the changes are coming and you'll see them in the second half of the year in a store near you. And there are many of them. And in the shops, there was some shock to the changes that we've made to the way the stores look.</p>
          <p>Price Drop, well, it's just too early to be able to say confidently. It was only ten days ago. But we've had trouble keeping up with it. And we'll let you know at the third quarter what's happened to our volumes and what's happened to our sales growth. So you've only got to wait about ten weeks to find out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Andrew Kasoulis from Credit Suisse. Two questions. Laurie, last year you gave us a broad indication of the returns target for the full year at this stage. So I'm wondering if you could give us your target for the percentage points uplift again this year?</p>
          <p>And second, perhaps one for Phil, there's been a big debate this morning about whether your price cuts on Big Price Drop are permanent or temporary. Could you clarify that? If you're taking a price down, will it simple go back up again in eight weeks' time, as some people believe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we're at the half year, Andrew, so it'd be hard to give you a target on returns. We got to 12.9 last year. We'll have a 13 in front of it at the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for that. I mean, 50 basis points or more? Last year you gave us a clue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Isn't that the red light moment?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:13) 13-point-something. How's that?</p>
          <p>And, well, we've taken down 3,000 prices, and we intend to hold 3,000 prices down. And how we got it to 3,000 is we looked at what customers bought every week in Tesco, and we hit those lines. We used our marketing services business <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:40). This is the methodology we use around the world, and we brought it to the UK.</p>
          <p>By the way, we don't assume a volume uplift immediately, but that doesn't mean we won't get one.</p>
          <p>There's been quite a lot of talk over the weekend in the newspapers, and again this morning by some of the media, about the Grocer 33. And I've been asked, well, isn't it just smoke and mirrors. The Grocer 33 is 33 products out of a basket of 200, out of the 220,000 wide range of food products stocked by Tesco. This week, the Grocer 33 showed us not being cheapest.</p>
          <p>In the 33 products were the following: big limes, fresh pomegranates &#x2013; when did you last buy one of them? Tilda Steamed Lime and Coriander Rice. Coriander rice in everyone's shopping basket every week. And Maynards Midget Gems. And then, of course, they make a simple mistake. Our whole food added-value premium 500-gram Californian raisins compared to <mark type="ph" /> Aster's (46:51) own label.</p>
          <p>So it's not representative. We are certain that we have materially reduced prices for customers. And we didn't assume a value uplift immediately. That doesn't mean we won't get one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Over on the left?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So can hear me now, yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we can hear you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:22) Nothing wrong with Midget Gems, by the way. <mark type="ph" /> I'd consider yourself at least one of those. (47:29)</p>
          <p>In terms of CapEx, can you just give us an indication of the rationale on the 5% to 5.5% of sales as a basis to invest in the future? And whether there is scope to actually materially take that down?</p>
          <p>And in relation to that, and looking at the UK, can you give us a feel for the nature of CapEx spend going forward, to the extent it would involve a lot more for store refurbishments, rather than new space? And can you give us any color as to what Tesco will actually look like once you've had your treatment on it, Philip?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 5% to 5.5%, and should we take it down, actually the performance of our investments to date would be around CIA targets in pretty much all of the countries. So what we're investing in is doing well.</p>
          <p>What's also encouraging is the level of impact that you saw on that chart have been pretty flat. So even if I bring your question back to the UK, it does seem that there's plenty more scope to build more stores. A mix of formats, that could be admitted. But at a good return for the UK, and it's a good thing to do. And of course, with the big <mark type="ph" /> WIP (48:52) balance that we're building out, you'll see more of that.</p>
          <p>Why 5.5% to 5%? When we did our long-term plan and basically moved our cash flows forward, and looked at what was the right level of investment with a steady stream of property proceeds, the standard yield that I think you've become accustomed to on dividend, that was the kind of CapEx that we felt that we could afford to spend, continue to grow through a combination of increased returns, but grow in the top line as well. And that was just the sweet spot for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's perhaps just worth adding a bit to that, because it comes into the discussion about the level of capital investments in the UK. I think one of the very positive things under Phil's leadership and a strong input from Laurie is, with the Board's stronger focus on levels of capital investment, and importantly, as Phil said in his presentation, returns.</p>
          <p>And I think this is a very good thing. Because if you look at Tesco's history, clearly through most of it, we had plenty of money available, and so we could do as much as we wanted, spend as much as we liked. And obviously now, we're in a different position where we have to make choices and there are priorities for capital investment.</p>
          <p>So you've seen lots of actions already in terms of exiting from Japan but still pushing strongly ahead in countries where we haven't yet got the scale and market share. So Malaysia, China, Turkey are good examples of that. But also in areas like the USA. So we're going to prove our business model in one region. So it's limited to one region. So sensible. Prove your business model, and that will open up, hopefully, many more opportunities.</p>
          <p>And I think this is new for Tesco, and it's coming from Phil and the team. Equally as many countries now with strong bases of hypermarkets already. So you see the focus moving to convenience stores at home in the UK. You can see it here, and also increasingly abroad as well.</p>
          <p>And I think this is all a very good practice in the way the Board looks at return on capital. For the first time, we've now got targets for return on capital in the business. You've got the financial criteria laid down by Laurie.</p>
          <p>Yes, all of these criteria can be changed, improved, tightened up, finessed over the years to come. But I think the &#x2013; from a shareholder point of view, and I'm guardian in that sense of the shareholders &#x2013; I think we're doing a much better job now on disciplined investment and returns. So if I can just overlay that on what Laurie said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Was the other part of the question on refit? So in the UK, by the end of this year, we're quietly getting on and refitting a large proportion of our stores. In fact, by the year-end, we'll have nearly 20% of the total space either caught up with this five-year refit, or indeed a full refit. More equivalent to a 10-year type of refit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> When you say that, (52:07) I remember back in the early 90s, when one of the leading fund managers said to me that you must stop all CapEx in the UK, Tesco. And thankfully we chose to get through that recession. And the market cap was &#xA3;4 billion, and now it's over &#xA3;30 billion.</p>
          <p>So that's not a Clever Dick remark. It's just trying to say hiatus decisions about let's double CapEx, let's really go for it, are probably not realistic. And so then what it's about, is what I tried to say, is tackling each area.</p>
          <p>And I think the other thing that shareholders should bear in mind is that if you take the starting point, whether you look at sales densities, operating margins, or the existing return on capital &#x2013; and you know that's going to go up, because we've targeted it to go up, so it will &#x2013; we're in a very strong position, so we can still open stores in the UK.</p>
          <p>So if you go for the hiatus situation, why, it would be in the interest of opening stores whilst we continue, and that's the approach we take. But within that, clearly there have been priorities, and a sensible financial management on top of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just before we take the next question, there was a question about what's the new Extra going to look like, wasn't there?</p>
          <p>And we're not simply working on a new look Extra. We're actually looking at each of our categories, wherever they are, and we're taking a cold, hard look and saying, what needs to be better?</p>
          <p>Any of you who were in the Central European investor trip would have seen the Extra there, and you would have seen the sort of high-quality category management that I think we can bring back to our Expresses, to our Metros, to our Superstores, to our Extras, and online. We sell products to people in shops and online. There's so much more focus going into that now, just as there is into where we allocate capital in the UK and around the Group.</p>
          <p>The 5.5% is just to give you an indication of the most that we want you to think that we'd want to spend. We're going through a whole new cycle now of looking at our businesses. We're through the greatest period of risk and uncertainty <mark type="ph" /> As far as that (54:28) we were in countries ten years ago. We didn't know it was going to work.</p>
          <p>All the countries we're in now &#x2013; probably bar two &#x2013; we are confident that we've got a model that can drive increased sales and more than acceptable returns. The other two or three, we're watching very carefully. You could probably name them.</p>
          <p>And I think once we're through with that, then we'll have a business that we'll be confident to invest more in, where it's required. But we've put down most of the hypermarkets that we need to do, say, probably China and Turkey. So it will be different formats, different ways to market, different ways to reach the consumer.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I just wanted to pick up on the CapEx thing. I mean, you continue to spend more in the UK than Europe and Asia combined. So how long is that &#x2013; you did &#xA3;1 billion in the UK in the first half. &#xA3;600 million, &#xA3;300 million. So if you're going to keep this 5%, 5.5%, are we going to see a change in that balance going forward, and the proportion invested into the UK decline? And people talk about you being an international business, but as I say, most goes into the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've had quite a bit to do in the first half of the year. But one of the things that hasn't escaped my notice is the amount of space that's going down in the UK and is suggested might go down in the future. So we're very clear that what we've got to do is invest where we can get access to the best rates of growth.</p>
          <p>Yes, you'll see more of it going outside the UK than inside the UK over time. Of course you will. We're right now reviewing our capital allocations for the next five years. So it's inevitable we see more opportunities outside than we see inside. But we still see opportunities to grow in the UK, and so we will still be growing in the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us any idea of timescale on that? Are you talking a three-year timescale? Because your total CapEx isn't going to &#x2013; not going up massively if it's only 5%, 5.5% of sales. So are we going to see that shift to 60% going outside the UK over a three-year period or what? Can you &#x2013; just some real guidance -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you're going to see it shifting. It's too early now to say precisely by how much, because the new team is having a cold, hard look at where we have chosen to invest. David's already explained the attitude that we're taking.</p>
          <p>A lot of focus now on getting more from the existing assets, as well as building out in places where customers can't reach a Tesco. And it might surprise you to know that in the UK, there are still swanes of the population that can't get to a Tesco food store in a 15-minute drive-time band. Now that's a big opportunity.</p>
          <p>So anyway, you'll hear more of this in our successive briefings that we give you in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just final point...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this the fifth question or -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, it's only the third. A final thing. Six months ago, you said there was no structural issues in the UK. You've just mentioned that you've noticed the amount of space going down. Do you still think there are no structural issues in the UK, and that the only thing wrong with Tesco is people need to work a bit harder, I think was your phrase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did I say that? I don't think there are any structural issues in the Tesco business, David. I think it is about execution. It's about clarity. It's about focus.</p>
          <p>And we've got a new team who just now every day look at the UK. They don't have to get up in the morning and think about China or Korea or what we're going to do in America. They just look at the UK. And they're gathering momentum. And it's, as I said in my introductory remarks, it's an exciting place to be at the moment. Very exciting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think also one just last point on this discussion is that financial saturation is &#x2013; because there'll be plenty of sites &#x2013; but financial saturation, which is what we're all really discussing, will be different for the different players.</p>
          <p>And that's why I think for Tesco it is potentially much longer than some of the other players who already will not be making, A, the proper &#x2013; enough existing returns, never mind the stores they're planning on opening in the future.</p>
          <p>So I think relatively, Tesco is well positioned in that sense. But clearly within that context, we've got to run our own business sensibly and properly in terms of returns we've promised.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't feel anymore that things are happening to us. I feel that we're making things happen. And we were talking about this last week <mark type="ph" /> as an executive (59:29) &#x2013; normal service is being resumed by us. We know now precisely what it is that we have to do. We've not been clearer at home. And we're on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's try one at the back there, and just on the aisle on the left?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Tom Gadsby from Soc Gen. A couple of questions.</p>
          <p>Could you just give a comment on the U.S. margin? Does the benefit from the manufacturing that you've acquired there offset the extra costs on the in-store bakeries of these projects? Where's that going precisely?</p>
          <p>And the second one was, I'm sure it's an oversight, but I don't think you completely answered Andrew's question on the permanence of the Price Drop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the manufacturing margin is in the margin numbers that we showed you, and the overall improvement does show an offset of any dilution from other product introductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've <mark type="ph" /> gained (1:00:30) in-store productivity, too. So there's a productivity program for the Fresh &amp; Easy stores.</p>
          <p>And we've taken the Chef's Table that you'll remember, if you've seen the business, where people sample things, and we've reduced that. Put the hours into baking, baking bread. So that's another way in which we're able to offset any additional costs from in-store bakery manufacture.</p>
          <p>Which part of Andrew's question didn't you think I answered?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Permanence of prices, I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The permanence of it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's 3,000 items, which we are holding down. And that's the idea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just down at the front here. Yes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John Kershaw of Merrill Lynch. Just a couple of ones. First one, <mark type="ph" /> stock record (1:01:20), but just on the CapEx point. Just explicitly on Extras, refurbishing them. New offer. That's great. Do you expect to open many more new sites that will extend existing sites?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of the Bank, can you possibly try and paint a picture &#x2013; I know it's difficult &#x2013; but with loans launched, and what sort of margin you might make at the Bank? Because the difficulty is the profitability has stagnated, and so investors need help with the future view.</p>
          <p>And then finally, just obviously with my eye on the Bank and the issues on the systems, how confident are you, perhaps with your old hat on as IT Director, that your systems are up to scratch? Because there's a lot of change. You're a more and more complex business with marketplace, et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, I'll do the CapEx and the systems, and then loans can go to Laurie, because he's looking up some numbers now, I can see over there. We can open...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:02:27) the Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry? We can open more Extras in the UK, because there are places where we don't have an Extra, and where there would be demand. You know the way in which we identify sites; the ones that are opening are hitting their sales targets. We'll refresh more for sure, too.</p>
          <p>Fewer extensions for us, though, of course, and others, because largely we've done that, and that was a program of 7, 8, and 9. That's why you have much less of that in our like-for-like number than you have for others.</p>
          <p>On the Bank systems, very confident that the team that we have there, and the strength in the team, will be able to complete the migration. They just need to do a lot more testing so that when they do it, it works smoothly. It didn't work smoothly in June. And I don't want to risk the reputation of Tesco. Lots of customers want to bank with us and buy financial products from us, but we don't want to do a credit card migration for 2.7 million accounts and it go wrong. And so it's not going to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just following up, sorry. If you believe in a more multi-channel world, more sort of reserve and collect, why do you need more Extras? Then just more broadly on the systems for the whole business, not just the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, there's certainly more opportunity for food, John, food stores, standalone, than there is for hypermarkets. So we'll talk to you in six months' time once we have completed our work, our plan for the next five years, about the likely shape of that. It's just work in progress for us, but there's certainly more opportunity for food stores.</p>
          <p>Generally on our systems, we're delighted. We've got full-fathomed technologists who work for us in Bangalore on our payroll, building our systems. And they're much more engaged and involved now in the work of the Bank than they were six months ago and a year ago, as you'd expect. So now we continue to be delighted with the rate of innovation and the quality of the service that we get from our IT systems.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the starting point on the Bank in terms of helping to estimate its profit growth, if you do back out the PPI provision that was taken in the first half, that's &#xA3;57 million. If you back out the full-year effects for the fair value releases, which is about roughly &#xA3;155 million last year, about &#xA3;20-odd million this year. You get to this underlying profit gross number that we're talking about. All of that growth came from the insurance business. The Bank, the standard banking business, didn't grow at all in terms of profits in the first half.</p>
          <p>And the low PPI and migration of the kind of headline-grabbing points, the bank also swallowed two quite big changes in profitability. One, the interchange fee on the reciprocity agreement for ATMs went down year-on-year. And also, legislation came in that when you're paying off a loan as a customer, it's the highest rate loan first, not a historic, what was the first loan they took out.</p>
          <p>So both those things have hit the Bank margin quite significantly. In fact, in the first half, it's about &#xA3;13 million, &#xA3;14 million. So you should assume that's kind of in the base going forward. All the insurance growth also came from motor insurance. The other insurance businesses we didn't grow for the various reasons that were talked about on migration.</p>
          <p>So I can't put a number on margin for you, John. And I can't obviously give you a number in terms of growth because kind of forecasting's the role of you guys. But we are as confident about the long-term potential for the Bank as we ever were. And if you back out the one times, then you're kind of back to where we should have been this year without those. And then the growth trajectory should be at least double-digit.</p>
          <p>And the &#xA3;1 billion that we've talked about in terms of the profitability for Retail Services, which I know is probably behind your question, we see that as still a realistic objective. We don't quite know when, and obviously we've had to slow down because of the migration issues. But we're still very much wedded to achieving that kind of profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question. Far right, just on the far aisle?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Sreedhar Mahamkali from Macquarie. Three questions, please; all on UK.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I think with the second half UK trading profits being flat, the kind of guidance there, how comfortable are you with the UK trading margin of circa 6% going forward? I'm not just asking this year. Or is that a number that you think needs a bit of resetting slightly below that level? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, you talked about additional labor investments and store-environment costs in the second half. Were you able to quantify any of those, please?</p>
          <p>And finally, are you able to give any guidance or help in terms of how much petrol impact to the margins in the first half? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, let's start with the petrol impact on margins, and, Laurie, your guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the petrol growth was &#xA3;750 million quantum growth. We do about 5% as our gross margin on petrol, so you can kind of work out what the impact of that is, and that there was more than half of the sales growth of the Group. It's of course diluted, and we've been offsetting the diluted impact of that. We're marginally down in the UK on trading margin.</p>
          <p>Going forward, it's not the highest trading margin we've got in the Group, by the way. It's a mature business. It's doing well. It's got a good productivity program. And if you look back at our performance, when we really get the top line growing, our profit grows pretty much in line with sales. And in recent history, we've been growing sales faster, sorry, profits faster than sales. So there probably is a bit of reset to go on. But it shouldn't impact quantum profits going forward. They should just grow fast on the same margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the half two is what the half two is, we've said. Where it will be, that includes the expected investments in in-store labor that we've talked about. It includes the resetting of our prices. And no, we're not achieving any volume increase, but we might just get one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, how big are these increases because this &#x2013; presumably the store environment, the labor you talk about is outside the &#xA3;500 million price drop. I'm just trying to get a sense of how big they are, that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'll repeat my earlier answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Half two is what half two is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We need to move on, give other people a chance. So, we're down to the last few questions, so if you can keep them sharp and brief, that's great. Obviously, the team are available afterwards and throughout the day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is this working?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a &#x2013; yes, a couple of little questions. You've built some &#x2013; quite an ambitious target on net debt for the year-end, which requires quite a big improvement. Can you possibly explain how you expect working capital and further property sales in the second half to play into that, just for our modeling purposes?</p>
          <p>And the second question's on the Bank. I noticed that the deposits haven't grown in the first half of the year. And is this something which needs to be ramped up in the second half prior to your mortgage kind of debut?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You've picked on one of our biggest challenges actually in terms of working capital. We didn't have a good first half on our inventory levels. In fact, our inventory levels were up nearly 20%; sales were up for the same categories, 7%. So there's quite a reversal, quite a lot of work to do to bring those inventory levels down. Of course, being a retailer your payables do pretty match your growing inventory levels, but work to do there.</p>
          <p>In terms of property proceeds, we are bringing it down year-on-year, and you've seen in the first half, it's quite significantly down year-on-year. But the guidance for the full year, have we given the guidance on property proceeds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not with precision, but we did say it would be usefully lower than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We're trending towards a band of property profits between &#xA3;250 million and &#xA3;350 million, and we'll be at the top end but above that for the profits. And you can kind of work backwards in terms of what you think is the margin that we're making on property. That will give you a good fix in terms of what you think the cash inflow is being.</p>
          <p>Of course in the first half, as I said, we spent &#xA3;200 million in acquisitions, and we bought &#xA3;300 million worth of shares back. And if you look at the property proceeds half-year-on-half-year, we're about &#xA3;600 million lighter than we were last year. But despite that, we've matched the net debt performance of the half-year last year. The UK spent a significant proportion of this CapEx. I think it's up to 60% of its CapEx, 65% of its CapEx already. So I still feel pretty confident about achieving the net debt target by the year-end.</p>
          <p>On the Bank's deposits, it's interesting because when you look at average balances, we've got an average balance growth on deposits. Patently, as we came to the year-end, it was right after the migration that we had done, and therefore we've slowed down taking on new deposits. Since the half-year, it's picked up again. Do we need it for liquidity? Actually, not; our liquidity levels are very good.</p>
          <p>We've had an increase in our ILA target. Actually we already had that level of liquidity in place. So we don't need to do anything incremental in terms of our balance sheet. We will in terms of the quality of the assets that count for liquidity, but we're already in a good position in terms of financing the Bank going forward for our new product launches when they come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we weren't actively marketing the products because we hadn't migrated after the migration. We're taking record deposits every week now. So it's going nicely, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's finish; one last question. You were first, so last question, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. James Anstead from Barclays. Just a question on China already. I think I was one of probably lots of people in this room who came out to China and Korea at the end of last year. My impression was that you spent quite a lot of time thinking about and finessing your business model for the Chinese market, and you've decided very firmly that freehold in shopping malls is going to be a big part of that going forward. Yes, that seems to change quite a bit in the space of ten months. So can you talk about what are the change in your thinking of the market over the course of that time?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you hinted that there are probably two or three markets within your portfolio where you're not yet 100% confident of the ultimate success. Is China one of those markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, lots of things have been happening in China. The market's overheated for land, so land prices have gone up. It's difficult to secure it. The schemes are very complex; getting permission is more difficult. We know that we can grow our China retail business with leasehold hypermarkets. We're having more success now, because you've seen the changes that we made in our Shanghai estates, and when you drop them into a new leasehold store that's better located, you get a good performance.</p>
          <p>So less risky, too. I know we once talked about &#xA3;6 billion, and that's a lot to put down. So we think we can grow in a less risky way, and we think we can grow as fast. Freeholds will be part of it, of all shapes and sizes, but having tried for three years, we're only really able to contract 20 of those shopping malls. That put a bit of a dent in our program, and that's why for about six or eight months we've been looking at different ways of doing it. We found a different way. I think by the &#x2013; because it's less risk.</p>
          <p>And China really one of the &#x2013; we're much more confident now because we're seeing our mature stores are making money at the shop-door level, and that's always key for a retailer. So, no, it's not one of those two or three markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
