          <p>ladies and gentlemen, thanks for standing by.  Welcome to the Q4 '07 Earnings Call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the conference over to Phil Johnson.  Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us for Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Fourth Quarter 2007 Earnings Conference Call.  I'm Phil Johnson, Executive Director of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by Derica Rice, Lilly's CFO, and by John Lechleiter, Lilly President and COO.</p>
          <p>As we announced in December, John will succeeding Sidney Taurel as CEO, effective April 1.  Sidney will continue in his role as Chairman of the Board until his retirement at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>2007 was a very strong year for Lilly and in the course of our call this morning we will highlight important positive trends in our business including double-digit sales growth driven primarily by volume with strong performance across many geographies and products, operating leverage with EPS growing faster than sales, strong cash flow, numerous business development transactions that have provided Lilly with access to exciting molecules, and an increase of nearly 50% in the number of compounds in the clinic.</p>
          <p>You can access the Earnings Press Release and supporting materials, a live web cast, an internet based replay, and for the first time, a podcast of this conference call at lilly.com.  The replay, the supporting materials and the podcast will be available on our website through February 29, 2008.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, but actual results may differ materially due to various factors.  For example, our results may be affected by competitive developments, the timing and success of new product launches, regulatory and legal matters, patent disputes, government investigations, governmental actions regarding pricing, importation and reimbursement, changes in tax law, acquisitions, business development transactions and the impact of exchange rates.  For additional information about the factors that affect our business, refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q.  In addition, the information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community.  It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions.  Now let me turn the call over to John to give a recap of our major accomplishments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Phil.  At our analyst meeting in early December, we discussed our strong operational performance across products and geographies and we described the emphasis we are placing on execution.  With the year complete, you will see that our efforts are translating into outstanding financial results.  2007 was one of the strongest years we have had in some time and we intend to carry this positive momentum into 2008.  Before we go into the detailed results for the quarter, let me provide an overview.</p>
          <p>As we have done in prior calls, I will focus my comments on the pro forma adjusted results, which we believe provide insights into the underlying trends in the business.  This view assumes we owned ICOS as of January 1, 2006 and it excludes some items.  Later in the call, Phil will provide details on the specific items excluded, as well as reconciliations between reported and pro forma adjusted results.  Slide 2 summarizes major achievements for 2007.</p>
          <p>To begin, let me recap the financials.  Fourth quarter pro forma sales grew 16%, and fully half of this growth was from volume.  For the year, pro forma sales growth of 14% was leveraged into even greater EPS growth as we delivered pro forma adjusted earnings per share of $3.54, at the upper end of our guidance range and a robust 17% increase over 2006.  Cash flow was also strong.  We generated $5 billion in operating cash flow, enabling us to complete $3 billion of business development transactions in 2007 and to raise our dividend 11%.</p>
          <p>The other achievement I would like to highlight relates directly to my top priority as incoming CEO, advancing our pipeline.  We have the strongest mid-stage pipeline in our history and the efforts of Steve Paul and our research organization in 2007 resulted in some significant achievements.  16 new molecular entities entered clinical testing, increasing our in the clinic portfolio nearly 50% to 44 NMEs.  We received approval for five important new indications or line extensions for Cymbalta(r) , Evista, Cialis(r), Byetta(r) and Humalog(r) .  Along with our partner Daiichi Sankyo, we completed the TRITON study on prasugrel and submitted what we believe is a very compelling data package to the FDA on December 26, achieving our aggressive goal of submission before the end of the year. And we are poised to bring 14 more NMEs into the clinic in 2008, as well as start a number of important Phase lll trials.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to another important aspect of our performance, and that's operating leverage.  Slide 3 characterizes the growth in sales relative to OpEx and the trend of our gross margin percentage.  Recall that the line represents the gross margin percentage over time.  The bars represent the spread between sales growth percent and OpEx growth percent.  During periods in which sales are growing faster than OpEx, the bars are positive and vice versa.</p>
          <p>Our full year 2007 results continue the positive leverage trend. For the year, sales grew 14% versus 12% for total operating expenses.  For the fourth quarter, however, total operating expenses grew 1 percentage point faster than sales, driven by substantial marketing investments.  Previously we have indicated that while we intend to grow sales faster than costs and expenses, there may be quarters in which this does not occur because of investments we choose to make.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter we made significant investments in our DTC program for Cymbalta(r) , substantial US and OUS investments in our insulin business, a pilot DTC program for Byetta(r), promotional efforts for launching the invasive breast cancer risk reduction indication for Evista, preparation for the potential fibromyalgia indication for Cymbalta(r) , and we conducted a number of promotional pilots to identify other approaches to our marketing mix.</p>
          <p>These investments underscore our commitment to two things: first, accelerating the growth of existing products and indications and second, adequately preparing the launch of new products and indications.  On the first objective we are pleased with our investment in Cymbalta(r) , a product which gained market share more rapidly than either of its branded competitors yet again in the fourth quarter.  Conversely, our DTC investment in Byetta(r) did not fully meet our expectations.  The DTC campaign did however provide useful learning that we will apply to our future marketing efforts.  We will aggressively trim expenses from our base to make way for increased investments in those products and initiatives that show the most promise.  Again, we are intent on continuing to generate positive operating leverage and to improve productivity company wide.  At the same time, we will continue to make appropriate investments to drive future growth.</p>
          <p>Let me also take a moment to discuss the gross margin.  You can see that for the full year, the gross margin percent declined slightly from 2006.  While we originally expected to see a slight increase in the gross margin in 2007, the impact of foreign currency exchange rates was the main driver for the slight decline.</p>
          <p>In addition, through tight control, we have reduced the days of inventory on hand.  While this effort clearly helped our working capital position, it does have a temporary depressing effect on gross margins due to higher variances.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our productivity initiatives are paying off throughout the company, nowhere more so than in manufacturing.  As an example, we ceased production at our Basingstoke manufacturing site in December 2007, six months earlier than originally planned.  During 2007, including the fourth quarter, our manufacturing expenses grew significantly slower than sales.  These trends and ongoing initiatives drive our expectation for a modest improvement in gross margin percentage in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude my remarks with a highlight of how individual products as shown on slide 4, are contributing to our volume growth.  As an example of how to read the graph, Cymbalta(r)  contributes 3.6 percentage points of the 8% total volume growth.  Alimta(r) contributes 1.4 percentage points and so on.  Underlying demand trends are strong and reflect the considerable effort we have placed on execution for every brand in every region of the world.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call to Phil, to give you more in-depth review of results.  Phil?</p>

          <p>Thanks John.  Slide 5 shows key events over the last three months.  In pipeline development on December 26, 2007, Lilly along with partner Daiichi Sankyo submitted a new drug application for prasugrel to the US Food and Drug Administration.  The proposed trade name for prasugrel is Effient(tm).  The submission follows the release of results of the TRITON TIMI-38 Phase III head-to-head study of prasugrel versus clopidogrel in November.  In November the FDA approved Cymbalta(r)  for the maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.  In January 2008, the FDA approved Cialis(r) for once daily use to treat erectile dysfunction.  In October, Lilly along with partners Amylin and Alkermes announced results from the pivotal study of exenatide once weekly, showing that the once weekly formulation demonstrated superiority in glucose control over Byetta(r).  Submission to the FDA is expected by the end of the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>On the business development front, in October, Lilly acquired the rights to a portfolio of transient receptor potential vanilloid sub-family 1, or TRPV1 antagonist molecules, including a clinical compound, GRC 6211, from Glenmark Pharmaceuticals.  GRC 6211 is currently in early clinical Phase II development as a potential next generation treatment for various pain conditions including osteoarthritic pain.</p>
          <p>In December, Lilly entered into a licensing and development agreement with BioMS Medical, granting Lilly exclusive worldwide rights BioMS Medical's lead multiple sclerosis compound MBP8298.  The compound is currently being evaluated in two pivotal Phase III clinical trials in secondary progressive MS and one Phase II clinical trial in relapsing-remitting MS.  The transaction closed earlier this month.</p>
          <p>Moving on to review financial results for the quarter, worldwide pro forma sales grew 16% to 5.190 billion. We will begin with the review of the sales performance of selected products and then discuss the other lines of the income statement.</p>
          <p>Slide 6 shows worldwide Zyprexa(r)  sales increased 10% to 1.274 billion.  Sales in the US increased 11% to 609 million due primarily to higher prices and increased volume caused by variations in wholesaler buying patterns. International sales increased 10% to 665 million due to the favorable impact of exchange rates.  The impact of generic competition in Germany and Canada offset increased demand in other markets leading to OUS's Zyprexa(r)  volume being essentially flat versus Q4 2006.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 7, Cymbalta(r) sales in the fourth quarter were 628 million, up 48% compared with the fourth quarter of 2006. US sales increased 45% to 547 million due to strong demand and to a lesser extent increased prices.  International sales totaled $81million, an increase of 70% over the prior year and an 18% sequential increase over Q3.</p>
          <p>Slide 8 shows worldwide Byetta(r) sales for the quarter were $184 million, a 34% increase, driven by demand. Lilly reports half of the gross margin from US sales of Byetta(r) plus sales of pens to Amylin. Total Byetta(r) revenue recognized in Lilly's income statement was 9q million, a 34% increase.</p>
          <p>On slide 9, Humalog(r) sales grew 18% to 414 million.  US sales increased 10% to 249 million, reflecting higher demand and increased prices.  Sales outside the US increased 32% to 166 million driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, Humulin(r) sales for the quarter were up 6% to 273 million driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher prices both in the US and internationally, partially offset by lower demand in the US.</p>
          <p>Slide 11 shows worldwide Cialis(r) sales.  Global sales were up 29% to 346 million in the quarter.  Sales in the US were up 24% to 133 million due to higher prices and increased demand, while sales outside the US increased 31% to $213 million, driven by increased demand and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Moving Slide 12, Alimta(r) sales in the Fourth Quarter were 244 million, an increase of 42% over Q4 2006.  US sales increased 33% to 126 million, due primarily to increased demand.  Sales outside the US were up 54% to 118 million due to increased demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 shows quarterly Forteo(r) sales of 198 million, up 15% over Q4 of last year.  US sales were up 12% to 138 million, primarily due to higher prices, partially offset by lower volume caused by variations in wholesaler buying patterns.  International sales of Forteo(r) were up 24% to $60 million due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates and higher demand.</p>
          <p>Slide 14 shows the revenues from the products Lilly has launched this decade, Alimta(r), Byetta(r), Cialis(r), Cymbalta(r) , Forteo(r), Strattera(r), Symbyax(r), Yentreve(r) and Xigris(r).  On a pro-forma basis, these products grew 30% reaching $1.7 billion, or 33% of our sales.  On a reported basis sales of these products grew 55% in Q4.</p>
          <p>Before taking a look at the rest of the income statement, let's look at the impact of price, exchange rates and volume on the sales results.  A summary by geography on a pro-forma adjusted basis is shown on slide 15.  For the quarter, Lilly's sales growth of 16% was driven by a volume impact of 8% and a favorable impact of 4% each from exchange rate and price.  For the year, Lilly's sales growth of 14% was driven by a volume impact of 7%, a 4% favorable impact from price, and a 3% favorable impact from exchange rate.</p>
          <p>For your information, slide 16 shows the impact of price, rate and volume on a reported basis.  For the quarter, Lilly's reported sales growth of 22% was driven by a volume impact of 15%, a favorable exchange rate impact of 4%, and a favorable price impact of 3%.</p>
          <p>Now let's look at the rest of the income statement.  The acquisition of ICOS creates some complexities when comparing financial data across years.  Consistent with the approach used in prior quarters, we will provide two views of the results to facilitate analysis.  Slide 17 provides a summary of these views.</p>
          <p>The reported results for each year include all financial results as reported according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  Consequently, the impact of the ICOS acquisition appears in reported results as of the acquisition date.  Up to and including January 2007, reported results reflect our earnings from the Lilly-ICOS joint venture in other income and deductions net of tax.  Subsequent to the ICOS acquisition, so beginning in February 2007, all ICOS and Cialis(r) related revenue and expenses are shown in their respective lines of the income statement.</p>
          <p>Another review of the results is also being shown: pro forma adjusted.  This view is intended to show the trends in our ongoing operations and to provide comparable data across years.  The pro forma adjusted results reflect the reported income statement, adjusted to include charges such as the restructuring of our manufacturing operations, the reduction in expected insurance recoveries and the 2007 in-process R&amp;D charges from the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion and Ivy. And the in-licensing deals with OSI, MacroGenics and Glenmark.</p>
          <p>Reported results are also restated utilizing GAAP methodology as if Lily owned ICOS for the entirety of each comparison period.  By incorporating the impact of the ICOS acquisition into both periods, we are better able to gauge performance across time.  We will focus on pro forma adjusted results as we feel it provides better insight into the underlying trends in the business.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the pro forma adjusted income statement.  Gross margin as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter was 75.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points compared to Q4 2006.  This decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates offset in part by manufacturing expenses growing at a slower rate than sales.  Overall operating expenses increased 17% in the quarter.  SG&amp;A was up 23% to 1.8 billion for the quarter.  The increase was primarily due to increased marketing expenses in support of key products, primarily Cymbalta(r) , Humalog(r)  and Byetta(r), and the impact of foreign exchange rates.  R&amp;D expense grew 7% to $954 million or 18% of sales.  The increase was primarily due to increases in discovery research and late-stage clinical trial costs.</p>
          <p>For your information, we have provided a reported earnings statement on slide 19.  Details about our reported earnings are available in our earnings press release dated today, January 29, 2008.</p>
          <p>Slide 20 shows fourth quarter other income and deductions, which contributed $32 million, a decrease of $7 million.  The adjusted effective tax rate was 20.4% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>To help investors better understand the underlying trends in our business, slide 21 shows the adjustments made to reported earnings per share in order to arrive at pro forma adjusted earnings per share.  To calculate pro forma adjusted earnings, Q4 2007 reported earnings have been adjusted for the 98.2 million pre-tax charge or 7 cents per share for asset impairments, restructuring related to previously announced site closures and other special charges related to Zyprexa(r)  product liability, including settlements, reserves for claims not covered by settlements and defense costs.  In December, Lilly settled more than 900 Zyprexa(r)  claims.  For those closely tracking the number of claims settled, approximately 150 of these claims had previously been filed and were reported in our third quarter 10-Q.  Approximately 1,200 Zyprexa(r)  product liability claims remain outstanding.</p>
          <p>We also adjusted for the 89.0 million pre-tax charge or 5 cents per share for acquired in-process R&amp;D for compounds acquired from MacroGenics and Glenmark.  And no pro forma adjustments are required to Q4 2007 results as we owned ICOS for the entire period.</p>
          <p>The full year 2007 reported earnings have been adjusted for the following pre-tax charges.  A total of 221.2 million or 15 cents per share for asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges; 81.3 million or 6 cents per share for charges related to an adjustment to insurance recoverables on Zyprexa(r)  product liability.  The 745.6 million or 63 cents per share charge for in-process research and development related to the acquisitions of ICOS, Hypnion and Ivy, and the in-licensing agreements with OSI, MacroGenics and Glenmark.  Finally, year-to-date 2007 results are adjusted by one penny per share to show the pro forma impact as if we owned ICOS for the entire period.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call over to Derica to update you on our financial guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Phil.  Slide 22 provides a summary of our 2008 financial guidance on a pro forma adjusted basis.  The guidance is unchanged from the guidance we provided in early December at our analyst meeting.  We expect sales to grow in the mid to high single digits, driven primarily by increased volume and strong sales growth for Cymbalta(r) , Cialis(r), Byetta(r), Alimta(r) and Humalog(r) .  Gross margin as a percent of sales is expected to improve modestly compared with 2007, driven primarily by manufacturing expenses growing slower than sales.</p>
          <p>We expect total operating expenses to grow more slowly than sales with growth in the mid-single digits.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses are expected to grow in the low single digits, driven by investments in prasugrel, Cymbalta(r) , Humalog(r) , Byetta(r) and Evista for invasive breast cancer risk reduction, offset by reductions in other areas.</p>
          <p>Research and development expenses are forecast to grow in high single to low double digits.  We expect other income to contribute less than $100 million.  While it is likely to vary quarter to quarter, we also expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be approximately 23% assuming the R&amp;D tax credit is extended.  At the bottom line, we expect pro-forma adjusted earnings per share to fall within the range of 3.85 to $4 per share.  Compared to 2007 pro-forma adjusted EPS of 3.54, this represents growth of 9 to 13%.  Capital expenditures are projected to be $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Finally, recall that as we announced mid last year, we will no longer be providing quarterly financial guidance.  We realize that financial estimates will be produced by those following our stock; however, we will not comment on the accuracy of these estimates.  We believe the detailed guidance we provide for the year and the updates to this guidance we provide in the quarterly calls are the appropriate level of detail.</p>
          <p>Now this concludes our review of the fourth quarter, and we will now be happy to take your questions.  Operator, first caller please?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks very much.  Thank you for all of the detail on the financial results.  Just looking forward to next week, could you please preview the Zyprexa(r)  depo panel and help frame that for us?  Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David I will try to tackle that one.  The panel will meet on February 6.  Clearly this is going to be -- we think -- an important addition to the medicines we have available for treating schizophrenia.  It should be, if approved, the first product of this type that has the full 4-week duration.  So we think the committee is going to be interested in looking at the data in terms of how are patients switched over.</p>
          <p>They are going to want to see the, look at the efficacy data and then of course, they are going to want to consider the benefit of, the balance of benefiting risk as they consider this small reported rate of inadvertent intra-vascular administration that we talked about in New York and that we've seen to a small extent in the ongoing clinical trials.  So we think that is going to be the kinds of things that will be considered that day.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  Today you gave us two surprises, one was the sales were really strong both in the US and international markets, and that's great.  However, expenses were also much higher than market forecasts, and so with that as a backdrop, I noticed that you have not changed your expense guidance for '08 and I wondered, particularly because it's going to be about half of what you experienced in '07, could you comment on why we should feel confident that your expense guidance is realistic and could you give us some color on whether or not there are enough expense buckets that you can decrease to offset any future increased investments or Six Sigma affects and so forth?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Catherine. This is Derica.  We are absolutely confident that we will be able to continue the operating leverage in 2008 that you saw in 2007 and as Phil said in some of the opening remarks, and we actually talked about this in December as well in New York, when we moved away from giving quarterly guidance, we don't run our business kind of March to April, so we will look for the opportunities to make the right investments in the business, and so if you look at where we put those expenses in the fourth quarter behind some products like Cymbalta(r) , Humalog(r) , Cialis(r), in the case of Cymbalta(r) , we gained 30 basis points a share of market in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>For Cialis(r), we gained 60 basis points in share of market in the fourth quarter, and as John highlighted in his comments, we didn't quite achieve the goals we had set for ourselves in regards to the Byetta(r) DTC, but we will continue to make those kinds of investments where we think we have the opportunity to further drive the top line, which you saw.  Now on the flip side, we believe we also have continuing opportunities to further trim expenses and drive our productivity agenda.  We are still committed to reducing head count.  This year in 2007 we reduced our head count by over 900 employees, and by the way, we also were able to complete some of our manufacture restructurings earlier than we though, such as Basingstoke, which we completed by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>So that combined with Six Sigma, of achieving at least 750 million of expense savings in 2008, we believe we can continue to drive the operating leverage while making the appropriate investments in the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One other thing we had mentioned, Catherine, at the December call, you've heard us mention on a number of occasions is putting as many of our resources as possible into customer facing roles, so within that SG&amp;A mix, I think it's safe to assume that there will be priority placed on the selling and marketing expenses that are directly going to impact customers' perception of our products and use of our products and we would be attacking even more vigorously those expenses that are non-customer facing, typically in G&amp;A areas.</p>

          <p>Great, thank you. Just a couple quick questions on Zyprexa(r) .  First, can you quantify the impact of the wholesaler buying patterns on this quarter, maybe just where inventory levels currently stand, and again, should be expect any type of reversal in Q1?  And then on the Zyprexa(r)  international business in Canada and Germany where you are seeing the generic competition, how much erosion are we seeing in those markets at this point?  Maybe you can quantify the sales in those markets maybe versus Q4 '06, and again as we go into 2008, should we be expecting our competition to intensify there, or are we kind of seeing the full impact at this point?  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris.  I'll go ahead and take your question.  Essentially, for the wholesaler movements, in total for the US business in the quarter, it really was quite minimal.  We did see a little bit of buy in in Zyprexa(r)  and a little bit of draw down of inventory of the wholesalers for Forteo(r).  But really, we're talking very, very small numbers here, and nothing that would be out of the average or normal for what we' would expect to see for days on hand at various wholesalers.  For your question on Canada and Germany, Derica, you want to go ahead and take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  Chris, in Germany and Canada, today we see about 50% of the prescriptions in those two markets are generic prescriptions.  So that's the impact that we have seen.  In regards to quantifying them, the guidance that we give, or the insight we have given previously is that if you look at it on a total year basis going back to 2006, which was the first -- the last 12 months where we saw no generic impact, the sales in Canada was about 250 million and the sales in Germany were about 180 million.  So that will give you kind of a reference point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little more color maybe on what's happening in those markets, if it's helpful to you, in Germany &#x2013; you may not be aware, it was not until mid-November that generics were introduced.  We actually saw generics introduced by a number of companies, both for the base tablet as well as for the rapid dissolving or a dispersible tablet.  As Derica mentioned, by the end of the year, they had gotten to about 50% of the total scripts.  In Canada, it's a bit different, as you know in mid-July, we had Prince Edward Island and Ontario that went generic.</p>
          <p>We have since had Alberta join that mix.  All three of those provinces essentially do not reimburse the branded, so you have got probably 90% conversion in terms of scripts over to generic.  Quebec is the other province in Canada that has gone ahead and authorized generics, however they will continue I think through 2013 to reimburse the branded as well.  That also didn't occur until late in the year, I believe in the December timeframe, and by the end of the year it was about 10% of the scripts that had shifted over to generic.  And in Canada, there are no generics for the rapid dissolving or dispersible, and that continues to grow nicely there.  Next caller, please?</p>

The ACC, I'm not aware, not sure if you are John of any updates.  I know there may be another upcoming venue at which one of the gentlemen from Tennyroop will be speaking and we are awaiting finalization of content of what may be presented there if we can pass that along to you.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  John, I was just wondering if you could kindly address the pricing environment in the US market?  It appears that the industry in general including Lilly has been able to push through healthier price increases than have been seen in the past several years.  That doesn't seem to imply a very tough pricing environment at present, and I would appreciate your views on that.  And then separately, if you could also address the growth outlook for the animal health business?  I noticed there's been a sequential acceleration in growth during this fourth quarter.  What's driving that and should we expect that to continue into the 2008 quarters?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the pricing environment in the US remains challenging.  It is probably going to be, we expect going forward, a bit more challenging due to a variety of dynamics including, obviously, the entry of more generic product alternatives into the mix.  We have taken, I think, a very responsible approach to this and we have judged the price of our products and any decisions with respect to price increases based on the value that we believe these bring and obviously as we deal with large-payer customers, in many cases there's, as you know, a contracting negotiation, a process that ensues.  And we want to make sure that we, in any decision we make, are able to maintain good access through these important large-payer channels.</p>
          <p>With respect to animal health, you saw a big volume growth number in the fourth quarter.  About half of that volume growth came out of our core food animal business.  About a quarter of that total, I think it was 21% volume growth, came from the acquisition of Ivy Animal Health, which we did in the first half of the year and then the other quarter came from the companion animal business, the launch of Comfortis in the fourth quarter of the year.  So our animal health business had a good year, and I think the acquisition of Ivy and also the continued development of this companion animal business is going to continue to auger well for that portion, for that business unit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for taking the questions.  Derica, can you tell us what the gross margin and SG&amp;A in the fourth quarter and full year '07 would have been without the impact of foreign exchange?  And then on your '08 guidance, you're expecting only a modest improvement in gross margin when your volumes are fairly robust and the pricing environment in '08 seems to be pretty healthy.  Can you help us understand with a little bit more granularity what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi John.  This is Derica.  I can't give you too many specifics other than to say if you were to take a look at the foreign exchange impact in the fourth quarter on our gross margin, the impact alone, if we hadn't had it, you were to exclude it, we would have had improving gross margins much like you saw in the first 9 months of the year.  So I think that'll give you a little bit of sight there.  If you look at our operating expense growth, I don't have the exact detail in front of me in terms of if you look at SG&amp;A to 23%, how much of that was FX related?  Phil, I don't know...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I believe in terms of the Q4 of '07 to Q4 of '06, rough order of magnitude, you're probably talking around 20 to 25% of that increase being FX.  And then in terms of '08 gross margin, we will continue to see some compression on the gross margin as a percent of sales given the particular rate we are seeing the euro at currently.

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, I just want to follow-up on an earlier question related to US Zyprexa(r)  sales.  John, I'm still really puzzled at the size of the gap between total prescription declines and your revenue, your actual revenues reported.  And this quarter, it seems that the gap is about as wide as it's ever been, about 19 percentage points.  Maybe my math is wrong, but based on the data we're seeing, total prescriptions were down about 8% in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>So, you also say that you are no longer getting a dual benefit pricing bump as you did for much of last year and part of 2007, so can you provide better clarity on what's happening with the pricing environment, because clearly a big part of the upside for Zyprexa(r)  for a number of years, and it seems to continue, has been on the price side.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jami, this is Derica.  Let me try to maybe to provide a little bit more color of around Zyprexa(r).  Recognize when you're looking at the script data, IMS, you're picking up the retail.   The piece that you're not picking up is the institutional segment.  And if you recall, we in our repositioning of Zyprexa(r) about 18 months ago, we began to focus on the urgent patient, which is primarily focused on the institutional setting.  So that may be why you see the difference between the script trends that you're seeing that's retail focus versus the volume trends that you're seeing in our reported results.  And then also from a pricing standpoint, because we have the repositioning and the urgent patient need, we believe we've got a much better balance in terms of the value proposition to the clinician and the patient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two other factors that would have affected the full year really, and then one that would have affected <mark type="inaudible" /> Q4 in particular for Zyprexa(r) , you've had a shift over the course of 2006 to 2007 as we've gone after the urgent need patient, from lower dose to higher dose forms of Zyprexa(r), which helps the volume essentially Jami as we measure it which is in kilos.  The other thing we did see again, it was not a large impact in overall dollar terms, but there was a slight benefit to volume in Q4 because of the variation in the number of days that wholesalers were carrying at the end of December.

Is it the goal of Lilly and Amylin to actually submit the outcomes for superiority trials for LAR versus the D54s and LARs versus Actos as part of that submission?  And second, Derica in your 1.1 billion CapEx expense, is any of that actually going to the Westchester, Ohio facility?  Is it really supplying any help for the technology transfer?

For the US FDA submission we would not anticipate needing to submit data from the additional head-to-head superiority trials that we're running.  I know you didn't ask it but I would like to let you know that may be data that would be useful for the European regulators, who typically do look for it like they did with BID, additional patient exposure to make their decision.  But for the US the answer would be no, those are not required for our submission as far as we understand it.  Derica, you want to handle the CapEx?</p>

There seems to be more &#x2013; Lilly seems to be taking more of an aggressive stance with regard to external licensing than, you know, over the past year, year and a half.  Could you just comment on that in general?  And then secondly, with regard to timing of specific programs, the Type I diabetes program with MacroGenics, there appears to be multiple trials underway.  Could you just describe the pace of the data roll out there?  And in a perfect world with that program when could that program potentially be filed?  Thanks.</p>

          <p>Okay Bert, I'll get it started here with respect to licensing.  We had a good year last year, three acquisitions: Hypnion, ICOS, and Ivy Animal Health.  Five major in-license deals, all of them in man deals, including BioMS at the end of the year and also Glenmark I believe in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We've ramped up our efforts here in the company to make sure that we not only have our eyes on all these innovations that's external to us but that we're ready to seize opportunity as it comes along.  I'm pleased to say that we do see opportunity out there; obviously we're going to evaluate that carefully and make sure that any deals we do make sense for our investors.  But this will continue to be something that I will emphasize.  We have a $5 billion plus operating cash flow last year, a good strong balance sheet, and we won't hesitate to use that wherewithal if we see assets like the ones we brought in last year that look promising.</p>

Third, and I apologize for not sticking to one question here, but I think I may be one of the last callers so, the potential impact of Fosamax generics on Evista volume trends and whether or not Evista is subject to any step therapy programs in your contracting for osteoporosis prevention?

Clearly, we've been extremely pleased with the response we're getting as we go out with the invasive breast cancer risk reduction indication that we got last year. That really seems to have made both the efficacy, as well as the two-fer of being able to have not only that osteoporosis prevention, but also protection against the risk of invasive breast cancer, really building in the image of physicians, Evista. So we're very pleased with not only some of the script trends we have seen, but also some of the leading indicators we've got on customer perceptions.  John, do you want to comment?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's important to keep in mind that despite our prognostications back in '98 when we launched Evista, we still haven't seen another SERM enter the category, so from a mechanism of action point of view, Evista remains unique.  I think that's going to be helpful in a generic bisphosphonate environment. Also, our current plans are to file arzoxifene in early 2009.  So I think we've got an opportunity here to bring even potentially better therapy forward in the form of arzoxifene and continue the progression in this SERM category.</p>

          <p>Yes, thanks very much.  Could you just run us through any update on the new prasugrel study, the TRILOGY study I believe it's called, and just walk us through the timeline on that? Thank you.</p>

          <p>David, since the early December meeting, there's not an update; the team has been working since then on the actual clinical trial plan, but those are not yet finalized enough for us to come out with more specific data over and above what we had discussed at the time, around the 10,000 patients, the 30 countries, and obviously the indication in the ACS medical management.  As soon as we do have some of those discussions finalized we'll probably pick an appropriate forum to begin to share those more detailed expectations with you. Next caller please.</p>

          <p>Yes. Can you talk about what you think the impact from generic Risperdal might be on the Zyprexa(r)  franchise in the US? Do you expect there to be any access restrictions placed on your product or any incremental downward pricing pressure once generic risperidone launches?</p>

          <p>Tim, we're going to watch that very carefully, and in preparation for that, certainly their actions, we've already taken in I think that data that continues to really support Zyprexa(r) . First of all we aim to retain the broadest possible access for Zyprexa(r) to emphasize the efficacy, the superior efficacy evident in KD, the longer duration of therapy. We're gong to continue as we said earlier to highlight the urgent-need patient and to differentiate that Zyprexa(r)  in many cases is the best choice for those urgent patients. We've got good health outcomes data.  We will be emphasizing the total cost of health care for patients who are using Zyprexa(r)  versus other atypicals. We also know as we commented I think in New York that even with fail first policy, the nature of this type of disease, schizophrenia and bipolar disease, is such that people do tend to cycle through different medications, so even if there's a fail first scenario where patients would either try a generic risperidone first, I don't think this is necessarily all bad news for Zyprexa(r) , depending on how fail first is defined.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking the follow-up. On Zyprexa(r)  Adhera. Can you just comment on what percent of the current users of Zyprexa(r)  are the oral users that might be candidates for the Adhera? Are you just viewing that as a switch-type strategy? And then on risk management, on injection of the product, how will you address that issue with the FDA? And then just one follow-up real quickly for Derica on the tax rate for '08 guidance of 23%, did you say that includes the R&amp;D tax credit or excludes it? Thanks.</p>

          <p>John, on Zyprexa(r) , a long acting injectable, I think it's difficult to say what percentage of patients that are currently on the oral medication would be candidates. We know that for many patients and possibly many patients who are sort of in that urgent need category that Zyprexa(r)  currently treats so effectively, having access to a product that has four-week coverage would probably be viewed by caregivers and patients as a positive thing.  So we're looking at it being very consistent with the way that the oral product is currently positioned.  As far as risk management goes, I think there's several approaches we can take and certainly you can expect that as we further prosecute the NDA and go through the advisory committee, that'll be a subject of discussion with the FDA.</p>

          <p>We want to thank everyone for joining us <mark type="audio gap" /> this morning.  Let me summarize a few of our key points.  We are delivering on our priorities and concluded 2007 with accelerating sales growth, solid fundamentals, robust cash flow and earnings at the top end of our guidance range, bringing positive momentum into 2008.  This strong performance is broad-based across products and geographies.</p>
          <p>We expect a number of important events in 2008, including US launches now in progress of Cialis(r) for once-daily use and Humalog(r)  KwikPen plus ongoing OUS launches of Cymbalta(r)  and Byetta(r).  FDA action on prasugrel, Cymbalta(r)  for fibromyalgia, Alimta(r) for first-line non-small-cell lung cancer and the long-acting injectable formulation of Zyprexa(r) .  Submissions of prasugrel in the EU, Byetta(r) monotherapy, Cialis(r) for PAH and Cymbalta(r)  for chronic pain, and the initiation of a number of Phase III studies.</p>
          <p>In my new role as CEO, my priorities will be increasing the flow of innovative new therapies from our pipeline, engaging our customers in fundamentally new ways by focusing on improved outcomes for individual patients, continuing to reduce our cost base and improve productivity, and developing effective leaders.  At Lilly we have a sense of urgency to deliver strong results today while also reshaping the company to win for the benefit of patients and shareholders alike.  Thank you for joining us this morning, and I look forward to continuing my interaction with our investors.</p>
