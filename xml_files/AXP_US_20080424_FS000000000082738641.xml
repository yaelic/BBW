          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon, thank you for standing by and welcome to the American Express first quarter 2008 earnings conference call.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.  At this time I would like to turn the conference over to our host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Ron Stovall.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you, Tom, and welcome to everyone.  We appreciate all of you joining us for today's discussion.  As usual it's my role to remind you that the discussion today contains certain forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects which are subject to risks and uncertainties and speak only as of today.  The words believe, expect, anticipate, optimistic, intend, plan, aim, will, should, could, likely, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements included in the company's financial and other goals are set forth within today's earnings press release which was filed in an 8-K report and in the company's 2007 10-K report already on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In the first quarter 2008 earnings release and supplement, which are now posted on our website at IR.AmericanExpress.com and on file with the SEC in an 8-K report, we have provided information that describes the company's managed basis and other non-GAAP financial measures and the comparable GAAP financial information and we explain why these presentations are useful to management and to investors.  We urge you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.</p>
          <p>Dan Henry, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Express, will provide some introductory remarks highlighting the key points related to today's announcement.  Once he completes his remarks we will turn to the moderator who will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the Q and A period.  Up until then, no one is actually registered to ask questions.</p>
          <p>While we will attempt to respond to as many of your questions as possible before we end the call, we do have a limited amount of time.  Based on this, we ask that you limit yourself to one question at a time during the Q and A.  With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Ron, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today.  As you have seen in our earnings documents, despite the more difficult economic environment, our first quarter results reflect a continuation of strong business growth on a relative basis and the benefit of our diversified business portfolio.  Our multi-year investments in a broad range of business-building initiatives again yield industry-leading performance for the quarter as they have over the past few years.  As expected, earnings for the quarter were somewhat below last year.  Our strong revenue growth was offset by the impact of the more difficult U.S. credit environment and higher marketing spending compared to the lower amounts in 2007.  As we discuss the results, it's important to keep in mind that the translation of foreign currency significantly impacted reported revenues and expense growth rates, increasing each by 3%.  When you compare our results from continuing operations to the first quarter of last year, net revenue grew 11%, while income decreased 11%, and diluted EPS of $0.84 decreased 7%.  ROE was 36%.</p>
          <p>For those of you who follow revenue consensus estimates, you know that each quarter there has been some noise around the way the consensus is tabulated by some reporting services.  This continues to be the case, as it is computed in a way that is likely to be above our reported numbers.  Let me remind you that last year's first quarter included $50 million after tax from the initial adoption of FAS 155 and $39 million after-tax pension-related gain.  Both of these contributed to the year-over-year decline in income.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we returned 38% of capital generated to our shareholders through share repurchase and dividends.  We slowed our share repurchase program during the quarter in order to allow the capital generated through earnings to help fund the recent acquisition of GE's Corporate Payment Services business.  Since 1994, we have returned 70% of capital generated to shareholders, which is above our 65% long-term target.</p>
          <p>The 11% revenue growth in the quarter reflects double digit growth in a number of categories, including discount revenue, cardmember lending finance revenue, card fee revenue, and commissions and fees.  Additionally revenue growth reflected the benefit of lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Revenue continued to be driven by solid growth in cardmember spending, loans, and cards-in-force.  Given the weaker economic environment, worldwide billed business growth for the quarter was particularly strong at 14%, or 11% on an FX-adjusted basis, which, as you know, is the more important indicator of the underlying health of the business volumes.</p>
          <p>In our U.S. proprietary business, consumer spending grew 7% in the quarter, small business spending increased 11%, and corporate services volumes rose by 8%.  These growth rates, while far better than the industry, are 300 basis points lower than the growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>In total, U.S. volumes for retail and everyday spending grew 11%.  This category represented about 68% of U.S. billings.  Travel and entertainment spending, which accounts for the remainder, rose 8%.</p>
          <p>Outside the U.S., proprietary billed business grew 22% on a reported basis.  This translated to an increase of 10% on an FX-adjusted basis, reflecting 9% growth in our consumer and small business activity and a 10% increase in corporate services.  These growth rates have held up well outside of the U.S.</p>
          <p>Within Global Network Services, billed business rose 50%, driven by continued robust growth both in and outside of the U.S.  Worldwide cards-in-force rose 10%.  We added 1.6 million net new cards during the quarter and 8.1 million net new cards since last year.  This reflects 5% growth versus last year in proprietary cards and 33% growth in network partner cards.</p>
          <p>Spending per proprietary basic card rose 6% worldwide, or 3% on an FX-adjusted basis, even with the suppressing effects of substantial card additions over the past few years.  Our average discount rate of 2.57% decreased 1 basis point from last year, but increased versus last quarter, reflecting the typical seasonal impact of lower retail-related business volumes in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Net card fee revenue increased 17% due to card growth as well as higher average fees per card.  Travel commissions and fees increased 13%, driven by 16% increase in travel sales.  Worldwide lending balances on an owned basis rose 17%.  On a managed basis, balances grew 19% on 18% growth in the U.S., and 23%, or 13% FX-adjusted, growth within our non-U.S. portfolios.</p>
          <p>This is a slower growth rate in the U.S. managed loans than recent quarters due to the initial impact of various credit related actions, such as targeted line reductions for higher risk customer segments, industries, and geographies, and increased efforts in our collection and credit area; and the flow-through of slower spending growth within our co-brand, lending on charge and other credit card relationships.  These were partially offset by a slowdown in payment rates consistent with the weaker economic environment.</p>
          <p>Securitization income decreased 3%, as higher finance charge and fee revenue, driven by higher securitized loans and a lower cost of funds, were more than offset by higher write-offs and a slower increase in the valuation of our interest-only strip this year versus last year, which was mostly due to last year's FAS 115 adoption gain.  Cardmember lending finance revenue rose 19% on growth in the owned portfolio.</p>
          <p>Interest expense increased 9%.  This was due to an 8% increase in funding costs within the lending business and a 10% increase within the charge card and other interest line.  -- other interest expense line.  These increases reflect loan and business volume growth which was partially offset by the benefits related to the decrease in the LIBOR benchmark rate.</p>
          <p>Marketing, promotions, rewards and cardmember service expense increased 20%, reflecting greater marketing investment versus a relatively low level of marketing last year as well as higher volume-related reward costs.</p>
          <p>Human resource expense increased 13%, reflecting last year's pension gain, merit increases, greater benefit costs, and a 4% higher employee level, primarily related to various customer service and sales force-related initiatives in addition to last year's corporate travel acquisition.</p>
          <p>Growth in the remaining operating expense reflects the impact of increased volumes within our technology and cardmember servicing activities and shows that the underlying operating expenses continue to be well controlled.</p>
          <p>The total provision for losses and benefits increased 48% versus last year, as the charge provision rose 65%, the lending provision increased by 41% and the other provision was 51% higher.  The lending and charge provision increased due to higher write-off rates and delinquency rates, reflecting the more difficult U.S. credit environment and loan and business volume growth worldwide.  The other provision rose on greater merchant-related provision in the first quarter of 2008 compared to the Delta-related provision benefit in the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>The consolidated tax rate of 28% for the quarter reflects the resolution of certain prior year tax items compared to the 32% rate last year.</p>
          <p>With that, let me conclude with a few final comments.  Business metric performance, like growth in billed business and loan balances, continued to be in the top tier of the industry.  The gap between our growth rates and that of most major competitors demonstrates the effectiveness and ongoing benefit of our marketing and rewards investments over the past several years.</p>
          <p>Business growth also benefited from the relatively strong growth in our Global Network Services and our non-U.S. consumer and commercial card activities, reflecting the benefits of the diversity of our business segments and our business models and the balance within our results.  While losses and past-due levels within the United States lending portfolio have trended higher, our credit quality indicators compare favorably to the industry and continue to reflect the benefits of our focus on the premium market sectors.  As we have discussed before, our write-off rate calculations include principal, accrued interest, and accrued fees versus the principal only calculation that our competitors generally publish and utilize.  This serves to overstate our comparable rate by about 20%.</p>
          <p>Overall, our first quarter metrics demonstrate that the business performance was dimensionally consistent with the 2008 plan that we discussed with you back in January.  We believe we are managing credit effectively in a difficult environment, although our actions are suppressing spending volumes somewhat and will negatively impact credit metrics in the near term.</p>
          <p>The managed U.S. cardmember lending write-off rate rose from 4.3% in the fourth quarter to 4.3% (sic) [5.3%] in the first quarter.  I want to point out that the rate for March was higher than the average rate for the quarter.  Therefore, we expect the loan loss rate will be higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter.  In addition to the combined impact of our actions and the current environmental conditions will likely cause loan growth to be slower than the 16% growth assumed in the initial plan.</p>
          <p>We do not plan to update our view of our metric trends, as they continually evolve and will likely vary from our original plan assumptions as we progress through the year.  However, our performance, together with the flexibility inherent in our business model affirms, our belief that we are still tracking to the reported EPS growth assumption of 4 to 6% that we discussed earlier in the year.  This expectation is based on the economic environment that is consistent with or moderately worse than what we have experienced to date.  If conditions were to significantly deteriorate from here, we would likely be more focused on the medium to long-term strength of the franchise versus our short-term objectives.</p>
          <p>Our strategy continues to be centered on positioning us to continue to gain profitable share regardless of the environmental conditions.  And in light of this difficult environment, we believe we are prudently balancing risk against profitability and growth.  As we have discussed with you before, our ultimate goal is to continue to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging economic conditions in the best position possible relative to our payment competitors and relative to the overall industry.</p>
          <p>We will continue to be guided by our long-term on average and over time financial objectives.  Since we set these objectives in 1993, we have generally performed consistent with these goals, and in fact have outperformed them in recent years.  Given our industry leading results, and the products, customers, and geographic breadth of our franchise, we believe we are well positioned to execute against growth opportunities in a manner that continues to appropriately balance short, medium, and long-term business and financial goals.  Thanks for listening.  We are now ready to take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  We'll begin today's questions with a question from Meredith Whitney representing Oppenheimer, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one main question.  One thing that really stuck with me at your semi-annual meeting in February was the market decline you saw in consumer spending from the month of November to December, and can you comment on, I know you guys said you didn't want to do this, but can you directionally comment on what you're seeing in consumer spending?  And then remind us if you told us about the line -- line issue in terms of cutting consumer credit lines, when that took place and if that's accelerated throughout the quarter?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So we saw a 300 basis point drop in December in the U.S. consumer and small business, and as I indicated, in the first quarter we had a 300 basis point drop across our various lines of business in the U.S. compared to the fourth quarter.  I'm not going to give information month by month.  I think that's probably too detailed, but I would say that that 300 basis point drop is consistent with what, the 300 basis point drop first quarter to fourth quarter is consistent with what we saw in December.  So we have seen a continuation of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of the line reductions that we have done with regard to certain lending customers, as soon as we saw the deterioration in credit, we took a look at our credit policies and practices, and we have heightened default rates across the board.  We have also been surgical in terms of looking at certain geographies, because default rates are higher in certain geographies.  We have also looked at certain industries where they have weakness, and in those we have taken special actions as well.  So we started really as soon as we saw the credit indicators start to deteriorate, which is back in December, and we have continued that really through the first quarter in total.</p>
          <p>So the number of line reductions in the first quarter was significantly more than you would have seen on average in 2007, and we have seen probably fewer line increases, so we're trying to be very focused on balancing controlling credit properly, on the other hand, we don't want to damage the long-term health of the business, so really balancing long-term considerations for customers with the desire to control credit in the short term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  If I could just follow up with one last one, one quick one, you've seen a flurry of large caps like yourself change their funding strategy over the last few weeks or augment their funding strategy over the last few weeks.  Could you update us as to any changes you see, any tweaks you'd like to make to your funding strategy, and any changes you see to your securitization strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So we really haven't changed our strategy.  We actually fund across a number of areas, so we borrow in the commercial paper market, we borrow in the unsecured market, and then thirdly we borrow through securitizations.  So there has been an absence of availability in the unsecured 1 to 5-year market really over the last 6, 7, or 8 months, but there has been perfect availability in commercial paper.  We continue to fund there the way we always have and have not seen any price increases in that funding vehicle.  We do have availability in the unsecured market kind of 5 to 10-years &#x2013; liquidity has been there for us.  Also there is plenty of liquidity in the securitization market.  Now, in the unsecured and the securitization market, we have seen the impact of what's taking in place in LIBOR impacting our, what we have to borrow at plus the credit spreads above LIBOR in the first quarter were higher than we have seen historically.  But there is plenty of liquidity.  We have to pay up a little bit.</p>
          <p>One of the other things I'd say, I just point out that on our website, we included on the website some information about the funding we're doing, debt funding we're doing, and in there we indicated that we were going to fund this year $37 billion over the course of the year.  In fact, because of the slowdown in business, that is now 34 billion.  I point out that we funded about 7.8 of that in the first quarter, and in the first 15 days of April, we actually funded another 4.8, so there has been plenty of availability in terms of funding for us.  We think we have a very strong liquidity plan and funding plan. We're an A+, a strong A+ rated company.  I think we're well regarded in the marketplace, and we have been able to fund just fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks so much, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next we'll go to the line of Craig Maurer, representing Calyon.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Looking at the increase in your marketing expense year-over-year, I was wondering if you can comment on how much of that growth is related to higher rewards points accrual.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our rewards -- we don't split out those two numbers.  I think historically we've given a dimensional split between marketing and rewards.  I would say that our rewards costs have grown dimensionally in line with the growth in the business.  The rest of the increase is really the fact that last year we took our marketing spending down, which we explained at that time.  This year we've brought it back up to more normal levels, so the 20% increase on that line is a combination of volume-related expenses on rewards, plus higher level of marketing compared to the first quarter of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And on the credit side, the reserve coverage ratio that you have in place right now, which seems to be in line historically with where you've been, are we to assume that you're going to maintain that similar leverage -- that similar level of coverage, or will that be increasing due to, like you said, March was the highest quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the reserve coverage of delinquencies in charge card is 96% this quarter compared to 95% last quarter.  On the lending side, on a known basis, the coverage ratio was 100% in the fourth quarter, it's now 101%, and if you look at lending on a managed basis, it went from 106 to 105.  So we're keeping it in the first quarter at dimensionally a similar level than we had at year-end.  Where we'll take reserve coverage in the future will depend on the economy, and the delinquencies that we're seeing in our own business and what credit actions we're taking.  You know, when you're setting, and you also take into consideration your, what your recent acquisitions have been, so I think we're take all those factors into consideration in the future in terms of where we'll set our reserves and our coverage ratios.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And have you thought about how the GE acquisition will affect that coverage yet?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't know the answer to that question.  It's -- I guess about $4 billion of business, so I don't think it will have a dramatic impact on the overall ratios, and we'll make an evaluation of what the appropriate coverage ratios are for that particular portfolio based on historical experience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will go to the line of Bob Napoli with Piper Jaffray.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Just two questions I guess, one on the funding side.  Can you quantify the percentage of your funding that is floating rate at this point and how much benefit you got?  I understand that your spreads are up and LIBOR is up, but the Fed, obviously the Fed has cut overnight rates a lot more, so you must be benefiting.  And I was just wondering if you could give a feel of how much benefit you're getting from the interest expense side, and I would imagine that you would expect that to somewhat offset the higher credit losses that you're probably going to see this year than, versus your prior plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, so approximately 30% of our funding is fixed, either because it's fixed rate or it's fixed through hedges.  In the Annual Report I think we make a disclosure that as it relates to charge card or our fixed rate lending products, a 100 basis point drop in funding costs yields us about 225 million in benefit.  Now, you have to think about our funding costs not just where the Fed has gone, because we, actually it's the LIBOR rate that's key, and you have to factor in where credit spreads above LIBOR have gone, so I think you need to think about all of those.</p>
          <p>As it relates to our variable rate book, you have to think about it a little differently, because when we design the product, we really just want to lock in a spread, and when interest rates go up or down, that's really the cost that gets passed on to the customer.  And inherent in there is an assumption that there's a relationship between fed funds and LIBOR rates, right, because we price to our customer off of prime, which is driven by fed funds.  So now that LIBOR is not moving in concert with fed funds, that has a negative impact on us, and that's moderating the benefit that we're getting.  So over time, it will be important for us to have fed funds move back more in line with LIBOR rather than move back more in line with fed funds, so we're getting a benefit clearly, but I think you have to factor in all the things I just discussed to fully understand what the impact to us will be, and as we go forward for the rest of the year, how much benefit we get will also depend on the relationship of those two curves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it kind of your expectation, though, that that benefit is offsetting the higher provisions that you will likely have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think interest rates, as I think about our business, to the extent you stay floating, are always a built-in hedge, so if you actually have higher provision and slower growth in billings, normally interest rates would go down and actually hedge that economic condition, and we're actually seeing that happen during the current period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then a big picture question, which I'm sure you can't give me an answer, I just didn't know if maybe you could give me some kind of a thought process around American Express, but American Express is trading at around 12 times earnings, and I mean you can argue that the earnings could be cyclically get impaired more than what people currently have them modeled at, nonetheless it would be cyclically impaired to improve, and when a credit cycle improves, but you have MasterCard and Visa trading at 25 to 30 times earnings.  You're earning double what maybe a Visa might earn, but have a lower market cap, so that brings some strategic thoughts, it must, or certainly discussions within American Express about what the right structure is, and does the lending business have to be attached, or should they be separated.  I just don't know if you can give any thoughts.  I'd love to hear what thoughts you have on valuation of American Express versus competitors of yours in MasterCard and Visa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So we certainly do discuss our PE.  It's something that we're focused on, because it's an important part of our share price, which is important to our shareholders.  So you know if you went back several months ago, there certainly was a notable higher PE for us compared to the issuing competitors.  When you think about our company, I think you really need to think about the various elements of it, because we are, have some diversified businesses here.</p>
          <p>Within the issuing side, we have a charge card business, which has less credit risk attached to it, and I think probably deserves a PE that's higher than the average of the industry.  We obviously have a lending component of that, but then our B to B business we have corporate services, which certainly has less risk.  Again, it's a charge card company and should derive a higher PE from that.  And then we have our merchant business, and GNS business, which is much more analogous to either a processor such as First Data Resources or a network such as Visa and MasterCard, so I think our PE over the years has reflected that.  I think people need to focus on the fact that there are really several different elements to it.</p>
          <p>I think what we're trying to do is navigate through the short term here in the best possible condition, maintain our business momentum and come out of the slowdown in stronger position compared to our competitors, and we think if we do that, that will be in the best interest of our shareholders and hopefully get reflected in our share price over time.</p>
          <p>In terms of lending, you know, lending is an important part of our business.  We put value propositions into the marketplace that we think customers want to use, and then we let them decide whether they want to use a charge card or a lending product.  The important thing for us is that it's a spend-focused card, and that's how we design our products.  So we think all pieces of our business are an important part, and people should think about each of those components when they think about our valuation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I guess also I would just add that if you looked at the performance of the company over the last really 5 to 10 years, the performance has been really very strong, and consistent with if not better than, over recent years, than our financial targets, and I think the kind of performance that we have been able to generate is clearly differentiated from most companies in the marketplace, and hopefully that will give us some credit on the PE side over time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks.  Just wanted to make sure I understand the guidance first.  So we should just think about the '08 guidance as being 4 to 6% EPS growth and not think about the charge-off guidance and the worldwide billed business guidance you guys provided in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then secondly, I mean just in terms of the, kind of your expectations on credit quality going in, when you guys mentioned in January, and sort of how things are progressing, I just want to know how the behavior's been across segments, vintages, et cetera, just kind of if you could help us with that?  And then just finally on the tax rate, I just wanted to get a sense as to sort of what a good tax rate would be to use on a corporate level, because it seemed like it was a bit lower than what I thought it would be.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, well, on the spending side, we have really seen in the U.S. the slowdown really across all products, all vintages, all geographies.  On the credit side, it's been different.  Where we've seen the greatest impact are in geographies where the housing market has really dropped more than 5% or more than 10%.  So if, when we look at our data and we look at geographies that really have not had a drop in housing, you know, there really hasn't been that much deterioration, and where there has been a greater drop, the greater the drop in housing prices, the greater the change in, or the deterioration in credit metrics.</p>
          <p>The other key thing that we have looked at is looked at where people stand in terms of their mortgage.  So if you look at folks who either are renters or people who have had a mortgage that is older than 2003, you know, again it's been relatively modest change in terms of credit behavior.  On the other hand, if you look at folks who have a mortgage that is more recent than that, or people that, where we don't have mortgage information, that's where we've seen the greatest increase in delinquencies.  So that's kind of to give you an idea of how it's different, but it's really different on the credit side as opposed to on the spend side.</p>
          <p>To answer your question about tax rate, you know, I would generally think about a tax rate in the low 30% range, 30 to 32%.  Over the last several quarters, in certain quarters it's been lower than that, such as this quarter, and that's really driven by the fact that we've settled and resolved certain prior period tax issues that resulted in a benefit to us and therefore it lowers the tax rate in the period that that settles.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for the remainder of the year, 30 to 32% is a good run rate to use quarterly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we don't -- so I don't want to do a forecast of the rest of the year, but I would think absent some settlement related to prior years, that 30 to 32% rate is about the right rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just, I'm sorry, one more question on that credit color.  How about small business?  I mean that's an area that we've heard some of your competitors talk about seeing quite a bit of deterioration.  I was wondering if I could just get some color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so in some prior periods we've said small business was kind of a leading indicator that credit was going to deteriorate.  That wasn't the case this time.  We should keep in mind that small business, just by the nature of the business, has higher credit losses in good times or bad times than consumer.  But what we've seen so far is both a similar impact to both consumer and small business during the cycle in terms of our cardmembers.  Now in terms of our merchant business, we actually had some higher provisions in this quarter, in part because some of the small businesses that are merchants, we've seen some impact there, and so we set up a reserve to cover ourselves on the merchant side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of David Hochstim with Bear Stearns.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed a minute or so of the call.  I wonder, did you explain or discuss what the investment losses that were in the corporate sector segment were this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so as part of the sale of AEB to Standard Chartered, part of that was an agreement that we would continue to own AEIDC, which was a subsidiary in which they actually had investments and then deposits really from customers where they invested money and made payments for customers.  We would hold that for 18 months past the time of the closing.  In the first quarter, we actually had about 100 million of losses related to that AEIDC portfolio.  Now, when we first took the portfolio, it had about $4 billion worth of investments in mortgage backs and other asset backed investments.  You know, we took that down to about 1.6 billion as of year-end, and now we have now taken it down to I think 783 million.  So we have really reduced our exposure within that portfolio.  Now, 93% of the assets within the remaining portfolio are triple-A rated.  That probably gives us less comfort than it used to, but basically that $100 million loss that we had in the first quarter related to that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that a realized loss, or a mark-to-market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A combination of both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So are there other unrealized losses that haven't been...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the mark-to-market was the vast majority of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and then I know you said you're not revising guidance, but in January you did talk about a 5.1 to 5.3% charge-off range for the year, and you indicated you're above that now, and I guess is there some relationship we should think about between billed business growth and that loss rate?  I mean, billed business was a little bit higher than I think you thought in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly billed business was a strength in the fourth quarter.  I mean, it was higher than the full year guidance that we indicated.  In terms of billed business, we continue to be very cautious in terms of our outlook as it relates to the U.S.  On the other hand we're encouraged by the performance internationally.  So we'll have to see how that plays out.  You know, again, I think our performance compared to competitors compares very favorably.  On the credit side, as I said, we came in at 5.3 for the quarter, and we expect that to be higher in the second quarter.  You know where credit will go after that is very dependent on a combination of the economy and what business actions we take in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a reason to think that it won't go?  I mean, shouldn't we expect it to go higher when we look at delinquency trends.  I mean, those moved up pretty significantly in the first quarter as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think that's why we've indicated that the second quarter will be higher than the first quarter, and delinquencies, a large part of the delinquencies will play out in the second quarter.  But what happens to those people who are current or only 30 days will be very much driven by what happens in economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did you see any change in roll rates during the quarter relative to the fourth quarter, a significant change in the later-stage buckets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you can see that just total delinquencies are higher in the first quarter than they were in the fourth quarter.  We don't really give out disclosures kind of bucket by bucket.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, that's what I was asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, we don't disclose that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow up there, Dan, you did say in your prepared comments that you're seeing slower payment rates, and in response to an earlier question, you were talking about seeing more credit deterioration in the markets where home prices have dropped 5 to 10%.  Are those things, what's accountable for the change in credit results versus what your outlook was back in January?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, what I would say is I don't know, presumably payment rate is slowing down.  I don't know it by geography, but I think it's probably reasonably broad-based.  There is lots of things we can do in terms of how much we allow people to spend.  But it's completely up to them in terms of how much they decide to pay.  So we've actually had a nice move in terms of the growth in managed AR in the US.  It dropped from 23% growth in the fourth quarter down to 18% growth.  So we think that's a good trend given the environment that we're in.  But I don't have specific information on pay downs as it relates to geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then a follow-up on the comments you made earlier about the 34 billion of funding in '08.  Is that all expected to be done in the ABS market, and what kind of pricing are you seeing on ABS deals these days versus where they were a year ago, and where would you expect them to normalize and any idea when?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I don't have any idea when.  That would be nice to know that.  I think lots of people would like to know the answer to that question.  So, we don't fund solely in the securitization sector.  It's really a combination of commercial paper, unsecured debt and securitization.  In the first quarter and in the first two weeks of April, we actually borrowed certainly in the commercial paper market, but we also did a number of ABS transactions, in January we did about 3.7 billion of ABS, but we also did about 3 billion of unsecured, and if you look at what we actually did in April, again, it was a combination of ABS transactions, where we did about 2.5 billion, but we also did another 2.5 billion approximately in unsecured, so we really continue to borrow through each of those channels as we have historically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And where is the pricing on those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the pricing is certainly higher than what we saw historically.  Often we were paying 10 to 20 basis points above LIBOR.  Back in January, early January, we, on a 3-year deal, we paid 45 basis points above LIBOR.  In February on a 10-year deal, we did 126 basis points above LIBOR.  Then if you came back into April, they came back a little bit.  We did some 2-year ABS at 95 basis points above LIBOR.  We did a 6-year deal at 140 basis points above LIBOR, and then we did a 1-year deal at 70 basis points.  So it really depends on the maturity or the length the debt's going to be outstanding, but I would say it's come back a little bit in April compared to where we were in the first quarter.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just, I know you said that your expectations at this point are based on an economy that looks similar to ours or maybe moderately was worse, but would you mind just quantifying what that means in terms of nominal GDP and unemployment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I won't try to put either an unemployment number on significantly or a GDP number.  I think certainly if it moves -- if unemployment moves up a little bit or GDP slides a little bit, I think we would stay with our current thoughts about where we're tracking in terms of EPS.  If they were to move notably, and I'm not going to put a percentage on that, then that will have an impact on our business decisions, and at that junction we'd have to decide is the correct thing to do is pull back on spending and continue to track towards 4 to 6%, or should we be more focused on continuing to spend at comparable levels, move away from that EPS number, and be more focused on continuing to have strong business momentum.  No matter what the facts are, we'll be very focused on continuing the business momentum we have and investing at a level that will enable us to continue to take share, just as we have over the last several years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I guess could you just help me to think about how, as an outside observer of the company, we can make a judgment about whether the broader economy is moving in a way that's consistent with your expectations or perhaps worse than?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think I've tried to indicate that I'm not an economist.  We don't have any economists in American Express, so I really don't try to forecast where the economy is going.  What I try to do is set up a plan based on a certain set of economic assumptions, and then we have a contingency plan, either positive or negative, depending on which way the economy moves.  Now we could take a very dire forecast of the economy and really pull back on spending now.  We've chosen not to do that, because if it doesn't really move down, then we would have missed the business opportunity.  So I think the thing that's important is us to know what actions we'll take, to either spend more money or less money, depending on where the economy goes, and be ready to move quickly in that direction, and we have those plans.  So I'm not trying to forecast the economy, but I'm ready for a variety of scenarios, so that we can operate in the most positive way going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what would be, and this is my final question, but what would be, if things were to get worse, what would be the first two actions that you would look to take?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we have a variety of actions that we could take, including how much we spend on marketing, how much we spend on technology, how much we spend on consultants, contractors, just what our overall operating expense levels would be, so those are all things we'll consider, but we don't consider them in isolation.  We have to consider them in terms of if we take those actions, what will be the impact on near-term metrics and the mid-term health of the business.  And we'll factor all those things together in determining whether we actually reduce expenditures or whether we decide to stay where we are or increase them.  The other thing is, another barometer, is just what we're doing with credit.  So we could, depending on where the economy goes, we could tighten up on credit further; we may assess that at this point it's better to actually loosen up on credit and let more billings come through, so our total objective will never be just one line item in the P&amp;L, our objective is not to have, for instance, the lowest possible provision rate, it's really to make decisions that have the greatest economic gain over time.</p>

          <p>And we have a question from the line of Mike Taiano with Sandler O'Neill.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking my question.  Dan, how should we view the 70 million payment that you received from Visa this quarter?  Should we just assume that that was reinvested in the marketing line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Visa's payments that we'll receive for the next four years we really consider to be part of our ongoing operations.  In some quarters, we'll fully reinvest it.  In others, we won't.  In the first quarter, we came into the year really very cautious about what was going to take place.  So we actually only approved certain limited spending against that 70 million.  We were actually comfortable doing that, because, as part of our regular plan, we had planned to actually increase marketing expense quite a bit compared to last year.  So I think each quarter we'll make an evaluation about how much we'll spend.  Now we have already approved some spending over the balance of the year of those Visa funds, and then after that, each quarter we'll make an evaluation of whether we're going to approve more of that for investment spending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And could you just maybe give us a little bit of color on what's going on with utilization rates on both the consumers and small businesses?  Are you seeing those utilization rates going up over the last 3 to six months let's say, or have they been basically stable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So utilization rates are curious.  I mean, customers kind of self regulate themselves.  Customers generally only like to take their line up to 50, 60, 70% of their total line.  I think they always like to keep some for a rainy day.  Quite frankly, when someone hits their line, that's an indicator to us that we need to be very cautious about them in terms of payment behaviors and whether we consider actually increasing the line or not.  So I don't know that we've seen a marked change in the utilization percentage.  Certainly to the extent we've reduced lines on people, that clearly has had an impact to help our credit, but it's probably also had an impact in terms of reducing spending in the first quarter in those categories where we have actually reduced lines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then just last question, where do you guys stand with what's going on with the airlines?  Are you guys withholding more cash these days, given the high price of oil and some airline bankruptcies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we evaluate all airlines on an individual basis, so they are very big customers of ours.  As you know, we have exposure, because to the extent a cardmember buys a ticket, that cardmember pays us, we pay the airline, and to the extent they're not going to fly for a week or two months, during that time we basically have a, frankly a receivable from that airline, but if they go into -- they were to liquidate, we wouldn't collect it.  So over the years, we have been very focused on this.  When appropriate, we do hold back to mitigate whatever exposure we have.  Over the years, from time to time we have had small losses, but we have never had any large, significant losses as, in the airline industry, so we don't have a blanket policy.  It's airline by airline.</p>

          <p>We'll go to the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just getting back to a couple of earlier questions, when you said that the expectation was for higher losses but similar earnings, I guess, would you say that the steps that would be needed to offset those higher losses already were taken in the form of falling interest rates, or do you have to make changes on the marketing front on top of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I didn't make any forecast for the full year as it relates to credit losses.  I simply indicated that in the second quarter we think write-off rates are going to be higher than they were in the first quarter.  So our assessment of the full year and tracking to the 4 to 6%, takes into effect everything that is happening, from billings, from fees, finance charge revenue, interest rates, investment spending, operating expenses.  So we factor all those things together.  We believe we're still tracking to the 4 to 6% EPS for the year.</p>

          <p>And we have a follow-up from Meredith Whitney with Oppenheimer.  Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This will be our -- we'll take one more question after this.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I couldn't help myself.  A two-parter, I'll cheat with a two-parter.  You guys say you don't have internal economists, yet the external economists and the Fed and whatnot are known to call you and ask for guidance.  So I'm wondering, wouldn't you have an ability to see, from a behavioral standpoint, further out into a couple of quarters and comment on that?  And then with respect to the guidance on the losses, the losses are accelerating, so why would you assume that they would do anything other than stabilize at best if not accelerate further, as the core fundamentals in the environment deteriorate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So we certainly have a very good window within the quarter about what is taking place, not only month by month, but day by day, and we can see what the trends are, and from that, we can have a window a little bit into the next month or two, but whether, what's going to happen beyond that is going to be very dependent on what customers view the economy is, as opposed to our view of the economy, so it's really going to be their behaviors that are going to impact it.  So we have a little bit of a window, but I don't think it's a long-term window that extends to the third quarter or the fourth quarter, and so on that basis, so certainly all of the decisions we make we take into consideration everything we know, but we don't have an economist in-house, and we're really picking a scenario around which we plan, and then we have contingency plans, either up and down around that.</p>
          <p>In terms of credit losses, as I have said, the large is higher than the average.  We have a view of what's going to happen in the second quarter because of roll rates in terms of what's taking place there, what's likely to happen in the second quarter.  But once you get beyond that, it gets a lot more difficult, because if you're going to have high delinquencies out there, it's going to be based on the behavior of the customers that are currently either current or 30 days, and only time will tell what their performance is actually going to be.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the bigger wild card is spending and the shortness of your &#x2013; because if it goes beyond 30 days, you guys know where it's going?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So in the very near-term, I think we know where it's going.  We certainly also listen to all the external information that's out there, and what economists are predicting.  But as we know today, there are one group of economists that have a very dire forecast, and there's another set of economists that think the slowdowns are only going to last for a short period of time, and it's hard to figure out which is actually going to be the case.</p>

          <p>I'd rather listen to you guys than economists.  Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so let me just make a few final, share a few final thoughts before we sign off, which is, despite the more difficult environment, we generated strong business growth during the quarter and metric performances in the top tier of the industry.  While we continue to be cautious about the U.S. economy, we believe we are prudently balancing risk against profitability and growth.  Our goal is to ensure that American Express navigates through these challenging conditions and emerges on a stronger footing relative to the competition.  So thanks everyone for joining us, and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.</p>
