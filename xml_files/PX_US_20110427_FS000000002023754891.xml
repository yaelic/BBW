          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the First Quarter 2011 Praxair, Incorporated Earnings Conference Call. My name is Michelle and I'll be your coordinator for today. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Michelle. Good morning. And thank you for attending our First Quarter Earnings Call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our web site at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on Page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference. In addition, please note that the comparisons are to prior-year results, which include an adjustment in 2010 and these reconciliations to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendices to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Jim and I will now briefly review our first quarter results and future outlook, and then we'll be available to answer questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kelcey. And good morning, everyone. Praxair began the year with another record quarter as the manufacturing economy in the U.S. began to recover, augmenting our long-term growth initiatives in emerging markets, energy, and the environment. Consequently, we delivered earnings per share growth of 18%, which is the high end of our long-term earnings growth forecast range of 12% to 18%.</p>
          <p>Overall sales growth was 11%, driven primarily by volume growth in both our base business and new project start-ups. We're beginning to see some opportunities to improve pricing, particularly in Asia and South America, where inflation has crept up to the 5% range. We were also able to increase overall price in the U.S. Most importantly, we continued to deliver earnings leverage, with operating profit growing faster than sales and EPS growing faster than operating profit. This is due to our unrelenting focus on productivity, which drives margin, and cash flow, which drives earnings.</p>
          <p>New project signings in the quarter accelerated to about $500 million, bringing our onsite backlog to 40 projects representing about $2.5 billion in capital investment. As we continue to sign more projects and complete the ones in our backlog, on budget and on schedule, we'll continue to drive double digit earnings growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Now please refer to Slide 3 in our presentation for a summery of our first quarter results. Sales this quarter were $2.7 billion, up 11% versus the prior year quarter. Higher volumes contributed 8% growth and price contributed 1%. Volume growth was strongest in Asia, followed by South America, North America, and Europe. Pricing opportunities are improving with capacity utilization increases and are reflected in Asia, South America, and North America. Sequentially, sales grew 3%, also due to higher volumes, price, and currency. Overall volume growth of 1% reflects seasonal effects of the Lunar New Year, Carnival in Brazil, and customer turnarounds in North America, which are typical during the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit was $591 million in the quarter, up 17% from the prior year, and the operating margin rose to 21.9%. The increase was driven primarily by higher sales volumes, price, and ongoing productivity initiatives. Net income was $398 million, 17% above the prior year quarter and earnings per share grew 18% to $1.29. Earnings per share grew faster than net income due to share repurchases under our 1.5 billion share repurchase program authorized in the middle of last year. $835 million remains available under this program, which we expect to complete by the middle of next year. EBITDA of $844 million grew 14% from the prior year. During the first quarter, we extended the maturity of our debt profile by issuing $500 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 4.05%. Our debt-to-capital ratio for the quarter was 47.2% and debt-to-EBITDA was a strong 1.7. After tax return on capital for the quarter was 14.4% and return on equity was 26.6%.</p>
          <p>Now I'll review our results in North America, which are summarized on Page 4. Sales in North America were $1.3 billion, 8% above the prior-year quarter, due primarily to 6% volume growth. Merchant liquid and packaged gas volumes both showed growth versus the prior year. Underlying sales including price increased 7%, primarily driven by the manufacturing, chemical, metals, and energy end markets. We completed the divestiture of U.S. Home Care in early March, which decreased sales by 1% versus the prior-year quarter. Sequential sales increased 2%, primarily reflecting the continued steady recovery we are seeing in merchant and packaged gases. Onsite volumes were impacted by the timing of hydrogen customer turnarounds.</p>
          <p>Merchant sales grew 10% from the prior-year quarter and grew 3% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from the energy sector, some of which is seasonal. Natural gas fracking in Canada remained strong due to fracking for natural gas liquids; however, these volumes will decline during the second quarter as they do each year with the spring thaw, which makes it too difficult for the trucks to access the sites. Oil well service volumes also increased in Mexico with the higher price of oil driving increased activity from Pemex.</p>
          <p>Merchant pricing trends for all products are positive, with some momentum from recent price actions. As these contracts are typically of a 3 to 5 year duration, our ability to increase the price is impacted by the timing of the renewals of the contracts. We expect to realize low single-digit percentage impact from pricing actions in North America this year.</p>
          <p>North American packaged gas sales were 9% above the prior year and 2% above last quarter, reflecting the continued strengthening of the manufacturing environment. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business, same store sales were 11% above last year. Gases and hard goods were both higher, with hard goods continuing to grow faster than gases, as expected during an economic recovery cycle. However, overall sales are still below peak from 2008, providing additional upside as the recovery continues. In addition, the pipeline of opportunities for potential small acquisitions of distributors is picking up again.</p>
          <p>Volumes in Mexico grew from the prior year due to stronger demand from energy and manufacturing customers. Operating profit in North America was $322 million. This reflects strong operating leverage versus the prior-year quarter as a result of higher volumes, price, and benefits from ongoing productivity initiatives.</p>
          <p>Our North American backlog is growing from energy and manufacturing projects. This includes the Tennessee Pipeline Complex expansion that we announced last month to supply Nucor Corporation, Valero Energy Corporation and the growing requirements of merchant customers in this region. In addition, proposals for smaller plant opportunities are increasing.</p>
          <p>Please look at Page 5 for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe were $343 million, and excluding foreign currency up 4% from the prior year, driven by 3% volume growth. In our Europe segment, due to local &#x2013; current local economic conditions, sales results continue to vary by country and by distribution method. In Spain, onsite and merchant volumes grew year-over-year and sequentially, primarily in the metals, food and beverage, and chemicals markets. Packaged gas remains slower to recover as construction and net fab remain weak. Construction was over-built prior to the recession, and credit remains constrained.</p>
          <p>Italy is growing modestly with improved trends in medical oxygen pricing. German volume trends as compared to last year are positive across all three distribution methods. Growth was strongest in manufacturing, metals, and the chemical end markets. Operating profit was $65 million compared to $67 million a year ago, primarily due to negative currency effects.</p>
          <p>Page 6 shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $558 million, up 22% from the prior year quarter. Excluding currency and cost pass-through, underlying sales grew 14% versus the prior year quarter from 10% higher volumes and 4% higher price. Merchant and packaged gas volumes grew 7% year over year and 2% sequentially due to the local manufacturing rebound. Onsite volumes grew year over year and sequentially due to strong auto demand within the metals end market during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The cost inflation that began to arise during the fourth quarter of last year is continuing, and power and distribution cost recovery remains a significant focus for our Brazilian team. Operating profit in South America was $133 million, an increase of 22% versus the quarter a year ago. Underlying operating profit grew primarily due to higher volumes and higher pricing. Our project opportunities in South America remain strong. During the quarter we signed and added several projects to the backlog in the metals, chemicals, and manufacturing end markets. These projects are located in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and Argentina.</p>
          <p>Slide 7 shows our results in Asia. Asia had a very strong quarter year over year. Sales of $310 million were 20% above 2010, largely due to 14% volume growth. Onsite and merchant volumes in China, India, and Korea grew from stronger demand for metals, electronics, chemical customers, and new plant start-ups. Merchant volumes grew over 20% year over year. We are growing the business by bringing our applications technology into China, India, and Korea for opportunities such as oxy-fuel that utilizes 100% oxygen fuel as opposed to air fuel at various lead, copper and aluminum melters to save energy and reduce emissions. Merchant pricing trends remain positive, especially in certain geographic areas with tight argon supply.</p>
          <p>Asia's operating profit increased to $46 million, or 35% from the prior-year quarter. Operating profit increased faster than sales due to the effect of higher volumes, price, and ongoing productivity initiatives. New project opportunities in Asia continue to be robust. Last night we announced a 5,000 ton per day atmospheric gases project to supply oxygen, nitrogen, and argon at a major chemical industrial park in Chongqing, the largest and fastest-growing city in inland China. This project is being structured as a Praxair-controlled joint venture with the parks developer. The park will house about $5 billion in chemical facilities including a new state-of-the-art MDI facility being constructed by BASF, who will be the primary customer. In addition, we signed long-term supply agreements for a significant electronics customer in Korea, and Praxair India won a contract to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Usha Martin Limited.</p>
          <p>Our results for Surface Technology are shown on Page 8. PST sales this quarter were $157 million, up 15% year over year. Coatings for jet engines were strong, particularly EBPVD. The industrial gas turbine and industrial coatings markets are starting to strengthen. The fourth quarter operating profit and margin improved due to our higher volumes.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call back to Jim, who will discuss our global end market trends and our updated earnings guidance for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Kelcey. Please turn to Page 9, which shows our global end market trends. This page shows year-over-year sales growth for our major end markets excluding currency, acquisitions, divestitures and natural gas pass-through, so it represents real organic growth from price and volume. We've included the sequential growth numbers next to the year over year quarter so you can get a sense for the comparisons.</p>
          <p>Growth in the energy market primarily reflects higher oil well services in Mexico and Canada and hydrogen sales to refineries. The sequential decline was a result of a number of refinery turnarounds, which is typical on the Gulf Coast during the first quarter. Longer term, hydrogen demand from refineries continues to be strong because refiners need hydrogen for desulphurization of crude to make low sulfur diesel and other middle distillates. We expect future growth to come primarily from new refinery investment in overseas markets for upgrading and new capacity. Potential number and the size of these projects is large, so we continue to see hydrogen as a significant growth driver for us. Sales in this market also include sales for enhanced oil recovery and gas well fracturing.</p>
          <p>The electronics sector continues to be very strong. We signed a significant new onsite contract during the quarter and now have three new world-scale high-purity nitrogen plants under construction in Korea, which will continue to boost growth over the next several years.</p>
          <p>Chemicals sector in the U.S. is benefiting from low natural gas prices and rising demand. It's also grown significantly year-on-year as it represents the largest share of our capital spending in China. Global steel production in the first quarter improved sequentially, in line with seasonal demand in North America as the fourth quarter is typically slower due to holiday shut-downs. China exported more steel as the price of steel rose in North and South America; and South America grew due to increased auto demand, even with the higher steel prices. Our outlook is for modest growth to continue in 2011.</p>
          <p>Sales to manufacturing were 14% above last year and 7% higher than the fourth quarter. This was driven by the uptick in U.S. manufacturing and particularly in sectors like machinery. Aerospace is beginning to recover, particularly for our PST business, and as deliveries finally materialize on the Boeing 787 using GE GEnx engines, we expect our electron beam vapor deposition business to pick up.</p>
          <p>Now please look at Page 10 for earnings guidance. Our earnings guidance for the second quarter is for EPS of $1.33 to $1.38. We're forecasting improvement from the typical first quarter seasonal slow-downs in South America and Asia, as well as modest sequential volume growth overall. We're raising 2011 full-year earnings per share guidance to a range of $5.35 to $5.45, which is 13% to 15% growth from our 2010 adjusted earnings of $4.74. We continue to expect sales to be in the area of $11 billion, roughly 10% above 2010.</p>
          <p>Our expectations for capital spending are in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion due to the projects signed in the first quarter. About 20% of this spend is maintenance capital for our base business; we spent another 5% for cost reduction projects such as improving energy efficiency of our plants by upgrading compression equipment to turbomachinery. We'll typically look for a 3 year payback on these projects. But the remaining 75% of our capital spend, or approximately $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, is for new production plants under long-term contracts with customers, which will deliver sales and earnings growth for the foreseeable future. Our capital spending guidance is driven by a strong project backlog of 40 large projects with a capital value of over $2.5 billion. Projects are all under construction with scheduled start-up dates from next quarter through late 2014.</p>
          <p>Our outlook is positive for nearly all of our market sectors, product lines, and geographies. The U.S. is finally emerging from the recession as capital investment and business spending has picked up substantially. In Europe volumes are picking up slightly or are being lost to falling prices as a result of intense competition between the two major industrial gas companies there. China, Korea, India, and Brazil continue to grow at a break-neck pace. As inflation creeps up in their economies, we'll be working diligently to raise our prices to cover our costs.</p>
          <p>And finally, I'd like to announce that we will be hosting an Investor Field Trip in the Chicago area on June 22. The primary focus will be on hydrogen and pipeline enclaves and we will visit the two world-scale self-performed hydrogen units recently commissioned at the BP Whiting refinery. Additional details will be made available over the next couple of weeks. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Jim, if I look at your project activity, it fluctuated last year within a pretty narrow range, plus, minus $100 million a quarter. In 1Q you had a larger jump in dollar value as well as the number of projects. Can you comment on your outlook for the balance of the year there and maybe give us some color on number of projects in and out and the mix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, Kevin. Basically in any given quarter, our booked capital spending will be somewhat lumpy depending on which projects or which stage of their construction. But we expect through the course of the year, CapEx with the guidance that we gave about 1.6% to 1.8%, which would be a significant increase over last year and probably a record level for us. What's been happening is there is a tremendous number of projects that we are in the process of doing <mark type="ph" /> FPL1 and FPL2 (19:05) cost estimates for and working on proposals. And that's over $5 billion worth of work. Now, not all of that's going to happen. We're not going to win it all. And all those customers are not going to build those projects. But it's a similar comparison to what you might call our opportunity set in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>We added about $500 million of projects in the first quarter and started up about $200 million or $300 million so that brought the backlog to $2.5 billion and we'll probably add a significant amount more in the second quarter and the third quarter as well, as some of these contracts get signed with customers.</p>
          <p>The locations are all over the world, about two-thirds in emerging markets, with about 15% each in Korea, India, China, and South America and about 25% in the U.S. and 15% in Europe. And then in terms of end markets, it's about 30% energy, 10% electronics, 13% chemicals and about 16% metals and about 30% in manufacturing and kind of all other categories. So that gives you a pretty good breakdown of where the backlog is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And second question if I may, Jim, on South America. Looks like your price mix contribution there accelerated to 4% from 2% last quarter. What is driving that? And how does it compare to the higher inflation in costs that you referenced?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Well, there's accelerating inflation in South America. And that applies to labor, particularly, and materials but it also applies to electricity pricing. When we do the pass-through of electricity pricing that doesn't show up as a price, that shows up as &#x2013; in our pass-through category. But we are able to increase price to offset the inflation that's going on. And I think we'll continue to be able to do that going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. One of your competitors reported some plant operating problems in Q1. Were you able to pick up some additional business in North American merchant this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, I'm really not &#x2013; I realize, I know that they did report that, but I am not aware of where those operational problems could have been. And it wasn't, certainly wasn't an opportunity for us to pick up any business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the end market strength that you saw in metals, manufacturing, chemicals and so forth, could you &#x2013; are those run rates &#x2013; can we expect the strength of those to continue for the rest of the year? What's your outlook on some of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the growth is a combination of what I'll call base business growth with just higher volumes to existing customers as well as start-ups of new plants. I think the base business growth is probably going to be a little slower during the rest of the year if you're looking at quarter-on-quarter comps with the prior year because of &#x2013; and last year we had a pretty significant run up as well. But we'll still see positive comps, I think, in all the markets, particularly since we're bringing new projects on stream.</p>
          <p>I'd say basically right now that we've, at least in those three markets, electronics, chemicals and metals, you know volumes have come back to pre-recession levels, in North America anyway, not necessarily in Europe. And they've exceeded pre-recession levels in Asia. And about the same as pre-recession levels in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In manufacturing, which is more heavy manufacturing, metal fabrication, machinery and so forth, it was the last sector to come out of the recession. And it's still not really up yet. For example, our packaged gas business, volumes are still 10% below pre-recession levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on Service Technologies; your margins were very strong in Q1. Do you think that's sustainable for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do. I think that there's two things going on in that business. About a third of its sales go to the industrial markets and about half of that is in Europe. And capital spending in Europe is very slow right now, but it is speeding up. And so I think we'll get a good lift, not only in sales but higher margins with the production increases. And then we've got a lot of opportunity for more volume with very strong operating leverage in both industrial gas turbines, which were off last year significantly and are going to come back, as well as the jet engines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi Financial. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Jim. Jim, your Asian margins declined about 140 basis points. Is it a raw material cost inflation issue? Or what's going on there in terms of pricing in Asia, given all the capacity, working capacity that's been added?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>He's talking about Asia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Asia. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about Europe. No, I think Asia, Asia margin percentage is typically low in the first quarter because we have the &#x2013; the Chinese or Lunar New Year, which significantly reduces the day count of the first quarter and reduces your volume in the first quarter. You can see volume's off 2% sequentially. That's just a normal seasonal thing and what happens is when the volume goes down like that, on a quarterly basis because of day count, your operating margin percentage goes down because you've got operating leverage in that operating margin. And so when you get back up, as we'll be in the remaining quarters, the operating margin will go back to the high teens.</p>

          <p>Good morning. Two questions this morning, first on Latin America. Can you discuss the market opportunity for hydrogen projects and what market share you think Praxair will capture going forward? And second question is, what is the current pricing trends in U.S. argon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. The answer to your first question, the major oil companies in South America that, primarily we're talking about Petrobras, are building several new grass roots refinery projects which will all be very, very hydrogen intensive. And we're working very closely with them and expect to most likely be the supplier of that hydrogen, but they also have the opportunity to build it and own it themselves. So that kind of remains to be seen. And I didn't get your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just what are the current pricing trends in U.S. argon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Pricing trends in the U.S. are good, especially coming out of the recession. We're getting a couple percentage point overall pricing in merchant and argon is part of that. And we expect that to tighten up a lot further because a lot of the argon goes into the construction or welding and heavy manufacturing, which in my mind has been the slowest part of the recovery and is now really stepping up. So I'm expecting that argon, which is really the only product in our portfolio that has somewhat volatile pricing, to go up significantly going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John McNulty. You started talking about this a little while ago but the Europe margins seem to be a bit weak year over year and sequentially. Could you elaborate a bit on why and when we might see it pick back up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Remains to be seen. I think that what has to happen in Europe is they got to get out of this &#x2013; the worry about the euro and worry about Spain and Italy because there's very little credit available in Spain and Italy and people are just not spending money on capital investments. And that's what's hurting our business and our margin there. Our packaged gas business is down about 30% from pre-recession levels and &#x2013; so if we could get a little bit more capital spending going on in Europe I think our business would improve significantly, both in terms of growth and higher margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And a quick follow up. Besides the power outages that you saw in Japan in the quarter, do you expect to see any further impact from the events in Japan to either Surface Tech or to any of your electronics customers in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really don't. Maybe by coincidence but we really don't have much business in Japan. It's always been a fairly low margin region of the world and therefore we haven't really set up much business there. And as you know, we really focus on a high density strategy to get a high return on capital so that's part of the reason why we're not there. So we're really not expecting any significant impact overall from the earthquake and the power outages and so forth.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, in terms of the projects you're bringing in that's building up your backlog, are the returns on those staying about the same? Are they accelerating maybe, given things are a little bit better in the economy these days?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the returns are about the same. The average in the backlog is about 16% and that's pretty much what we're signing on average for new projects. Some of them above that, some of them below it. But no real change in the average IRR in projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then in terms of your Hydrogen business, you talked about pretty nice future backlog there for the next several years. What type of growth will that business see potentially, let's say over the next 3 to 5 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm guessing probably about 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends on which of the new projects that we sign, and we're in negotiation on quite a few as we speak today. But I'm guessing 3 years out about 20% per year growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And last question on PDI, same-store sales was pretty impressive in the quarter, is that a run rate that you should continue to see for the next couple quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm expecting it to accelerate in the next couple quarters, particularly on the gas side. What we've seen in packaged gases as the economy is finally bouncing back, is that the cyclicality and then right now the improvement in the hard goods side of the business, which is a lower margin and not that attractive side of the business for us, but hard good sales are up more than gas sales. So I expect both the margin in that business and the same-store sales to be going up.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I had a couple questions. To follow-up on PDI, I think you said sales were up 11% and same-store was 9%. Does that imply therefore a 2% lift from acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We don't have much change in acquisitions in PDI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would the currency, perhaps, a strong loonie help here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's just &#x2013; it's hard goods driving that. Gas sales are more like 8%, but the hard goods are up 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then looking regionally, it looks like Asia is about to overcome Europe in terms of sales, but not in terms of profits. Is there potential for margins in Asia to pick up over time? Or is that just, given the nature of the business, the nature of the mode of supply mix, just going to be a lower margin area for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Margin in Asia will definitely pick up over time, and what you have to understand is that most of our plants in Asia were commissioned in the last five years, let's say. We've been there for 15 or 20 years, but most of the CapEx in the last couple years. So at this point we don't have anything that's fully depreciated in Asia, and we have a lot of startups going on. So the startups going on is, in the short term, compressing the margin. And so there's nothing different structurally in the business in Asia versus anywhere else in the world. The only thing that is a little bit different is the higher proportion of electronics, but most of our electronics is large on-site and we've got roughly $300 million, $400 million in the backlogs just specifically for Samsung on large onsite. So when those come on stream, we'll get even higher margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, if I may, the real has been very strong. It's helped you in terms of currency effect. Are you concerned about the company &#x2013; the country's attempts to control that? Will that have an influence on your sales growth going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. A lot of people talk about that, and it's certainly something that the commodity exporters in Brazil are concerned about. But so far it hasn't had any impact that we can detect. Consumer spending is very, very strong in Brazil right now. And an interesting thing that's happening is that I think I just read that China has overtaken the U.S. as Brazil's major trading partner, and that kind of means if you have inflation going on in China, that Brazil will always be competitive with China, even at stronger exchange rates. So I'm not concerned about that. I think that the economy is continuing to grow rapidly. They have a lot of work to do on the infrastructure and the refinery side, the oil side, the World Cup coming there and the Olympics going there; they've got their hands full in Brazil right now.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Brian Maguire on for Bob. Just a question on North American margins; you know, showed good year-over-year improvement there. I'm just wondering if you could kind of quantify how much of that was just lower natural gas prices and lower pass-throughs? And how much of an impact that the mix shift to the hard goods which have a lower margin had to dampen them? And if the year-over-year gain for this quarter is sustainable? What's your kind of outlook there for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the year-over-year gain in margin is totally driven by getting operating leverage on the volume growth. And generally what we're seeing is volume growth in our base business, we're getting about 30% operating margin leverage on that, so that's the driver there and I don't see that going down any time soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And then on the recently announced deal in Chongqing, I was wondering if you could kind of size that deal? I know it's a couple years out but maybe size it in terms of CapEx or sales contribution that you'd expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm not going to go into the cost of the plant, but basically it's 5,000 tons per day of oxygen. We're using two of our standard 2,500 ton per day plants, and it should start up in 2.5 years. And it's basically a new chemical park that's being built by the developer, very much like the Chongqing Park near Shanghai, and we really have the inside track on being the gas supplier in the park. And the first major customer is going to be BASF for their MDI facility. So that's just another example of the kind of growth that we're seeing in China, and the fact that it's inland in the fastest-growing city area means that there's still a lot of up side there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Was that one of the big deals that you referenced last quarter that was taking a little bit longer to get signed and done? Or are there a couple of other big deals still in your pipeline that you were expecting to close in the quarter that fell through to the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is one that we've been &#x2013; it probably had been pushed out by almost a year from the first time we started working on that until we got to the signing. So that is exactly what happened, and that tends to happen at a lot of these newer grass roots projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Jim. You said in your opening comments that over the next year or so you'll spend $835 million on share repurchase. So that would knock your share count down by about 8 million, but I would imagine there are some share issuances that should offset that. So is it fair to say that if you execute the program maybe your average shares would drop by about 5 million shares over the next year? Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably somewhere in that range, that's about right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your tax rate was 28% this quarter. As you see your growth profile changing geographically over the next year or two, does that change the tax rate and give it an upward bias or a downward bias? Or does it keep it where it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it'll stay more or less where it is. The areas where we're spending more capital and growing faster, like Korea and Brazil and China do have lower tax rates than our average, and so that would tend to push it down. But given the fiscal situations in most countries around the world, I'm not optimistic of the overall rate going down for that. So I expect the 28% to hold for a long time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then lastly, there seems to be more positive price momentum in the industrial gas business generally, but all of the industrial gas companies are quite profitable and becoming more profitable. So in your opinion, when you go out and you try to get price, what's the primary rationale for achieving it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The primary rationale is inflation, and so we start to see inflation, it's much easier to get price increases and the average customer spends less than 1% of his cost of goods sold buying gas. So nobody likes a price increase but it doesn't really hurt them very much, and they understand that we have inflation and power costs and so forth.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jim. A couple questions on North America. Just wondering on the margin benefit, how much you're getting from, if you can remind us what healthcare going out the door did for your margins as well, because presumably that's sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, well, healthcare we didn't actually close until end of March.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, so that'll be more of a Q2 benefit then? And what...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It'll reduce our quarterly sales by something like $40 million a quarter, with very little impact on operating profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so a nice margin improvement there on a reported basis. On your merchant pricing you're at 82%, but I know you've often talked about when you get to 85%, that's where you can get pricing above and beyond cost inflation. But is that more common on your rates or industry rates? Because certainly your largest competitor is quite a bit below you on operating rates, so I'm wondering what the outlook for real price improvement in North American merchant is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think over the next couple years we'll get back the 2% to 3%, 4% kind of annual price increases. Really during the recession, we kind of fell off that track. Because they're long-term contracts, they're 3 to 5 year contracts, they don't come up for renewal except over a kind of a 3 to 5 year period. But I think we'll be able to get back on track with that.</p>

          <p>Okay. And then finally on PDI, what are margins there in that business compared to merchant right now? And you mentioned 30% incremental margins. Was that a comment on just merchant or did that include PDI as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that was a comment on North America combined, pretty much applies to both merchant and PDI. And I think that where there's still a lot of excess capacity in the economy is in packaged gas business, mainly because it just really hasn't picked up yet. But we're really starting to see people spending money on machinery and non-residential construction and so forth. So we're expecting that margin to go up. And right now it's about 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what's the dynamic there between, because obviously as hard goods recovers you have lower margins there, but is the operating leverage on gases enough to offset that and eventually take margins up overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm assuming that going forward the growth rate, same-store sales growth in gases will catch up with the same-store sales growth in hard goods. So it'll actually be a positive to margins.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. You mentioned inflation a couple of times, and what percentage of your contracts have inflation protection?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say virtually 100% of them. I can't say for sure all of them, because I haven't read all of them. But virtually 100% of them have some level of inflation indexation. And the newer contracts in the emerging markets tend to have a lot more inflation protection, but basically they've got, the model is to escalate the price to your power cost at whatever percentage your power cost is of sales, and escalate your other costs at an inflation index. And then kind of as a currency hedge, either we get the rest of it currency escalated, or inflation escalated. So inflation should be quite positive for us in those countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And interest expense ticked up a bit sequentially. What's your target for the full year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say it's going to stay about where it is right now. It's higher because we moved to more fixed rate this quarter, and so I think it'll stay more or less where it is right now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and is there any update on your early activities in Russia and the Middle East?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, Russia and the Middle East; not much of one. We've got a couple projects under construction in Russia, working on proposals for a number of new ones. And then in the Middle East we're working on a number of proposals in the Emirates, the United Arab Emirates, as well as in Saudi Arabia. And we haven't, obviously we're troubled by the civil unrest there, but it seems very unlikely that either the Emirates or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or Qatar really will be affected.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jim. The realization of pricing in the U.S. packaged gas business I believe you said was 2%. Does that imply that the March 15th price increases are sticking, and what do you expect once we get a full quarter impact in the second quarter? Would it be just the full impact relative to that 2%? Or a little bit less?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're still yet to see much price improvement in packaged gases. I believe we've put through some increases in certain areas. I think we'll start to get it going forward, maybe we'll get 2% overall for the year. It's probably not a bad average number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ok, and then last quarter you mentioned that you were trying to close the gap in South America in energy costs. Are you still chasing those up or have you closed the gap now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've closed 88% of it, so we're almost there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then finally in terms of the U.S. home healthcare divestiture, were the gross margins in that business similar to your overall gross margin or higher or lower?  Just so we can understand the GP and SG&amp;A impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The gross margin was very similar, around 50%, to the rest of our business. But the SG&amp;A was higher and so consequently the operating margin was closer to 0 rather than around 20%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, so maybe $20 million impact on SG&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, something like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great thank you.</p>
