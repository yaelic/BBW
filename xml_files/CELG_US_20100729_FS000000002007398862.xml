          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Celgene second quarter earnings call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Smith, Director of Investor Relations at Celgene Corporation.</p>

          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'd like to welcome you to Celgene's Second Quarter Conference Call. The press release reporting our second quarter financial and operating results was issued earlier this morning and is also available on our corporate website. In addition, today's conference call webcast will include a presentation, which you can access by going to the Investor Relations section of our website at www.celgene.com.</p>
          <p>Joining me this morning are David Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer; Bob Hugin, our Chief Executive Officer; and Dr. Sol Barer, our Executive Chairman.</p>
          <p>Before we start we want to remind you that our discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements exclude the effects of the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience unless noted. Our actual results, performance or achievements could be materially different than those in the forward-looking statements. The factors that could cause actual results, performance or achievements to differ from our forward-looking statements are discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as our form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports. Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Also, our discussions during this conference call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and management with supplemental measures of operating performance and trends that facilitate comparisons between periods before and after certain items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available as part of our earnings releases on Celgene's website at www.celgene.com in the Investor Relations section.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. The second quarter was an outstanding quarter for Celgene across all functions and geographies. Our exceptional global team produced both excellent operating results and achieved multiple significant milestones that have the potential to create meaningful benefits for patients and strong returns for shareholders for years to come.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="audio gap" /> (02:48-03:10)</p>
          <p>Earlier this morning we announced record financial results with total revenue growing 36% year-over-year to $850 million and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing 50% year-over-year to $.069.</p>
          <p>Before we review the specific operating of financial results of the quarter I'd like to highlight several of the key strategic developments of the last three months. Though not yet completed, the announced Abraxis BioScience acquisition broadens our therapeutic focus into the solid tumor marked.  Their lead product, Abraxane, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the United States and international markets, has also shown significant promise in pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer critical trials. The transaction provides the opportunity for us to leverage of global commercial, clinical and regulatory organizations and further strengthens our pipeline with multiple candidates from the Abraxis proprietary nab technology portfolio.</p>
          <p>Advancing our hematology pipeline is also a strategic imperative. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology and European Hematology meetings in June, there were many presentations that highlighted important new data supporting our key products and programs. Perhaps the most significant data were results from three Phase III studies demonstrating the substantial benefit achieved by multiple myeloma patients receiving continuous REVLIMID therapy.</p>
          <p>Our international expansion strategy continues to be an important growth driver for our products.</p>
          <p>On June 25, REVLIMID was approved in Japan for the treatment of second line multiple myeloma.  Governmental reimbursement was achieved in less than a month following approval, accurately reflecting the importance of  REVLIMID therapy in myeloma and a validation of the quality of the planning and execution of the Celgene team in Japan. We are now in the early stages of a thoughtfully planned commercial launched in this, the second largest oncology market in the world. The investments we have made in Japan and in other international markets will enable us to capture the full value of REVLIMID and the many other opportunities in our pipeline in all major markets.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, substantial progress was achieved in advancing multiple pipeline programs, highlighted by the initiation of our first pivotal Phase III trial for our lead anti-inflammatory product,  Apremilast, in psoriatic arthritis and the initiation of our Phase I cancer clinical study of our novel dual TOR Kinase Inhibitor, CC-223, a product of our research labs in San Diego. The significant progress in this quarter further strengthens our belief that sustained long-term growth comes best through an unwavering commitment to invest in multiple programs designed to produce breakthrough therapies for patients with serious unmet medical needs.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to hand the call over to Dave Gryska, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our second quarter financial results. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. Now I'll take you through our record financial results. Non-GAAP total revenue for the second quarter was $850 million, a 36% increase versus the second quarter of 2009. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $323 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.69. Total non-GAAP net product sales increased to $821 million for the second quarter, up 38% from $596 million in the year-ago quarter. The second quarter REVLIMID net product sales were $587 million, an increase of 48% over the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to VIDAZA, net product sales for the quarter were $132 million, an increase of 43% from the year-ago quarter. THALOMID net sales were $98 million for the quarter, down 7% as compared to the year-ago quarter. For the second quarter sales of REVLIMID in the U.S. were 351 million, representing an increase of 15% on a sequential quarter basis and a 44% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009. International sales were 236 million, representing an increase of 5% on a sequential quarter basis and a 54% increase when compared to the second quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP product gross margin for the second quarter of 2010 was approximately 92.4%. Gross margins were slightly negatively impacted for the quarter by non-reoccurring inventory manufacturing charges. It's important to note that inventory levels were virtually unchanged as compared to the first quarter. We continue to expect gross margins to be approximately 93% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&amp;D expense during the second quarter was 202 million, an increase of 9% over the first quarter of 2010. We are continuing to strategically invest in developing new products that will enhance our long-term growth. During 2010, our development efforts will evaluate multiple compounds in more than 20 pivotal and Phase III clinical trials. Our key development programs are evaluating REVLIMID in all stages of multiple myeloma as well as pivotal Phase III trials in NHL and CLL. We are also conducting late-stage trials for Apremilast, Pomalidomide, Amrubicin, VIDAZA and ISTODAX. In addition, we're continuing to advance more than 16 promising compounds in pre-clinical and early stage development and expect all of these activities to accelerate in the second half of the year. We now expect non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses to be in a range of 845 to 865 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Taking a look at SG&amp;A, non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses were $197 million during the second quarter, an increase of approximately 5% from the first quarter of 2010. We now expect non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses to be in a range of 675 to 785 million for 2010 as we continue our international commercialization of REVLIMID, VIDAZA and our patient support programs in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Turning to taxes. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was approximately 18%. This improvement in the tax rate is the result of a one-time benefit from a settlement related to state taxes. We expect the 2010 non-GAAP effective tax rate to improve to approximately 19.5% for the year. As you are aware, we hedge our balance sheet foreign currency exposures and our company foreign currency transactions and exposure related to certain revenue and expenses based in foreign currencies. The impact of foreign currency on total revenue on a sequential quarter basis was immaterial. We are well positioned with our hedging programs to minimize the volatility of various foreign currencies' effects on our earnings for the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, during the second quarter we realized approximately 5 million in hedging and revaluation losses, which are included in other income and expense. This was an exceptional quarter with record revenue and earnings. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $3.1 billion. We repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock during the quarter.</p>
          <p>We are updating our 2010 financial outlook. REVLIMID net product sales are anticipated to increase to a range of 2.3 to 2.35 billion, up from a previous range of 2.2 to 2.3 billion. Total revenue is now expected to increase to a range of 3.4 to 3.45 billion, up from a previous range of 3.3 to 3.4 billion. This updated revenue guidance does not include Abraxis BioScience. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are expected to increase to a range of 2.65 to 2.70 as compared to a range of 2.6 to 2.65 that was previously reported. The updated non-GAAP EPS guidance includes $0.05 dilution from the proposed acquisition of Abraxis BioScience.</p>
          <p>In summary, we continue to execute on the global expansion plan for hematology, oncology and inflammation franchises. Our business model is driven by strong operating leverage and efficiency as evidenced by industry-leading operating margins. We are truly well positioned to achieve our goals in 2010 and beyond and continue to deliver record operating results.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Executive Officer, Bob Hugin, who will give you his further update.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave. Quite a quarter. The operating results of the quarter were highlighted by strong REVLIMID revenue growth with sales growing 48% year-over-year and 11% over the last quarter. Sales were up 15% quarter-over quarter in the U.S., with 4% sequential growth internationally. Many factors contributed to this excellent performance, most notably recent data highlighted at ASCO and EHA, all supporting continuous REVLIMID therapy.</p>
          <p>VIDAZA growth accelerated in the quarter. Year-over-year global sales increased 43% with 10% growth quarter-over-quarter. Europe was the primary driver of this growth and international sales now represent greater than 50% of total sales. In addition to new markets, label expansion has the potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>A little interlude here. Apologize. But let's give the operator a minute to see if she can take care of the music.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that. You may continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Let's see. As I was mentioning, new markets are important to our expansion and growth. Label expansion also has the potential to be a major growth driver for REVLIMID in multiple indications. At EHA in June, positive updated data from MMO15 was presented. The Phase III trial in newly diagnosed myeloma patients will be the backbone of our submission to European regulatory authorities later this year.</p>
          <p>As we deliver on our near-term value drivers, we're also focused on long-term value creation. We remain committed to maximizing the full potential of REVLIMID worldwide, with pivotal studies ongoing in lymphoma, CLL, MDS and prostate cancer. Recently, we enrolled our first patients in our Phase III trial PSA-002 for Apremilast in patients with psoriatic arthritis. We're optimistic that we'll be able to grow the Abraxis acquisition in the coming two to three months. We look forward to updating you on our strategy for capitalizing on the opportunities and synergies of the combined companies as we clear regulatory hurdles.</p>
          <p>The fundamentals in our core myeloma business remain very strong. Growth in the U.S. was driven by increasing new patient starts and duration gains. Our core European markets also produced robust results despite an increasingly challenging economic environment. Second line market share increased to nearly 40% in the four major European markets where REVLIMID is reimbursed. In the United Kingdom where REVLIMID is reimbursed in third line, market share is over 50%. We're monitoring the environment closely and believe that our guidance appropriately reflects the current economic reality.</p>
          <p>In other international markets, we also saw strong sequential growth and are making good progress. The approval in Japan represents the most significant commercial development in the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're in the process of initiating a well-planned launch in Japan which includes the introduction of our proprietary risk management system, RevMate, to nearly 250 sites across Japan. We believe that our long-term interests are best served by ensuring that hematologists in Japan are well educated on the effective and safe use of REVLIMID to ensure a positive first experience. A proper foundation will pay significant long-term dividends.</p>
          <p>Physician practice in oncology is data-driven. New data is the lifeblood of hematology oncology products. In early June, data was presented from more than 100 posters and more than 20 oral presentations at the ASCO and EHA meetings. By every measure, these were a great success for Celgene products. Data from three pivotal studies demonstrated that continuous treatment with REVLIMID for patients with multiple myeloma has the potential to become the standard of care. In addition, abstracts were presented that demonstrated REVLIMID's activity in lymphomas and leukemias and exciting new data about Pomalidomide in relapsed refractory myeloma was also highlighted. Based on these clinical and &#x2013; based on the clinical and commercial potential of these results, we continue to accelerate the development of these products and indications as rapidly as possible.</p>
          <p>We believe that we're just seeing the beginning of the impact of the paradigm-changing data that supports continuous use of REVLIMID. In the IFM and CALGB studies presented at ASCO, continuous REVLIMID therapy demonstrated unprecedented reductions in the risk of disease progression in the post-stem cell transplant setting with 54% and 58% risk reduction respectively. A week later updated data that included 70% of events from MM-015 were presented at EHA and the results were consistent, a 58% reduced risk of overall progression in the non-stem cell transplant population. The data presented from the podium from MM-015 and the IFM and CALGB studies all illustrated the progression-free survival advantage of continuous REVLIMID therapy.</p>
          <p>The three Phase III studies represent a pillar of our myeloma strategy, the generation of supportive data for early and continuous treatment of the disease. In addition to MM-015, IFM and CALGB studies, other presentations at ASCO presented data demonstrating that REVLIMID combined with dexamethasone is a highly active induction therapy and that REVLIMID may even represent an alternative to stem cell transplants in certain patient populations. We're continuing to develop our clinical strategy for the treatment of high-risk smoldering myeloma while at the same time accelerating the development of Pomalidomide for the treatment of relapsed refractory myeloma,  where studies have demonstrated a 50% response rate representing the highest response rate of any single agent in relapsed refractory disease.</p>
          <p>We're committed to improving the treatment options in all lines of therapy for patients with multiple myeloma. Paradigm-changing data, increased market share and duration, and global expansion, all of these factors contributed to the very strong results that were produced this past quarter.</p>
          <p>As we seek to broaden our label's indication and as physicians become more aware of this new data, we're optimistic that our strong performance in this market will continue. VIDAZA also produced excellent results for the second quarter. International VIDAZA growth was particularly  strong as we continue to establish a leadership position in major European countries and other key markets.</p>
          <p>In the United States, revenues were up 3% quarter-over-quarter, maintaining market share leadership. VIDAZA remains the only agent in its class worldwide that demonstrates survival advantage of MDS AML. We have a number of ongoing studies to strengthen VIDAZA's role in the treatment of MDS and AML. Positive trends continue in the MDS del 5q market with REVLIMID. We're optimistic that we'll receive regulatory approval in Japan later this year and are on track for an MDS del 5q submission in Europe, soon after the MM-015 myeloma filing in Europe. The international launch of VIDAZA is ongoing, with global expansion and share gains coupled with increasing duration driving growth.</p>
          <p>Additional data on both REVLIMID and VIDAZA and MDS is expected at this year's American Society of Hematology meeting in December. In addition to the outstanding REVLIMID data in multiple myeloma that was presented at ASCO, there were numerous other abstracts that highlighted the potential of REVLIMID and our broader hematology/oncology pipeline. Ground-breaking data from a study that evaluated the novel R-squared, REVLIMID plus Rituxan combination, in patients with follicular lymphoma demonstrated 97% response rate, which included a complete response rate of 86% with duration now greater than six months. This represents a significant opportunity for REVLIMID in lymphoma and we expect to begin a pivotal Celgene-sponsored study in the coming months.</p>
          <p>We also recently initiated an adaptive design study in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The concept for this study was based upon the differential response rate data seen in a biomarker defined subset of the patient population. In addition to these studies, we'll continue to maximize the potential of REVLIMID in lymphoma with additional pivotal studies in mantle cell lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In leukemia positive data was presented at ASCO that illustrates the potential of our pivotal CLL-008 trial, which is evaluating REVLIMID as a first line therapy in elderly CLL patients.</p>
          <p>In addition to REVLIMID, our hematology/oncology pipeline has seven compounds in all stages of development. We expect to have results from our pivotal study evaluating ISTODAX in relapsed refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma in the next coming few weeks. With approximately 15 pivotal and Phase III trials from the hem/onc pipeline, there will be a steady flow of important new data for the next several years leading to what we believe will be another 5-10 new indications in this period. I do look forward to our next presentation when we should be able to add Abraxane and the Abraxis pipeline to this slide.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Abraxis, we're on track with all of our regulatory filings related to the transaction. Both companies submitted the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings two weeks ago and the S4 proxy statement was submitted earlier this morning. Once the filing is declared effective by the SEC, there will be an Abraxis shareholder meeting to approve the transaction. The transaction is expected to close shortly after that meeting. We do expect that the transaction will close before our next conference call in late October and look forward to updating you on our progress and plans at that time.</p>
          <p>In addition to the hematology/oncology discussions, we continue to build a substantial portfolio of assets in our inflammation and immunology franchise. We now have six candidates in clinical development. This pipeline was a major focus at our R&amp;D Day in April and it's continued to make excellent progress since then.</p>
          <p>We're now initiating our first trial with ACE-011 in renal anemia, moving rapidly into Phase II in Crohn's disease with our cellular therapy, PDA-001, and advancing our JNK Inhibitor in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Our most advanced program is Apremilast. In just the past few weeks, we have dosed our first patients in PSA-002, the first of our pivotal trials. We have an expansive  development program for Apremilast in psoriatic arthritis, moderate to severe psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and other serious immune inflammatory diseases. All of our pivotal trials in psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are targeted to be initiated before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>It was an exceptional quarter both in terms of financial and operating results and also in terms of positioning Celgene for the future. While producing strong bottom line results, we're also investing in the future to sustain the success and high growth that we've achieved. We're executing on our plan and managing the challenges of healthcare reform in the United States and budgetary pressures in the E.U. while making the sound strategic decisions to extend our capabilities around the world and to expand therapeutic franchises that capitalize on our existing strengths.</p>
          <p>As we close, I want to recognize and thank the Celgene team worldwide, who all contributed to these extraordinary results of this past quarter. Superb results achieved in a challenging global economy. It's their dedication, their passion for the patient, their creativity and expertise that makes us so optimistic about the future. Thank you for joining this morning and we look forward to answering your questions.</p>
          <p>So operator, please &#x2013; you can now open the call to questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question is from Chris Raymond of Robert Baird and Company. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the new REVLIMID revenue guidance. Just kind of doing the math quarter-on-quarter, even at the top end of the guidance, and I know it's still early days here in terms of looking at the second half, but if you do the math, there is an implied decrease in quarter-on-quarter growth. And I'm wondering if, there's something specific that we should be thinking about or if there's just a level of conservatism in that number? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That's a good question, Chris. I think, clearly we wanted to raise the guidance. We think the results of the quarter were very, very strong. I think we do need to be careful that there could be summer seasonality in some markets. There clearly are some budgetary pressures in Europe. We're managing them quite well so far. And I think our own outlook is that we'll continue to do that in an effective manner. So I think it's just appropriate that we're, here where there's uncertainty in the marketplace, we certainly wanted to increase the guidance. It's the second quarter in a row so the guidance for the year, at the beginning of the year, has turned out so far to be fairly conservative.</p>
          <p>And so I think, there isn't anything out there that we're seeing that other people aren't seeing. The trends are very positive. We're optimistic about the future. But I think we just wanted to &#x2013; we did want to raise the guidance. I think it was appropriate to do so. I think you do reflect that there's hopefully better opportunity than the guidance indicates, but we do want to be cautious with the environment that we're facing. But there isn't anything we know that's not out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Zhang of BMO Capital Markets. You may ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks. Good quarters. Bob, have you provide us the average duration of REVLIMID in the U.S. versus the European countries? And also if you could share with us your current rate of the market share with regard to REVLIMID or REVLIMID together with THALOMID in the multiple myeloma market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the market share combined is about 65% overall in the U.S. when you put our products across the lines in myeloma which has continued to be very strong and, clearly, REVLIMID being the most widely prescribed drug in the U.S. and Thalidomide moving more towards second, third, and fourth line therapy over time. In terms of duration, we've made the decision for competitive reasons to ensure that we retain the full negotiating leverage in all of the markets that we seek reimbursement, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we just &#x2013; we don't think it makes sense for us to give specific duration information out. I think on the quarter the trends in the U.S. were positive on duration and we saw positive duration trends in the major developed markets outside of the United States. So continuation of a very positive trend but the specifics are things that we just don't think is in our interest and we &#x2013; to publicly give out any longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the past, if I could just follow up on that, we have seen in a half month's duration increase per quarter. At some point we're going to see that slowing down. But you said, still positive, still increasing. Are we still in the same ball mark as half a month's increase per quarter or is it a little different than what we have seen in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the trends continue to be quite consistent with what we have seen in the past. The IFM and CALGB data were only presented in June, so if we were to see an acceleration of that trend it would be early to see that. But so far what we saw in the second quarter was consistent with the very positive trends we've seen before that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and congratulations, Bob. Great first quarter in the new seat. Just a couple of questions. First, you've got a lot of studies where you have a primary end point of PFS. Could you comment on your interpretation of the significance of the FDA advisory committee's discussion of the PFS signal for Avastin in breast cancer and whether that changes your expectations? And then just following up on that, you seem to imply that your filing in Europe is just going to be MM-015. Is that correct, or will you still be including CALGB IFM data and then some of the early cooperative group studies as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on the latter question about the European filing, no, certainly MM-015 will be the backbone of the filing but we intend to include in that filing as much data -- and we have so many successful Phase III trials supporting newly-diagnosed and maintenance therapy for REVLIMID. So we will be including multiple trials in that package to ensure the most robust data package and the most robust label as possible in that review process. So that's &#x2013; there's no change to that. If anything we're more convinced to ensure that we've got all that data included in there, and the timeline is unchanged to get that done before the end of this year.</p>
          <p>On the first question about PFS data, et cetera, I do think it is always important to ensure that you've got a close dialogue with regulatory agencies regarding end points of clinical trials, and we certainly would not pursue regulatory strategies without a good intensive robust discussion with regulatory authorities in advance of initiating those trials. And I think the specifics, I think you have to be careful of extrapolating one market segment to another. It very much depends on what therapies are available out there and what's available to be explored and examined in clinical trials in a particular patient setting.</p>
          <p>So I think that it's &#x2013; again, always instructive to learn and listen, but we feel good about the direction that we're headed and that we're engaged in a very robust discussion to ensure that our clinical trials meet the kind of criteria that are going to be important for both regulatory and reimbursements positive outcomes upon a successful completion of the trial. So I think that &#x2013; I think we feel that our segments and our market indications are very well understood, and I think we're targeting the right end points.</p>

We are in the process of finalizing regulatory discussions as to exactly what will be required in both the design and -- the design of the trial in multiple markets. So the data is very, very positive. It really encourages &#x2013; especially when you look at the duration of those very, very strong responses. It's the subject of a pretty robust discussion right now with regulatory agencies. As soon as we have clarity and we begin to initiate those trials, we'll give you full disclosure on what that design is.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Let me add my congratulations on a very good quarter. Bob, with regard to the Japanese commercial rollout, you mentioned RevMate. Could you tell us how that is different, if it is, from RevAssist in terms of the cost or the adoption curve impact that it may have? How is that really a different risk mitigation system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the RevMate system in Japan is clearly consistent with our very strong global philosophy of ensuring that REVLIMID is appropriately distributed in each individual market. And then markets clearly have differentiating characteristics. Japan is a market with a very, very significant sensitivity to past effects of drugs with birth defects and overall a market very sensitive to side effect management. And so that we're very &#x2013; we're being, I think, very prudent here to ensure that we've got the right risk management system. It's something that we've developed and our team has developed in very strong concert with important other constituencies in Japan, including the ministry and patient groups, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So it's been thoughtfully done. It's well planned out. We do not think it will have any long-term negative impediment. In fact it will give people confidence that it's a very safe system and it's going to be well controlled and managed. That being said, putting the risk management system aside, Japan is a great market and REVLIMID is a spectacularly well-situated compound to fit extraordinarily well with the conditions and market of Japan. An oral therapy with very manageable side effects, with strong effectiveness, you know, demonstrated in the labeled indication. And so it's very important for us to establish Japan early on and make sure that physicians are very comfortable with how they administer the drug, how to safely do it, how to manage the side effects.</p>
          <p>And that's a marketplace, if you establish a strong initial presence and physicians are comfortable with how to use the drug with the initial one, two, three patients, you're going to see a very rapid uptake over the longer term. But in the near term, the reason we're talking about it, we want to make sure people don't get overly enthusiastic to see a dramatic ramp. We're playing Japan and we're positioning ourselves for very long term excellent performance, but we're going to do it the right way to ensure education is there, good solid risk management systems so that physicians, patients, and the government and we are all comfortable that it's being done in a very prudent manner.</p>
          <p>And that's not the say that we aren't just incredibly excited about having approval on June 25, and to get pricing and reimbursement in such a short period of time really does reflect, I think, a few things. One, the importance of a new therapy for myeloma in Japan. The need for REVLIMID to get out to patients and also, I think, the -- really the execution, the planning, the strategy of our Celgene team in Japan to produce that in such a short period of time. So we're very excited but we're going to do it in the best way positioned for long-term success.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, congrats on a good quarter. What can you tell us about the IMF guidelines for maintenance and what impact the data or guidelines could have on European first line or maintenance use prior to a formal approval? And I have a follow up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, I think it's still early to tell that how rapid and what markets specifically we're going to see the impact from the IFM and CALGB data. But there's no doubt when we look at our medical information resources, there's a strong interest in understanding and learning about the data from many markets around the world. I do think in some markets we'll be successful and, like the U.S., that people will understand the data and hopefully relatively rapidly use it appropriately to where the physician thinks it's appropriate to use.</p>
          <p>Certainly it's had an impact already in terms of maybe dispelling some physicians' reluctance to treat only to best response and not to treat through to progression. So, I mean, there's a strong positive impact about continuous therapy from MM-015, IFM and CALGB on all sectors in myeloma that we've begun to see over the first half of this year. I think specifically to the post-transplant maintenance setting, it will be market-to-market and I think it's a little bit early for us to have a strong view as to how and what that uptake will be. You had a follow-up, Geoff?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, guys. I have two questions. One, can you give us a little bit of a sense of what the impact of healthcare reform was in the quarter? If I recall there was about negative 4 million last quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense there. And then, also, I don't know if you can, but help us understand a little bit how all the price concessions in Europe will impact your businesses as we look to next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yaron, it's Dave. I'll answer the first part and then Bob can take the second part. The impact on healthcare reform was between &#x2013; in Q2 between 9 to 10 million dollars and that's the same kind of estimate that we gave you last quarter. The revenue impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then in Europe, the one impact we had in this past quarter was the 4% price rebate, increased rebate in Spain for orphan drugs, 7.5 for other therapies. We were at the 4% level starting June 1 of a rebate in Spain. That was the only meaningful event in the second quarter. Clearly, people are focused on Germany for later this year with an increase of -- a 10% increase in the rebate in Germany. And the specifics of that are still being finalized. But that looks pretty clear. As we look out past 2010, our marketplaces are &#x2013; we look at it country by country and clearly there's lots of pressure.</p>
          <p>I think the impact is more just on budgetary pressures, less on specific price declines, but we're going to see continued price declines. And that's the reason why when we started REVLIMID internationally, we established the benchmark price that we did. So we in our original forecast we were expecting to see pressure just in the normal course of events in 2011, so in some respects we're not going to be as dramatically hit by it. There are other price increases. So I think as we look out, it's a little early for us to get too granular and specific about 2011, but our outlook this far in advance, using all of the information we have and the outlook for pressures in Europe, is pretty consistent with what we've seen our expectation is for &#x2013; in line with our plan where we think the growth of REVLIMID will be over the next five years.</p>
          <p>So again, it's &#x2013; these are tough times out there but our team in each individual market I think are crafting a very unique and specific strategy to the market. It is part of our strategy to &#x2013; we have got to manage price and duration over time. And it is nothing unusual in terms of what we're expecting and we're ready to manage the circumstances, though it's certainly &#x2013; it certainly is a challenging environment, but we think 2011 initially looks pretty encouraging to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And our next question is from Eric Schmidt of Cowen &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the accelerating U.S. trends on REVLIMID quarter-on-quarter and maybe also comment on some of the deceleration in ex-U.S. growth?  A little more on the geographic split there. And then, Dave, I was a little bit confused as to what is in the 2010 guidance vis-&#xE0;-vis Abraxis. Do I understand it that your SG&amp;A and R&amp;D guidance include expenses, assuming the merger closes in the second half, but that any Abraxane revenues are excluded?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we'll answer the latter part of your question first, Eric. In our guidance, our revenue guidance and our SG&amp;A and our R&amp;D does not include Abraxis BioScience, okay? That is just Celgene stand-alone. And although we did estimate that assuming a transaction closes, Bob said the next two to three months, that there would be a $0.05 dilution. So, again, to be clear, the R&amp;D and SG&amp;A is Celgene stand-alone. The total revenues are Celgene stand-alone. It's pretty difficult for us to get to the granularity before we close on those expenses for Abraxis, but we've given you at least what the dilution would be in terms of the whole year, in terms of updating our guidance on EPS. Is there any more questions on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the REVLIMID growth trajectory, certainly the U.S. benefited from both an increasing number of new patients which is very encouraging for the long term because the quarter was also positively impacted by increased duration. So as you have a very strong ramp in new patients, and you have increasing duration, that bodes well for the future. So we're always &#x2013; have to work very hard to ensure we have the best strategy and results in the U.S., but the trends are very positive there. In Europe, the underlying trends were very strong also on a comparative basis and market-to-market. There were some countries where growth was a little bit slower than it has been, where there have been pressure on budgets. Not specifically price cuts, but just authorities, hospital leaders saying listen, where can we cut costs just to produce some fiscal restraint.</p>
          <p>That's our bigger issue that as economies need to come to grips with the fiscal challenges they have we have to make sure the value proposition of Celgene is very, very clearly delineated. And that's one of the great successes of REVLIMID that we have such a great value proposition and why it continues to grow in all markets. And we saw in some markets accelerating growth. The UK, Canada were both very strong in the quarter.</p>
          <p>So, I mean, we're going to continue to see some markets where we're going to see budgetary pressures, others where the duration and increasing market shares will offset that. So overall we feel very good about what's happening in Europe, and the growth there will continue to be very strong over the next two years.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. Maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question for Bob, if I may. So you've done the ABII deal and the Gloucester deal and the Pharmion deal, all M&amp;A and all in oncology. I was just wondering what the company is currently thinking regarding business development/M&amp;A outside of oncology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, we are clearly very excited about the potential of our immune inflammatory franchise, with Apremilast and the Phase III programs, the JNK program, the acceleration of PDA--001 in multiple indications and aggressively going forward in Crohn's. So we think it's a great franchise for us. But right now our focus has to be to closing the Abraxis transaction, ensuring that we execute a very, very positive integration, that we maximize the opportunities that Abraxis brings to us, both in terms of fully reaching the potential for Abraxane, both in its approved indications and ensuring that we get label expansion to the full potential of what's available to us. And we're also &#x2013; we also think the nab technology portfolio has a number of other candidates in there that we think will stack up well and we'll look to develop those also. And we'll look for other compounds to use the nab technology to develop.</p>
          <p>So we're going to focus on the synergies of it but also the growth opportunities of Abraxis. So I think for the near term, we're going to continue to execute what we have on our plate. But I do think the potential of the immune inflammatory franchise is such a great one and the trajectory's a very positive one. And once we have the Abraxis transaction closed, and no need to do a deal in anything else. But we'd look at things, but certainly that's not something that's going to happen in the near term here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I have two questions. Just one, in Europe you talked about your filing strategy. Have you actually met with the EMEA recently to discuss the 015 data and your filing strategy? And then the second question is just on the healthcare reform. Do you have any updated view for 2011? You had given guidance earlier in the year and just wanted to see if there were any changes to your thinking on that front? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, just on the healthcare front, we are just maintaining the guidance that we had previously given of the 80 to 90 million potential revenue impact in 2011. I do think, as the fall approaches, we will have more clarity on that and if that guidance should be lowered in terms of having a less of effect next year or a more of effect, we'll update you. But right now we do think the guidance is still, for all the information we have in terms of U.S. revenue impact on U.S. healthcare reform, we wouldn't change that guidance. We haven't any information now that would lead us to do that.</p>
          <p>And in Europe, I don't want to go to the specifics of it, but we're &#x2013; we have a very active dialogue with multiple officials in different countries that will be involved in shepherding the REVLIMID newly-diagnosed application through the European process. So that's an ongoing and very active dialogue and we're on track for submitting that filing by the end of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats, my congrats as well on the strong quarter. When we saw the 015 update at EHA, it looked like REVLIMID was continuing to perform well. Looked as if the PFS benefits were a bit more pronounced in the younger patients who were in the trial. So I'm just wondering how you foresee this potentially impacting the positioning of the RMP plus R regimen and whether you expect there to be any kind of age recommendations on a potential front line label? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little premature to speculate on what exactly will come out of the label and the discussions with the regulatory agencies. Certainly, Melphalan and Prednisone is not a high-growth regimen generally in the myeloma population. So I think our own strategy of doing MM-020 which is our big, largest Phase III trial in the myeloma marketplace which really examines REVLIMID and Dexamethasone versus a Melphalan-based Thalidomide regimen is really designed to say listen, if we are able to get the broadest label possible and all the data presented from all the clinical trials that we're hopeful that physicians will have the full course of options to say which specific patient would benefit best from REVLIMID Dexamethasone, which patient would benefit most from Melphalan, Prednisone and REVLIMID or other therapy.</p>
          <p>So I think we're getting a good range of data from multiple clinical trials, Phase III trials. Certainly the REVLIMID ones have all had positive, positive results and we're optimistic that in the next year or two as we get the MM-020 data, we'll have even more information to give physicians, more guidance as to what is best for newly-diagnosed myeloma patients. I think we're very encouraged by what MM-015 has had an impact already in the marketplace. We're optimistic the impact it will have in our regulatory ability to expand the label. But it will &#x2013; but MPR is not the &#x2013; will not be as any Melphalan-based regimen, will not be for every single patient.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple of questions. One, just to clarify the commentary on Japan. It sounds like we should expect that maybe longer term penetration could be as robust as some of your other territories, but maybe the timeframe to achieve that more extended relative to the experience with REVLIMID in the U.S. and Europe? And then also, just wanted to get an update on Pomalidomide, the next round of data on the post REVLIMID Velcade myeloma setting and the potential for you to file in a more accelerated fashion for that indication? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. First on Japan. I think you represented it very accurately. We're very, very optimistic about the potential of REVLIMID in myeloma in Japan and for all the reasons that we've discussed. And well, hopefully, you will keep your estimates as low as possible in the near term for us. No, but seriously, we think that success is &#x2013; it's important to do it properly with a strong education emphasis and ensure that people have a good, positive experience because the potential for Japan is such an important market to us over the next few years. We want to do it right and do it with the right trajectory. But we're very optimistic about the potential is there. And I think since our last call or &#x2013; certainly since the last quarterly conference call, the very important Phase II Pomalidomide trial very rapidly finished accruing and we're going to &#x2013; we'll hopefully look forward to that data as soon as it is available.</p>
          <p>And there's a potential in the next three or four quarters, we'll see that data and that we'll initiate the Phase III trial in Pomalidomide by the end of the year. I have to tell you, when we think about priorities here as we think of the rest of this year and 2011, the acceleration of Pomalidomide and making that available to the relapsed refractory myeloma population and myelofibrosis patient population is a critical corporate objective because it remain in that relapsed refractory population a serious unmet medical need, and an indication that we feel so strongly about -- the need to serve myeloma patients. So we're very encouraged by what we're seeing, the results.</p>
          <p>As soon as we get the Phase II results, we'll share them and see how they can be used. And we'll accelerate the Phase III trial and we're accruing the pivotal trial in myelofibrosis. So there really is hard to imagine a higher priority for us than the acceleration of Pomalidomide development.</p>
