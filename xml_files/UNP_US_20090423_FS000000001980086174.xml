      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to Union Pacific's first quarter earnings conference call.  Joining me today in Omaha are Rob Knight, our CFO, Jack Koraleski, Executive Vice President, Marketing and Sales and Dennis Duffy, Executive Vice President, Operations.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter earnings totaled $0.72 per share, a 15% decrease versus last year's quarterly earnings of $0.85 per share.  Strong service, productivity, pricing and lower fuel prices helped drive our results.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter we experienced one of the most challenging business environments we've ever seen.  Jack will talk in more detail about each of the groups, but the weak global economy played a role across the board.</p>
          <p>Even our bulk commodities, which tend to be less economically sensitive, were impacted by weak export grain demand, reduced animal counts for feeding and reduced electrical consumption by industrial manufacturers.  Given the sharp volume decline, our efforts in the quarter focused on reducing cost while improving customer service.  We're taking advantage of the lower volumes to increase operating fluidity and efficiency.  Regardless of what measure you look at we've never run better.</p>
          <p>First quarter velocity increased more than 20% year-over-year.  It was an all-time quarterly best.  These productivity efforts, along with lower fuel price, helped us to achieve a record first quarter operating ratio of 80.3%.</p>
          <p>In addition to increasing efficiency, we're focused on further improvements to safety and customer service.  First quarter safety measures were better in all categories, while our customer satisfaction scores hit a new high.  In times like these customers are focused on improving their supply chain efficiency.  This provides us a great opportunity to show both current and potential customers the excellent value and service Union Pacific has to offer.</p>
          <p>Finally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet.  We're maintaining a high degree of financial flexibility in today's world of low business volumes and uncertain credit markets.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Jack to give you the marketing perspective.  Jack?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim and good morning.  While our first quarter volume fell 21% as the economy took its toll in each of our businesses, our core price was at the top end of our target range, but our average revenue per car was only up 1% as lower fuel prices drove a decline in our fuel surcharge revenues.  Total freight revenue declined 20% to $3.2 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>And what I'll do now is take you through a walk-through of each of our six businesses.  We'll start with Ag.  Our Ag products carloadings were 12% below last year's strong first quarter showing and with a 1% in decline in average revenue per car, it lowered total revenue for Ag products 13% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Whole grain exports were down 34% against stronger worldwide supply and a stronger U.S. dollar.  Domestic grain and meal shipments also softened due to a reduction in corn shipments to ethanol plants, a weakening of the wheat market and reduced animal feeds.</p>
          <p>Our DDG business grew 9%, while ethanol volume fell about 1% as four plants were closed by the VeraSun bankruptcy.  These plants are expected to resume production over the next couple of months.  Frozen meat and poultry and sugar beet shipments also were down.</p>
          <p>Food and refrigerated products were the bright spots with our Produce Railexpress leading the way with a 50% volume increase resulting from our new California unit train start.  Import bear, canned goods and wine shipments also increased.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead we expect grain exports to show modest improvement in the second half.  An increase in livestock and poultry should give a boost to domestic grain and higher gasoline usage during the summer vacation season should lead to stronger ethanol volumes later in the year.</p>
          <p>Auto volumes dropped 48%, resulting in a 55% revenue decline as negative mix and lower fuel surcharges dropped average revenue per car 13%.  Finished vehicles shipments declined 54%, while our parts volume was down 40%.</p>
          <p>Certainly there's a lot of uncertainty in the auto industry.  Most forecasts suggest production will remain low through the second quarter with some strengthening in the second half.  We're just now in the process of digesting the GM announcement from yesterday.  We'll have to see how that plays out in terms of their additional plant closings.</p>
          <p>For growth opportunities, our strong service performance and our inside network logistics team are allowing us to penetrate both the parts market and used car markets and we're particularly excited about the used car market.</p>
          <p>Today that's growing much faster than new cars and through INL we've developed capabilities to manage truck-to-rail transportation of autos nationwide, providing a retail channel through door-to-door transportation.  So this summer we're going to be launching a fully transactional e-store called shipcarsnow.com, which in combination with our new co-loading capabilities will allow us to blend used cars into our existing new car delivery network.</p>
          <p>Our Chemical revenues were down 15% that's a 6% improvement in average revenue per car, partially offset a 20% decline in carloadings.  Reduced downstream demand in the automotive and construction industries, along with a decline in consumer spending has impacted our liquid and dry business, plastics and soda ash.  Fertilizer volumes were also off with reduced demand both in the export and U.S. market.</p>
          <p>Sulfur shipments were the bright spot. They were up 21% largely the result of some new unit train business that we put on the railroad.  Improvement in liquid and dry, plastics volumes will largely depend on the strengthening of the economy.  Soda ash export volume should improve in the second half and there continued to be some spot opportunities in petroleum markets with crude oil, asphalt and diluents.</p>
          <p>A 10% decline in energy volume was partially offset by a 5% improvement in average revenue per car, resulting in a 6% revenue decline in our Energy business.  In January we indicated there were a couple of legacy deals that got away.  Those losses cost us 2.8 million tons out of the Powder River Basin in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Our SPRB volume was also hampered by utility outages, lower electrical demand and relatively high coal stockpiles.  Mine and coal quality issues continue to impact Colorado/Utah tonnage and resulted in us losing about 200 trains during the quarter, leading to a 21% decline.</p>
          <p>Now we knew it was going to be tough year and that those contract losses would hold energy below 2008's record volume, but the deepening economic slowdown and the high stockpile levels have dampened our outlook a little further for coal markets.</p>
          <p>Continued weak demand across Industrial Products markets led to a 27% drop in volume, which with a 3% decrease in average revenue per car, resulted in a 29% decline in revenue.  Weakened demand has steel production at 43% of capacity compared to 91% last year, so we've seen our steel volumes about cut in half.</p>
          <p>Lumber shipments were down 37% as the market showed no signs of recovery during the quarter.  Slowed demand for highway projects and commercial and residential construction impacted stone carloadings.  However, we are starting to see an increase in the Texas DOT project lettings and that's over and above the normal seasonal lettings or pick-up that we would expect at this time largely the result of some of the stimulus funding finding its way into the market.</p>
          <p>Paper mills continue to reduce inventories, driving a 29% decline in our paper volume.  Looking ahead it looks like our best prospects for significant improvement are later in the year in our construction segment, driven by stimulus-related infrastructure projects.</p>
          <p>Our Intermodal volume fell 22% with a slight improvement in average revenue per unit, offsetting some of the impact of a 23% volume decline.  Volume in our international segment was down 30%, while domestic was down nine, but there are some good things happening on the domestic side.</p>
          <p>Our Streamline subsidiary, which offers door-to-door intermodal services, saw volume grow 113% for the quarter, with about 30% of that growth coming off the highway.  Freight service drove our EMP volumes up 18% with intermodal marketing companies and it's also supporting new truck competitive products, including our LA to Dallas and Memphis markets and some refrigerated service in several lanes that again were targeting highway conversions.  That success helped drive some strengthening as the quarter progressed with our domestic Intermodal volumes closing March down only 2%.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, international could very well continue to trail 2008 volumes, but we expect domestic business will benefit from our EMP product offerings and strong service and that's supporting some additional truck competitive products, including our new LA to Tacoma double stack service that was made possible by our investments to clear the tunnels along the I-5 corridor.</p>
          <p>So while inventory levels have dropped significantly, they haven't come down enough to match the fall-off in sales.  The top chart shows average retail trade inventories during the first quarter from 2006 through 2009 and for '09 we used only January and February, since that's what's been recorded so far.</p>
          <p>While inventories are back to 2006 levels, the inventory sales ratio is significantly higher than in any other prior years as the falling inventories couldn't match the pace of falling sales.  The bottom chart shows that the same is true for the automotive industry.  The extended shutdowns have significantly reduced inventory, but sales have dropped even more quickly.</p>
          <p>So until these inventory levels in these and other segments of the economy align with demand, there's not much pull in the supply chain and of course that impacts the demand for transportation services.</p>
          <p>Many of our customers are telling us that their inventories are already at very low levels, but until consumer confidence returns I don't think we're going to break that cycle and that makes the timing of a recovery pretty hard to judge.  However, some customers believe that the deeper that inventories sag the greater the potential for more of a V-shape recovery when in fact it does comes back.</p>
          <p>So here are some of the leading indicators that we're watching in our business.  In the upper-right, gondola orders are showing no signs of life, which fits with what we're seeing going on in our steel markets.  In the upper-left we've plotted orders for centerbeam flat cars, which handle lumber.  We've seen some seasonal strengthening here of late and of course in this economy even a seasonal upturn is starting to feel encouraging for us.</p>
          <p>Boxcar orders appear to have stopped their slide and have even shown some slight uptick the past few weeks, while this time last year we were actually trending down.  And in the lower-right our southern rock carloadings are trending up, although not as strongly as a year ago.</p>
          <p>So we got gonds down decidedly, boxcars showing some signs of life and the other two following their seasonal pattern.  So I guess you could say that these leading indicators reinforce the general uncertainty that remains with perhaps some faint signs of life.</p>
          <p>The good news is that the favorable economics of rail, combined with the great value we can provide with our service, is a competitive advantage for us and it's one that our customers are recognizing.  Our first quarter Customer Satisfaction Ratio came in at 87, topping the fourth quarter of last year as our best effort.</p>
          <p>The satisfaction index of 88 in March equals our best ever month, hit only one time before back in February of 1994, so we're pretty pleased with those results.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Dennis, who is going to talk about our service performance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jack and good morning.  The operating department took on the challenge of a lower volume environment, working throughout the quarter to align resources with demand, while increasing network efficiency.</p>
          <p>This chart highlights four different service metrics, each attaining new bests in the first quarter.  Starting in the top-left quadrant, network velocity increased five miles per hour to 27.2, a 23% increase.  This is our highest quarterly speed ever and drove better asset productivity and strong customer service.</p>
          <p>As we said before, lower volumes do help, but Unified Plan initiatives, Lean management principles and strict inventory controls are helping us leverage today's lower volumes into capacity for tomorrow.  Velocity and productivity gains also led to a re-crew rate of 3.8%, another best, as well as a 5% improvement in our fuel efficiency rate.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter dwell times were almost a full hour lower year-over-year at 24.3.  We are consistently making our car connections, minimizing inventory in our terminals.  Freight car utilization, measuring the days between loads, was a first quarter best at 9.1 days.</p>
          <p>Faster asset turns allows us to reduce the short-term rental expenses.  It also adds capacity.  Service delivery index reached a best ever level in the quarter at nearly 92.  This is a composite metric of all customer commitments and correlates directly with the improvements Jack discussed with customer satisfaction.  Importantly, we achieved this high performance level while making safety gains in all categories, employee, customer and public.</p>
          <p>A key question is how volume variable can UP be in a declining volume environment?  The concept of volume variability can best be illustrated by this chart.  Our working resources, crews, locomotives, freight cars, coupled with our fixed plant, determines capacity in terms of network throughput, which is the most appropriate definition of capacity in the rail industry.  Although seven-day carloadings have been running about 145,000, we believe today our physical plant has fixed capacity for roughly 200,000 weekly carloads.</p>
          <p>We needed to adjust our working resources to reflect the current economic conditions.  To achieve that we employed a number of levers that impact each category, such as furloughs, lease returns, retirements and network re-design.  These steps work in a down economy, but we have also built in recall steps should volumes increase.  To date those efforts have yielded strong results.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, UP's gross ton miles declined 20% year-over-year.  As we've discussed in the past, one of our primary objectives has been to match train starts with the freight demand.  And with the first quarter starts down 21% against a 20% tonnage decline, we again achieved that goal.</p>
          <p>For the quarter we averaged 18% fewer train engine and yard employees, used 24% fewer road locomotives and 26% fewer freight cars, so our working resources lined up well against the first quarter volumes.  As we enter the second quarter, resource storage rates exceed first quarter averages as we've taken additional actions.</p>
          <p>Currently on the right-hand side of the chart you can see we have roughly 26% of our trainmen furloughed, 31% of our road locomotive stored and 31% of our freight car fleet parked.  We've also furloughed about 700 employees in other crafts as the overall network workload has declined.  Moving forward we will continue to make adjustments as warranted by demand.</p>
          <p>Beyond these adjustments in our working resources we are also making changes in the use of our fixed plant, adjusting terminal operations and train networks to maximize efficiency.  We are using our Unified Plan process to shift workload to our most efficient yards and to dramatically scale back or close other less efficient facilities, as represented by the pyramid on the left.</p>
          <p>Through this approach we have significantly reduced activity at the regional and local yards in our manifest networks.  For Intermodal and Auto traffic we are combining the two networks to match volumes and maintain or enhance service performance.  Then we aggressively are controlling costs within these scaled back networks through the applications of remote control locomotives, shift eliminations, reducing staff levels and other cost-related actions across all terminals.</p>
          <p>So as we look ahead to the rest of 2009, the operating team's objectives are unchanged.  Safety is always a top priority and we expect continuous improvement.  The work of being volume variable is evergreen.</p>
          <p>In fact, we believe the operational changes we're making today are creating capacity and service consistency for our customers in the future.  And as we enter the summer capital maintenance season we have the opportunity to work very efficiently on our unit cost with the lower train volumes.  And when the economy turns around and the volumes return, we are ready.  We will apply the principles of volume variability to generate upside leverage to the growing volumes.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Rob for the financials.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dennis and good morning.  Let me start today with our first quarter income statement.</p>
          <p>Operating revenue declined 20% in the quarter to $3.4 billion.  Lower revenue was primarily driven by the 21% drop in carloadings.  In addition, fuel surcharge revenue decreased more than $300 million year-over-year as a result of lower diesel fuel prices.</p>
          <p>Operating expenses also decreased 21% to $2.7 billion.  The company's cost saving initiatives associated with the lower volumes and increased efficiency helped hold down expenses.  Another contributor was the 47% year-over-year decline in average quarterly diesel fuel prices.</p>
          <p>In addition, last year's first quarter included roughly $20 million of higher costs associated with the Oregon mudslide, so we have a slightly favorable comparison year-over-year.  The combination of lower revenue and expenses resulted in first quarter operating income of $672 million, a 15% decrease.</p>
          <p>First quarter freight revenue totaled $3.2 billion, down 20% year-over-year on lower carloadings.  On the pricing front our results were consistent with our outlook for average increases in the five to 6% range.  In fact, in the first quarter we were at the higher end of that range.</p>
          <p>Average revenue per car also increased year-over-year, up only 1% to $1,755 per car as lower fuel surcharges nearly offset the positive pricing.  In fact, if you look at average revenue per car over the last five quarters, it peaked in the third quarter of 2008 when diesel fuel prices were at their highest.  Customers see the benefit of lower fuel prices in their freight bills, which have decreased on average 9% over the last six months.</p>
          <p>Our opportunity in today's depressed carload environment is to align expenses with volumes, while at the same time increasing efficiency.  As carloadings started falling off last November, we've taken action to better align supply with demand and those actions aren't just confined to operations, we've acted across the company to reduce spending.</p>
          <p>Our efficiency has also improved significantly in the last several months.  Although it's difficult to separate how much of this is driven by volumes, the gains are evident in our costs and in our service.</p>
          <p>Back in January we discussed that roughly 30% of our costs are linked to quarterly volume changes.  We also stated that the share of costs that vary with volume increases grew about 50% over the course of a couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Longer term, over a number of years, costs are increasingly variable as we size our business to match volume levels.  With first quarter volumes declining 21%, quarterly operating expenses, adjusted for the change in fuel price, declined 12%.  We combine the impact of lower volumes and greater overall productivity to achieve 55% expense variability in the quarter.</p>
          <p>As we walk through each of the different expense categories we'll point out areas where volumes, efficiency gains or both helped drive lower costs.  Let's start with compensation and benefits, down 5% to $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>An 8% reduction in our workforce, enabled by lower carload volumes and record operating efficiency, were the primary driver of the year-over-year decline.  As you heard from Dennis, our TE&amp;Y workforce declined 18% in the first quarter.  Freightmen, which accounted for roughly 30% of our workforce, are clearly the most variable part of our employee base, but all UP departments experienced workforce reductions in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Furlough levels increased throughout the first quarter and are continuing today.  As a result, we have a timing difference with our quarterly averages and the actual reduction trends.</p>
          <p>Offsetting a portion of these reductions was wage inflation associated with a 4% increase last July for union employees, as well as higher benefit costs.  As we move through 2009 we will continue to align our workforce levels with demand and productivity.</p>
          <p>Purchased services and materials expense declined 15% in the quarter or $70 million.  This category benefited from decreased contract service expense, as well reduced crew transportation and lodging.  Lower volumes and increased productivity were the primary reasons for less usage of purchased services.</p>
          <p>First quarter fuel expense totaled $386 million, a 60% decline versus last year.  We saved $335 million in the quarter as fuel prices decreased from an average of $2.84 per gallon in 2008 versus only paying $1.51 per gallon on average this year.  Interestingly, the $1.51 per gallon is the lowest quarterly average price we've paid in four years.</p>
          <p>Fuel expense was also lower year-over-year as a result of consuming 78 million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in the quarter.  The 20% reduction in gross ton miles saved approximately $177 million, while our continued fuel conservation efforts contributed another $45 million in savings.</p>
          <p>Although diesel fuel prices have inched up some in the last few weeks, we're still only paying about $1.55 per gallon today.  At that level, fuel prices could be as much as $2 per gallon lower in the second quarter of 2009 versus last year.  If these prices hold similar to the first quarter customers will continue to see the benefit of declining fuel prices in the form of lower fuel surcharges.</p>
          <p>Depreciation expense increased $5 million year-over-year to $345 million.  This reflects increased capital spending in recent year.  However, effective January 1, 2009, lower depreciation rates for rail and other track material offset most of the increase.  The lower depreciation rate is associated with longer asset lives and reduced track usage.</p>
          <p>First quarter equipment and other rents expense declined to $317 million, down $25 million from 2008 levels.  Lower carload volumes of finished vehicles, Industrial Products and Intermodal continue to drive down short-term car rents.  Fewer leased assets also reduced rental costs in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Other expense declined $16 million in the first quarter to $226 million.  Freight and property damage expense decreased in the quarter, along with our volume levels.  In addition, first quarter casualty accruals were lower in 2009 as a result of ongoing safety improvements.  Somewhat offsetting these reductions were higher state and local taxes, as well as an increased provision for bad debts.</p>
          <p>A 21% decrease in operating expenses against a 20% decline in operating revenue resulted in a first quarter operating ratio of 80.3%.  This record operating ratio was driven by lower year-over-year fuel prices, pricing gains and increased productivity, offset somewhat by lower volume.</p>
          <p>In fact, year-over-year we improved 1.2 points on our operating ratio.  Over the last four years, despite declining volumes, we've taken 3.4 points off of our first quarter operating ratio.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the full income statement, first quarter other income was $2 million lower versus 2008 at $23 million.  Gains from real estate sales declined in the quarter, while interest income was also down, reflecting lower interest rates.  Interest expense increased 12% in the quarter to $141 million.  Although UP's effective interest rate was slightly lower year-over-year, higher average debt levels drove the increased expense.</p>
          <p>First quarter income tax expense declined $52 million or 22%.  Lower pre-tax income and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 34.7% contributed to the expense reduction.  Similar to last year, our effective tax rate includes a deferred tax benefit associated with newly enacted state legislation.    On a full year basis we would expect an effective tax rate closer to 37%.</p>
          <p>Net income for the quarter totaled $362 million, an 18% decline versus last year's record first quarter.  Earnings per share came in 15% lower year-over-year at $0.72 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide 32 illustrates UP's adjusted debt balances at the end of the first quarter, which totaled $14.4 billion or a 47.9% adjusted debt-to-cap ratio.  In February we retired $250 million of debt and we took advantage of a favorable capital markets window, issuing 750 million of additional debt.</p>
          <p>First quarter ending cash balances totaled nearly $1.5 billion, reflecting the proceeds of the debt offering I just mentioned.  We are continuing to maintain a strong liquidity position through these tough and uncertain economic times.  We are also taking a hard look at our capital spending in 2009.  Although we initially budgeted $2.8 billion, we now plan to trim that back to about $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>As Jack discussed with you earlier, there's still a great deal of uncertainty in the market place.  Although we can point to certain inventory figures and leading carload indicators that hold the potential for trends to improve, the timing is unclear.</p>
          <p>It does feel, however, like we've reached a point of stability in our volumes.  With little visibility to near-term change in demand, we will work to further align resources with volumes, while also improving efficiency.  Keep in mind, however, that we've already achieved over 50% cost variability.</p>
          <p>Lower year-over-year fuel prices should continue to help drive a decline in quarterly operating expenses and since we don't yet have 100% fuel surcharge recovery, lower prices help.  We are also committed to achieving strong pricing gains for 2009, which are necessary to earn a return on our investment.</p>
          <p>While we are not providing quarterly earnings guidance today, it is safe to say however at these continued low volume levels we won't reach last year's second quarter earnings of $1.02 per share.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Rob.  As we look ahead at the year there continues to be a great deal of uncertainty regarding business volumes.  Although we are watching for signs of a recovery, we don't anticipate a turnaround any time soon.</p>
          <p>With business volumes continuing to run down more than 20% versus last year, we're taking additional steps to take costs out of the network.  Included in this, as Rob motioned, is a reduction in our 2009 capital budget to about $2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Although we are slowing some of our capacity additions, we're still investing for the future when the volume returns.  This cost focus does not, however, reduce our commitment to increasing safety and providing excellent customer service.  The performance record we have built in these areas is fundamental to increasing the value we provide to our customers and our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Customers are looking for supply chain solutions that can help them meet their business objectives and our network is poised to meet that need.  In fact, we believe we will leverage volumes more strongly than we have in the past cycles as a result of our Unified Plan efforts, Lean management and other network initiatives.</p>
          <p>UP's safe, fuel efficient, environmentally friendly transportation offerings further increase the already strong value of rail.  Today's balanced regulatory environment supports our ability to invest and advance the value we can provide our customers, our shareholders and the nation's economy.</p>
          <p>UP's goals of investing and growing with our customers will be challenged if regulations change and limit our ability to earn an adequate financial return.  We're dedicated to increasing shareholder value and we look ahead optimistically to a growing global economy that will benefit from the strong rail franchise UP has to offer.</p>
          <p>With that, let's open it up for your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning.  I'm just wondering if we can talk a little bit about incentive comp, sorry I jumped on late, so I wasn't sure if you'd mentioned it, but incentive comp I don't think came down very much.  So is that suggesting that maybe you feel like the first quarter is perhaps the trough for the year or how should we think about what incentive comp trends suggest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill, I think first thing you have to be careful on looking at maybe what you saw at some other railroads, our program is not similar in terms of the way you do mark-to-market.  Ours is a little more consistent that's out here.  Incentive comp is down a little bit to a year ago.  We'll take a look at it each quarter in terms of our performance going forward and we'll adjust according to how our performance will work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  So, Jim, UP used to be one of the best railroads, if not the best before the SP merger.  Can you get back to that level and if you can what's the philosophy and importantly what's the CapEx requirement for you to get back there?  Because I look at the locomotives stored and I look at what you've done at CapEx and I say, well CapEx maybe can come down materially from where we are.  And yet if you want to get back to those operating levels and you've improved a lot I would think you still might have to spend quite a bit from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Bill, I would &#x2013; we used to be one of the best.  I think we're one of the best right now, but we can debate that another time.  We're being smart about our capital investment and if you look at it, again you have to go back to the SP, C&amp;NW merger we bought some properties that needed capital.  We've been putting it in.  I think you see the results in several areas.  Customer service, clearly we have substantially changed the mindset of customers and I would tell you that doesn't happen overnight.</p>
          <p>You've got to work at it consistently, show what you can do.  Our efficiency, granted, we are benefiting from lower volumes, but I will tell you whether we're running 145,000 cars or 190,000 cars our productivity is going to be very good.  We still have some needs going forward and I've got to keep an eye on the long term here.  Now is the time to put capacity in.  I will tell you, we're seeing our productivity in terms of capital efficiency, we're up almost 20%.  So we're going to be smart about our capital long term and we've adjusted, you heard we cut it back about 2.6 billion.  If you recall I have 125 locomotives in that number right now that quite honestly I don't need another locomotive for several years, but we'll be smart going forward.</p>

          <p>Just on the pricing side, it sounds like you've got a pretty good five to 6% into the high end of that you were mentioning.  I was just wondering how is the tone right now of your recent renewals, are you still getting five to 6% in the first quarter or is it coming down because of the economy?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's really not been a substantial change in our renewals.  I think what you'd have to do is distinguish between our legacy contract renewals and then our other day-to-day contract renewals.  But there's &#x2013; the negotiations are ongoing.  We're trying to be competitive, trying to make sure customers recognize the value they're receiving and we really haven't seen a substantial change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And do you have a sense of how much of your 2010 book is priced in right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well right now, Walter, we're not providing any guidance on 2010 that's out here.  But again, what we look at is keep in mind, I'd go back to your first question here.  There's still a significant spread between an old legacy contract and even a softer market that's out here.  So I'm confident if we keep providing the service, the value proposition to customers that we have today, we're going to see positive pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Jim, some of your competitors have been talking a bit just yesterday about the risk of cutting too much too quickly.  Can you talk to us about how you look at that and what are the big challenges you see if volumes do start to come back and you stored a lot of cars, furloughed a lot of workers?  What's your biggest challenge if we do see that V-shape recovery to getting things back on line to be able to service the demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Walter you may recall we learned a pretty hard lesson in 2003 and '04 when we were short substantially when the economy came back.  We were short locomotives, we were short people and it hurt us in terms of &#x2013; in fact we still had business that we lost then that hasn't come back.  We've got a very disciplined approach, Dennis and his team.  We know what the lead times are on each one of our resources.</p>
          <p>Every Monday morning we have the team together looking for signs of recovery and ask the question if it's a V-shape how quickly can we respond.  I will tell you right now though at a 143, 142,000 cars a week with Dennis's slide that we've shown where we've got fixed ability of 200,000, we got a long ways to go before we're going to be stretched in terms of an economic &#x2013; problems of handling volume growth.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Got it.  Just last question here, Rob, on the share buyback, very quickly, what's your thoughts?  You cut that down this quarter.  Any view on resuming that or you're going wait until markets improve a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Both.  I mean obviously our price is very attractive, but you nailed it.  I mean we're going to take hard look at economic recovery and of course our resulting business volumes recover.  So we're taking a cautious approach at this point.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.  Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Good morning.  Hey, Jim, Rob.  Jim, when we were talking a couple months ago it sounded like you said if volume stay down 20% we may have to look at things a little bit differently.  We're kind of still at that 20% level.  How long and what do you think needs to shift here?  I mean you said you made more cuts on the head count reduction.  Can you get the costs, the employee costs even down closer to that, do you want to?  And what other moves do you want to make longer term with volumes staying at these levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Ken, the question is how long.  We are taking additional actions.  We have not stopped.  We're again trying to, you know I said in my summary here, I don't see much of a recovery this year.  So we're really looking next year at best.  I'm going to have Dennis answer, address this here in a minute in terms of some other, the new things we're looking at.</p>
          <p>But we're after it and again it takes &#x2013; we're down 20% in volume right now, our force counts are down about 8%.  I think second quarter you'll see that spread, even do a little bit better.  You're not going to match a 20% reduction in volume with force counts in the short term.  But I'll have Duff talk a little bit about some of the things, additional things we're looking at in our network right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously, Ken what we've done is intent a job on the variable cost and we continue to do that.  You saw in Rob's chart we show a 55% variable.  We think we're in that 55, 60%.  And what we're trying to do is move up into the fixed plant and see what economies we can derive right there.  And I mentioned that just a few in our terminal operation where we have it stratified between our network, our regional and our local yards and driving the efficiencies into the networked yards.  And we're doing that on the Intermodal side, the Auto side and our manifest network so that we can leverage as much as possible out of the fixed plant and continue to take that percent variability higher and higher as we see these volumes erode.</p>
          <p>So the other thing is we're trying to shorten the cycle time between the time we see the volume reductions and the time that we're able to take it to the bottom line.  In the past that's been elongated.  We always talk about the percent variable in each quarter, but we'd like to get it down to days and so that we're totally responsive when we see those volume fluctuations.  And I'll just reinforce with Jim that we do that on the down side, we also build in recall steps, so totally along the way.  We don't take a down action that we don't have a recall step and be able to work our way back out of that with a predefined lead time so that we can recover if volumes are there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, a couple quick points here.  One, we're not going to jeopardize customer service, it's very important, we're seeing a lot of value there.  And two, we still are seeing attrition.  We expect attrition in our force counts this year.  Will it slow down a little bit?  We'll still see three to 4,000 folks leave the company and that's down a little bit from what we saw in prior years.  So we're trying to take advantage of that as much as we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then on just a quick financial question on the surcharge lag benefit, was there &#x2013; what dollar, Rob, was the benefit this quarter?  And then, I guess a Jack question, on Intermodal, yields were actually positive this quarter, how did you do that relative to what we've seen from the industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the lag benefit it's roughly $0.20 on an EPS basis for the surcharge.  So while prices were clearly down and our surcharge number was down, as you know, which drove our revenue down we did get a benefit in the first quarter of about $0.20 on an EPS basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the Intermodal pricing, Ken, we've got, we did have some on the international side legacy renewals last year that gave us some carryover benefit this year.  But we've also on our premium domestic business with the service levels being what they are, some of the new products like our Streamline growth, that's actually been quite good for us and we have been able to get price in the market on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then on coal do you look for, I mean at the Transportation Coal Conference last week it sounded like things are abysmal with export declining, no test burns east of the Mississippi.  What is your outlook for continuing to push PRB coal east, are there any opportunities and what do you view as volumes going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The phone has kind of stopped ringing again for eastern opportunities.  There are occasional opportunities that we're continuing to work on, but it's not nearly as hot as it was a year ago, so we're looking right now primarily at our own domestic franchise.  We said before we're not a big player in the export market, so we didn't gain a lot from that.  We're not going to lose from that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question I have is, Jim, if you can just give us an update on what you think is coming out of Washington, it sounds like everybody is in a huddle room right now with the AAR joining in.  Do you think we see some legislation, are you more confident that something is going to come down the pipe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ken, I &#x2013; we are active in Washington, as we have been the last two, three years and what our goal, what my goal is to make certain if legislation comes down the pike and you can read the tea leaves.  They're clearly with the new congress up there, there's the higher potential.  But again, one of the things that &#x2013; whenever I'm in a member's office, particularly the folks that want to push some new regulations, the discussion always ends up with how do we put more business in the railroads.</p>
          <p>And our discussions one on, you've got to be careful where we're going because capital will dry up very quickly and you have to take into account replacement costs of assets going forward.  So I think we've got a good story to tell with our service, the value we're offering.  We're a private industry that's putting capital into capacity.  So we'll see what happens here.  I would tell you I feel pretty confident that the members understand the value of railroads and that we're going to get this right going forward.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy with Citigroup.  Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you.  I appreciate the dashboard you provided in the slide deck about indicators you're watching for a turn.  Just curious looking at the AR traffic that came out this morning, both your numbers, the industry numbers over the last four weeks are a couple points worst than the first quarter rate of decline which certainly doesn't point to anything improving any time soon.  I was wondering though what are you hearing from customers.  People have talked and speculated about the potential from de-stocking and how that might drive a pick up, but I'm wondering if your actual conversations, your boots on the ground are having those conversations and showing that people are intending to do that or at least contemplating it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well <mark type="inaudible" /> but keep in mind what I said here is and if you look at our numbers, I don't see it.  You have to careful about each week here.  I think there's little bit of carryover from Easter in the numbers.  Traditionally in fact if you look over time when you &#x2013; early April, the start of the second quarter is generally weak.  I mean if we see a pick up towards the end of a quarter then it falls off and then it picks up.  What I see right now and what I'm hearing from customers is, as Jack said, there's some sign of hope, but not a strong leaning towards things are getting worse.  If anything it's kind of balanced right now.  Jack, you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say, Matt, say our customer conversations, there's lot of optimism for the second half and nobody really sees much happening right at the moment.  There's lot of speculation as to what the stimulus bill will or will not do.  We're working very closely with our customer base to make sure they understand opportunities within the stimulus bill.</p>
          <p>So there's some bright spots associated with that, but overall I think our customer base is relatively realistic.  They're not pessimistic in terms of it getting worse.  They think for the most part it's kind of bottomed out.  You can kind of pick an industry, you can kind a pick a customer to kind of walk through it, but everybody is kind of looking towards the second half as starting really to show some substantive signs of recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, just the concern being is that in December everyone was looking towards the first half and the middle of 2009 and that hope didn't materialize, but certainly we're pulling for the stimulus to have some...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matt, the way we're running and looking at resources though, don't hear from us that we're seeing &#x2013; we're saying there's a second half recovery.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, no, I understand, I understand and I appreciate that.  The second question I had and it relates to Washington, but from a different perspective, certainly the expectation is we'll get some kind of regulatory update in the coming weeks.  On the stimulus side, it seems that a lot of red meat was thrown to a lot of different industries and the rail/freight industry, which checks a lot of the boxes in terms of what the stimulus is trying to accomplish, kind of got just bread crumbs.  And I was just wondering is there a strong voice representing the rails in Washington?  It would seem that you guys would be a natural beneficiary for more stimulus funds given the environmental benefit, given the infrastructure benefit.  If you could just give us an update on the efforts there and whether it's a tax credit, what might we work towards longer term to get some of that money that's being thrown around in this industry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Matt, I think there are two issues there.  You have the long-term investment tax credit that we've been talking about for some time.  And our objective there obviously is if we believe more rail capacity is needed to meet the country's needs in the future, which I do, one way of attracting capital and improve returns is investment tax credit.  That's a long-term strategy.  The stimulus money, quite honestly, we did not make a major ask.  If you look at what came out for the overall transportation, about 80, 85 billion I think in total  and very little of that is for freight.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>That is a huge investment for this industry and you can call it an un-funded mandate because that's what it is.  That we're going to have to figure out how that's paid for long-term, not only in the freight system, but the commuter operations.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I understand why a direct government stimulus into the industry might not make sense, but the tax credit is certainly something we have been hearing about for a while.  Is there any kind of roadmap or process that, that could happen sooner rather than later or is it just a work in process and we should just stay tuned on this end?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Tom.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to and I missed the beginning of the call, there was some overlap, but I don't know if you've talked much about the coal view.  It seems like in the east the volume outlook has gotten materially worse and there's more sensitivity there due low natural gas prices and some switching on the margin.  But what's your coal view looking forward?  Did the volumes get worse year-over-year, are inventory levels too high and do you care about natural gas prices or do you think things actually get a little bit better for your coal volumes?  I guess the other factor there is that you had talked about production issues in your Colorado mines and I'm not sure how that could affect going forward as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you look at the first quarter, tonnage was down about 10% or so and you could split it three ways.  About a third was to some loss legacy business that we incurred, about a third to Colorado, Utah in terms some of the production problems and a third to overall demand.  Right now we're running about 27 trains a day, 28 trains out of PRB.  So that's down a little bit from what we finished the quarter at.  It's going to be weak I think the balance of the year unless, again, the wild card here is what happens with summer heating that's out here.  And we're not, again, we will see our volume, our coal volumes down for the full year.  Jack, you want to add anything to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you're right, Tom.  I think we're less sensitive to natural gas pricing.  A lot of our customers have peakers, but they don't actually have the ability to convert massively to gas.  So we tend to be cushioned a little bit from that, although you never say never, that tends to be more a southeast and a northeast kind of phenomenon for us.  Stockpiles are relatively high, as Jim said, depending on weather and what happens.  They can melt away pretty quickly if we have a really hot summer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay and, Jack, since you're I guess on the line can you give us a sense of the breakdown of yield in terms of fuel price and mix?  I know you talked about price being kind of towards 6%, but what was yield impact from fuel and mix in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you go back and you look at it from a yield perspective, I think fuel hit us for about 7%.  We were on the high end of our price range, as I said and then you probably got a point or so from positive mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, a little bit from positive mix.  Okay, good.  And last question and I'll hand it off to someone else.  From a more &#x2013; from a kind of higher level strategic view, I guess if you looked a few years back you might have said that the way you ran your terminals, let's say pick Houston as a point, there would have been some room to run the terminals more effectively in terms of you got a couple Houston terminals and maybe the way you managed the flow could be improved.  I think you did some work on that back a few years ago, but is there a further opportunity to make major changes in the way you run terminals where you have more terminal density and perhaps even shutdown some terminals and expand others?  Is that the type of thing you can really do to make structural changes when you're in such a weak volume environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, absolutely, Tom.  And that's exactly what we are doing with all of our terminal infrastructure and if you look at the slide that I showed that shows the hierarchy of our terminals, you're talking about those major network terminals, the Houstons of the world.  Our impetus is to drive volume into those and obviously take the economies from the lower level yard jobs, the local yards, the regional yards and even within the major yards we have still, still plenty of opportunities there to run those more efficiently.</p>
          <p>But we certainly want to take advantage of the economies of scale offered by those yards and then make them as efficient as possible.  And that's exactly what we're doing and redefining the transportation plan as we do that using the Unified Plan.  So that we can at the same time improve customer service and derive the efficiencies associated with it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.  The next question today will be coming from the line of Randy Cousins of BMO Capital Markets.  Please go ahead with your question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Rob, for you I guess the first question.  You don't have 100% fuel surcharge coverage. I guess the fuel surcharge drop was 300 million bucks and the fuel cost drop was 570 million and obviously there's a volume factor in there as well.  But could you give us some sense as sort of what you thought the benefit was in the first quarter of the lower fuel prices juxtaposed against the issues of coverage that you have in some of your book of business?  And does that benefit continue over the balance of the year, assuming fuel prices stay where they are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, we don't break it out as precisely as I understand you're asking.  But again, the net was when you add it all in, the net benefit versus last year was that $0.20.  But of course last year we were facing kind of a rising fuel environment and as you look forward into the second quarter, if fuel prices stay where they are and volumes stay down like what they're running you will get, well there might be &#x2013; we would expect some lag benefit moving forward.</p>
          <p>It won't be as material because now you're in a flatter environment.  So as time goes on and fuel prices stabilize you don't see that kind of a lag benefit going forward.  So it all depends on what fuel prices do in the second quarter, but again, assuming they just kind of stay flat and everything kind of stays as it is, while prices would be significantly down versus the previous year in the second quarter, you wouldn't see any kind of material lag benefit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that $0.20 that you're talking about, that includes the sort of the fact that some of the business just doesn't have a good fuel surcharge coverage number in it, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And I don't know whether this question should go to Dennis or Jack, but your RTMs were down a lot less than the GTMs and I noticed that the chemical ratio looked particularly, a big difference between RTMs versus GTMs.  Can you give us a sense as to what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  It's primarily mix, Randy, and length of haul improving some of those kinds of issues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And of course that would be a good thing for you guys, not a bad thing, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just with reference to the Intermodal business, you talked about the domestic side being down nine versus the international being down 30.  Can you give us some sense, do you think you're picking up market share against the trucks or can you give us some sense as to sort of some color within that 9%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, we definitely are picking up some market share against trucks and again, what I said was it was down nine for the quarter, but by the end of the quarter for March domestic was only down two and we're continuing to see that strengthen.  It's largely on the benefits of the service that we have today.  We are very competitive with trucks and some of our new service offerings, we opened up several lanes to run Intermodal.</p>
          <p>Refrigerator trailers that we hadn't had in the past, the new double stack service up and down the I-5 corridor on the West Coast.  The Streamline door-to-door product is catching on in the market place, very attractive to customers.  As I said, about 4,000 &#x2013; they grew about 5,000 containers in the quarter and about 1,700 of those came off the highway.  So we are definitely making some improvements against the trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Some of your competitors have talked about RCAF being an issue in terms of price.  I wonder if you could talk about whether that had any impact in terms of your arc in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>RCAF is a pretty small factor for me.  In total, RCAF related it's probably three, 4% of RCAF alone and then you'd have another eight or so percent associated with ALIF, but of course there's a differentiation there.  So in total only about 11% or so of my business is RCAF related, so it's not a big factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Last question, last May I guess when you guys had your investor conference you talked about what you could do in terms of operating ratio reduction.  Going along with the expression, that necessity is the mother of invention and obviously we're taking a look at systems and approaches you never had to before because of the environment that we're in.  Do you guys feel safe to say that there's another two or three points of OR that's come out of the system just simply because you found efficiencies that you never realized you had?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Randy, I am not wavering from our long-term view that said our operating ratio would get down to that low 70s.  While this is &#x2013; obviously the volume environment is a challenge we still have tremendous opportunity at both price, the service to value equation and our productivity piece.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Jim, do you think it could even go even lower given that you've seen how the system performed through this downdraft?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Randy, I've said consistently we could be a smaller railroad with much higher quality revenue and we're humming in terms of asset turns and efficiency.  You're seeing that to some extent right now.  You have to have some volume though.  I mean there's a point here where we're running 140,000 cars, we're resourced for 200.  You've got to have some volume pick up.  I believe it will pick up.  The value proposition for railroads is there and we're proving our &#x2013; we had a great example of how you prove that there, it says greater velocity drives efficiency, better service drives efficiency and you can see it in our numbers this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well then I'll flip it around and say if the volumes went back up by 10,000 carloads or 20,000 carloads could you give us some sense of what you think the torque would be to the EBIT line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are going to -- I used a term you're printing money, but you really do, we have -- when you look at the way -- what we're resourced for today we can take on a pretty significant increase in volume and lever the bottom line.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Ed, I don't know if you've got some of the detail that Dennis gave in going through his, but we finished the quarter at a lower run rate than the average was for the first quarter.  So we're off to a start here that would suggest that at this level of volumes that we're lower than that first quarter average.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my question, what is that number, if you have it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>40, just under 45, 44.7ish.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And directionally are you kind of done there or is it a process that you'll expect more to happen in the second quarter, assuming no change in volumes right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Jim.  But, yes, as I said we are &#x2013; we have additional activities underway.  We didn't &#x2013; the way this process works you don't put a plan out and then stop.  We've been watching our carloadings and volume, we're continuing.  You're going to see more reductions if this volume doesn't start to turn around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.  Could you talk a little bit about the Utah/Colorado situation, has anything come back and do you have any visibility into the timing?  I think you said give or take a third of your coal demand is a result of that.  When should we see that third start to come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've seen some comebacks and we've seen some setbacks.  So we're still sitting there today with about I would say 2.5 mines down.  We got one mine that's working at about half tilt, trying to work through some coal quality issues.  We have one mine that is trying to get through some issues with MSHAW and one that's working diligently to get their coal line back up again.  So with two-and-a-half mines down they're anticipating that certainly during the second quarter everybody will be back up and running.  We're rooting for them.  We want to see that happen, but that's kind of the place where we see it right at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And has it been basically that same level give or take that we've been at for the last three or five months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has.  It seems like unfortunately as one mine comes back another one develops a problem and we've been running about two-and-a-half mines down since certainly since the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Hey, Jack, can you talk to directionally when you look relative to each other which end segments new pricing as you're in those negotiations right now, where are you seeing relatively greater pressure and where are you seeing relatively less pressure on pricing by segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The place where the truck competition is the most intense is probably the places where we're seeing the greatest pressure.  And that certainly is understandable and particularly as we look across our book of business you just kind of work through those ebbs and flows.  We are not chasing business by any stretch of the imagination.  We're working very diligently with our customers to provide good value and to help them get through these tough economic conditions here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  One last big picture for Jim.  I understand your thoughts on the regulatory environment and the need to make sure that D.C. understands the importance of the railroads.  We certainly heard that kind of talk from everybody.  To you at UP, assuming that something has got to change, what do you see as the main issue that is out there?  What is the kind of focus do you think that the regulators are looking at and that the rails are going to have to come to terms with settling or negotiating through?  Is it bottlenecks, is it switching, is it a whole pricing scheme?  What do you see as kind of the main issues here?</p>

          <p>Ed from the customer perspective you can call it what you want to, but it's about pricing.  And they call it competition to some extent, but at the end of day you're looking at some kind of added perspective on the pricing that's out there.  And my view of this thing, again, the other side, the complicated thing is, every member I talk to, including the STB, agree that replacement costs are also an issue in how you think through it long-term.</p>
          <p>So we got a pretty big spread here.  But all of them, again, even our customers and the representatives in Washington that are supporting new regulations want to see more investment in the railroad business.  And I think there's, again, what I try to point out in this business when you look at cash flows and you look at return on capital when you bring replacement costs in, we don't have much room for there to be any error on new legislation.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to ask a couple of questions.  First just a quick cleanup one for Jack.  Coal pricing looked a little bit better than we thought.  Is the Colorado/Utah mix change, is that lower revenue per carload, was that mix positive to lose some of that volume?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, I think the biggest issue was the legacy renewals that we had last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then, Rob, could I ask you also to just clarify, you said the fuel tailwinds were $0.20.  Was that net year-on-year or was that in the quarter added $0.20?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's year-over-year.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And could you just remind us what the year ago number was?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, just one comment.  I mean of course in that environment it was rising fuel prices, but I think net-net last year was a similar number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no, no real impact on the actual earnings you created this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  As you guys look at some of these slides that Jack put together, you  look at the utilization level in terms of where you think you are at 75%, the mention that inventory really isn't the issue and that what's required is a real shift in demand.  How much &#x2013; how far through the cost reduction process are you and does it not make sense to go further?  Because it really does feel like it's an end market demand issue, unless things come snapping back.  Feels like that the volume isn't going to be up to that 200 plus thousand carload throughput you're capable of?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not stopping.  I mean we are continuing and don't hear from us that we believe 200,000 cars is in the near term.  Our assumption and what we're doing on the, the way we're running the business here is this is, number one, not much recovery, if any this year and then a very slow recovery when you look out to the future.  Could be wrong, we've got to protect that if we're wrong we can respond, but you're going to see continued progress on our cost numbers, efficiency, for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there a way, Jim, to think about how much of that you were able to get through in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Gary, again, long term, again, Rob or somebody was about 55% variable this first quarter.  If again as things progress or don't progress and it's neutral, that percentage starts to increase.  I mean we can get into a model here where we're closing yards.  We're shutting down on weekends, there are lot of things that you can start to deploy that we're actually looking at right now in terms of our cost structure.</p>
          <p>And I again mention, keep in mind here we're, we are still seeing attrition, three to 4,000 employees a year, which again we will manage as we're going forward here.  Our capital spend, we're not &#x2013; I'm not going to talk about next year, but again where you look at if you assume that this is a long haul you're going to see substantial lower capital numbers going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could just add a couple of comments, Gary.  One, I mean as you know, if we thought, we're not predicting this, but if you thought volumes were going to stay down forever at low levels, you'd start to take those deeper cost actions.  So you've got to kind of balance that with a long-term perspective and I wanted to come back to your first question to me, Gary, where you asked about fuel.  I looked up you question about what happened last year.</p>
          <p>In last year actually the lag hurt us in the first quarter.  So when you look at year-over-year there was a $0.20 all-in benefit to us in the first quarter this year versus last year and last year versus the year before that lag was a negative.  So you got sort of, lots of moving parts there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I guess all I am trying get at is would you have earned anything less or more than 70%, so the answer sounds like no, that's a clean number for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the other thing you got keep in mind is offsetting, I mean volumes were of course a much bigger drag on earnings.  So while we got a benefit of fuel in the quarter year-over-year, the bigger driver of course was volume.  So we did a good job of overcoming, fuel certainly helped us, productivity and price where the other major players.  So we were able to offset that rather significant volume drop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, guys.  Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning.  Just a couple of quick follow-ups on the coal situation.  First and I apologize if you mentioned this, how much of an impact over the past few weeks has weather been?  We've seen a bit of a down lag in volumes there, how much of that is related to weather issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jack?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, typically I would tell you that there was some impact associated with weather, but in this market with stockpiles being so high I'm not sure I would say weather was a significant factor for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more fundamental than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then have you seen, I guess last year folks were talking about a potential knock-on benefit for western rails in the coal businesses as the eastern guys were making a lot of money shipping stuff out of the East Coast ports and maybe you were doing some back filling with western coal.   Has that reverse at all with the sharp drop off in exports out of the east?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the enthusiasm has certainly, has certainly gone out of the market, so it has not, again, been a big factor for us.  I think the bigger factor is just high stockpiles, energy consumption, electrical consumption being down and then to some extent some of the mine issues that we've had in Colorado.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then one quick one on the Ag business.  Did you see farmers holding inventory in the quarter because prices were low, did that hurt the Ag volumes and what's your outlook for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the bigger issue is the world supplies are so much stronger this year than &#x2013; last year was a record first quarter for us in the Ag products business.  World supplies were relatively weak.  The dollar was weak and so the U.S. market was incredibly strong.  It's very, very different the first quarter.</p>
          <p>This year world supplies are relatively strong, the dollar is higher value.  We have been surprised that some of the Gulf exports have been stronger than what we had anticipated.  We're watching pretty carefully, it looks the soybean crops in Argentina may not be anywhere close to what the world had expected.  That could actually provide greater export opportunity for us later in the year, so that's kind of where we see it right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had a question on your Streamline product which you've mentioned a couple of times, very high growth off I guess a relatively small base providing door-to-door intermodal on your own line, is that correct?  Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that is correct John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Can that product kind of peacefully coexist with your intermodal marketing company customers, truckload customers and so forth?  It seems to me that you in some ways are beginning to compete with your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually the biggest users of our Streamline product are the intermodal marketing companies.  So we are not using it to aggressively go out and retail against our IMCs.  The product is really focused at the IMC community.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And do you provide your own chassis and boxes into that system, how does that work?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do.  We use our EMP box fleet and chassis to provide the service.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there's another factor that you have from the Streamline, which is market intelligence.  That's what happening in that truck sector, so I &#x2013; and there's several values when you look at it long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure that's right.  We've heard during the first quarter that there was an awful lot of bidding of intermodal packages by big shippers.  Who ends up absorbing any price decreases that might get built into those bids, does that all get absorbed by the IMCs or does the UP have to absorb some of that as well or does it depend on the particular circumstance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It depends on the circumstance and what the supply chain &#x2013; I mean in some place it gets absorbed in the supply chain.  It's difficult to say whether it's IMCs, I can just tell you from our price perspective we're looking good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then your service from let's say LA to Chicago, which I guess is the biggest intermodal market out there, looks like that's improved pretty dramatically over the last few years and maybe even in the last six months.  How does that stack up on a reliability and perhaps a transit time basis relative to brand X?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I mean when you stratify it from a premium service down to the more general domestic products in the double stack. It would be very, very competitive on all fronts now, John, when you look at transit times with very little variability associated with each one of the services.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now have you maxed out on the service improvements there or as you continue to I guess perhaps more slowly build out the Sunset Corridor project, is there still more upside to the service?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.  We expect continuous improvements in every one of those lanes and we have defined initiatives to make sure that happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's extremely interesting, thank you.  One last question, with fuel having dropped so dramatically and stabilized, is this a good time to consider maybe late laying in some hedges at this point, if you believe that the economy is going recover and perhaps fuel prices recover along with the economic recovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, we're looking at it, but we are not going to pull the trigger.  I mean right now if you look at it we have the natural hedge with the fuel surcharge and quite honestly I think you just rolling the dice.  But we're taking a look at it.  It is attractive right now, but I'm not ready to pull the trigger yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If the economy started to improve and credit conditions improved would you be more inclined to perhaps to take a risk there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Jason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Quick question, you were talking about the stimulus at least showing up in Texas and some of the projects, is that the only state that you're seeing action in and could you give us a little bit more color about when that might be flowing through the system?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jason, it's not the only one. It is one of the larger ones right now because of their extensive highway programs.  So there has actually been some real benefit there, but actually we, we actually have a team of people that are going through the stimulus bill with a fine-toothed comb, carving out what we think are opportunities for our customers and then we're sitting down with our customers to make sure they're aware of them.</p>
          <p>We've actually started in some of the construction projects, stone, sand, gravel, some of those, actually seeing some dollars flow our way because of that effort.  But again, one of the biggest markets is Texas and that's one of our biggest opportunities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although, Jason, there's lot of money flowing to California also on the stimulus plan and I think there are obviously going to be opportunities for us there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  That's very helpful.  We've see a lot obviously in the press regarding the problems Mexico has been having.  We've seen some terrorists levied by the Mexican government to the U.S., but it appears to be me more truck-like traffic.  How is that impacting your business to and from Mexico or can you even parcel all that out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, at the end of day in terms of our service metrics, it's having no impact.  There are issues at the border that have been well publicized that we're working cooperatively with the U.S. government on.  But in terms of our service it's the economy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fair enough.  And, Rob, not to beat a dead horse on the lag benefit, now the number you quoted was $0.20 compared to the prior year.  In the quarter itself what was fuel lag for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jason, the year-over-year all-in benefit to us with all the moving parts year-over-year was about $0.20.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the lag was a &#x2013; I don't split it out exactly as you're asking it, but lag was a piece of that.  And looking forward, as I said, it would have stabilized, assuming stabilized fuel prices, that lag would be the component that we would not anticipate as great in the second quarter.  There will be year-over-year price differences obviously because last year was a peak price point in the second quarter on the cost of fuel itself, but the lag benefit should dissipate.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  I guess most of my questions are answered, so let me drill a little bit deeper on coal.  Over the last four weeks we have seen what looked like very weak coal volumes and there's always been sort of an explanation in terms of blizzards at the PRB or holy week or this or that.  But it seems to be across the nation and it seems to be just unusually low.  And I just wanted to press a point and see whether you see anything unusual out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Arturo, it's demand.  There are &#x2013; you're always going to have the issues whether you're, we're in the spring season here, but just fundamental demand is weak.  We have a little bit of some issue with Colorado/Utah production.  We did, I'll remind, you we did lose some business on a legacy deal.  But the real issue right now is just overall industrial demand.  I think if I recall the numbers, I think electricity demand was down in first quarter by about one, 2%.  I just don't see, I think it's going to be soft all year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.  We're seeing electricity demand, it was down 7% for February, coal fire demand was about 14% in a flash and March demand was also down.  And these numbers just seem very, very low and not at all consistent with what we might hope is an economy that is doing better.  But they just seem so darn low for something so steady as power demands that I was just wondering whether there is something else going on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you've got it right.  I mean your question, the issue you have right now is thinking long term.  And when the economy turns you're going to see electricity demand turn with it.</p>

      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Actually I'm on the sell side, just to be clear.  I know you guys are not looking or calling for the bottom in the second half of the year.  But I just wanted to hear your thoughts in terms of your conversations with customers in terms of which lines of your business you might expect to lead us out of the current recession?  Do you think it would be consumer led, you think it would be industrial?  And along those same lines there's been a lot of conversation about inventory de-stocking and then the potential re-stocking, if you're having any of those conversations with customers, hearing about anyone getting to low levels of inventory, clearly not on the coal side, but perhaps some of the other products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you have to ask the question what impact will the stimulus spend have and to me that says something about industrial demand.  You look at, Jack, I think we were &#x2013; our lumber loadings right now are down I think almost 70% to the peak about three years ago.  If there's any pick up towards the end, other than some seasonal like ag, you think about some of those products, I think it's going to be come on the industrial side.  I don't see consumer spending picking up until you see some pick up on the industrial side because that's obviously jobs and some confidence there.  So I think in a very simple sense that's about as good an outlook as we could see for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then one specific question on Intermodal, I missed part of the call, so I apologize if you addressed this.  You talked about domestic growing faster than international.  When we look at your actual overall carloads for the Intermodal carloading for the quarter, you grew at a slower rate than your closest competitor in the region.  I'm trying to get a sense if that was driven by mix or if there was an in fact also share loss that might have been occurring particularly on the international side and what might have been driving that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We tend to be weighted a little heaver on the international side and so that's an issue right from the get go.  So the bigger &#x2013; if you look at our product itself and our total mix of business, international was down 30%, domestic down nine, so we're 60% international.  So it hits us a little harder.</p>
          <p>We're still in the process of wrapping contract, a domestic contract that we lost last year and that won't actually work its way completely through the system until probably June of this year.  It's tailoring down here in the second quarter, but that is something that will lap here in the second quarter.  So that will change the number somewhat.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But just to be clear, no contract issues on the international side?</p>
