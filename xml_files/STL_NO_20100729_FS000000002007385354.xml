          <p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to Statoil's webcast and telephone conference on our Second Quarter 2010 Earnings.  I'm Lars S&#xF8;rensen and I am the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>This presentation is a webcast presentation and is broadcasted live from our offices in Oslo to be followed on the web from statoil.com or by calling into the conference by phone.  You'll find dial-in numbers on our website.  This morning at 7.30 AM Central European Time we announced our results for the second quarter 2010.  A press release on the results was sent through wires and to the Oslo Stock Exchange.  The quarterly report and today's presentation can, as usual, be downloaded from our website &#x2013; statoil.com.  On the front page of statoil.com, there is a link directly to the presentation pack.</p>
          <p>Can I ask you please to take special note of our use of forward-looking statements, which are described on the last page of the presentation set.  After the presentation we will open for questions.  Please observe that you'll have to use a phone line to ask questions; questions cannot be asked directly from the web.  The dial-in number is on the website.  The operator of this conference call will revert to a procedure for asking questions over the phone immediately before the Q&amp;A session starts after the presentation.  It's then my privilege to welcome Statoil's Chief Financial Officer, Eldar S&#xE6;tre, who'll now take us through the second earnings presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Lars.  Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this second quarter earnings presentation for Statoil.  After a promising start of 2010, we have now seen yet another challenging quarter regarding both the global economy and financial markets.  And we have been reminded that great uncertainties still remain when it comes to the pace of the world economic recovery.  However, Statoil has delivered another set of good results this quarter.  Operationally, we have had a strong quarter with high production despite the shutdown of the production on the Gullfaks C platform, which by the way came back on stream on July 14.  We are also getting closer to production start on a number of new fields, amongst them is the Gj&#xF8;a field, which you can see, being towed out to the field on the front page of this presentation.</p>
          <p>We continued our exploration efforts and have made several new discoveries also in this quarter.  Our flexible gas strategy has created significant values by moving volumes from last summer and mainly placing them on the forward curve at considerably higher prices.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have had higher than usual impact from non-cash provisions this quarter, which is seen as infrequent and outside of our underlying operations.  We have made a cost provision in connection with an onerous contract related to the Cove Point LNG regasification terminal in the U.S. of NOK 3.8 billion this quarter.  In addition, the market outlooks for our Mongstad refinery have worsened and we have decided to take an impairment of NOK 2.9 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And now some words about our second quarter earnings.  Here you see an overview of our key earnings figures compared with the same quarter last year, which is illustrated at the bottom here.  Our reported net income amounted to NOK 3.1 billion compared to zero in the second quarter of last year.  And I should then remind you that the reported second quarter results last year was quite exceptional due to a 99% tax rate deriving from the change that we made to use dollar as functional currency while the tax basis is still being calculated in Norwegian kroner.</p>
          <p>The reported net operating income is NOK 26.6 billion against 24.3 billion last year, which is a 10% increase year-on-year.  When focusing on the underlying business performance, we derived at the net adjusted result of 36.4 billion in the quarter and this is a 25% increase over last year's NOK 29.2 billion.  The main contributors were the 32% higher liquids price in Norwegian kroner combined with a 2% increase in entitlement production and this was partly offset by a 12% decrease in average natural gas prices.  The adjustments of NOK 9.8 billion were mainly caused by natural gas derivative losses, by the provision related to the Cove Point, and both of these were in natural gas, and the impairment of the Mongstad refinery which I mentioned within manufacturing and marketing.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate this quarter was 88%.  After adjustments for the effects of tax on infrequent items and net financial items, our effective tax rate on adjusted earnings amounts to 71% which is in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the production numbers for the quarter.  Total equity production was 1,957,000 barrels per day this quarter.  This implies 6% growth over last year.  The growth primarily came from increasing gas production, which was up 14%, while the overall liquids production was up 1%.  Volumes from Norwegian Continental Shelf increased by 6%, while equity volumes from outside of Norway grew by 5% this quarter.</p>
          <p>Entitlement volumes increased by 2% to 1,765,000 barrels per day.  And this means that PSA effects &#x2013; so-called PSA effects were 192,000 barrels per day in the second quarter and this is compared to 116,000 barrels per day the year before.  And the increases were mainly due to changes in profit tranches for some Angolan fields and also some one-off positive PSA adjustments that we made in the second quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Gas equity volumes increased by 14%.  On the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the 15% increase was related mainly to higher gas off-take on our long-term contracts, but also higher spot volumes due to higher NBP prices this summer.  Outside Norway, the 10% increase in gas production mainly came from higher volumes from In Salah in Algeria and the ramp-up of production in the Marcellus area in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are now well into the final quarter of the European gas year.  Traditionally, the third quarter is a relatively weak quarter in terms of off-take, and we have no indications that this quarter will differ from this typical seasonal pattern we have seen previously.  And neither should you forget that our gas production is &#x2013; remains value-driven, so we will continue to use the flexibility in our gas fields, which is mainly Troll and Oseberg, where this creates value.</p>
          <p>So, let me then move the results per each of our business areas.</p>
          <p>High activity, strong operations, and higher oil prices have been the main characteristics of this quarter.  This has been translated into adjusted earnings, as mentioned, that are 25% higher than last year.  E&amp;P Norway had adjusted earnings of 29.1 billion in the quarter, which is 40% up year-on-year.  The main reasons were higher liquids prices, up 32% measured in Norwegian kroner as well as a 6% higher production volume.  And this increase was partly off-set by a lower gas transfer price.</p>
          <p>Depreciations increased by 9% in E&amp;P Norway due to increased production and also higher depreciations from the new fields.  Both operating expenses, SG&amp;A expenses, and exploration expenses were lower than last year in this business segment.</p>
          <p>International E&amp;Ps adjusted earnings grew by 3.5% to NOK 2.9 billion in this quarter.  Higher liquids prices contributed positively to the result.  This was partly off-set by lower entitlement volumes due to the relatively large variations that we saw in PSA effects.  Adjusted exploration expenses outside NCS were NOK 2.4 billion compared to 1 billion last year.  The increase was to some extent explained by more costly and higher ownership shares in general, but by far the main cause is related to the expensing of one individual well-deemed to be non-commercial in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Natural gas adjusted results were NOK 3.3 billion, which is down 21% from last year.  The subsegment processing and transport's adjusted earnings were flat year-on-year at 1.8 billion.  Adjusted earnings in the marketing and trading subsegment were at NOK 1.5 billion, which is down 38% compared to last year.  This is mainly driven by normal variations in our gas trading business.  I will shortly come back to a further discussion of the natural gas business.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing and marketing &#x2013; their adjusted earnings were at 0.7 billion, which is down 47% compared to the second quarter last year.  The trading results were significantly lower this quarter as the forwards curves flattened out and also from some loses related to the price drops &#x2013; the price drop that we saw during May.  Within manufacturing, an increase in both refining margins and methanol prices contributed to the earnings of NOK 0.1 billion compared to last year's loss of NOK 0.5 billion.  Within energy and retail, mainly higher fuel margins caused the 50% increase in adjusted earnings NOK 2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Despite the improving refinery margins that we saw in the second quarter, the outlook for our Mongstad refinery has not improved.  This refinery is a net importer of fuel oil, combined with relatively lower share of diesel output compared to standard FCC refinery.  And all of this configuration has been beneficial for the refinery for many years.  We now see a situation where tighter market, and consequently higher price outlook for fuel oil, and consequently lower margins at Mongstad.  And this has let us to take an impairment of the refinery of NOK 2.9 billion this quarter.</p>
          <p>And as promised, I will now address our natural gas business in slightly more detail.  Both short-term and forward European gas prices have increased significantly during this quarter.  Spot prices are also significantly higher than we saw last summer when we decided to move gas volumes beyond 2009.  On the other hand, our long-term oil index gas contracts are showing slightly lower prices this quarter compared to the same quarter last year due to the approximately six months time lag in the pricing formulas.</p>
          <p>So my first point in this context is to remind you that any changes in gas market prices are reflected in the E&amp;P Norway business segment and not in the natural gas business segment, as the mix of all these market prices is the foundation for the transfer price between these two business areas.</p>
          <p>My second point is that our flexible and value driven gas strategy is still highly valid and has created significant value to us.  Last summer, we observed prices of around 0.20 to NOK 0.25 per terms, while the summer of 2010 at that time was priced up to NOK 0.40 per term.  By using the flexibility that I mentioned in the upstream portfolio, we decided not to produce some of this flexibility last year, but instead sell the volumes this summer or in later years and also placing most of these volumes on the much higher forward curve.  Through this strategy we have increased the value significantly from these volumes.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, and as a consequence of using the forward curve, we are also accepting non-cash mark-to-market or derivative effects in our accounts as the forward curve is moving up or down.  In the second quarter, we have had a negative derivative impact of NOK 3.4 billion in the gas business mainly related to this flex strategy, but also to other hedging strategies.  While we in previous quarters, and actually in the four quarters in row now, have had a positive derivative effects from our gas trading business.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have concluded to make a cost provision this quarter in connection with our commitments related to the Cove Point LNG regas terminal of NOK 3.8 billion.  This was a position that we entered into in 2004 when it was anticipated that the U.S. would need to import significant gas volumes in the years to come.  The rapid development of unconventional gas production in the U.S. has reduced the need for import of LNG significantly.  And the consequence is lower expected utilization of regasification capacity at Cove Point.</p>
          <p>So, all-in-all and despite the negative face value of our natural gas business segment this quarter, we're still creating considerable values from our gas trading business with a major part with reflected in the E&amp;P Norway business segment.  And we will maintain our value over volume strategy also going forward.</p>
          <p>And then finally, some words on our guiding.  We maintain our production guidance for 2010 at the range between 1,925,000 to 1,975,000 barrels per day for 2010.  Compared to first-half of this year, we expect equity production to fall due to extensive turn-arounds in the third quarter of around 120,000 barrels per day in quarterly effect.  Start-up of new fields will mainly take place in the fourth quarter, and there are no new start-ups internationally this year.  In addition, uncertainty related to the short-term gas markets still prevails with the third quarter typically as our weakest gas quarter.</p>
          <p>CapEx guidance for 2010 is still at US $13 billion, exploration expenditures are US $2.3 billion, and unit production cost is expected in the range of 35 to 36 and it was at 35.2 over the last 12-months period.</p>
          <p>Regarding 2012, we recently announced the farm-down of 40% in the Peregrino field in Brazil through the partnership with Sinochem.  The direct implication was that we adjusted our 2012 equity production accordingly.</p>
          <p>So, with these words, I am ready to take your questions and I leave the word back to Lars to manage this sequence.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Eldar.  We'll now start the Q&amp;A session.  In addition to Eldar S&#xE6;tre and myself, here in Oslo we are joined in the studio by the Head of Corporate Accounting, Mr. Kaare Thomsen.</p>
          <p>In order to be able to ask questions, you have to dial into the phone conference.  The dial-in numbers are available on our website.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Our first question comes from Jason Kenney from ING.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there and thanks for taking my question.  Where do you see the net debt-to-capital employed figure going through the next two quarters and actually by the year-end?  And secondly, could you give us an indication of the cost of the drilling moratorium in the U.S Gulf of Mexico?  You do note in text form at least in your quarterly release, and I was wondering if Statoil will be looking to recover that cost in time, and if so, who from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On the net debt to capital employed, that was &#x2013; that ratio was at 29% in &#x2013; at the end of the third quarter, and that included also the full payment of the dividend of 19 billion as we are paying dividends only once a year.  So, that is included in the net debt and it has impact on the cash position.  So, just to give you a few comments to this if for instance we had paid dividends twice a year, which is not allowed in Norway, the net debt ratio would have been approximately 29%.  And we have also had a negative effect from U.S. dollar-Norwegian kroner exchange rate during the first-half of the year.  And that has had an impact of approximately 2%.  So we would have been around 24-25% if we had adjusted for these components.</p>
          <p>Now still this is a fact we have seen these changes in the currency exchange rate &#x2013; U.S. dollar and Norwegian kroner &#x2013; and obviously to estimate the impact and how this ratio will develop for the rest of year is quite difficult.  It will depend on these factors.  It will depend on the downstream profit on the gas resource, but obviously also on the oil price.  But given sort of the current environment we expect to see &#x2013; and the current type of exchange rate, we expect to see a ratio quite close to 25%, may be slightly higher than that but not significantly higher than that.  So, 25 plus something &#x2013; in that range &#x2013; that's the best estimate I can give you currently.</p>
          <p>Then to the Gulf of Mexico and the costs related to that &#x2013; obviously there is a lot of discussion we can come back to on the more long-term implications, but short-term this is really about managing the rig portfolio.  And we have a &#x2013; we run a process of drilling five wells.  Two of them were started and operated and we participated in three other wells.  So, and these were exploration wells.  So, the activities on these drill &#x2013; these drilling activities have been closed on.  So, in our case, we have declared force majeure on all these &#x2013; on these contracts and are paying lower rates, but there are still costs associated with this and there is no drilling being made.</p>
          <p>Obviously what we are doing is to look probably into other ways of employing our rigs.  But so far, these rigs are still in the Gulf of Mexico area.  So, the cost to us; first of all, we have made no provisions in the accounts.  There is no on-risk contracts that should be provided for.  So, we will take any costs that is coming as it turns out.  The estimate we have given is around US $100 million assuming that the moratorium will last for six months &#x2013; 100 million, maybe slightly higher, but not significantly higher.  So, that's the best estimate we have given.  As I said, we are working together with our contractors to deal with this issue and also together with our contractors see how these rigs can be employed in other parts of the world to the extent that can be done to mitigate the situation to the benefit both for Statoil and our contractors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you look to recover that cost in time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have declared force majeure and that is regulated.  The force majeure rate is regulated in the contract.  So, as long we are paying force majeure rate, that's the rate that we are obliged to pay according to the contract.  So, the way to mitigate that is basically to make sure that these rigs eventually can get back into business either in Gulf of Mexico or other parts of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Jack Moore from Harpsfell Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  I was wondering if you could talk a bit about just tax rate going forward and what you anticipate for taxes and, I guess, production sharing as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay when it comes to taxes there is no &#x2013; I mean we'll always see variations in the tax rate in the segment tax rate from quarter-to-quarter.  But when we get to the bottom-up &#x2013; and also adjust the variation because of the fact that we have U.S. dollar as functional currency and we still have this issue that we're paying taxes and calculating taxes in Norwegian kroner, which is also included in the tax cost in the accounts.  But the account is not reflecting the Norwegian kroner pre-tax basis.  So, we will have variations due to that.  But if you sort of take away that impact and get down to the underlying operations, the normal operations, we are still &#x2013; there is no change to our guidance of around 70, 70-71% tax rate going forward.</p>
          <p>In the previous quarter that was at, I think, 69; now it was at 71.  So, we are sort of in that range and there are no reasons for us to change the guidance on tax based on what we have seen in this quarter.  When it comes to PSA effects, we have a PSA effect of 190,000 barrels per day in this quarter and we saw a very low one in the same quarter last year.  So, there will be variances on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  There will be adjustments, but overall we maintain our guiding.  So, for the full-year, at around US $75 per barrel for the full-year we still indicate around 180-185,000 barrels per day in PSA effects.  And so, no change to that, but what we have seen is that there are variations in this number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  And then just one follow-up question, I was wondering if you could discuss any potential kind of tactical changes you might make in you CapEx in the medium to near-term to perhaps reallocate resources either away from the Gulf, or oil versus gas, or any other strategic moves that you might make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think for the first where there is an operational or tactical change, I don't know, but as I mentioned we will have to make sure that we employ our rig fleet in the most efficient way.  So, that could lead sort of to higher sort of exploration activities outside of the U.S. and lower exploration activities inside the U.S.  But that will not impact sort of the short-term CapEx program or production profiles as such.  And beyond that, I'm not prepared to sort of &#x2013; we have taken no conclusions and we have had no reasons to make any adjustments or take any conclusions in relation to changing our strategy.  I think what we will have to do is to simply wait what will be the consequences in terms of regulations both in the U.S. and potentially also in other parts of the world coming from the incident, and then we just have to be patient and wait for that and the results and what really caused this incident.</p>
          <p>So far we have found no reason to make any changes in our strategy to deepwater activities either in Norway, or in Gulf of Mexico, and other parts of the world or make any reallocations of our investments.  So, we'll just have to wait to see to the extent there are common sort of things out of this which might cause that kind of changes.  But at this stage I have no reason to expect that this is still sort of the core of our competence.  This is where we're coming from offshore operations and deepwater operation.  So, I think we still &#x2013; should still be considered to be good and prudent operator in this type of environment.  And I think it will still be allowed to operate within this type of environment and our relative competitive position possession should still be very good in this context.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree.  And thanks for taking my questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Oswald Clint from Sanford Bernstein.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Hi, thank you.  First question, I guess, may be linked to that last one about capital allocation.  Just back in the Marcellus, is there anything differently going on at the moment in terms of your drilling pattern there, or are you still expecting to increase rigs and wells per quarter going forward or any slowdown in activity and still economically viable at the gas price you're receiving in that particular area.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I'm just curious on the Shah Deniz renegotiations on that contract, what the new gas price is that you're receiving for that gas and is that the same formula or gas price available for the second phase of Shah Deniz?  And if you could you talked about the transit through Turkey &#x2013; what type of the tariff the Turkish were looking for for transit across Turkey?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  When it comes to Marcellus we are planning or just to speak is planning to increase the number of rigs.  We &#x2013; at the start of this year, we had 19 rigs in operations.  Currently we have 26 rigs, 25-26 rigs in operation, and the plan is to increase this number towards the end of the year and continue to increase it to around 40 rigs by 2012.  So, there is no change to the way we look at it with still sort of for us &#x2013; a small part of the portfolio is rather small volume we're talking about 10,000 plus barrels per day in gas production from Marcellus.  And we think its still is profitable business even in today's environment.  And we think it's giving this more scalability, it's right thing to do to build the capacity to be prepared as we expect sort of gas prices to improve going forward.</p>
          <p>When it comes to Shah Deniz &#x2013; first of all, I'll say we are very pleased that the Turkish and the Azerbaijan government has come to an agreement, both on the existing contract and on the arrangements for the next phase of Shah Deniz &#x2013; both the transit arrangements and the sales arrangements both to Turkey and, as I said, the transit arrangements through Turkey into Europe.  So, for me to go into details as to the pricing formulas I'm not prepared to do that, but what I can say is that we're pleased with both the transit arrangement and with the sales arrangement that we're seeing both in relation to the current agreement and with the next phase of Shah Deniz and we feel now that is quite realistic to have the next phase, Phase II in operations let's say by the end of 2016.  And we are very optimistic about that.</p>

          <p>Next question from Jon Rigby from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yes, hi.  Two questions &#x2013; both gas-related.  The first is you mentioned about taking some unrealized losses on derivative contracts in the second quarter.  Can you give us a bit more visibility on what that might be sort of what's moving was created that and may be some kind of indication of the kind of gains you've been booking in the last few quarters, so we get some idea of what underlying performance has been.  And the second is just in terms of the transfer price being achieved by the NCS at the moment.  Are you able to just give us a bit of insight into the degree to which this low transfer price is a result of the changed mix &#x2013; pricing mix of your long-term contracts, i.e. the increased proportion that's related to spot or the degree to which you &#x2013; that Dubai is not lifting your gas contracts and you are selling directly onto the spot market?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  When it comes to the derivatives, these &#x2013; we have, as I mentioned, we have we locked in main part of the volumes that we deferred from last year on the forward curve.  Some of this has been realized during the second quarter at the profit compared to the price that we locked it into.  So, we have realized that even higher prices than we actually locked it into in the second quarter.  But, the main part of this is still on the forward curve partly for this summer, this winter, next summer.  And what has happened during the second quarter was that gas prices &#x2013; we locked this in last year.  And during the second quarter, gas prices, spot prices, and the forward curve in parallel has moved very much in the same way as the spot prices during the second quarter.  So, we saw a steep increase in both the spot prices and the forward curve.</p>
          <p>So, what happened with the forward curve was that all the volumes that we have locked in beyond the second quarter had to be valued at the new forward curve at the end of the quarter.  So, basically as the forward curve has moved we have taken sort of an unrealized loss.  Now, as we indicated, this has to be seen in relation also to gains that we have seen since we actually took those positions.  And I mentioned four consecutive quarters where we have seen gains.  I think it's fair to say that these gains are not &#x2013; doesn't add up to 3.4 billion as such, but they are getting quite close.</p>
          <p>So, this is a theoretical.  If we have sort of left possessions and went into the possessions at the perfectly right time, we could theoretically have made those kind of benefits, but we have made significant value from moving it and we have chosen to secure that, and theoretically we could have made even more value if we had hit the move in and out of the forward curve at the exact right time.  So, that's more sort of a loss of opportunities, but it's significant values and I think also the hedging strategies looks much better than the 3.4 million that you see in this quarter when you combine it with the previous quarters.</p>

          <p>And the mix effects in terms of NCS production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  Well, the transfer price is reflecting the actual mix over volumes at any point between the &#x2013; what is long-term contracts, what is the spot portion of long-term contracts, and what is the straight-forward spot market volumes.  So, what has happened in this quarter is that, you're right; we still have approximately 70%.  I haven't got the exact number, but approximately 70% of this is still oil-indexed volumes in the formula.  And then the rest is related to an increase in the sort of spot portion of the long-term contracts and also higher spot volumes in general compared to what we sold last summer when the prices were very low.  So, we have sold highest spot volumes, you have a higher portion of spot priced component of the long-term contracts.  But we still have approximately 70% oil index in the pricing formula.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just said it's a bit of a double whammy this quarter.  So you're taking it to components of spot-related pricing in the long-term contracts plus a higher proportion of actual spot sales of this quarter as well?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please.  First, the Mongstad refinery, you've taken, I believe, several impairments on that and are you prepared to disclose where the current net book value of that asset is?  Secondly, if you could update us on international exploration in light of the U.S. moratorium in the second half of this year, what high impact wells should we be watching out for?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  First of all, on the Mongstad refinery, I think we simply have made it as a good practice not to disclose specific accounting and balance sheet numbers on individual asset.  But, what I can say is that we are far above zero; there is still a significant book value left on the refinery, which is justified by the value that we see in this.  But, it is 2.9 billion is definitely a big bite into the book value.  But there is a significant portion left there.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the international exploration, it's &#x2013; obviously, we don't expect to see any major high impact wells in the Gulf of Mexico if it's in moratorium.  So, we are moving outside of Gulf of Mexico &#x2013; maybe I should comment on 2010 and 2011 in combination.  So, based and just directly those areas and I think the main areas for us in exploration when it comes to impact stuff &#x2013; I mean we will be drilling a lot in Angola and so on.  But when it comes to impact stuff I think the most important ones are in Faroes, in Egypt, where we're getting closer to actually drilling, in Indonesia, Brazil.  And in Brazil that also includes additional drilling in the Peregrino area, as such.  So, I think these are the most interesting.  We're also preparing drilling in Tanzania, for instance as all, but I haven't got the exact schedule for that whether that there would be any drilling &#x2013; not this year, but maybe next year, but I'm not confident about that.  So, I think that's the main comments I can give you on the more impact stuff when it comes to exploration outside of Norway.  And hopefully we will get back to the high impact stuff that we have lot of in Gulf of Mexico as soon as we can.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, two questions please.  First is, could give us an update on progress in Iraq with West Qurna &#x2013; what stage you are &#x2013; where you hope to be by year-end?  And secondly, about the Mongstad, you obviously spinning of the retail side of the business &#x2013; given your gloomy outlook for Mongstad, would you consider something more some strategic restructuring there, potentially selling your stake or even converting the assets to some alternative use or is it just something you're just going to live with because it's tightly integrated to your oil production?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay I think you started answering the last question yourself.  It is a fact that most of this is definitely &#x2013; I mean the value creation that we see from Mongstad goes actually beyond more the refinery as such in isolation.  It is highly integrated into the West process facility.  It's highly integrated into the oil production on the Norwegian Continental Shelf through pipeline which gets a very efficient structure from the Troll field and so on.  So, it is highly integrated and there are values from this refinery outside of the refinery book value as such in itself.</p>
          <p>So, basically the configuration that we see is that it takes <mark type="inaudible" /> refinery takes no fuel and this refinery has capacity to crack these type of heavy components.  And it also produces more gasoline versus diesel.  And I think that's really more or less addressing the issues that we might be looking at going forward.  Not hopefully, not closing the refinery or doing anything else but simply looking at how, first of all, we can continue to reduce cost in the refinery, improve the energy efficiency where we are doing a lot in terms of the CFP development.</p>
          <p>In terms of looking at sort of the fleet mix that is going into it, is there anything we can do about that, and looking at the yield that comes out of it in terms of how the markets are looking for gasoline and diesel and so on and the various products. So, we are definitely looking at a lot of metrics &#x2013; how to possibly reconfigure the refinery.  Obviously any costs associated would add would have to be robust and associated with robust adjustments, but obviously we have to look at it and pursue cost reductions &#x2013; quite ambitious plans on cost reductions on the Mongstad refinery as such.  And also look at integration possibilities with our, for instance, our Kalundborg refinery, which is actually producing fuel oil.  And we will look at sort of how we can benefit from tying these two the output from them Kalundborg refinery into the Mongstad refinery and benefit &#x2013; sort of tailor-made that fee as well.  So, we have a lot of plans to improve the profitability for Mongstad going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yes.  Well, first of all, we have established the consortium in the contractor group.  We are currently looking at towards the preliminary development plan with a deadline in August, which is actually the first deliverable under the service contract.  The first time this has been set to the market and responses are expected soon.  And the projects will start production and achieve first commercial production, we think, now ahead of the deadline and we're getting into the autumn of 2013.  What I can say in general is that this project is actually looking better and now having worked on it then it looked at the time of the award.  It's satisfied our internal requirements for profitability definitely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Eldar.  Can I ask few questions please?  Firstly, just a follow on Iraq.  How you're planning to book the resources there?  And the second question was actually on the gas sales during the course of 2Q.  I mean you signaled that 3Q is normally seasonally low point.  Would you suggest that the high off take you saw in Q2 must suggest you get an even bigger sort of swing around 3Q &#x2013; that the customers have sort of mopped up their sort of appetite at far as your volumes are concerned for this gas year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first on the gas question.  It's very hard and I would be very reluctant to sort of try to guide on specific gas volumes for the third quarter.  As you know, there is a lot of flexibility in the contracts on an annual basis.  So they could get up to more than to ACQ 110% and they could get below 90% ACQ.  So, there is a lot of annual flexibility.  So, there is lot of outcomes for the third quarter as well.  So what I can do is to point at sort of the typical pattern that we have seen.  And we're seeing no reasons to sort of expect that this quarter will look differently.  But, there is still two months left of the quarter, so we'll just have...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you.  I have a question in relation to Cove Point since you've made the write down there.  Is it possible to say how much this is related to the total and culd you also comment on the remaining contract length?  And I have another question when it comes to new sanctioning of fields, what's coming up next now?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, when it comes to the Cove Point, what I can say is this is adjustment on the value of the contract.  And I am not prepared to say what's the full value of the contract, but what I can say is that we have taken down quite significantly the utilization factor this quarter from where we have been.  So, we think now we have utilization factor, which is the basis &#x2013; the main sort of component of defining the cost provision here to much lower level, which we believe now is reflecting in a relevant way the nature of the U.S. gas market which, we think, will separate from the European gas markets and the balance that we expect to see in the U.S. gas market.  And the need for import, we still think there would be a need for import of LNG, but not sort of on a permanent basis.  It will be more sort of a cyclical basis and a seasonal basis.  So, I think that's how far I can &#x2013; as far as I can get when it comes to add comments on the Cove Point.</p>
          <p>When it comes to new sanctions, there's actually a lot of fields that we are working on in terms of new sanctions.  So, we are talking about between &#x2013; around 20 new PDOs being worked on that could be sanctioned this year.  And when it comes to Norwegian Continental Shelf, for instance, we are working on the so-called fast track projects.  And I think the Pan Pandora is the first one to be sanctioned and that means that we actually down to two-year development time from discovery to production on the Pan Pandora.  So, it means that we have really &#x2013; it seems that we are successful on the fast track developments on the Norwegian Continental Shelf.  But in terms of specific fields and so on, I haven't got a list for you today, but it's a quite big number, both in the Norwegian Continental Shelf and internationally.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  Could you clarify please the hedging effects, the non-cash effects to the extent that hedges made last year in the spot gas market matured in the second quarter. Won't those be reflected in the realized price on the gas sales?  And is this going to be an ongoing activity where you will be selling forward, for example, into 2011, or was that a particular action you took in the weak market in 2009?  And I have a separate follow-up question.  You are a partner with BP and have been for a considerable time and a lot of international assets &#x2013; some of these may come up for sale.  Would you be interested in acquiring some of those assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, hedge accounting is quite complicated.  What we &#x2013; as I said, this is to a large extent related to the flexible trading strategies that we introduced last year where we started to move.  It was a very weak market, and we moved quite significant volumes forward and we selected to put these on the forward curve.  What we have actually delivered in the second quarter, that has been realized, that's not part of the hedge, of the derivative accounting.  So, that's in the adjusted numbers for the natural gas segment.  That means what is in the adjusted number is actually what these hedges gave us above the market price.  So, the main part of this is actually reflected in the E&amp;P Norway business segment on the part which is realized.  The major part of this has still not been realized by the second quarter.  So, it's still on the forward curve.  It still commitments to physical delivers at certain point in time going forward.  So, it still has to be valued according to the forward curve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the hedge &#x2013; yeah so that's what explaining the derivative variations that we see.  I don't know if I had answered your question but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It does partly, but are you going to continue to do this, will you continue to sell forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, let's say we have in terms of derivative effects, there are various &#x2013; it's not only the flexible strategies that's related to moving gas forward in time.  So, that's one strategy.  We also have other strategies.  We could hedge.  We could lock in volumes outside of sort of the physical flex strategy.  So, we have mandates in place to do that as well.  So, that could be part of the strategy.  If you took a market view &#x2013; to get back on the market because of our sort of insight into the market and took the position independently of the flexible volume strategies that I talked about.  So, that's something we are doing, not massively, but we are doing it to some extent and have done it for many years.  So, that will cause this kind of derivative positions and we also have storage positions or so and that goes into this.  And we also have long-term contracts, for instance in the U.S., which is tied to oil which is oil-indexed and which is also measured as derivative.</p>
          <p>So, there is sort of a mix of things which goes into this overall derivative effect.  But the main part is coming from what we did last year and moved into this year and through forward curve.  So, some of this has been delivered now.  But we are also taking new positions.  But what I could say is that I don't think we would have to see a very special market situation to revert to the kind of significance that we saw in terms of volumes from last year.  So, I don't think this year, this summer, that we will see the same magnitude that we saw last summer because then we saw a very big spread between the spot price and the forward curve.  And we are not looking at the same contango situation this time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Yes I'd try to avoid that one.  What I can say, we would never &#x2013; that's a consistent strategy &#x2013; we never comment on &#x2013; if I were to; if I were not to, to work on specific opportunities I would never mention that.  So, what I'll say or repeat and what we've said previously is that it's an obligation we have towards our shareholders to look at also these kinds of opportunities.  We see actually a more comprehensive set of opportunities also beyond BP in this environment than we have seen for some time.  And so we are obviously looking at this kind of opportunities and considering what is it and does it fit into our portfolio, is there ways of creating values for us, and so something that we are considering.  But if we made a move, it would definitely be value-creating and it would also fit nicely into our strategies.  So, this is something we can do all the time and we're definitely also doing in this environment.  But beyond that I couldn't give any further or more specific comments.</p>

So, they look &#x2013; they should look on the preparing themselves for specific drilling activities.  The FPSO is scheduled to arrive in Brazil towards the end in the fourth quarter of 2010.  So, in terms of startup, it will take sometime to sort of build &#x2013; this is heavy oil, so it will take some time to get into regular operations and build the capacity and stable production.  But we are still talking about early 2011, so that is not January, not February, but then we might start talking.  So, that's the kind of time schedule that we are talking about.</p>

          <p>Great and so may be a quick follow-up on your point in the ramp up.  Could you may be give a bit more color as to how long you expect the ramp up to take as they get to plateau, which I think I believe was about 80,000 barrels per day, was that right?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The plateau is 100,000 barrels, 100,000 is the plateau.  So, I think basically we expect to be more or less plateau towards the end of 2011, in that range.  But the exact &#x2013; there are uncertainties on this but it's in as I recall in that range.  So, it should be at &#x2013; it should be more or less at plateau by 2012.</p>

          <p>Hi there gentlemen.  Just a couple of questions, first of all, it's been a while since you've talked about cost cutting and the progression of your unit costs within the business.  Does that signal an end to any hopes of getting your costs lower?  Are you beginning to see cost pressures reentering into the industry, or is there more to come, as well as if you could make some comments on any potential merger synergies there?  And the second question I had was largely around M&amp;A.  How you are thinking about M&amp;A, are you looking more on the exploration side, or are you looking to recycle the proceeds, for example from Peregrino into assets on the K&#xE5;rst&#xF8; production?  I just wanted to get how you're thinking about M&amp;A at the moment?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have certainly not forgot cost cutting, and I think you will see it in the numbers this quarter as well.  I mentioned it in relation to the E&amp;P business segment.  Our operating expenses is also lower than you saw in the same quarter last year quite significantly so.  SG&amp;A cost is down and then we exclude inflation by 11%.  So, we are definitely working on the cost cutting program and basically we are on track with the cost cutting program that we have presented to you earlier.  And you see that &#x2013; I think you have seen their reduction in our cost base quite consistent in some quarters compared to what we have seen earlier.</p>
          <p>So, but in terms of the merger I think when it comes to the merger synergies, that's something we have now.  I think we are moving into measures now which of course beyond the merger when it comes to cost reductions.  We are more or less settled now &#x2013; the new organization and new operating structure offshore which was the last measure I would say which comes out of the merger.  So, that process took approximately one year, so we now have one integrated offshore organization, and by July this summer that process has been finalized, and we have restructured and taken out the people that should be taken out of the organization and reshuffled the organization and unitized the working procedures of offshore.  So, we are not talking about cost reductions that goes beyond that and we are on track with all of these measure.</p>
          <p>When it comes to unit cost &#x2013; unit cost per barrel is down.  When we adjust for merger restructuring cost is down from 35.6 to NOK 35.2 per barrel on a quarter-to-quarter basis.  So, again we see impact on the unit cost and our guidance of 35 to NOK 36 per barrel for this quarter, that's done.  So, simply we have to pick issues to talk about, but it's a good question.  Thank you.  And we are on track with the cost reduction program that we are talking about earlier.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I tend to forget these second questions.  M&amp;A, well, I think it's &#x2013; first of all, what you're looking at is it's a good strategic fit, it's value creation in the deal, then preferably it's growth going forward.  So, it's something where we can impact either some operator or where we can add values to it, not only sort of pickup something which is just exchanging money to put it that way.  We want something where we can influence it.  We are a big operator, have a high technological base, high skill set, and we want to use that in our acquisitions to demonstrate value creation in whatever kind of acquisitions we do.  So, that's basis of what we have done in Gulf of Mexico, that's also the basis for what we did in the Peregrino case for instance.  And I think we have demonstrated that through the divestment that we did on Peregrino that we have actually created values in &#x2013; through that strategy and that's also the way we would think forward.  So, it's basically growth, it's value, and it's strategic fit.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi.  Sorry.  Just two questions if I could please.  Firstly, if you had any comments on trends that you seen in European gas demand, that'd be very helpful.  And also, could you tell us whether you're currently renegotiating any gas contracts with your customers?  And secondly, are you just able to talk about what happened at the Gullfaks C platform in May with the well incident?  I believe that was a high-pressure well.  So, just wondering if that was a precaution linked to you in the Macondo, which you would not have taken otherwise?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  I'll try to remember these three questions this time.  First of all, when it comes to the gas demand, what we obviously &#x2013; we have talked about gas prices increasing quite significantly in the second quarter.  So, that comes mainly from &#x2013; now, it's a logic sentence.  It's demand-driven.  It comes from higher demand.  We have seen some stock-building both in the U.S. and but also in the Europe.  We have seen some outages in &#x2013; from other energy sources.  We have seen an increase in gas-fired, power generation and gas demand in relation to power generation.  And we have also seen some positive developments when it comes to industrial demand and mainly this is driven by the power segment.  And on the supply side, basically we think we have seen a situation where there has been, as we understand it, a lot of maintenance activities mainly in Qatar related to the LNG development.  So, this is basically what we think explains the second quarter.</p>
          <p>What about going forward?  Definitely, this is positive signs.  We see a higher demand, that's good.  How much of this is permanent?  That's a big question.  We think that when it comes to power generation that &#x2013; what we have seen now is that gas has replaced coal to some extent; and as gas price is increasing we will get to a point where we might see switching back to coal.  So, we think that might happen on the gas side and hopefully the industrial demand is increasing and hopefully gas customers also will realize that gas is definitely a good feedstock for power generation from many perspectives and we see that emerging.</p>
          <p>When it comes to the supply side, we definitely think there is no &#x2013; there will be no change to sort of the build-up of energy capacity.  So, we think the situation we have seen in second quarter is temporarily that &#x2013; and that we will see a significant increase in LNG capacity with a pyramid starting in, most attractive Asian market, then Europe, and then U.S. at the bottom of this pyramid.  So, we see some positive &#x2013; and actually I also add, obviously we see it growing indigenous gas production in the U.S. which is sort of decoupling the U.S. gas market to a larger extent.</p>
          <p>So, basically it's &#x2013; we expect some volatility short-term on the gas side, as we have seen now.  And we are uncertain as to sort of the short-term outlooks, but we in the sort of medium term we are still slightly bearish despite the positive signs because of the overall balance and the LNG that is coming in and sort of the coal gas we've shown of the gas parts on the power generation side.  So, we still have the same fundamental view that there is an overhang when it comes to gas medium term, but there are some positive signs also that gives hope for optimism.  When it comes to longer term we still have the same fundamental positive view on gas.  So our long-term view is very robust and there is no change to that, but what we have seen this quarter adds optimism slightly to the gas market view going forward.</p>
          <p>On the Gullfaks C, to complete the list of questions, I think you know with &#x2013; first of all this is not a high pressure reservoir at all.  This is &#x2013; this is &#x2013; but it's a very complex reservoir.  And so Gullfaks is one of the most complex reservoirs that you can think of, but not in terms of pressures and tight reservoir, so it's a very conventional in many ways.  So, we have now &#x2013; I mean, this was a situation that we have controlled very well.  We have always had barriers in place, so there was no risk of any blowout or anything like that.  We have controlled this situation all the way.</p>
          <p>And I think to &#x2013; if you are asking for similarities or what's sort of implications in relation to the Macondo and so on, I think there are very few similarities.  But obviously what we will do is to wait and see what comes out of the on the investigations in Gulf of Mexico and to the extent there are similarities we will definitely take care of that in that context, but it's a very different &#x2013; very different context.  This is also a production well, not an exploration well, from a fixed platform with totally different reservoirs.  So, the situation is very different.  We are now investigating what happened on Gullfaks C and obviously will make every lesson that we can learn from that available to us.</p>
