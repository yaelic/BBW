        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. This is Maximilian Sch&#xF6;berl, Director of Corporate Affairs. I would like to welcome you all to the telephone conference of the BMW AG for third quarter and nine month review of our business performance this year.</p>
          <p>With me today are Dr. Norbert Reithofer, the CEO of the BMW Group; and Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, the CFO of the BMW Group. First, Dr. Norbert Reithofer will give you a brief review and update on our Strategy Number ONE efforts and on our overall business performance. Then Friedrich Eichiner will give a brief overview of our financial performance for the third quarter and for the nine months of 2009. Afterwards we will have time for a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Dr. Reithofer, the mic is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the BMW Group is maintaining its strategic growth and we plan to achieve our long-term goals. Today I would like to talk about the three following points: First, this quarter we again achieved a profit; second, we are further implementing our Strategy Number ONE, as well as focusing on profitability targets; third, we are shaping our future in line with our strategic goals.</p>
          <p>To the first point, the BMW Group achieved earnings before taxes of euro 126 million in the third quarter. Net profit was also positive. In the nine month comparison we reported positive earnings before and after taxes.</p>
          <p>In light of this we are able to make the following forecast for 2009: We expect a decrease in sales volume of between 10 and 15% from 2008 level. We are aiming to achieve positive earnings and a positive adjusted free cash flow for the Group.</p>
          <p>Currently the decline in sales continues to slow at group level. Third quarter sales for 2009 are around 7% lower than in the third quarter of 2008. MINI sales are already recovering. You all know that some of our high volume models, like the BMW 5 Series, are nearing the end of their lifecycle.</p>
          <p>Over the next two years we will be renewing a large share of our product portfolio. This will get underway with the launch of several new models over the coming weeks and months. Our customers will be able to choose between different technologies and drive concepts.</p>
          <p>The BMW 5 Series Gran Turismo and the BMW X1 were released last week. The X1 comes with the option of rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The number of orders is much higher than average. In December we will be introducing the BMW X6 with ActiveHybrid technology in the United States. This is BMW's first full hybrid. It will be launched in Europe in mid-April 2010.</p>
          <p>This fall we will launch three new versions of the new BMW 7 Series, the four-wheel drive, the 740 diesel and the 12-cylinder version. From April on, customers in Europe will also be offered the BMW 7 Series as a mild hybrid. It will be available to U.S. customers from May on.</p>
          <p>Rolls-Royce will start delivering the Ghost to customers by the end of the year. That brings me to my second point, we are continuing to implement all measures set down by Strategy Number ONE. We are laying the foundation for profitability in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Our new models and the renewal of our high volume series over the next few years will lead to greater efficiency potential. For instance, through a more modular concept we have found synergies across model series. This should also enhance the value of our cars. The quality of our products remains our top priority.</p>
          <p>We will be able to reduce material costs by 2012 much more than originally planned. The steps already taken have allowed us to secure substantial long-term cost benefits. All of this will help us to meet our profitability targets for 2012.</p>
          <p>The size of our global workforce was further reduced by more than 1,600 over the course of last year. This is the result of natural attrition, partial retirement and voluntary termination agreements. Such actions are done in a BMW style with transparency, fairness and a strong sense of responsibility.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, we are still hiring, especially specialists in research and development. Here in Germany we hired more than 200 new employees during the first nine months of this year.</p>
          <p>We stand by our social responsibilities even in tough economic times. That is part of the identity and culture of the BMW Group. Early this September more than 1,100 apprentices started their training with us. We have also launched a BMW Group graduate program for future executives.</p>
          <p>The first participants will start in April 2010. To face the complex challenges of the future we need executives with outstanding competences and skills who can motivate and inspire their employees and who are prepared to take responsibility and it is essential that they have intercultural understanding.</p>
          <p>And that brings me to my third and final point, we will continue to shape our future. We are now taking strategic steps that will ensure the BMW Group's future. Let me give you three examples.</p>
          <p>Example number one, we are investing further in our production sites, with around $1 billion in the U.S., including 750 million for our Spartanburg plant in 2008 and 2009. We are also investing over euro 1 billion this year and next year in our German plants. This is a clear commitment to Germany as home of premium products and we have set ourselves the goal to operate the most efficient, most effective and highest performing production network in our industry.</p>
          <p>Example number two, we are expanding further our Efficient Dynamics program. Our concept car BMW Vision Efficient Dynamics, which many of you saw at Frankfurt Motor Show, showcases all the possibilities Efficient Dynamics still has to offer. Equipped with a three-cylinder turbo-diesel engine and two innovative electric motors, this concept car has an average fuel consumption of 3.7 liters per 100 kilometer and generates just 99 grams of CO2 or less per kilometer.</p>
          <p>So BMW brand's new CO2 champion, the BMW 320d Efficient Dynamics Edition is almost ready for market launch. From spring 2010 on, customers will enjoy a 163-horsepower engine that uses only 4.1 liters of fuel and produces 109 grams of CO2 per kilometer. We are also expanding our large-scale MINI E field test to include France.</p>
          <p>Example number three, we are developing new mobility concepts, such as the Megacity Vehicle as part of project i. We are cooperating with SB LiMotive to supply us lithium-ion batteries.</p>
          <p>The next step will be a joint venture with SGL Carbon, the world's leading supplier of carbon materials. This will secure us access to competitive future technologies and raw materials. For the very first time our Megacity Vehicle will use large quantities of extremely stable lightweight carbon fiber components and let us not forget that this joint venture will also create new jobs in the BMW Group's two largest markets, the United States and Germany.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, all of these examples demonstrate that we remain a long-term oriented company in the premium segment for individual mobility. Within our Strategy Number ONE we have analyzed future trends in mobility. We know where we want to go. We implemented sustainability in all areas of our company at an early stage.</p>
          <p>Many experts have recognized our efforts. At the beginning of September, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ranked the BMW Group the world's most sustainable car company for the fifth year in a row.</p>
          <p>Later the same month, the BMW Group was included in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index for its exemplary contribution to climate protection. Our achievements in this area have also been recognized by NGOs and political decision makers. This was recently confirmed to me in the conversations I had with many politicians and opinion leaders in the U.S., the U.K. and France.</p>
          <p>Our reputation as a good corporate citizen is increasingly essential to all companies who want to become and remain successful over the long-term. Premium must set an example. It must be both a leader and a driver. In my opinion, we at the BMW Group are meeting this challenge.</p>
          <p>Forecasts predict that the premium segment will recover in 2010 and the overall auto market is expected to stabilize. We have great new products and we expect to gain even more momentum through the renewal of our model range.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer and now Friedrich Eichiner will provide us with an update on the financials of the BMW Group. Mr. Eichiner, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon from my side. I would like to give you an update on our financials, but I will keep it short so that you have enough time to ask questions.</p>
          <p>BMW Group closed the third quarter with a positive performance, despite the difficult conditions. Group net profit was positive for both the third quarter and the first nine months. This is in line with our targets, which were based on a decline in sales of 10 to 15% for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the status of the BMW Group in the third quarter. The global economic downturn had a negative effect on the third quarter. The BMW Group continued to feel strong pressure from the competition. We expect that price discipline will return when the market recovers.</p>
          <p>We improved our cost position even further in the third quarter. Our strict cost management and profitability measures enabled us to make progress and increase efficiency. We reduced our fixed costs substantially. Our measures to lower our variable costs and especially concerning our cost of materials are taking effect.</p>
          <p>A large number of measures are being taken to improve profitability right now and they have already started to provide benefits. Thanks to these measures we are confident that we will emerge from the crisis in the black and with a solid financial basis. This proves that we are tackling our efficiency goals with resolve. This is how we are getting fit for the future.</p>
          <p>As announced in August, we changed our focus in terms of financial management. This was in response to more stable conditions on the capital and sales markets.</p>
          <p>We funded the second tranche of our German pension obligations in the third quarter. This caused our liquidity reserves to drop. As of September 30 our liquidity position totaled euro 9.9 billion. At the end of June it amounted to euro 11.9 billion. We are aiming for about euro 9 billion in liquidity by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Net financial assets in the Automobiles segment were reduced accordingly. As of September 30 they amounted to euro 7.8 billion. This was after more than euro 10 billion in the first half.</p>
          <p>Intra-group receivables decreased in the third quarter. Compared to the second quarter, they dropped by euro 800 million to euro 5.6 billion. The Automobiles segment's receivables from financial services declined by euro 1.2 billion to just under euro 3 billion.</p>
          <p>The capital markets experienced further relief. This is reflected in our lower credit spreads. At 100 basis points they fell to the lowest level since August 2008. Refinancing costs are attractive because interest rates are currently low.</p>
          <p>As planned, we ramped up production again in the third quarter. This was due to production start ups for new models. As a result, net current assets rose marginally. In a nine month perspective we gained euro 1.6 billion from reduction of working capital and changes in other items.</p>
          <p>Net of the funding of about euro 1.9 billion for pension obligations and marketable securities, free cash flow in the Automobiles segment amounted to a positive euro 417 million in the first nine months. Including this adjustment we thus continue to aim for a positive free cash flow for the full year.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to the segment reporting. EBIT generated by the Automobiles segment in the third quarter was slightly negative at minus euro 76 million. For the first nine months it amounted to minus euro 358 million.</p>
          <p>For seasonal reasons, EBIT in the Motorcycles segment amounted to minus euro 3 million in the third quarter. As of September the segment had a positive EBIT of euro 51 million.</p>
          <p>The Motorcycles segment suffered a sales decline of 8.4% compared to the same quarter last year, but the company increased its market share, although the market shrank on the whole. It was reduced by nearly one-third.</p>
          <p>The development of the Financial Services segment should be highlighted. Despite a difficult market, it continued to perform well. In the third quarter it achieved a profit before tax of euro 94 million. As of September, Financial Services had an EBT of euro 247 million.</p>
          <p>The business volume was down by 2.6% to euro 59 billion. The leased products were down more than euro 2 billion from the beginning of the year. In contrast, receivables from sales financing were up about euro 511 million.</p>
          <p>The segment's risk situation was unchanged from the second quarter. The used car market continues to display a consistent development. The U.K. and U.S. used car markets experienced a strong recovery, but the situation on Continental European markets remains tight. This is due to national support measures and the German scrappage program.</p>
          <p>We expect that the used car markets will remain difficult and will continue to display an inconsistent development. As before, the positive and negative effects on the risk provision offset each other. There was no further burdens from unplanned risk provisions.</p>
          <p>The situation in terms of credit risk is similar. The credit loss rate for the first nine months was slightly lower than for the first half. We remain cautious and do not expect this to lead to a short-term improvement.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as Mr. Reithofer announced earlier, we are aiming for a positive group profit for 2009 as a whole. This will be driven by our resolute cost and financial management.</p>
          <p>We benefited from the company's very good financial position in the last few months of the crisis, but we still expect the global economy to remain volatile and difficult. This does not rule out the possibility of individual markets displaying a positive dynamic development, like China, for example.</p>
          <p>Over the short-term, any recovery will probably be marginal. In the fourth quarter we will benefit from the start up of new competitive models, such as the X1 and the 5 Series GT. We will benefit from the revamp of our portfolio, which will be implemented soon.</p>
          <p>This will happen on three levels: Our product portfolio will become younger; this will make it much more attractive; our measures to reduce the cost of materials are having a positive effect on the new models; and third, this will put us in a position to optimize our price and competitive position once again.</p>
          <p>The resulting momentum should lead to an improvement in earnings next year. We will take advantage of the start of the market's recovery to improve our pricing. Next year we will strengthen our profitability by taking numerous measures.</p>
          <p>Economic analysts expect markets to recover over the medium to long term. If this happens, we will benefit thanks to our attractive range of vehicles. Our 2012 targets remain unchanged: Achieve an EBIT margin of eight to 10% in the Automobiles Segment and return on capital employed of more than 26%. We are working hard and optimizing all areas necessary to achieve this goal.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your time.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think we start with the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first question comes from Mr. Ellinghorst of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Swiss. I have two questions, firstly on Financial Services, you've been working on the structure of your Financial Services business for a while, shifting the business under the U.S. and German banking license business. Could you update us where you stand in this move and also how this could affect your future refinancing costs overall for Financial Services?</p>
          <p>And secondly on the U.S. market, I mean we are aware there's a proposal in terms of fuel efficiency for the U.S., BMW it seems has to improve fuel efficiency by some 20% over the next couple of years, so I guess you will roll out Efficient Dynamics to the U.S. Could you give us some color on how much this will cost per unit moving forward, would it be right to assume some round about euro 500 additional cost for the cars you sell in the U.S.?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much and I think we start with Mr. Reithofer and the U.S. market and fuel efficiency targets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I was in the United States about two weeks ago and I had a lot of discussions, as I said, with politicians and influential people and what we have to see in the United States is first of all we will have regulations on a federal level and not on a state level anymore. That is an advantage for the car manufacturers. We will have a kind of a phase in, let me say, until 2015. You cannot 100% compare to with what is going on in the European Union and what does it mean for us as a car manufacturer?  First of all, it means we are definitely on the right track with our Megacity Vehicle, but that is only one part of it because a lot of people, they look into the future, they say in the year 2020 just between five and 15% will be electric vehicles. So that means electric vehicles we need to fulfill regulations, especially, Mr. Ellinghorst in the United States of America.</p>
          <p>Then the second point is, of course, we will not give up the diesel in the United States. We introduced the diesel, one is the X5 35d and the other one is the 3 Series 335d and we had to fight for the diesel because the diesel is the technology what you can use instead of hybrid because from a fuel consumption point of view diesel, as we all know, is very good. And, of course, we have to introduce as well hybrids in the United States. The first will be our 7 Series ActiveHybrid, our big car, our flagship and, of course, we have to think about to introduce hybrids as well in our 5 Series and in our 3 Series model lineup.</p>
          <p>So really the euro 500 on costs I cannot say at the moment because first we have to look into how many four cylinders do we have to introduce and in my opinion we have to introduce four cylinders in the United States of America, will we be able to push the diesel, to bring the diesel up in the United States of America and as I said we need the Megacity Vehicle because to earn gold credits in the United States in future. And as we see it as the BMW Group, we have the right package. Will it cost us money?  On the cost side, yes, of course, it will cost us money. Do we have a choice?  No, we don't have a choice, but the advantage is we are not the only ones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Dr. Reithofer, would you &#x2013; you had a discussion with Daimler recently and they seem to be looking at additional capacity in the U.S. and potentially producing some C Class over there. Would that be ever a point of thought for BMW as well, given the dollar and the also the upside in the U.S. that you might see?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all, as you know, we made a decision to produce our X3 in the United States. We will move end of next year the X3, the new model lineup from Austria, that means from the Euro zone to the United States of America. As you know, the X3 is a volume model and how we see it, it is the right step because then we will produce in the United States of America the X5, the X6 and the X3.</p>
          <p>That means in principle with one exception, the X1, all SUVs in the United States of America, so that will give us an advantage in the United States of America and as you know, when we made the decision and you could see a smile on my face, but you cannot see it, as I said two years ago, look, the dollar will be strong again and what BMW is doing is, of course, not necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Arndt, your other question about the structure of Financial Service will be answered by Fried Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So hello, Ms. Ellinghorst. Now just to keep you updated about the changes within the Financial Services structures, first of all to remind you what the targets are, so we want to be more robust on our financing structure in order to be prepared for any volatile financial markets in the future. And, of course, there's always a issue to reduce cost of capital. Now those are the reasons why we will change it and the first target is to be able to use deficits that we can collect. And in Germany, for example, we'd like to be able to use it for refinancing in other European markets and the second target is to really get access to central banks and to the ECB in terms of open market financing.</p>
          <p>So both are the two target areas and now the status is in the meantime we got approval from the Spanish authorities to move forward. We got the approval from BaFin here in Germany and we are now waiting to be registered on German Federal Commercial Register. So that is now really a question of days to get the final approval there and then we can use the funds in Spain. Next steps would be to integrate the next market with Italy or France in the next step on the basis of our strategy. Okay, so that's the status and we move forward very quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And now when I look at &#x2013; is the 70 billion Financial Services balance sheet more likely growing, I mean will that cover 10% or 20% of your exposure or will it be more or less, just give us some color maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The target is that we will step walk and create one market after the other here in Europe and as such would be able to really to cover the whole European business. And I would say, at least I would give you one-third to up to 50%, that is what we are targeting.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Firstly, I thought I heard that you now planned no short time working at Dingolfing over the end of the year, I wondered if that was true and if so is it a better run out of the old five, a better reception for the new GT or is it knock-on effects for other models?  Secondly, I wonder whether you see any further necessity to reduce dealer stocks in any area or was the adjustment that we saw in the third quarter the end of it?</p>
          <p>And finally following on from the discussion about Financial Services, your deposit taking was actually static in the third quarter. I just wondered whether you found other sources have developed, financing sources, have developed to a stage where you are less interested in deposit taking to finance your Financial Services business or is this just a feature of the competitiveness of the market right now?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. John, we start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, what is the overall situation of short-term work at BMW at the moment?  I mean we do not have short-term work at any of our automobile plants at the moment. There are currently well under 1,000 employees working short time. Of those, 500 are at our motorcycle production facility in Berlin and then I would like to add we are at the moment in the launch phase of the X1 and the 5 Series GT. The X1 is affecting our plant in Leipzig and the 5 Series GT our plant in Dingolfing.</p>
          <p>And I mean you have to know, we have to fill up the pipeline now with X1s and with 5 Series GTs because, as I said, both cars are better than our plans, that means better than budget, from a order intake point of view. And as I said, to have enough cars in our dealer body we have to fill up now the pipeline and that is the reason we have to push the production in Dingolfing and in Leipzig.</p>
          <p>That is the first point and, of course, as we all know, we will launch our new 5 Series, our new 5 Series, next year and then we have to see again what does it mean during the launch phase for our plant in Dingolfing. We have to see it, no decision at the moment.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. The second part of your question will be answered by Fried Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Before I come to the dealer stock, first the question about Financial Services, so when we look at the deposits actually we cannot use more because we have structural limitations. That's the reason why we want to change structures and with the integration of further markets in 2010 we should be able to use even more deposits for refinancing purposes. But I have to say, other sources like commercial paper or ABS is quite attractive at the moment, so there's no big advantage now from the deposits in comparison, for example, the commercial paper markets.</p>
          <p>Now your question about the dealer stock, actually we have reduced dealer stock in quarter three in order to prepare our dealers for a better business in the months to come. So we want to reduce sales support, we want to have more price discipline in place and as the new models are coming to the market now, in the fourth quarter, they have to be prepared.</p>
          <p>So we want them not to be overstocked and to be in a position where they have to push the cars into the market. That's the reason of taking out dealer stock and this is something that is reflected in our earnings as well because the wholesale numbers are between 10 and 20,000 units below the retail number in this specific quarter. And that is one of the reasons the numbers are like they are. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Daniel Schwarz of Commerzbank. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, Daniel Schwarz, Commerzbank. I have three questions. First is do you think you will need a second joint venture partner in China?  Second question would be regarding your current estimates with regard to the U.S. dollar or your mid-term expectation for the U.S. dollar?  And the third question regarding the new models, how many of the orders of the X1 came from current owners of the X3 and for the 5 Series GT how many orders came from current owners of the 5 Series?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That was it?  Yes? Daniel?  Okay. Thank you very much. That will be handled by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think actually I can really say that we don't think we need a second joint venture partner in China. Our existing partner Brilliance is in the meantime very stable and maybe you have followed up the announcement from Brilliance that they will now sell off their cars business or their Zhonghua business, which was a loss bringer in the past. By doing it, the company will be much more stable in the future because then they have two profitable legs. One is a minibus business and the other is the BMW joint venture. So having said this, I think we are quite happy that they develop in this direction and we have a partner that is able to follow our growth path because we are just on our way to prepare investments, capacity investments in China.</p>
          <p>Now your question about the dollar, not so easy to predict I have to say. In the mid to long-term that we are looking at equilibrium and that is what we think it's a best measure you can take. Actually the dollar is a bit too weak from our perspective, but it depends on economic recovery in the United States. If this takes place, as we expect it, I think then the dollar will strengthen. If this will take longer, then maybe we have to wait a bit longer, but at the end of the day we think in the long-term the dollar will be a bit stronger again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then the second part, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean to talk about cannibalization and that was the core of your question between 5 Series GT and 5 Series Sedan and X1 and X3, I mean I can only tell you it's too early to ask such a question. We have to say and in my opinion we can be happy of that fact the new 5 Series will be a very good looking car or let me say is a very good looking car and we are very confident if we look into the year 2010 that it will be a brilliant launch next year of our 5 Series Sedan.</p>
          <p>And at the moment I can only say we are happy when we look into our order intake for both vehicles, the X1 and the 5 Series GT and I mean, we should not forget at the moment we are in our last full year of our X3. That means it is in the seventh year and we should not forget we will have the launch of the new 5 Series Sedan next year. That means the 5 Series, the current 5 Series, is as well at the end of its lifecycle, so that means it's not a fair comparison, two new products and two let me say not so new products anymore. We have to see the comparison after the launch of the new products, the new X3 and the new 5 Series Sedan.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question comes from Mr. Gehrke from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions, if I may. Firstly, just on some short-term clarification, Mr. Eichiner, I think on the press call you said that you're not sure whether BMW can achieve a positive Automotive results in the fourth quarter. Could elaborate a little bit on that, is this mostly related to the 5 Series changeover or shouldn't we really go for a stronger revenue momentum in the fourth quarter also in the light of a very weak base from last year and shouldn't we therefore be a bit more positive with regard to earnings as well?</p>
          <p>And the second question is much more on a longer term view. Last night your new North American President painted a relatively bleak picture with regards to North American pricing. At the same time, the BMW Group in your competitive environment is the one with at least on a competitive level the most aggressive volume targets out there. Isn't there a disconnect between the two and shouldn't we step away from 2012 volume targets really at this point?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Jochen. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, first of all, just to make that clear, I was talking about the EBIT at the end of the year for the full year, the year-to-date from December as of December and that's why I said that that will be a tough target to really compensate all the losses we had in the first three quarters. But if you look at the particular quarter, I would say it's very clear our target to be positive there, very clearly, that's what we want to achieve and what we are going for.</p>
          <p>And your second question was about the dealers pricing situation and the volume targets. It's a balance, as always. I mean we have attractive products now in the pipeline and we are really expecting, for example, the new 5 Series, the 5 Series GT to get momentum in the market and especially now big markets like the U.S.</p>
          <p>Pricing is a question of discipline now. All over the world sales support is too high and we have set up now the first measures in order to really come back to more pricing discipline in all markets. That was the reason why we didn't push hard in third quarter on the wholesale side because, as I said, in the beginning dealer stocks should not be heavily overstocked, otherwise they push the cars into the market with heavy discounts.</p>
          <p>We want to avoid that. That was the reason we took the wholesome number down against the retail number and now dealers should be in a much, much better situation when the first quarter came in and in the next forthcoming months and with the new products in place we expect them really to come to a much better pricing discipline. That is the target and we are going for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mr. Eichiner. Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean it is a difficult question you ask because you have to look from time to time in a crystal ball as well. But in my opinion it is safe to say we strongly believe, we at the BMW Group, that the premium segment will remain attractive, but even here it will take a while and, Mr. Gehrke, that proves that your question is absolutely right and even here it will take a while, of course, for the market to fully recover.</p>
          <p>Other pictures in my opinion are not realistic and we have to be realistic. In my opinion the recovery will start from a lower level than what we had originally predicted for the coming years and what does it mean for the year 2012?  As you know, we revised already our volume target for 2012.</p>
          <p>Our original target was 1.8 million cars and we revised it to 1.6, let me say, to a range up to 1.65 million cars and that is &#x2013; and the reason is the current economic crisis because you cannot go steep up after an economic crisis, that is just not a realistic point of view.</p>
          <p>And, Mr. Gehrke, I would like to add one point to your question regarding the United States of America and let me say I hope you agree, I mean from a volume point of view we have not overdone it in the United States of America in 2009. Our course was a very careful one, having in mind cost of retail, our residual value position and volume. That is how we see it at the BMW Group and if we see the last two months ahead of us and as well our figure in the United States in October, we can say it was a balanced way to handle the U.S. market in 2009 and as well in November and December volume will not be our first target.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question comes from Christian Breitsprecher of Oppenheim. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon, it's Christian Breitsprecher from Oppenheim. I have two questions related to your net financial position and the financial result. For the net financial position of the Automotive business, you indicate a deterioration by euro 2.2 billion. You say that about 1.5 billion of that is attributable to the contribution to the CTA, which leaves me with about 700 million deterioration that has to be explained and you are indicating an adjusted negative free cash flow for the automotive business of euro 99 million, so I wonder how these two numbers fit together?</p>
          <p>And secondly, in the third quarter you've shown a very strong improvement in the financial result. Could you explain to us what's behind that and what we should expect for the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. These are the right financial questions and they will be answered by with Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, the improvement in the financial result is due to stand-alone interest rates derivatives. They had a positive fair value and this was one of the reasons our financial result was on a Group level stronger and in the Automotive segment we have to see that the financial result against the quarter three in '08 was also stronger because in '08 we had an effect coming out, a negative effect coming out, of exchange rate hedges. Those were basically the reasons for the financial result.</p>
          <p>Now your question about the cash at the, what was it, financial assets, net financial assets?  Now the changes we see here are coming from cash and cash equivalents and for internal net financial receivables. That's where the changes are coming. As you mentioned, we externalized the second tranche of the pension obligations and we had the changes in the cash and cash equivalents, the internal net financial receivables and some changes in financial liabilities. That all together made the changes you mentioned the 2.2 to euro 9 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Frank Biller of LBBW. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon, Frank Biller from LBBW. Just two questions remaining here, the one is on the outlook for the U.S. market. So last night there was also a new outlook given for the U.S. market, expectation of slightly more than 11 million units in 2010 versus 11.5 units, so maybe you can give us an update here why are you a bit more cautious for the American total market and does that imply that you have really weaker October sales figure in the magnitude of decline of double-digit maybe?</p>
          <p>The next question on wholesale versus retail figures, here you said it's 10 to 20,000 units lower wholesale figures than retails. That means here, of course, you had a negative EBIT effect. Can you just give us some thought about what would have been the EBIT line without such an under-stocking of dealers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Frank, thank you very much. We start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all I would like to start with October and I can give you a clear answer. We had a plan for October for the United States of America and we said having in mind the current market condition in the United States of America it doesn't makes sense and we have to revise our volume target for October. That is exactly what we have done. That means, what I said before, volume in the United States is not our first target.</p>
          <p>You have to balance really and it is very important you have to balance cost of retail, residual values and volume. If you put the accelerator too harsh towards volume you will feel it on the incentive side and you will feel it on the residual value side and that is not what you should do. That is how we see it.</p>
          <p>And outlook for next year, I mean what is the difference between 11 million cars and 11.5 million cars, at the moment we have to say we don't know, what will really happen in the year 2010. For us, I can only answer, I mean we will launch the new 5 Series next year Sedan and Touring, as we say. We will have two new products, the X1 and the 5 Series GT.</p>
          <p>We will have a new Rolls-Royce Ghost, I know not a high volume. We will have a new MINI Crossover end of next year and a new X3 end of next year. I can only say for the BMW Group we will have a very good product momentum between 2010 and 2012 and that should put us into a position again to grow, that is my answer, worldwide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thank you very much. The second part, Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the difference between wholesale and retail. First of all, basically I have to say I think we should not make our profit by pushing too hard into the dealer stock, so what we try to achieve is a good balance at dealer level because they have to really manage their working capital as well and they have to be prepared that they really can build up the stock for the new products to come, like the X1 and like the 5 Series GT, so it's just a normal BMW way of steering the dealer, the dealer stock. So that is to make the point clear.</p>
          <p>Now the difference between retail and wholesale, as I said, is between 10 and 20,000 units and clearly if we would have pushed for the same number at the retail, we would have seen a much higher revenue number in order of a mid three digit million number. That would have been the consequence out of that, but I explained why we don't want to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the EBIT, it's roughly 40, 50 million or what?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's really, that's hard to calculate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. I think we have time for two more questions. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Your next question comes from Michael Punzet of DZ Bank. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael Punzet. Good afternoon. I have a follow-up question on your interest rate result, you highlighted that the positive development in this quarter was related to interest rate derivatives. Maybe you can give some indications what are the markets see derivatives linked to, for example, is it U.S. dollar, is it euro and is it on the absolute level or is it on the interest rate structure?</p>
          <p>And the second question is you highlighted that you will return to price discipline in 2010. Do you think it's really realistic that you can return to a better price discipline if especially in the European markets maybe the volume manufacturer would increase incentives to compensate for the scrapping schemes, which run out at the end of this year, for example, in Germany?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Michael and will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I have to say we are using interest rate hedges for all markets where we do Financial Services business and as the interest rates went down a bit, so the hedges gained value and that is one of the reasons why we have a better financial result. So that's basically part of our Financial Services business.</p>
          <p>Now your second question was about the price discipline and what we can do in order to achieve this. I think it has a lot to do with the age of our product portfolio. You have to see that the third quarter now is really the peak of the age because from now onwards we will get more and more momentum with the new products to come.</p>
          <p>So in average we will refresh our product portfolio step-by-step, now month-to-month and also beginning of next year then with the new 5 Series to come and this is a very tough situation in order to really go for price discipline when you are on the top of the age of your product portfolio. And from now onwards especially with the new products we really go for much more discipline, so we don't want the new products to be discounted heavily. And we targeted in all our markets, our people, our managers there to really go for more price discipline and with new attractive products we should have a chance to achieve those targets. That's how we see it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question comes from Aleksej Wunrau of BHF-Bank Frankfurt. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good afternoon, Aleksej Burgold, BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. Four questions actually, but I need to ask them. Why is this that you say you outsourced 1.5 billion in pension provisions and on your P&amp;L pension provisions over the quarter reduced by just roughly euro 1 billion?</p>
          <p>Secondly, as far as we were able to pick up from the telephone conference this morning, the main reason for BMW not meeting expectations in Q3 was strong pricing pressure also coming from the new Mercedes E-Class, which forced you to grant high incentives for your 5 Series.</p>
          <p>So is it fair to assume that there will be fewer price discounts following the model switchover of the 5 Series and that we should see a major swing in EBIT in this regard in the coming quarters?  And could you also maybe quantify the adverse earnings effect coming from the sell out with your dealers in the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That was only three. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I ask my fourth after the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Okay. Mr. Eichiner, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now on the pension side there are other effects, especially in the U.K. where we had to build up new &#x2013; the obligations, as planned, and we have to build up new pension obligations. So that is the reason that we have a certain offset to the 1.5 billion with the result you've mentioned.</p>
          <p>Now the next thing talking about our competitors, actually we don't talk about our competitors, but I have to say the introduction of new competitive products, whoever the competitor was, doesn't have a major influence now on the pricing of our products. I mean it's the overall market that is in a very, I would say, very distressed position because if you compare '07 to '09 and you take out the base effect of the low market of the September and October last year, then you see that the market is nearly 20, 21% behind '07. So it's still not there where we want it to be and this is the reason that there's still a lot of pressure in all markets in the world, with one exception and that is China.</p>
          <p>Now the third question, I think most of the difference between the wholesale and retail that I mentioned and as I said before, of course, it is an offset between 10 to 20,000 units and basically if we would have pushed all the cars out into the dealerships at the same level as the retail was, then clearly this would have a positive effect on revenue and on earnings. But for us this is not an option.</p>
          <p>Our target is to get back to price discipline and if you push heavily on the dealer side, the opposite would be the case, so we would even have to consider even more pressure in the market and even more, even higher discounts in the market and financially a very distressed situation with the dealers overall. So that's the reason why we didn't go for it and in order to come back to more price discipline in the fourth quarter already and in the beginning of 2010, there was no option. So we reduced stock and we prepared the dealers that they are able to come back to more price discipline.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Adam Hull, WestLB, two questions. One on the intra-group pricing, you mentioned that obviously net borrowing costs have fallen pretty substantially in the last few months. I just wanted to be clear, what interest rates are you charging between Financial Services and the Automotive division, are you using the low rates we're seeing or are you using some kind of blended number from the previous sort of borrowing history?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on residuals you mentioned that there was a netting to the neutral net effect from I presume low residual value assumptions in Continental Europe and high ones in the U.S. whether you'd give some detail on that, what's the gross number?  And when I look at the free cash flow I do notice a change in provisions in Autos of negative 180 million in the cash flow in Autos. Could you just tie that in, perhaps is it to do with that residual or what exactly is it, is it an EBIT number in Autos or lower down?  Many thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Now intra-group pricing, so we have a very clear principle between Financial Services and the other segments, so the pricing is arms length principal and therefore there is no, well lots of leaning on the Automotive side for Financial Services, is arms length, as I said. The second question about the residual values, well clearly the biggest hit we got was in the German market and the reason is the coverage allowance and that is something we had to consider over the last two quarters definitely.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately as we planned it in our budget we could offset that development with positive results in U.K. and in the U.S., mainly in the U.S. and that brought us back to a neutral position. And now the next question was change in provisions in the cash flow statement, the decrease is primarily due to drawings on provisions for personnel and total expenses, so including severance payments, as we already explained in our Q1 conference.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just go back to the arms length on the intra-group, I mean just to be clear, you're using the current rates then, so you're using &#x2013; borrowing costs have fallen dramatically and you're using those low rates to pay and will continue to use them as that bleeds through?</p>
