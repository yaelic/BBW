          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to publication of the First Half Year 2011 Financial Account of EDF Group. I will now &#x2013; I'll start with summarizing the major facts of the half year. Then, of course, I will come back. On our ambition 2020 that I've already mentioned before, some of you during the shareholders general meeting, after which Thomas Piquemal will present the details of the figures for the half year and the outlook for 2011, and more generally the outlook for our ambition until 2015.</p>
          <p>Let's start with the financial result of the first half year of 2011. Around &#x2013; We won't teach you anything if I say that the contest was particularly challenging, complex, uncertain with of course the Fukushima accident that released with much acuteness and on the global scale the choice of future energy policies. A number of other major highlights of market high industry, particularly in France as well as elsewhere. And we'll be discussing that.</p>
          <p>Let's start with performance in the first half year, performance that can be regarded as highly positive in spite of the troubled environment. First, with the satisfaction is an improvement of our income, improvement that comes essentially from operation improvement.</p>
          <p>Organic growth of 6.2% EBITDA, nearly 40% improved EBIT. Improvement found in the strong growth of the net income multiplied by 2.4 in particular, for the attributable net income and +12.5% for our net income from current operation.</p>
          <p>Another important point to highlight is that we have recovered some leeway margins from maneuver by improving our net debt and debt net over EBITDA ratio, which as you see today, is around two. And that debt is being covered by 2 years of EBITDA, meaning that, EDF's balance sheet is probably one of the soundest in our industry.</p>
          <p>We're actually the only company in the sector to have an increase in our rating which is now up to AA- by Standard &amp; Poor's. We've played a major role, as you know, and we continue to play a major role in the nuclear sector; which is strategic for economy, as was reminded last Monday when we set-up the nuclear strategic committee for the nuclear industry. Very solid results.</p>
          <p>In spite of uncertainties, we have not moved off course from our strategic ambition or our priorities, as tested by these highlights of the first half year of 2011.</p>
          <p>Among these highlights, let's start with the improved operational performance. That was our key priority, to improve our output efficiency and it was the pre-requisite for any future growth.</p>
          <p>We've reached this target with an excellent performance of nuclear output, plus 7.7% in France and in the U.K. was nearly 25% increase in the output efficiency. Although in the previous fiscal year, we had a maintenance shutdown in one of our power plants.</p>
          <p>However, the performance of the nuclear fleets, both in France and the U.K., has reached record high this &#x2013; in this first half year. And we remind you as well that in the U.K. last week, 18th of July, the U.K. government confirmed it's nuclear &#x2013; energy choices by approving nuclear developments.</p>
          <p>In fact, I'll remind you that the level of the nuclear output has reached 43.9 terawatt hour, a level unprecedented in the history of EDF. We were also able to keep up our targets, particularly thanks to a very low number of &#x2013; unplanned outages. Down 371 days in the semester, and so, very significant progress in reducing the number of unplanned outages.</p>
          <p>This results from major investments in maintenance, in particularly, to replace major components in our power plants, replacement that is accelerating. Thus, the nuclear efficiency, which is significantly higher than it was in last year and even above our expectation, had two positive effects. First of all, we were able to review upwards our annual targets for the year 2011 within a range of 411 to 418 terawatt hour, instead of the 408 to 450 in initially planned.</p>
          <p>,</p>
          <p>Second effect was to offset highly deteriorated climate conditions that impacted the hydro-power output. This year the lack of rainfall and snowfall have actually caused approximately 35% decrease in the water flows. To this excellent performance of the French nuclear and U.K. nuclear fleet, we can also add a significant decrease in the average power cuts down 16 minutes versus 2011. So this shows a test to the real progress I have made in terms of operations.</p>
          <p>The announcement last year of the Flamanville &#x2013; the new construction schedule for Flamanville, goes in the same direction and fits into the rationale of sharing information, of course that is fully transparent. The first semester 2011 was highlighted by two key events. First of all, we have strengthened our position in renewable, with the decision of taking over the EDF Energies Nouvelles. We now own 96.71% of EDF EN shares and, after the following process to buyback the remaining share, we will own 100%.</p>
          <p>The second highlight is the decision of the ARENH price, that was set at &#x20AC;42, as of January, 2012. The NOME Law came into effect on the 1st of July, 2011, and the CRE regulator has already mentioned that our competitors have been demanding 61 terawatt hour. I remind you that the total amount that has been approved by EDF is 100 terawatt hour. This leads me to deduce that those who were claiming that the ARENH price were not &#x2013; was not advantageous, actually are finding it quite sufficient.</p>
          <p>So, in that solid semester with the committing and positive decisions for EDF enabled us to reassert our ambitions for organic growth. So, priority to profitable growth this may not be very original, but that is the meaning that we want to give to the Group strategy. As in introduction, in this first half year was highlighted by the events at Fukushima, as well as the contrasted, and sometimes drastic, reactions that led to some governmental decisions in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Let me add that the nuclear &#x2013; nuclear power has its right &#x2013; full-fledged right for base in the future energy mix. Neither the U.S. nor China nor Russia or the U.K. are even considering doing away with nuclear power. Not any more than South Africa, India and many other countries. I told you earlier that the British government adopted two weeks ago the approval of building new power plants, nuclear power plant. And the reform of the electricity market actually confirms the implementation of favorable conditions to invest in carbon-free energies, including nuclear power.</p>
          <p>And this illustrates another dimension of the energy mix expansion, different from what was chosen by country East of France. France has opted for nuclear power. And my conviction, I repeat, is that nuclear power is a carbon-free energy and safe energy provided that we devoted the necessary investment and it is interested to comprehensive operators. Beyond this performance, we are fully aware of our strong responsibility as an operator, of course. A role that places us on the forefront, as you know, in the nuclear sector; and this is probably the very first lesson to be learned from Fukushima.</p>
          <p>As you know that &#x2013; you know the safety quarter is part of EDF's DNA and it's reflected in an ongoing approach to improve a safety end performance of our fleet. Hence, the necessary investment in maintenance to &#x2013; in proper operation of the powers &#x2013; of the power plant and extension of their life span. In 2010, in France, we devoted 1.7 &#x2013; excuse me, 1.5 billion in &#x2013; let me repeat, in 2009, 1.5 billion. We devoted in 2010, 1.7 billion will be invested for maintenance and should reach &#x2013; should exceed that by 2015.</p>
          <p>Of course our ambition is not committed to nuclear only. At the latest shareholders assembly, last May, I presented the Group's strategic orientations; orientations that intend to position EDF as a global electricity operator, operating in all of its businesses with one goal: to be the global leader of carbon-free electricity. By 2020, I'd like to renew our &#x2013; restate our ambition to have an electricity generation fleet with 75% carbon-free outputs. We also intend to sustain and continue our leadership. To this purpose, EDF can and must propose its scales and expertise to support other operators in countries, particularly in developing a safer nuclear power.</p>
          <p>In renewable energies, our commitment is clearly stated by our takeover of EDF EN. And, we are now fully in charge to develop projects and draw the benefits in line with our investments. Our commitment in renewables will also involve our determination and our commercial ability to win future tenders in hydro-power concessions in France, of course, as well as in other countries worldwide.</p>
          <p>Lastly, within this energy mix, we are not neglecting nuclear &#x2013; excuse me, thermal power. Gas and Coal remain important components in the global energy mix. It is up to us, to how country is developed technologies that are more modern, more environmentally friendly; as we will be doing in Poland by developing clean coal with super critical coal or in Asia with combined cycle gas turbines.</p>
          <p>As you see, our expertise, which is recognized on a global level &#x2013; determinates our growth ambitions provided, of course that this growth must be profitable. To do so, we need to have higher demand in terms of return on investments. Thomas would be speaking about that. We review the CapEx criteria to ensure that all projects will create value. And still in the perspective of optimizing the profitability of higher growth, we've also redefined our development revenues.</p>
          <p>This involves, first of all, clarifying our international partnerships. We've gone through several complex and sometimes constraining situations.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., in particular, we've put an end to the threat of the put that could have been exercised by Constellation that could've cost us up to $2 billion. In Germany, we exited from EnBW at the time where the context was becoming unfavorable. Initially, the decision may have been surprising, but the recent political choices in Germany probably now proves us right.</p>
          <p>With that, regarding Edison Italy, as you know, our shareholders agreement has been extended up to the 15th of September and we've been working with A2A to find a solution and comfort Edison's position as the second electricity operator in Italy.  Now that these situations are being clarified or are being clarified along with the takeover of EDF NE now confers us a full mastery over our strategy to keep going forward.</p>
          <p>So, a global benchmark of electricity with an ambition consistent with the group's identity. This ambition is actually facilitated by EDF's integrated model, vertical integration of all businesses, from down-streams to up-streams, from design and build all the way to operation and management of services. Within all of these businesses, EDF is and should and must remain a global reference. So, vertical integration of our businesses, but an open architecture worldwide, authorizing all forms of alliances, partnerships, contracts, managements in France and elsewhere. The only keyword is to capture growth where it is.</p>
          <p>And we will use our key assets, mainly the diversity of our skills in response to the diverse situations and expectations of our clients everywhere across the world, expertise in hydro-power engineering, fossil fuel power plants, design and operation of networks, scales and expertise in trading and services.</p>
          <p>Last June 17th, EDF signed a partnership agreement with MRSK, the Russian electricity distributor, relative to the maintenance and quality of the distribution created in Russia. In this country, we've also initiated collaboration with Gazprom and Rosatom in complimentary areas.</p>
          <p>While our domestic playing field is Europe, we'll also intend to develop in countries where we already enjoy historical partnerships and very strong competence. In China, for instance,</p>
          <p>we've been working for the past 35 years with the CGNPC or the U.S. or in South Africa with ESKOM.</p>
          <p>Our target is to boost our presence in high-growth countries with considerable energy requirements, Poland, Turkey or Brazil among many others. In Brazil, in particular, we want to be present there and last June we inaugurated the very first solar power plant in the state of Rio de Janeiro at the power plant of UTE Norte Fluminense. To sum it up, EDF Group every day is more open to the world, with an output capacity that has grown 50% internationally.</p>
          <p>Being a benchmark electricity operator means also anticipate the future in preparing for the challenges of the 22nd century in the world that will be faced with major issues of climate warming, security of supply or doubled global demand for electricity by 2015. And to this purpose, and this is another asset we enjoy perhaps to let you know, that we will continue to strengthen innovation in R&amp;D,  which have always been a key strength for EDF and that will continue to boost out our technology potential over the coming years.</p>
          <p>2,000 engineers and technicians have already been mobilized to develop the group's ability to anticipate and develop all of these businesses. Material ageing, CO2 capture and storage, solar photovoltaic, new generation, offshore wind, concentration solar power and marine turbines are as many areas of major potential for the future where we intend to develop.</p>
          <p>Efforts in R&amp;D will also include efforts in networks, energy demand to make sure that electricity becomes the energy of the sustainable city. Among other examples is a development of smart grids and smart systems, including smart meters, like the Linky meter experimented successfully by ERDF, low-energy buildings, reasonable price for smart buildings, innovative usage of electricity for transport comfort of industry.</p>
          <p>This is reason we inaugurated last June the new R&amp;D center of the group in Beijing dedicated to CO2 capture and storage and to smart grids, two sectors that represent a major challenge for China in the major challenge of the sustainable city. Anticipating the future for EDFR also will guarantee that the skills and expertise will be kept within the company, we are all mobilized to meet this major challenge and make sure that EDF can not only renew its skills and expertise but also to develop these skills to respond to our future growth.</p>
          <p>So, I briefly summarized the semester for you, in which we've seen a lot of events and progress for our group. Within 18 months of presence together with my team we have solved four key challenges on the mid-term for the group.  First of all, operational performance, we've been increased our nuclear output in France and in the U.K. among others, secondly, defense of our interest under the new NOME Law in France and defense of our interest everywhere in the world more globally, management of international partnership and lastly deleveraging of the group.</p>
          <p>I can also mention the decision of the French safety authority to extend the lifespan of the Fessenheim power plant for 10 years. This decision, of course, independent of the safety audits and stress tests to be conducted after Fukushima reflects, nevertheless, the quality of EDF's work and achievements in terms of maintenance and safety, successes that many are attempting to minimize. Within 18 months, our group has gained in strength and consistency in all of these priorities we've actually acheived better than our expectations and hopefully, better than your expectations, even though, and I regret it, none of this is truly reflected in our share price. But we can still continue to hope.</p>
          <p>Over the long-term, last May we announced that we wanted to increase our installed capacity to 200 gigawatts by 2020. A few words, being a reference benchmark operator in 2020, mean, of course, that we need to have an energy mix that will be competitive and diversified with projects that will enable us to reach this ambition of 200 gigawatt of raw capacity, up approximately 30% versus today. As I said, the 2020 energy mix in EDF will be broken down into 50% nuclear power, 25% fossil-fired and 25% hydropower, plus other renewable energy sources, which implies an ambitious development in these forms of energies. The group will thus to have a 75% CO2-free energy fleet and 50% internationally, which of course means that three-fourths of these new capacities will be built outside of France.</p>
          <p>These developments will be based on new forms of contract-based-engineering, meaning that we will not necessarily have to hold 100% of the assets, management for third-party account, concessions or <mark type="ph" /> Winamp (21:35), investment of the IPP type. We will thus be able to limit our risk exposure while endorsing the full responsibility of the industrial and technological choices.</p>
          <p>These projects of new capacities, well, you're familiar with them as we already mentioned them. Projects in construction account for approximately 8 gigawatts in addition, in nuclear power, the EPI in Flamanville, plus 2 EPIs in Taiwan and China, in fossil-fired, two CCGT's are being built in France are Bl&#xE9;nod and Martigues, and one in the U.K.  Other projects have been identified for approximately 34 gigawatts, such as the EPI in the U.K. and we could've also considered other hydro-power international projects based on the Nam Theun model.</p>
          <p>The example of Nam Theun shows actually that the increase in the Group's installed capacity does not necessarily involve heavy investments in capital since we own today 40% of the company that owns the power plant, but we do have full industrial control, thus we estimate that 40 gigawatt of capacity for the group should be re commissioned that 2 reach the 200 gigawatt project in 2020.</p>
          <p>We'll now give the floor to Thomas Piquemal for a detailed financial presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentleman, I'll now give you a detailed explanation of our results for the first half of 2011, confirming our objectives for the current year and I will share with you our medium-term outlooks and the targets we have set for 2011, 2015.  But before talking about the present and future, I suggest you should look back at the past. Just to pinpoint the presentation for 2010 based on IFRS 5 standards, we have the contribution of EnBW as an asset available for sale. In the reported results, we've the contribution of assets that we disposed of in 2010.</p>
          <p>I'm referring to the British networks and the Eggborough power plant in the U.K., as well. A contribution which was reprocessed just as the contribution of RTE, which has now fully equity consolidated, reprocessed for the results of the first half of 2010, so as to propose a comparative basis, so that you can properly measure the operational performance of EDF in the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>The chairman gave you the main key figures, sales up, organic growth of 2.7%, EBITDA at 8616 million plus 6.2%, therefore on a like-for-like basis, as compared to the first half of 2010. The group share of net income multiplied by almost 2.4 on a like-for-like basis. Let me point out that last year, in the first half of 2010, we had recorded non-recurrent losses, losses in value on our American values almost &#x20AC;1 billion. Of course, we do not have this impact in the first half of 2011, we process for non-recurring items, and net income is up by plus 12.5% to &#x20AC;2,629 million.</p>
          <p>The debt is below &#x20AC;30 billion, reduced as compared to figures in 31st of December 2010, reaching towards &#x20AC;9.2 billion, namely twice EBITDA. As I said, sales up by 2.7% plus &#x20AC;870 million in sales, thanks to a fine performance by France &#x20AC;651 million, plus &#x20AC;219 million, but this relation is due to the fact that revenue in the U.K. is down due to the drop in volume and very small margin in the B2B business.</p>
          <p>EBITDA is up by 6.2%, they are truly driven by the performance in France plus 400 million EBITDA out of the total of 500 million organically. Internationally, all of our businesses are arising aside from Italy, which I will tell you more about in just a few moments.</p>
          <p>EBITDA is up by 6.2%, amortizations are, more or less, stable as compared to the previous year. No losses in value, especially in the United States, so EBIT of 5,256 plus 30% almost 40% as compared to the previous year.</p>
          <p>This slight improvement in our financial income done by 7.3% has enabled us, therefore, to have a significant improvement in the Group income of net &#x2013; in a good share of net income, and the progress shown of net income excluding non-recurring items up by 12.5%.</p>
          <p>Non-recurring items are kind of offset in this half, over a positive impact. We had the capital gains under this divestment of our German subsidiary &#x20AC;263 million. To the final &#x2013; this operational was finalized in February. In view of this capital gain of &#x20AC;263 million, we had a loss of value internationally mainly in Italy, where we have a 50% share consolidated in our accounts for a total  &#x20AC;170 million from Dalkia International; this is, although, non-recurring items giving us a total of minus &#x20AC;7.5 billion as compared to &#x20AC;1.3 billion last year.</p>
          <p>Let me point that, on the other matter &#x20AC;151 million, we also accounted for, while even though it's very difficult for us to understand this, the consequences of the regulation published in the beginning of July, regarding the compensation of our competitors were tied down. It's very hard for us to understand and we're hoping to have clarifications on the French regulatory authorities during the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>The volume performance by France plus 8.3% in organic growth is mainly driven by the increase in nuclear output generating &#x20AC;17 billion in excess nuclear offset, and the drop in hydro-power generation on also due to a major weather condition in the first half of 2011 compared to 2010. The &#x2013; We also benefited from higher prices of the wholesale market and we're able to benefit from this, thanks to the excess nuclear output. So we can see the impact of choices made in terms of human resources as of the beginning of 2010 and the accelerated recruitment campaign.</p>
          <p>Our perception of changes in EBITDA consist in looking at regulated activities, which now include mainly ErDF's; we're now consolidating RTE, which is under equity consolidation and non-regulated, meaning production and downstream and optimization. We can see that this offsets the drop in volume due to a mild of weather conditions in 2011 versus 2010, in the non-regulated sectors the progression is 10.8%, was significant in the unregulated sector and the lower section can reproduce the improvement in nuclear production plus 15.5%.</p>
          <p>Whereas, the demand for end customers is down by 18.6 kilowatt hours, mainly due to mild weather conditions, 13 kilowatt hours less. We are able to sell more in the markets and therefore, as I said before, we're able to benefit from higher margins thanks to a positive price effect. Nuclear production has improved significantly, a constant progression every month. This chart shows the trends we have seen in 2010, where we had said that, as of May last year, that we had crossed a new threshold month-by-month.</p>
          <p>Nuclear output has been rising plus 7.7% in total figures for the half year over 15 terawatt hours, in excess generated. All of this, due to the fact that shutdowns are must &#x2013; are better controlled you can see here on this chart, in blue, which shows unplanned outages. Quarter after quarter they are dropping as compared to what we saw in 2010 and then it begins to improve our nuclear output target from between 411, 418 terawatt hours while maintaining our availability a target of 78.6%. In hydropower is quite different due to the hydrological conditions in the first half of 2011, very poor historically, as you can see in blue, and in 2010 in black.</p>
          <p>You must have understood that, on this chart, where I'm talking about the red curve; for the first half of 2011. We did not continue it in July. Of course, we expect a slight improvement given the weather conditions in France today, but it won't really change much.</p>
          <p>You lose nothing in terms of the current reservoirs, and must remain precautious when it comes to hydro-power output in the second half. And this is the gather that explains the fact that output is up by 35.2%, as compared to the first half of 2010, which is quite significant, of course, in terms of our results.</p>
          <p>But you're able to offset this, thanks to nuclear output in particular. Nuclear output was almost rising sharply in the UK, explaining the fine performance of our British subsidiary plus 12% EBITDA and organic growth due to the fact that production was rising by 6.2 terawatt hours in that quarter, a half of which was achieved thanks to the fact that we had no generic problems just last year.</p>
          <p>In this half, we were penalized by the shutdown of the Sizewell power plants which accounted for 3 terawatt hours that were lost. Electricity, you can see that nuclear production is rising. Sales in B2B declining, but these are selected choices made to preserve margins, down by 5 terawatt hours, all-in-all the terawatt has to &#x2013; by less, under market, as you can see on the top left of the chart minus 10 terawatt hours. All of our international operations are improving, except in Italy. These figures, as presented here, are down by 40%, including EDISON in EBITDA that report us straight away that we did not account for the very positive impact for EDISON of the renegotiation of gas supply contracts with gas farm.</p>
          <p>Contract signed about one week ago, and which made it possible for EDISON to record extra gains at this period. We did not account for it due to the time on EBITDA agenda and that for the Group is immaterial even though it is important for EDISON. With that, we have to have &#x20AC;56 million on this chart. We will do that of course through the second half. Aside from this good news, which enabled EDISON to confirm its objective of 900 million in EBITDA for 2011, you can see that performance is dropping, showing difficulties on the Italian markets, especially shrinking margins in the field of electricity and gas.</p>
          <p>Internationally, all businesses are improving except in the United States because they're right now putting new nuclear projects. As a charge EBITDA is up by 10% driven by the very high performance of our subsidiary in Belgium. Amongst our other businesses, EDF Energies Nouvelles reported its results yesterday. The trading activity is up in trading, up by about &#x2013; well, up by 5.7% exactly, after the start of the year that was difficult with a certain level of volatility. In the year for energy, these figures are significant, plus 18%, even though we expect more disposals in the second half. So the &#x2013; progression for the year will be even more significant.</p>
          <p>Free cash flow is positive, plus &#x20AC;300 million, to be compared to the first half of 2010 at 1.3 billion, which included the first payout for 1.7 billion, because we process for that. You can see that we have improved as compared to the first half of 2010. And all this was achieved even though the insufficient compensation with respect to the SPE affected this quarter for about &#x20AC;500 million in our accounts, as in the previous period, in terms of our working capital requirements.</p>
          <p>Positive free cash flow &#x2013; positive, therefore, even though we are continuing to invest significantly. Our CapEx up by 2.7%, gross CapEx, as compared to the previous year with the same breakdown as what I presented at the general meeting; of course, taken into account the deconsolidation of RTE, about 30% of regulated business, the remaining 50/50 between maintenance and development. Net financial debt is dropping sharply, &#x20AC;29.2 billion versus &#x20AC;34.4 million at the end of December 2010, thanks to the collection of assets from disposal of EnBW &#x20AC;7.1 billion for the balance of securities and the deconsolidation of the debt. This figure does not include an uncommitted amount. So, this is merely the impact with respect to our debt; a positive impact, &#x20AC;300 million. &#x20AC;200 million for the period, for dedicated assets, less than in the previous period.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we are benefiting from the allocation of RTE securities, 50% is dedicated assets, allowing us to build up for a longer period the &#x2013; our dedicated assets. We paid out the remaining dividends, &#x20AC;1.2 billion, in cash and we carried out the acquisition of EDF Energies Nouvelles minorities' asset sales, because after this offering we will be on a 6.7% of capital at EDF Energies Nouvelles, starting with down 50% with the compulsory on withdrawal.</p>
          <p>And as of Octeville, who we'll fully -own the subsidiary. There was one section that was in cash, &#x20AC;40 per cash &#x2013; per security, and one in securities, followed by the intensification of the EDF share buyback program, selected to cancel the dilutive effect lent to the portion in cash. So, if we were to add up the cash portion, the share buyback program, as well as the mandatory squeeze-up in the coming weeks, the total cost for EDF in cash would be &#x20AC;1.5 billion. Meaning that cost price per security would be &#x20AC;38, meaning a premium of 50% on the stock market price of EDF EN.</p>
          <p>Now, all of this allows us to confirm our objectives of 2011. EBITDA will rise by 4% to 6%, before taking into account the unexplained compensation due to TaRTAM. Once again, we hope we'll get clarifications on this on the second half. We do not really understand the TaRTAM cost, which is clearly the link to the factor on competitors did not cover themselves, so hedge on the market as we did at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>But the TaRTAM will disappear as of the 1 of July, adding to the non-recurring aspect of this portion. So, we expect therefore an EBITDA growth of between 4% and 6%, on the financial debt of EBITDA ratio I'll say 2% to 2.2% at the beginning of the year; including the impact of energy in Nouvelles, so we'll have 2.1% to 2.3%, with our objective we maintained of a dividend that will be at least stable to be paid out for 2011.</p>
          <p>In the introduction I pointed out, I see this opportunity to share with you our medium-term outlooks and our objectives of 2015. Our objective is to enable profitable growth for EDF, based on six key drivers. First of all, anticipating on the renewal of scales to be able to reveal with the significant churns due to retirements over the next coming years. The second driver &#x2013; I'll cover all the drivers, one after the other &#x2013; the second driver consists in capitalizing on know-how in R&amp;D, as well as in contractual engineering. Thirdly, investing in the power generation fleet at the network as it'll show that these investments create value even though we are talking about maintenance.</p>
          <p>Fourthly, continue the Group's selective development, more selectively. As the Chairman mentioned in his introduction, from now on we have investment criteria that are far more selective than in the past. Fifthly, reinforce financial solidity; and lastly, step up, transformation and synergy effortswith greater synergies within the group and more and more transformation.</p>
          <p>The first driver is a key challenge for our group, renewing skills, the need for us to anticipate. Let me give you one example in the field of production and engineering in France, from 2011 to 2015 there were more than 10,000 new hires, a net increase of our stock by 2,300, net of retirements. This is just one example, I could have taken many others, and of course we could spend much more time on this.</p>
          <p>But once again, I must point out that it is our key growth driver for profitable growth and it is a huge challenge for our group to enable skills to be renewed and the development of engineering capacities at the time when we will be conducting major growth projects abroad, in particular, and to supports the capitalization &#x2013; upon know-how abroad in particular. No need to invest to grow, to grow competitively. Growth will be based on an R&amp;D effort that will be intensified. Our R&amp;D budget is now &#x20AC;500 million per year, more or less, and we have 2,000 people working in our key research areas with three major areas for R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>First, the energy mix, carbon-free that is a nuclear, with one example, amongst many others, with respect to ageing materials and research. In renewable energies, there is one example amongst many others; there is research for example on new generation photovoltaic technologies to make them more competitive. The second key area for R&amp;D refers to networks at the time when we decentralized energy. There is more-and-more of a need for renewable energies. Smart meters, of course, in my frontiers the smart-grids in which we are investing significantly, more particularly in research and development.</p>
          <p>The third is main area is in energy demand management, energy efficiency and also the issue of the sustainable city to capitalize in know-how also means contractual engineering and partnerships. No need to invest to develop the group abroad by capitalizing on its know-how. A few example of this contract engineering and partnerships that Henri Proglio mentioned earlier in his presentation, in the field of delegated network management for instance with the MRSK agreement in Russia. We have a team who has been put in charge of improving the network efficiency and that's an excellent example of what could be done in terms of network improvement and I am sure there will be many more over the coming months.</p>
          <p>For example, second example in the U.S., where we manage 15 gig watts for a third party account in field of optimization and trading. This is a key success of EDFs trade in North America, that should continue expanding as well. In the U.S., we've also managed wind farms for a third party account, 4.8 gig watt are managed by enXco subsidiaries in the U.S.</p>
          <p>There again, we want to capitalize on the Group's expertise, and know how with that additional financial investments. And naturally, they will be project-by-project partnerships, the latest example being the Nam Theun 2 partnership in Laos that Proglio mentioned. I said one of our key drivers for medium-term growth is to continue investing in our nuclear generation and in our &#x2013; in the power plants and the networks.</p>
          <p>In France, our target is to multiply by two the maintenance CapEx over the period 2011, 2015, in all areas. 10 year inspection shut-downs and inspection visits what you know more &#x2013; the more we go with time, we're not looking &#x2013; looking at the 13,00 megawatt plans than the 11,00 that we're doing.</p>
          <p>We're also continue investing and replacing major components, as well the power plants operation.</p>
          <p>All of these investments, as I said, create value. First of all, because it enable us to anticipate on the extended live stand. As long as you change major components, you don't do that for just four or five years, you do it for several tens of years.</p>
          <p>Secondly, over the period, this type of capital investiture &#x2013; expenditures up to 2015, 2011 &#x2013; '18 will enable us to increase by approximately 400 megawatt hour capacity. This is the case for the 900 megawatt unit when we exchanged the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (45:40) that increased the generation output. Lastly, this CapEx are into the fact that we're intensifying preventive maintenance with the AP-913 plant, thereby improving the availability of our power plants and thereby a better plan, the maintenance shut down or anticipate on any possible failure.</p>
          <p>All of that while benefiting the &#x2013; from the best safety standards and secure extensions beyond the 40 years last plan. We also continue on our selective developments, every year we develop &#x20AC;1.4 billion to development CapEx and we will go from 4 to approximately 5 by 2015, due in particular to the CapEx power plant in nuclear power in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Our investment criteria are extremely strict measured in terms of value creation. 300 basis points versus the watt. In the other words, 300 basis points above the weighted average cost of capital, much stricter criteria above 150 basis points, so that we can now optimize the various management and operational support from the various corporate function.</p>
          <p>In view of this investment in maintenance, in development, in maintenance and network and plants, we plan to go from approximately &#x20AC;11 billion up to, let say, around &#x20AC;14 billion on average, while preserving the financial standards of our group.</p>
          <p>Thanks to control of our debt, that should remain below 2.5 billion, and thanks also and mostly to the high visibility of our cash flows. In our cash flows, we have regulated activities. We also have renewable businesses that are back to electricity &#x2013; long-term electricity sales contracts. We also benefit from the reforms on the French and British market, so that we can derisk if you will our investment, particularly restated by the new British government decision. As well as our improved financial ratings since the SPE has improved our rating from a, A+ to AA-.</p>
          <p>Final major driver enable us to deliver a profitable growth is &#x2013; and will involve intensifying the synergies and transformation of the group. Over the past 10 years city has gone through major transformations in our areas. Our intention is to continue these efforts based on three essential pillars, first of all procurement performance. Synergies, within the group, will be second driver. The group has expanded significantly abroad. We want to benefit capitalize from this size effect. And third driver will be a continuation of our operational excellence approach perfectly intergraded into Group that involve simplifying processes and ongoing search to improve our performance everywhere.</p>
          <p>Overall, our target is to reach accumulative gain on &#x20AC;2.5 billion in gains, between 2010, 2015 broken down as you see here on this slide, &#x20AC;600 million in gains from improved margins, &#x20AC;1.3 billion in improved sourcing, and &#x20AC;600 million in other gains. So this gains will be broken down as soon here. Where the 23% to be saved on support functions in IT, for instance, we already reduced our cost &#x2013; IT cost by 6%. That was a key challenge for us. On the right side here, you see that this is spread 50-50 between sourcing and synergies and operating performance.</p>
          <p>In sourcing, we have achieved considerable efforts by the group, we've centralized the sourcing. We've optimized the procurement. Our ambition with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (50:10), the leader is to become more anticipatory. Better definition of our need, industrial polices, with gains sights we expect an estimated and approximately &#x20AC;400 million. We want to also optimize our suppliers channel and we want to strengthen the execution of negotiated contracts, including all negotiated contracts for execution. This is a major gains target totaling 1.3 billion over the period.</p>
          <p>Synergies, we have a lot of projects in terms of synergies. I'll show you two examples. Abroad, for example in Poland, and Jean-Louis is here with us to reply to any questions you may have. In Poland, I remind you that, for the past ten years we've been present in Poland with 4,000 employees, &#x20AC;275 million in EBITDA. We are spread, basically, over the entire Polish territories with projects there. So you know there are good prospects in this country and of great interest for us.</p>
          <p>But there are also synergies to be gained in the current scope. This is just one example amongst many orders. We have developed the Shared Service Centers, based on EDF expertise that we have now relocated in Poland with centralized function. Synergies, overall, the estimated gains are to reach approximately &#x20AC;30 million by 2015, in Poland. Second example, is optimization in trading, and Emmanuel he is here with us, he also can reply to your question. In the field of optimization in trading there are several systems, and our competitors have several systems.</p>
          <p>The graphic illustration shows that some of our competitors are on the left. Trading optimization is centralized, our model is on the right side i.e. one local optimizer so that you can draw on the local expertise and skills and knowledge of local market; and a global leader or a global trader that can capitalize the group's power in terms of trading, so that we can generate significant synergies in this area by 2015, as well.</p>
          <p>This program is being rolled-out in all of our subsidiaries. This is what being done here in the green dots in subsidiaries, in terms of optimization in trading. In blue is ongoing, orange is what is planned for the future years. This is a highly structuring project for the group that should generate a lot of &#x2013; create and generate a lot of value.</p>
          <p>Let me talk now about our targets for 2015 based on these drivers that I have described in detail earlier. Our targets are -of profitable growth; by 2015, we continue with average annual EBITDA growth target of 4% to 6%, translated into net income average &#x2013; within average annual growth of this net income 5% to 10% and net debt EBITDA ratio x2.5 and payout ratio in the range of 55% to 65%.</p>

          <p>We have a number of written questions, just like at the shareholders' meeting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Chairman Proglio, a question about the extension of the lifespan of our power plants and on level of confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is difficult to give you any comment as you know regulations, of course, not that they are reassuring. The nuclear safety authorities, is the one who plans the extensions or authorization to extend, this is done plant-by-plant and for a 10-year period based on the 10-year inspections.</p>
          <p>Thus, we were granted the French Nuclear Safety Authority approval to extend the lifespan at  Fessenheim. We are very confident about being able to get such authorizations. We target 40 to 60 years extension per charges of 10 years and we're quite confident in our ability to get approval on this lifetime extensions, excuse me.</p>
          <p>So, if the question is how confident are you? I might say, yes, we are confident, but of course, we have to look at each site per times scale of 10 years and we have, yes, we are confident of our ability to convince the ASN to grant this extension approvals. So, yes, we are quite convinced of our ability to do so and we shall demonstrate as the permits are delivered over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, I will read two other written questions. Martin Young, again, question regarding the TaRTAM cost that I was mentioning earlier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The TaRTAM transition price is very complex. To sum it up, EDF is the obligation to indemnify &#x2013; it's competitive for the difference between your theoretical sourcing cost and the TaRTAM price which is set by regulations. Therefore, we're supposed to be paying the difference; traditionally every year we provision this cost based on forward anticipating that any operator could indeed take advantage of that. So, we've been provisioning that into our accounts and that was done at year end 2010.</p>
          <p>The gap and our feeling is that the sourcing cost is in excess of the coverage cost or hedging cost that we could have had if that policy had been continued by our competitors. So, this gap is significant for the group. &#x20AC;170 million is what we had not provisioned, so we've asked the CRE regulator to speed up their audits with our competitors so that we can get additional explanation in the second half. The TaRTAM mechanism is over, it's been closed since the first of July, but of course, EDF continues to be responsible of the cost of our competitors' policy and of course this is something that will be reviewed in the second half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Questions from the floor, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have three questions. First of all, you're reviewing your annual nuclear output targets upwards. You are also catching upon on Edison, 50 million for the year. Does that give you more comfort on the annual guidance, perhaps? I see that you are a bit shy here, a little bit, you are doing better slightly better than your annual growth rate in the first half year?</p>
          <p>On that midterm, you're basically giving us 4% to 6%, that's basically the annual guidance, yet you have a new cost reduction plan, approx. 1.2%, 1.3%, additional growth should be generated thanks to these gains. So, are your guidance not a little bit timid based on what you are doing and implemented?</p>
          <p>And the third question has to do with the hydropower concessions, they seemed to be postponed because of political issues, local and national. How long do you think this will be postponed, the renewal of the hydro concessions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll get back on the guidance 4% to 6% these are targets that we gave early this year within our ARENH price of &#x20AC;42. &#x20AC;42, we were able to get that as of the 1st of July 2012. First, January, excuse me, first of January 2012. Difference of &#x20AC;2 in the second half year, the ARENH price is &#x20AC;40 and that difference that &#x20AC;2 gap is costing us &#x20AC;70. Now, our competitors were asking for much more than what was planned initially based on this ARENH price.</p>
          <p>Delivery rate is 85% in excess of our estimates, which is also an additional cost; approximately &#x20AC;100 million is the total that this is costing us that is ARENH price-based deliveries. But, we will be offsetting that, thanks to what you mentioned: the synergy gains, higher output in nuclear power. So, this is why we keep our 4% to 6% targets, but we also want to remain cautious in terms of nuclear output.</p>
          <p>We had three 10-year inspection to make, we have three ongoing and three are still to be launched. Of course, that forces us to be very cautious, because of the planned maintenance shutdowns and that entire program. This is why we have to be cautious with the total nuclear output. On the mid-term, yes, our synergy and transformation plan will generation efficiency naturally, and as I mentioned earlier, one of key challenges is to renew our skills, therefore, we need to invest in skills and personnel.</p>
          <p>And that's why overall we set this 4% to 6% EBITDA growth rate for over the period 2011, 2015. As for the hydropower concessions, I really would not like to make any comments beyond what has been said. Let me just regarding the postponed renewals all I can say is that we are prepared, we are set, we have offers, we have great ambitions and great efforts are mobilized on the topic of hydro concession renewals. Other questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First half, we had lack of water flows in the hydro power plant. Can you give us an idea of how much that represented as a loss, particularly in view of the water fall that we've had since July, maybe with the rains we've had in July, could we expect to see a positive effect in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, yes. That hydropower gap has had its significant effect. Now, can we be more optimistic during the rainfall in July, my reply would be no, because what's important is to fill up your reservoir during the winter season, i.e., the first half year. So, we remain very cautious regarding the hydro output in the second half. However, yes, you're right that the rainfalls in July can reduce the threat of a heat wave, for example, or any drought, but I do not want to play weather forecaster.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>From Morgan Stanley, my first question relates to your vision for 2015, my question relates to the parameters you're using. The first parameter, the group market prices for electricity. Are you using assumptions for the forward prices for U.K. or France, or internal price assumptions?</p>
          <p>The second parameter, a nuclear production in France and U.K., could you quantify and give us a range in terawatt hours? And lastly, what could you tell us, and this is more tricky, about your assumptions regarding your philosophy regarding pricing or the ARENH?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on CapEx, you spoke of increasing from 1.9 to 3.5 for nuclear maintenance in France. Which amount of that release to preparing for the extension of the lifespan?. And for 2015, are you still comfortable with respect to the group share of net income? How confident are you with the wholesale market about 60 U.S. per megawatt hour in France, just above current forwards, in line with forward prices in the U.K.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't give any estimates for nuclear output for 2015 in France or the U.K., it's an overall objective that we have set and which we share with you. Similarly, I won't be very satisfactory in answering your third question regarding our pricing philosophy or changes in the ARENH pricing. These are decisions that are not up to us, it's up to public authorities. On the ARENH pricing, we will have a lot of talks on the formula, a formula that must take into account all of our costs of operations, CapEx, as well as remuneration on an economic basis, remuneration therefore of capital invested.</p>
          <p>Regarding the share of our maintenance expenses linked to the extension of lifetime, it's not that I don't want to you understand, but it's extremely difficult to answer that question. Because when you change a steam generator, you're preparing for the extension of lifetime, what portion of that change which is a major investments &#x20AC;200 when you do that? What portion of that investment will enable you to prepare for the future? I would say the full extent. What portion could avoid a short-term breakdown? It's also the entire portion. Once again, it is extremely difficult on these details to draw distinction in our CapEx programs of what prepares for the extension of lifetime or was only a matter of maintenance.</p>
          <p>But in general, we're preparing our plans for life extension, investments are made for that. That's what we can say. As from the analysis which is a portion of this linked to that decision and what's due to current maintenance, that's a bit complex in an industrial operation. But the group's philosophy is that all investments for the coming years are decided about and managed in view of the extension of the life span of all reactors for a 60-year period. On the last question, net income, the answer is yes. We still feel comfortable with that consensus of 3.3 billion net income for 2011.</p>

          <p>Hello sir, I'm from an Italian newspaper. As always, we'd like to find out more regarding negotiations in Italy on Edison. You're always a bit reluctant to give us more information. I would like to know in particular if the 15th September could be a deadline in terms of changes in Edison's plans from a technical perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't understand your answer question, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I apologize. I would like to know the date of the 15th of September is a deadline or could that be extended, that they be extended after that date, whether the date is contractual?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All contracts may be amended by riders but normally abide by a contract. So, we consider that the agreement will be complied with and the date will be upheld. In Italy, it's hard to make comments because the talks are not over yet. You know that our relations with A2A, our Italian partners, well, we have good quality relations.</p>
          <p>We had concluded the main guidelines of an agreement that's suitable to both parties and the Italian public authorities' reaction did not enable the agreement to be signed. So, clearly, I will not express myself more than that with respect to the public authorities' decisions because this is a very complex matter. We have ambitions for Edison as I said before,  major industrial ambitions, now we express that, as a matter of fact, it was well accepted in Italy by the public authorities and by our partners.</p>
          <p>I have no doubts that we will achieve this. But right now, I can't tell you more, because we don't have in our hands the answers. So, this is the situation, one of uncertainty that is still continuing. Our vision is clear, once again, and I hope that the decision will be taken, so that Edison, which needs it, will have our better visibility regarding its future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I am from UniCredit. To come back to pricing, now we have the NOME law that was adopted, the way it was voted, if I understand in fact, it implies a convergence of residential tariffs that wasn't necessarily in the initial project, initial bill and the pricing this year dissociated residential from industrials.</p>
          <p>So my first question is, can you confirm a convergence between residential tariffs for 2015 is still to be maintained? If that were the case and if you use your assumptions for the historical nuclear costs, what will be the required increases on the residential segment for the next five years?</p>
          <p>Now, we know this is a very political issue and it may be difficult to voice your opinion on this, but instead of speaking about a scenario where we will be setting historical costs of nuclear, but if we were to talk about how residential tariffs may be challenged and if we imagine that it's at 40 today and we have 42 for ARENDH in 2015, what will be the increases in residential tariffs for you, 3% to 4% per year? Would that be realistic in your opinion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't want to use any assumptions, we'll take things that are certain. 42, that's certain, it's not an assumption. Whereas, let's talk about things that are clear. Secondly, you said it yourself, it's a political issue. The prices are regulated in France. You can understand that's a bit difficult for me to give any visibility on prices instead of a government, which would be prior to taking any decisions. That would be a bit, well, surprising in terms of each parties' role, so I will not go there.</p>
          <p>You speak about convergence or the ability to challenge pricing. It's a very political issue. The tariffs should be set by the government up to 2015. To ask me to give you an answer for the government regarding pricing, ,well, let's be very clear, the talks were held on the NOME law concerned the full economic costs of historical nuclear plants in France, because the law required us to provide the competitors 20% of our power generation capacity over a 15-year period. It was therefore legitimate for the company to ask for the disposal price to competitors to be the full economical cost of the historical facilities.</p>
          <p>This is how the law was adopted; this is a country where normally we abide by laws. By application of the law as adopted, the government has decided a first disposal price as of the 1st of July 2011 of &#x20AC;40 and &#x20AC;42 as of 1st of January 2012. Logically, these changes in this transfers price should enable the company to be offset for the full costs by 2015. That is the issue. That's the only issue with respect to the implementation of this law, so it'd be natural to move from &#x20AC;42 to &#x20AC;46 at the end of this transition period.</p>
          <p>But that's the only answer I can give you. As regards the transfer price of nuclear, I'll put to our competitors. As regards tariffs and tariffs for residential customers, that's up to the government and I will not voice any opinion on that because, furthermore, it's a very complex matter taking into account differential tariffs, enabling access to electricity for some fellow citizens who deserve us to facilitate their access to electricity and also decisions that are up to the government. I will not permit myself to anticipate on decisions in that respect, that's all I can tell you.</p>
          <p>My only position is that it is legitimate that in application of the law, the transfer price to EDF's competitors by EDF should be compliant with pricing trends that enable the company at the end of the transition period derived at the transfer price that is complaint with the full economic cost. Let me seize this opportunity to answer a few written questions.</p>

          <p>The second question for Mr. Pierre. Why is it that our nuclear production objective of the second half in France is stable as compared to the first half of 2011 according to Mr. Pierre calculation I said before? Because we have more program shut downs in the first half and the second half, six to 10 year inspections versus three in the previous period. Last question, what potential impact in the medium-term forecast of the loss of our hydro-power concessions?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have no plans to lose in the hydro-power concessions and this is why I can't give you any estimate of our &#x2013; of the impact. But, of course they won't earn them all since we have to pay a small royalty, to figure that's not the IT set to schedule to have a marginal impact on our EBITDA offers over the medium-term.

          <p>I'm from BNP Paribas and I have three questions. First of all, linked to rating. You planned to maintain your rating and your rating was upgraded by one step. Would it be evaluated to down to A plus or do you like it go up to A minus.</p>
          <p>Secondly, regarding the cost of a new power plant &#x2013; for the power plants price in the U.K. given the slight gap in terms of the cost in Flamanville and your objective of profitability that were increasing. What quality you see full cost of a nuclear plant today in the U.K? Thirdly, could you tell us how you calculate the formula for the total economic cost in France?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For rating we plan to maintain our ratings standalone. For the full cost of the British nuclear, we had at Investors Day dedicated to that on the 17th of December 2010, where we pointed out the expected return of 10% minimum, no need to change that criteria.</p>
          <p>All of that will be updated in autumn in subject to what <mark type="indiscernible" /> (79:08) tell us. With respect to the formula as known today these are principles in trend in the normal low to the end of 2010. You spoke about covering our cost and investments and spoke of initial cost of capital amongst the economic ambitions.</p>
          <p>First, what's essential for us is first to capitalize on, or to value in the French nuclear plant and this economic value and not this book value, which will be meaningless in terms of determining a cost price for one of our company. Above and beyond these principals and trying in the law, I have nothing further to tell you about that. This is the third and last point to be clarified with respect to the reform of the French electricity market.</p>

          <p>I am from JPMorgan. Three questions, with respect to 2015 you spoke of tariffs which are determined by government, could you use assumption that the profit if use in your &#x2013; tend to be conservative or you have a safety module with respect to our theoretical path with the converges between the ARENH and the full costs of nuclear or versus the low portion of the ARENH tariffs? Secondly, you have not spoken about the 80% of the coefficient &#x2013; availability coefficient factor? And thirdly, in the 2.5 billion of operational gains with respect to 2010 what about your expectations of in terms of improvement in nuclear output especially there availability factor or are these two points totally separate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Mr. Proglio said we have not comments to make on changes in tariffs. We have set our objectives 46% growth in EBITDA, that is our commitment and there you have it. We have no extra comments to make or no links or simulations or any assumptions to comment upon for reasons that you can certainly understand.</p>
          <p>Regarding the availability factor there at present for us to call it a question our objectives to reach 85% of availability by replacing the main components, by properly managing program shut-downs. You have seen that -- we have seen impacts in the first half, and thanks to preventive maintenance as I pointed out earlier, so that we can achieve this anticipated level of 85%.</p>
          <p>Also because ASN will submit its report on the consequences of Fukushima at the end of the year, the nuclear safety operator, and there is no point in us to talk about the consequences to continental aspect, but our analysis will change. With respect to the &#x20AC;2.5 billion, now there is nothing with respect to the availability factor as synergy and performance program, optimizing costs with the remarkable performance of our program was including in the margin with respect to our normal operations.</p>

Can you tell us, what are your objectives in solar at the level of efficiency you would like to achieve? And the financial impact that they ultimately have on your financial statements. You also spoke about delegating maintenance and engineering. What sales figures would you like to achieve in that business, would it be a supplementary business or full business in the medium or long-term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the idea is not to create a new activity you've driven a new batch. The idea is just to cascade our current experience on broader contract base. In other words rather than systematically being operator an owner, the idea is to enlarge, to extend opportunities for growth less demanding on our balance sheet, and,while being more -are being operative, and so this provider, in other words, deliver supply our scales and expertise to government, or regions, who would finance the infrastructure and would entrust to us design and build, design and build, design and operate under long-term contracts, referring to ONM concession type contracts.</p>
          <p>Couple of contracts that could be spread out into various countries of the world. So its &#x2013; both are actually broadening the potential for group expansion. Without being demanding on investment that is keeping capital expenditures to upgrading and all our support and some investors made by the concession makers. And basically to continue our international development in a forum that would be adapted to this type of services, that's what we've done with networks with the major contract in Siberia with MRKS in Russia.</p>
          <p>ERDF in terms to continue its international expansion in major geographic areas, highly densely populated areas, using its expertise in imaging that investing in the ownership or networks and regions like that is not our first priority and certainly would not be ERDF or EDS priority goal. So, there again, it's just a way of applying our expertise rather than creating a new division. We are not going to identify within the group since we're talking with the same skills and expertise that would be delivering growth potentials for public service delegations or those services that will develop activities or businesses for own account.</p>
          <p>The idea is to open up the contractual system to new horizons opening up new geographic horizons as well, that would not be accessible in the absence of such an approach. As for quantifying CapEx or targeting sales revenue, that's not really our goal. What we target is sustainable growth. The growth of the economic performance will be more dependant on our results than our sales revenue.</p>
          <p>There are some revenues that maybe low but yet that have a strong potential for enrichment, if only in terms of return on feedback on experience and expertise. And then you have high revenues with very low profit margins, so there is a mix there. In any case, the group defines itself in its industrial dimension and expertise with a strategy based on developing, cascading and expanding the application of this expertise broader geographically and on the longer term. The group has a responsibility towards the challenges to have a good return on investment and to create shareholders value. And as for sales revenue, well, it will be what it would be. But the group does not ambition necessarily to base its vision only based on sales revenue.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We saw a slide on that presenting the model of that area and implemented to link up its French activities and EDF trading. It's what we call the EDF way. Major principle in fact because it empowers the management teams and it splits the optimization activities where you close your position from taking positions mainly a trader's activity.</p>
          <p>One of the competing model there are three or four models on the market but the competing model on the left all of these activities are mixed-up meaning that you cannot give clear incentives or major the performance of local activities of generation, and of distribution separate from optimization and this model from our standpoint present a major drawback namely the local &#x2013; the markets are very specific locally in terms of liquidity, organization, market design and we're not seeing very quickly any kind of harmonization of market rules in Europe and this is why the model that we have and that we are proposing should be much more efficient.</p>
          <p>In terms of synergies, estimated synergies for this model should reach approximately &#x20AC;50 million to &#x20AC;60 million annually, that we should reach by 2015. And this will result from the roll out of our EDF rate program regionally in countries where we have not yet set it up as well on commodity &#x2013; commodities market because all commodities are treated by the Group in France and mobilized by the Group in France are managed under this system.</p>
          <p>While in other countries will start with the easiest things as spot market for electricity and we'll spread it out. So, our target is by 2015 to have implemented these principals, so that in the future this entire double entry charge should only have green dots.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question from Societe Generale <mark type="ph" />. Three questions, what happened at Dalkia in the first half year, is it linked to the announcement that was made this morning by the OEI environment? Second question, could you clarify your strategy in the U.S.? Third question, that would we streamline, what is your strategy in terms of external growth in acquisitions, have you identified any kind of markets where you want to go or go back? I'm thinking about Germany, in particular.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question of Dalkia, we have exceptional expense for loss of value for Dalkia International and that is it affects primarily Italy. In Italy, Dalkia has a new management team and they really find a strategy since late last year. They concluded with necessary to exit from a number of low profit activities, meaning that we review the growth prospects in that country, and that is a reason we had to reflect this also value for this half year in line with accounting principles. When you have new elements, we have to revise the value of our assets at 4.5 year accounts. We're getting the U.S. announced strategy there.</p>
          <p>I'll talk it today is to pursue the expansion of the Group, backed by all other skills and expertise that are numerous in the U.S. With enXco in the U.S., we have over 400 people working on renewable energy, wind power and solar power, backed by optimization and trading activities as well. I've shown you that we also have a team out there doing optimization for third party accounts and that business is very valuable with major growth prospects.</p>
          <p>We're already managing nearly 15,000 megawatt for third party accounts. This is what you see here on this slide. We have ability to intervene throughout the usage, taking advantage of arbitrators in the various markets, and thanks to our teams &#x2013; know-how we are talking about remarkable optimization. Lastly, in nuclear power at a time when Exelon and Constellation are currently emerging, our strategy is to ensure that all synergies can be achieved and that they are in within CENG. All synergies on that generation, asset base, this is what we've got involved in the merger of project in the U.K &#x2013; excuse me in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We have highly constructive talks with all stakeholders; all of this in the perspective of pooling all of our support functions and development functions. So that we can fully capitalize our strength for all of these businesses in the U.S., something that is perfectly achievable, particularly with renewable energy since we own 100% of the enXco renewable subsidiary in the U.S. In terms of external growth and acquisition, I can say is that the targets that I announced this morning are primarily industrial organic growth. But, in terms of industrial growth strategy, we have identified number of projects. But as I said we have highly selective investment criteria and that is the very basis of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Now, we will not ignore anything and it's our duty to see what is going on in the industry worldwide. But, once again, the requirements for profitability and financial solidity for the Group are prerequisites; and naturally, beyond that we shall not comment on any specific details, we may have in terms of targets, east or west of the world. I think as you've seen concern almost exclusively organic growth naturally. If by any chance we were to consider an external growth operation, that would be over and above the figures that we've presented this morning.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Question from <mark type="indiscernible" /> (95:19). Can you clarify or update the provisions for end of life, could decommission and spend few processing, give us a breakdown. In that respect do you feel that what the Cour de Comptes, the French Administrate Court or Accounting Court is working on, do you feel that maybe detrimental to you? Could you also comment your talks ongoing with Landell group regarding the storage project in Born ? Lastly, could you give us the impact of the synergy and transformation program on the annual EBITDA by 2015?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding nuclear provisions they involve various components, of course. Maybe we can show this slide again. So, you see, we have a total of &#x20AC;28.6 billion, including provisions for spent fuel, 8.9 billion, treatment of spent fuel, provisions for long-term management of radioactive waste, &#x20AC;6.5 billion and that figure includes the deep storage projects in Landell that you mentioned. Provisions for decommissioning of nuclear power point, 11.2.  And last core, that is the fuel bags at the core of the plant at the end of its lifespan. So, a total of &#x20AC;28.6 billion including 11.2, 6.5 and part of the 11.2 is covered by regulatory obligation to constitute a portfolio of dedicated assets.</p>
          <p>However, questions relate the level of these provisions I would imagine and the question on the audit carried out by the Cour de Comptes. This provisioning level is reviewed and audited constantly by statutory auditors based on peers and based on estimates that we have for dismantling, based on our own experience. As manufacturers we are currently decommissioning and dismantling some power plants.</p>
          <p>You heard about the recent announcement of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (97:43). But we also have international benchmarks that give us a lot of comfort on this level of provisioning. Now, obviously you are seriously Landell and the deep storage. These calculations were based on the budget that was defined Landell. We don't have any additional budget or a different budget. We are waiting for another estimate by late 2012 and we have full fledged stakeholder in the context of ongoing legal and regulatory obligation to find any solution to look at any kind of solutions so that we can stick with the budget, but once again there will be no future review of the estimate until late 2010.</p>

          <p>Question from the floor, Reuters. Recently, Arriba announced that the cost of the additional safety measures for nuclear power plant could reach up to &#x20AC;100 or &#x20AC;200 million per plant. Does that estimate look adequate to you?</p>
          <p>Second question, regarding the EPR at Poly or whether the project, do you think that project is still needed? Can you tell us how far you are in terms of considerations and any timescale or calendar on this project?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding the announcement made by Arriba, well, Arriba that's quite natural for any kind of industrialist. Arriba is showing proposals, saying what would I intend to do if that type of work in the context of this or that. All I can say is that, of course, this does not commit us in any way. And even though I can understand that kind of approach.</p>
          <p>But secondly, our estimates are done quite naturally by taking into account our own estimates on investments made in terms of maintenance and extension of the lifespan of power plant. We can't break down whatever is linked to safety measures specifically in the post-Fukushima area.</p>
          <p>It is, of course, our obligation to make sure that our investment guarantee the safety regardless of what has happened, and that is &#x2013; these are the assumptions used to calculate our figures. As for orientations to be taken by the ASN or the French Nuclear Safety Authority, let's wait and see what they say.</p>
          <p>Our responsibility to a nuclear barge is like in any other areas. And wherever we are, France, U.K., or elsewhere, is to provide the safety and security of our facilities overtime sustainable and under the strictest standards. And that is why we have provisioned the necessary investments in our accounts. That is basically the only answer I can give you.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Poly EPR project, obviously, it's ongoing, as you know there are number of enquiries, investigations going on, so let's just wait and see for that procedure to go ahead without trying to anticipate anything for the future.

          <p>There seems to be an increased in unplanned outages, so we in order to understand the level for next year, when we look at the 10-year inspection reviews, we could expect a net positive boost effect as compared with 2011. Since you will have less of this 10 years maintenance shutdowns, perhaps 1%or 2% might be the positive impact?</p>

          <p>Yes, this year we'll have nine inspection visit against five last year, next year we will have six of this 10 years inspections. And because this year we'll have four more than last year it's costing us 1.4 &#x2013; 1.5 points in KD factor. Last year, we'll have more normal number of 10-year inspections, so mechanically we should be able to benefit from this additional availability.</p>
          <p>Also means that while keeping an objective of stable KD factor at 78.5 similar to last year, it means that the intrinsic availability of the facilities has actually improved 1.5 points in 2011, with better management of the shutdowns and replacement of the major components. And you're right in 2012, mechanically, we can expect 1.5 additional points in availability simply since, because there will be less 10-year inspection shutdowns.</p>

          <p>Question from Bloomberg. First question addresses the U.K. do you think that you will need to have now support of subsidies from the government, and do you have increase cost for the EPR that you have experience in Flamanville for instance?</p>
          <p>The second question, well, why don't you reply to this first question, because I have lost my train of thought on the floor?</p>

          <p>Reform of electricity market in the U.K. now, the principle of it is not to have the customer bare the responsibility of the operator and builder in terms of debt lines and cost. The purpose is to guarantee a certain stability and predictability both for investors and for customers on the revenue linked to the electricity output. That is the purpose of that reform.</p>
          <p>So, our responsibility is to control our cost, to commit ourselves, to make sure that we can secure revenues to have to keep good control over the construction cost as well; and in return the British Government will look at in &#x2013; at the different contracts and then the British Government based on carbon prices and cost prices and so on.</p>
          <p>We'll make a commitment on a straight price &#x2013; over is &#x2013; length of time could be 15 to 20 years. So the mechanism planned by the British Government is intended to provide stability on prices, both for investor &#x2013; the investors and the customer, it's a win-win mechanism really. It is not a mechanism that would enable us to pass through to the client any surplus cost in terms of the construction cost toward others.</p>

          <p>My second question regards the Atnea projects. Do you think that it will see the light of day and do you think that it is really adapted to the 1,000 megawatt reactor as you have at EDF?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Reactors are 1,000 megawatt EPAs, EPRs, CPR 1000. I mean, if we were starting to detail all these different reactors...</p>
          <p>Well, Atnea is a process that was initiated by Arriba, has the merit of existing. Now, our corporation was Arriba is strengthening and among other, we ambitioned to add or to integrate into our review, 81,000 megawatt reactor that would be adapted to the needs of customers that are geographically differentiated and that will demand technologies that are suitable for their own needs, with industrial partnerships that are also diversified and we have taken a clear orientation towards these technologies. Now recently, together with Arriba and as in <mark type="indiscernible" /> (110:53) probably will tell you more about it. But we had discussion with Arriba regarding projects that are currently being investigated.</p>
          <p>I can not give you any final judgment on this or that type of reactor model. We are not builders of reactors, we are operators. We're very much aware as &#x2013; of our responsibility as a leader of this nuclear French industry, and we are working in close cooperation with all partners in the industry to enable them to secure the best opportunities for development throughout the world. And that is a topic that is currently being investigated and discussed. And I can not discuss it from an industrial set perspective about this or that type of reactor. It depends on the typology of the clients as much as the typology of the industry operator's concerned.</p>

          <p>I am from ENSA. Two questions of Edison. You spoke about the public authorities that planned the first agreement. Do you think that could happen again or can you make sure that it won't take place? Secondly, would you be ready to let an Italian takeover the Chairman ship of Edison, of what argent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question is quite surprising. I don't see why we would forbid an Italian to be the Chairman of Edison. Easily that person was confident. The first question is not up to me to make any prognosis, like to guess what the public authorities will plan to do their contracts that are &#x2013; have been signed and so far, but they are all well intentioned.</p>
          <p>But once again, I won't speak for the Italian public authorities is for the public authorities to speak for themselves and you will certainly understand that it give the agitation at present on the markets; the landscape, is a bit agitated today around the world to be it in Europe or even in Italy. And amongst the priorities this has not been viewed as &#x2013; been a greater priority than others.</p>
          <p>Well, once again, we have made proposals, we proposed an industrial action plan in the best interest of Edison, Italy. That's all I can say. And they will abstain from any comments on the reactions of the Italian Public Authorities are waiting for them, to make their announcements. We have heard comments by members of government. We seemed to have understood or taken on Board our proposals in their studies.</p>

          <p>Our question &#x2013; the series that Friesenheim one and two maybe shutdown after the stress tests or because the steel, the floor that cannot be reinforced the &#x2013; the concrete force cannot be reinforced well now there is no problem there. And is not up to me to comment on stress test. Let me repeat quite simply, because each this time I hear this type of question, my answer can only be the same. Don't you even imagine for a second that EDF or our Group, in general, can take any risks regarding safety to keep our plant up and running if it does not meet the criteria for safety for over 10 years? That's the only answer I can give to that question.</p>
          <p>Now, supervisory- by this including the French Nuclear Safety Authorities, if they ensure the criteria for itself, if nuclear plant is nothing more natural than that. That's my answer, no, I cannot imagine for a second that Friesenheim maybe shutdown, because it is my responsibility to siege with that pleasant time person is that the highest level of safety, so as, to guarantee safety for our fellow citizens and that is our responsibility from day one and that will continue to be our responsibility and our number one mission. Much more than economic rational is the responsibility of a Group such as EDF, a Group shouldering a strong responsibility in the public service. That's the one answer I can give you.</p>
