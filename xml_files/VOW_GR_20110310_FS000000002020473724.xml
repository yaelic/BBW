          <p>Yes. I'd like to welcome you. Dr. Neumann is going to join us later. Everybody else is already here this morning. Professor Winterkorn and Mr. P&#xF6;tsch in detail explained our strategy and the development of our business to you, and now I think the analysts and investors might have a number of questions and we'd like to answer your questions now.</p>
          <p>And that is why I'll ask to ask you &#x2013; to ask your questions; and please also ask in, for instance, English and wait until somebody takes the microphone to you and please give us your name so that we can understand what your question is about. And we start with Mr. Breitsprezur.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Breitsprezur from Macquarie. I have a number of questions. On China, for instance, you so &#x2013; you had mentioned the operating profit and can you tell us something about the share of the turnover and the Abbott share for China and Porsche Holding Salzburg. Can you tell us something about world revenues, you mentioned that, but on profitability, for instance, of the business in the last year?</p>
          <p>Then, commodity prices, you appeared very relaxed and said that you did not expect any significant negative effect here. Other manufacturers named figures as &#x20AC;700 million for instance, was what Daimler said. Could you give us the concrete figure here perhaps? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First commodities and raw material prices, we're relaxed but cautious. What was said this morning was that we will have foreseeable effects in 2011, but that we actually control the risk. We have introduced a number of measures which are currently being implemented. Also, we have long term agreements with our suppliers, with a large of number of suppliers, plus suppliers with commodities; and we're working on measures, namely, cut in product costs to compensate for the higher commodity price, and that is why we're saying that we are having the risk under control for 2011 and we have long term agreements and contracts and they will actually also allow us to stay on track in 2012.</p>
          <p>To give you an exact figure is irrelevant, because what do you want to do with the figure? We've taken measures and we're trying to compensate for the market risk with these measures. These have been introduced and we do not expect any negative effects worth mentioning in 2011.</p>
          <p>Then I can continue with the China business. In China, we had 100% basis for a &#x20AC;30 billion turnover. You know that the margins are not something that we explain in detail, but we have a clear double-digit margin business in China and do not expect this to change.</p>
          <p>Porsche Holding Salzburg; here we had a turnover of something more than &#x20AC;10 million &#x2013; something above &#x20AC;10 billion &#x2013; billion, and turnover and profit <mark type="audio gap" /> that is respectable for a trading company. And the effect for &#x2013; on the income statement in 2011 means that we also need to consider allocation effects.</p>
          <p>It's a trading company, and because of that the allocation of purchase price components will have to relate to assets which have a relatively rapid turnover. So that the result for the first year will only be a slightly positive result, but the advantages that, starting from 2012, a considerable part of the earnings will be shown, because the write-off on the allocation effects will decrease very quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here's a question from Mr. Woonrow and then Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Woonrow from BS Bank. The earnings bridge, which you showed in the presentation will &#x2013; allows one to assume that in 2010 &#x20AC;2.8 billion burden was on the earnings, because of run-up costs. How much of that will disappear in 2011? And what would be the end of sale deriving from that? Second question on China, what is the dividend you expect from the entity for the past year just ended?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on the swing in the fixed costs comparing 2010 with 2011 &#x2013; &#x20AC;2.8 billion, well here two effects actually play a major role. One effect is the new structures as they emerge. We actually talk about that. That increases the fixed costs, but that's not necessarily negative. We need capacities if we want to realize the increase in volumes in the new markets.</p>
          <p>As a second effect, that's the depreciation of capitalized development costs, previously capitalized development costs; and in the notes to the report you'll find information on that. The basis for the impairment was a very conservative one. In 2011 the value here shouldn't &#x2013; or this amount, the amount in question, should not occur to this height.</p>
          <p>China dividend; you know that what we were able to receive was a three-digit dividend, and this is not to change in 2011. In 2010 we had a one-off effect, so dividend from China also in a three-digit figure in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam Hoe, and then, Mr. Schterma, and then, Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hoe from West OB. Three questions. Firstly, on the inventories, we understand that the inventories at your dealers are quite low. Just give us maybe some magnitude of that. Is that three, four percentage points relative to overall sales? I need to fill the pipeline a bit there.</p>
          <p>And then just thinking overall in terms of revenues, you've talked about you're beating customer deliveries globally. Maybe, I guess, a bit of a mix impact. And then you've got potential Audi to fill up that pipeline &#x2013; fill-up. Can we be expecting 10% plus revenues?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the VW brand in the Q4 EBIT number, you showed &#x20AC;58 million growth in EBIT year-on-year on revenues up 19%, &#x20AC;3.4 billion year-on-year. So you've got a very big increase in revenues, not really coming through in the margin. Maybe just give us some indication what happened in Q4 for the VW brand and whether you should be expecting the brand EBIT in full year 2011 up?</p>
          <p>And then finally, just very simply on Bentley. You mentioned some of the reasons for the Q4 loss earlier, a &#x20AC;245 million loss for the full year at EBIT. Can we expect to break even in '11 or is that too early? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me first talk about stocks. We clearly have to say here that we are below ideal stock levels. This refers primarily to finished products and I must be very clear here in saying that we have to go outside of our normal calculations and take into account the situation at dealerships because they too have stocks of finished products that are too low. So this refers to basically nearly all markets and regions, or rather market regions, and we can definitely say that it's something that we might call, if we were to use numbers, &#x20AC;1 billion to &#x20AC;2 billion.</p>
          <p>Then your second question. As we said in our outlook, we're going to increase revenue in 2011. It's too early to make precise statements about that, but the mix, the product mix, we believe, will play a favorable role in this regard. In terms of country mix, things will be pretty much balanced because in positive countries, we'll have a profit contribution that's above average, and things will develop favorably there.</p>
          <p>But of course, our sales volume in countries which still &#x2013; and this will change in the next few years, but which still are below average, they too will improve. So that means that the situation will remain more or less balanced. As I just said, we believe it's too early to make any &#x2013; to provide any concrete figures.</p>
          <p>And then with regard to revenue in the fourth quarter; well, every quarter we do our calculations on a rolling basis and we look at our provision item, it adjusts &#x2013; adjusted all the time. And beyond that, we do impairment tests, as well. And, in fact, we did this in Q4, as well.</p>
          <p>So of course, we can say that the repercussion of a positive development in terms of key personnel provisions is there, which means that the next year you can pay bonuses. And this, of course, this effect is felt in the fourth quarter, so that means we have got a number of one-off items in Q4 that we've seen reflected in our accounts. And so that means it's a typical effect for Q4, but you'll see that the margin level should not be measured against the baseline of Q4. Rather, you should look at the average for 2010 to compare what happens in the next quarter, in Q1 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to Bentley, I would like to reiterate that we see a combination of difficult economic development, in particular in the luxury segment, combined with one-off expenditures in that very phase at Bentley, in that very phase of economic development. So, that means that we've got a combination of negative effects here that we're seeing reflected in 2011, rather, in 2010. And so, for 2011, we believe that the situation could improve considerably. Whether it will be sufficient to allow us to get back in the black with that brand is something that's too early to say, but I don't want to rule it out altogether.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Then I believe it was Mr. Schterma and then Horst Schneider, and then Mr. Punzet. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Schterma, IS Automotive, used to be Global Insight. I have a question about the breakdown of the increase in operating earnings. You had a factor volume mix price &#x20AC;4.6 billion that you told us about. Can you break that down according to the contribution from volume mix and then prices?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, it's a more general question for Mr. Winterkorn. You said that the stakeholders for the company are the workers, the shareholders and the company, but you didn't mention suppliers. So how is that supposed to be understood? You're very proud of your cost cuts, so how are we supposed to interpret that from the point of view of a supplier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you know the one-off effects on operating results are not commented on or broken down, but I'd like to point out that the &#x2013; this effect, by far, is from volume, volume development. There is a limited contribution from the mix that consists of a positive product mix and a negative country mix. Let me point out the situation in Germany, that plays a major role of course, and we have a positive effect from prices.</p>
          <p>Mr. Schterma, you're right. I just checked that. I forgot that. It wasn't deliberate on my part to forget to mention the suppliers. It really was just something that just slipped my mind. I do want to say that, and Mr. Garcia can talk about our suppliers in a minute too, but our relationship with suppliers is very good, both in terms of development, engineering. We've got a lot of engineering suppliers, that's the one side of things.</p>
          <p>And then of course in terms of volumes, well Mr. Garcia is a customer that our suppliers really like a lot, because last year we purchased parts for another 1 million cars. So I can say that we have a good relationship with our suppliers, particularly since, and this is a very important point, since with our modular strategy and our platform strategy, we of course are achieving lots of synergy with our suppliers. We're talking about the modular longitudinal, modular transverse system, new drivetrain, powertrain strategy and so on. So if you talk to European suppliers today, then I'm persuaded that they will say that there top customer nowadays is Volkswagen. Mr. Garcia, maybe you can say something about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, share of value-added from suppliers is 60%, 70%. So that means the suppliers are a major, a core aspect of our production process and sales process. And then point two, I believe that the success we've had in terms of costs would not have been possible without our suppliers. Of course there are always certain conflicts here. We're not a club focusing on harmony, but that's just the nature of things. Nevertheless, as Dr. Winterkorn just said, we do have a very good relationship with our suppliers because at the end of the day we do have a difficult &#x2013; we can be a difficult, but we are above all a reliable partner.</p>
          <p>We're growing. We're growing in markets which are being established today for tomorrow. And for suppliers, the best type of growth and with the least risk is with VW in countries like China, India, United States, South America too. Obviously they can come along with us because they're bringing a customer with them, so to speak. So the investment risk for suppliers is lower therefore, and that can already cover some of their fixed costs. So, for us, the advantage is we can work with known suppliers. We know them, they know our processes, they know our requirements and they know our quality too.</p>
          <p>So, of course, it's not a club that is focusing on harmony, there are conflicting interests. Each party has a different interest, of course. But, I can really underscore what Dr. Winterkorn said; by and large we are once again a difficult but a predictable and a reliable partner and customer. And we do provide them revenues. And we have our modular strategy that we have established with the help of our suppliers and this is a very effective production model, and that's an advantage for them too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst Schneider, HSBC. Good afternoon, I have a couple questions. First of all with regard to the statement about 2011 that your earnings and revenues will go up, now what should we use there as orientation? My concrete example is &#x2013; question is this, fourth quarter or 2010 as a whole for orientation? Thanks for an answer to that.</p>
          <p>And then, secondly, Q1, you said that there will be &#x2013; could be an increase in Q1 over Q4. If I look at deliveries to customers in January and February they look quite impressive, so my question is vehicle sales different, because if I understand things correctly, you held back with some sale &#x2013; deliveries to customers in Q4 so that means &#x2013; in early December &#x2013; so that means we might see a less than average vehicle sales increase, and then the next thing, the modular strategy that's been mentioned.</p>
          <p>Well, it &#x2013; more play a role in 2011, but in 2012, for the very first time, we're going to be talking about the effects. And we all heard about the reduction in cost per vehicle, so I'd be interested in hearing this. Is this &#x2013; is an effect that we will tangibly feel in 2012, or will 2012 be like a transition year in this regard? Because for the first time, you have to book costs upfront and the revenues will not be coming in for the new platform until later on.</p>
          <p>And in this context, I'd like to ask the following; last year, in Q1, you told us about your medium term target, your mid-term targets and I think you achieved them already in Q3. So can you give us an update on that? It might be important for the organization, too, to have news from you. Okay. From here, we've got to increase things once again. I'd be thankful for information on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd like to begin with 2011. Mr. Schneider, I can't really take all the work off your shoulders, the work that's your responsibility. I can really do my best to help you out, maybe. And I think I already did this to a sufficient extent, actually. I think it's right to orient your ideas toward 2010 and that's what our statement for 2011 is based on. We said very clearly here that our key performance indicators, unit sales, revenue, operating earnings, are to be surpassed. We want to surpass all of those, as we said.</p>
          <p>Now, with regard to a breakdown in the parameters and looking at just the first quarter well, I think you've just got to look at the period that you're covering in terms of revenue per car. I don't think things will be poor here, but there might be shifts. As you know, we don't have targets based on three-month periods, based on quarters. We have a clear opinion on this. We think it's a waste of time. There are other things for us to do. And so this type of thing is always affected by certain coincidences, but once again, let me say you will see a very strong first quarter.</p>
          <p>Then with regard to our modular strategy, well, I have to correct what you said there slightly. Without being too verbose here, because I don't know whether all of you have booked a room here in Wolfsburg; nevertheless, let me point out two, three things:</p>
          <p>As you know, we use three major modular systems. And I'd like to refer to just two now to make sure it doesn't last too long here. First of all, we have our modular longitudinal system that is the basis for most of our Audi cars. And then we have the modular transverse system, which is the basis for most front-wheel drive cars; that is cars with a transverse engine.</p>
          <p>Now you focused on the modular transfer system, MQB, and you know that in 2012 the first of these cars will be rolling off the lines. I would like to say you shouldn't forget that one thing that will be part of our performance in 2011 will be the further spread of the use of our modular longitudinal system. And here I'd like to remind you that the A8, for instance, will only be available this year for the whole year, and we just launched the A7, and we're now just launching the A6. So that means at Audi, for instance, we're going to see a major effect from this, the longitudinal system.</p>
          <p>And at Volkswagen too, we shouldn't underestimate things, even though it's not from the modular transfer system; because, of course, we've done our best to take advantage of what we can from PQ 35, the previous modular system. So basically what I'd like to get across here is this: each and every year we are making a major profit contribution from our modular systems.</p>
          <p>2012 will, nevertheless, usher in a new era; that is the era of the modular transfer system, MQB. And, in terms of volumes, there will be numerous cars coming down the pipeline on that basis, and no doubt this MQB has generated upfront costs. So that means 2012 we won't see the full effect of it, but rather after 2012, it'll be 2013 and 2014 when we see the positive impact going up, because we're talking about volumes of up to 4 million units that will be based on this system, this modular transfer system. So that means the full effect will only be felt later on as more and more models are built on this basis.</p>
          <p>But, once again, let me say the bottom line is each and every year we're going to be seeing a significant performance improvement that is only possible because of this; first of all, because of one-off effects. Have a look at 2010 for this. I think you see it very clearly there. And then, secondly, direct costs, unit costs, with the modularization. It would not be possible to achieve these levels otherwise.</p>
          <p>Then with regard to medium-term objectives, Mr. Schneider; well, as the term indicates, they are medium term or midterm objectives, and for us, for me, it's not a contradiction if we've already achieved something early, because even if we say okay, 2011, it will be better than 2010. Well, I think there still are reasons for us to remain cautious. And thus, I'd like to point out that we have expressed clear objectives for 2018 and we've got quite a ways to go to get there. So, I don't think it makes much sense to talk about things before that. In other words, we have established clear milestones for the future. The company is working on it, and I think that they are quite challenging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Next, Mr. Punzet here at the front. Yes. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Punzet from DZ Bank. I have three questions. Porsche Holding Salzburg will be fully consolidated at Volkswagen, where will we find this? As a separate division or is it going to be added to one of the group divisions?</p>
          <p>And then, too, this morning in the speech &#x20AC;700 million were expected from synergies between Porsche AG and Volkswagen AG and that one-third had already been identified of these synergies. Well, how many percentages of the &#x20AC;700 million can already currently be achieved? And what's the difference for Volkswagen between merger of Porsche SA or purchasing the sport car business? I adjust Porsche on the basis of the put-call factor.</p>
          <p>And then you mentioned four million vehicles on the base &#x2013; built on the basis on your strategy, but you need to have a supplier to supply you these numbers and the quality, and doesn't that limit the number of potential suppliers? And that of course, sir, should also mean that you will not be able to get the price in the market that you want to achieve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I answered the first two items. First, Porsche Holding, from today's point of view this will not be a separate item in our reporting and you will not really get to notice this. I talked about depreciation of allocated assets, well, that's one thing; then, there will be an increase in sales to a certain extent, but for the next year when you look at the earnings you must &#x2013; it must be considered that Salzburg is a trading company that's highly profitable; a highly profitable trading company.</p>
          <p>Then the next question was synergies, mid-term goal &#x20AC;700 million. You asked about the share that can currently be achieved, or which can be achieved, which share could be achieved with the merger?</p>
          <p>I already said this morning, and let me repeat that. So we expect between &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;300 million out of the &#x20AC;700 million. And these will also be achieved without the merger if, for instance, on the basis of the existing options Volkswagen would, so to speak, get the remaining 50% of Porsche operations, as I said, on the basis of the existing options.</p>
          <p>As not to lead to the wrong assumptions, let me tell you that these options can only be exercised tax free of the second half of the year 2014, so Porsche via a put or Volkswagen via a call. So that's the merger in our assessment. If possible and available, offers the shortest road to the creation of maximum synergies, and for a number of other reasons as well as this reason, the contracting parties preferred the merger over any other solutions.</p>
          <p>Yes. And I'd like to make a fundamental statement on that question &#x2013; you asked will the suppliers be able to cope. Well, the modular strategy does not mean that you have to have four million parts which are the same. Let me give you an example. For a lot of money we developed a modular entertainment system, a radio navigation system and so on.</p>
          <p>So our development cost was &#x20AC;250 million to develop this modular system. Small items, bigger items for bigger navigation systems, simple radios, and for that we have development &#x2013; various development suppliers. Or when you think of swivel bearings, for the &#x2013; that determine the width of the vehicle, the track for the AO, for the Polo class and for the Golf class and the Passat class, we have one modular system, but we have different track widths.</p>
          <p>The supplier actually has a foundry and can actually produce these different widths that we're trying to find synergies. And actually, we don't have just one supplier for items, so we use the production technology which is the same for the 4 million or 3.5 million vehicles. However, depending on the type of vehicle, we have different sizes.</p>
          <p>I could not have given a better answer. Just imagine and let's assume that part is the same and be equal with all other parts. We do not have these parts manufactured at one point in the world and then ship them all over the globe. No, we're trying to have those parts produced in that part of the world where they're required. Now, you might ask, what's the savings? The savings is that we develop things only once, develop the process only once; then we do duplicates of the tools and create modules somewhere in the world with the best costs. But if a part is required in India, it doesn't really make sense to supply it from Wolfsburg to India.</p>
          <p>So that's the whole complex system, and that's helped us, and Mr. Winterkorn explained that to you, to bring down costs and make savings. And it's not a limitation of our suppliers because we have global suppliers who could theoretically supply the four million. We also, however, ought to try to develop local suppliers for the local market who would produce these parts for the local market. So we're trying to have a balanced risk here with between one, two, three, or several suppliers and to achieve optimum unit cost.</p>
          <p>And, of course, we also have the aftermarket area. And the modular system allows to make life easier for people who work in after sales in the workshops, because no matter what car comes in for service, if the components are the same, it's a lot easier to do repairs, whether you've got a Polo, a Golf, or a Passat.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fine. Thank you. Mike Tindrel and then Mr. Dennegar, and then Mrs. Lemka. And then we change to the other side of the room.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first is related to Porsche sales break. I'm wondering if you could give us an idea as to what proportion of their sales would be considered intergroup sales and what proportion of their cut, I guess, from the Volkswagen family.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to MLB and Audi. If I'm not wrong, with the launch of the A6 that pretty much fills out all of the Audi models that are going to be on the MLB and there should be a significant jump in volumes on the MLB as a result. But you're guiding flat margins year-on-year. So I'm just trying to reconcile the two things there. Where are those savings going from the MLB platform?</p>
          <p>And then the third question is really about 2018. When we think back to February of last year when you said that you wanted to have a pre-tax margin of above 8%. You just reported, or about to report, a pre-tax margin of 1.2%. You've done 7% this year, 6% if I take out some of the one-offs. I'm just wondering about the progress from here to 2018. Is 2018 too pessimistic a target? Or is the pace going to slow going forward? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First, Porsche Salzburg. Sales revenue for Porsche Salzburg on the basis of the consolidation of sales will actually not be shown to 40%, because the 40% will be netted-off against the sales revenue that the group already achieves currently.</p>
          <p>You asked about the effects of the modular system on the margin. Mr. Stadler, do you want to answer that question for Audi perhaps?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's talk about the MLB. We started with the Audi A5 Coupe. And of course, we don't start with the development structure of the MLB. We need to develop structures, we've put in some work on an entertainment system, the Audi A6, A7, A8, they all have a rolling hot boarder Wi-Fi where you can use your iPhone and so on and so we're working on all that to stay ahead of the competition with our products.</p>
          <p>And, as far as the profit is concerned, you can see that the operating earnings has a margin of 9.4% where return on sales is about 10%. The ROI is about 24%. So you can see the quality of our strategy, of our decision in favor of the modular system in that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And now our pre-tax earnings for 2018 is what I'd like to pick up. Let me repeat what I already said. It's very courageous of us to post this goal for the future and on the basis of that, you might assume that, of course, we're a lot more ambitious as to the goals we've set ourselves internally or else we'd not be so confident that we can supply the 8%. What we promised was supplied relatively well over the past few years. And of course we were successful here because internally, we, of course, work here with a lot more energy. We should not give up this concept.</p>
          <p>If then the underlying situation becomes more favorable than what we very conservatively assumed, then something might happen. But you could not tell us you need to adapt your goals, something more should be achieved, because certain elements might happen and even if those things happened, if they're not having a structural effect; we'd be able to supply these figures.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Benninghoff and then Ms. Lemka.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Albert Benninghoff, Research GmbH. Two housekeeping effects about the basics affecting your speech, Mr. Winterkorn. You talked about 20% improvement with your modular systems. Now, is this based on a comparable previous system or is it based on 2010 with your high profitability and low cost? That is, this 20% improvement. What year is it compared to, 2010 or previously?</p>
          <p>And then I have a follow-up question on the 15% improvement in fuel efficiency. Can you tell us about the average fleet's consumption for the Volkswagen Group in 2010 compared to 2009 and tell us about the change there? And then on that basis, please tell us whether the 15% are a good indicator?</p>
          <p>Then, in Europe last week, there was a report that various manufacturers are earning a lot of money in Asia. They're much more aggressive in marketing. Volkswagen was also mentioned there too. Can you confirm that, that you're using competitive means to increase your market share at the expense of, well, entry-level brands, or is this not so much the case? In other words, is the limited availability leading to higher prices?</p>
          <p>And then the last question is this, in your annual report you have a high balance loss carried forward, &#x20AC;8 billion compared to &#x20AC;3 billion previously. Can you tell us whether this loss carried forward has something to do with MAN and whether it could be utilized in the context of MAN and where it comes from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to your first question, Mr. Benninghoff, the reduction of 30% of direct costs, there, of course, referred to a PQ 35 vehicle with a comparable equipment level. In other words, current generation of Golf, and that compared to a MQB generation, and we mentioned a similar figure for Audi and the MLB. I can say, most assuredly, that we did achieve these objectives.</p>
          <p>Average consumption, 2009 compared to 2010, or vice versa; well, here we went from 141 grams in 2009 down by 7 grams in 2010, 144 grams. Then there was a question about aggressiveness in marketing. I wouldn't mind passing that onto my colleague, Mr. Klinger, and then the subject of loss carried forward, Mr. P&#xF6;tsch will answer that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, last week there were some publications made in which people said in Europe the Volkswagen Group is really giving lots of rebates and adjusting prices and so on. I would recommend that the results from the different companies be looked at; in particular the last two quarters, and then use our company's figures by way of comparison.</p>
          <p>I think you'd be surprised to see that our figures look quite good, and the others perhaps don't look as good. To put it differently, we cannot confirm that. We do not see a decrease in prices, and we do not, cannot confirm that in Europe we have poorer margins than in the previous year. Actually, I can say very clearly on the contrary, rather on the contrary. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, with regard to the loss carried forward, that originally comes from the Scania group, as a result of the acquisition of a legal shell, so to speak, and no decision has been made on the use of it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. <mark type="inaudible" /> Lemka from Morgan Stanley I've got three questions, please. First, you are in China, and I was wondering if you could give us an update on the number of Audi dealerships that you're having at the end of 2010, and also what your expansion plans are for the next two years?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in the light of the increasing amount of restrictions that we're seeing from the government, for example, on availability of number plates, I was wondering if you could actually tell us the proportion of volumes that you're selling in the Tier 1, 2, and 3 cities, if possible?</p>
          <p>And then, the last question, relates to MAN Scania, obviously, there's kind of a variety of alternatives how you could structure this deal, but there's one scenario where VW actually wouldn't have to make a capital contribution. And, in case that is the preferred option, what would you do with that cash that you're not spending? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the Audi dealers, I'd like to say briefly that we've got about 170, just over 170 dealers in China and right now per week, we're adding about one dealer on the average. So per year, we're adding about 50, and that will definitely continue this year and next year, too. Mr. Klingler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer your second question. Without going into all the details, I can say, yes, there are restrictions in Beijing, for instance, with regards to registrations. The situation is this: people that to date have not had a car are seeing restrictions in terms of registrations. People that do have a car already have a registration, so they can buy another car, because there might be a major effect otherwise.</p>
          <p>And in addition to that, we're seeing that in the last three months in Beijing there were a lot of purchases last year so that in the first quarter, they would be able to avoid this problem. There's a basic effect of &#x2013; the basis, the foundation. Nevertheless, we believe that the Beijing market will reduce, will go down.</p>
          <p>There's another phenomenon and I think this is an important one, is that in China, there's a major discrepancy between the East and West. In the East, development's well, the area is developed well &#x2013; very well. In the West, there are major opportunities. We're seeing that and on that basis, we realize that the need for mobility is continuing to increase there.</p>
          <p>So we believe that despite these restrictions, we believe there will be reasonable growth. And we said with regard to China that we believe that in 2011 growth ought to be possible, something to the tune of 8% to 10%. Maybe it will be a little above that; it depends on developments in the next few months, because in the first two months things were very positive and we believe, as you saw, if you look at our initial forecast for the next few years, that these developments will continue to be positive.</p>
          <p>My last small remark is this. We do see a positive effect if there are restrictions, which means that customers buy more expensive cars. And we, of course, are not against that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. P&#xF6;tsch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me say something briefly about MAN Scania. As I said, no decision has yet been made. People are still working on the concepts about which tasks to adopt, so we have to ultimately assume that there will be a need for cash. And, as a result, we're not wracking our brains about what might happen if we don't need cash. But I would like to point out that no matter what we decide on this subject or on others, we will not make any compromises as regards our A rating. And of course here too, certain things have to be taken into account therefore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Winterkorn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to make a general comment about China, to complement what Mr. Klingler said. For a long time all of us were focusing on the East, Beijing, Shanghai, farther to the north for instance, Changchun. And, just a couple years ago, we went to the West for the first time &#x2013; I went there for the first time and there are many cities, five million to seven million population, Chengdu where we have a factory, for example.</p>
          <p>And you can see that China consists of more than just the East, where it's more densely populated. You also have the West. There's a great need for mobility. The biggest Phaeton dealer, I believe Mr. Klingler, is in Chengdu. The biggest Phaeton dealer in the world is in Chengdu, and Chengdu is in the southwest of the country, and there are several cities like that. So China, by far, has not been fully developed as far as mobility is concerned.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll go over to the left-hand side here, John Lawson and then Mr. Sullivan and then Mr. Raab. And I think that's it then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. John Lawson from Citi. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch, you mentioned the non-cash elements of earnings in 2010. And if I understand it correctly, the write-off on the put-call was around &#x20AC;2 billion for the Porsche put-call, give or take a few million. On the negative side, I don't think we have many of the numbers. It seems there wasn't any PPA for Porsche at the end of the day. But I guess there was for Scania and I wonder whether you could evaluate that for us in 2010? And are there any other major non-cash effects that we need to take into account when looking at 2010 earnings?</p>
          <p>And then, on perhaps a related subject, just on the Porsche op co, PZG, I wondered if you were able to provide the 2010 joint venture contribution that came from that company? And tell us whether you took a dividend, or whether you expect to take a dividend from PZG? And what level that dividend might be? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, you were you talking about &#x2013; in the context of the dividend payment I said that it would make sense to also take into consideration the non-cash items, which are actually quite considerable. That's the put-call situation that needs to be reconsidered, and that's shown with &#x20AC;1.8 billion in the result, and therefore this would have to be removed from the cash side and we also of course have a reduction in earnings, because of the depreciation on the allocated assets, and that's a total of &#x20AC;700 million, of which &#x20AC;300 million are related to Scania. In the operating results on &#x20AC;200 million, the financial result, and a part of that is also related to Porsche.</p>
          <p>You asked about dividend distribution. Yes, we do expect a dividend, and further dividends from Porsche, and that should be in the hundreds of millions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have Mr. Raab and Mr. Sullivan. Who's got the microphone? Mr. Raab.  And then we go to row three, Michel Earheart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to go into hedging instrument and derivatives that are not held for hedging. If I look at the assets and liabilities as they arose in 2009 and if I net them, I come to &#x20AC;200 million net assets and &#x20AC;1.9 billion for this year, one point &#x2013; &#x20AC;2 billion market net and at market effect and &#x20AC;200 million. This does not come to &#x2013; up to &#x20AC;1.9 billion. So that must &#x2013; what is behind all that?</p>
          <p>And strategic question to Professor Winterkorn. Against this 2018 background, your principal opponent is Toyota but if you look into the rearview mirror, it's Hyundai, and if you look beyond the year 2018, shouldn't that actually be Hyundai, your principal opponent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll start with question two. Yes, we see Hyundai in the rearview mirror. Hyundai and Kia. We also focus on their vehicles and we test those vehicles more intensely than four years ago. The reason for this is the improvement in design. They're more precise; they're more European; the drivetrain, the engine.</p>
          <p>Well, here, Hyundai Korea is actually moving forward, gaining ground, so we monitor this company very closely; but our product, our modular strategy, our way of handling things will give us a slight advantage. That's as I see matters and I don't see Hyundai in that situation yet. Mr. P&#xF6;tsch?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our financial result in the context of derivatives also includes the evaluation, the measurement of options. So the &#x20AC;1.8 billion, which I mentioned previously, have to consider this, this and a number of other items, about 20 on the sheet here, and I'm not going to read through all of them. This explains matters relating to that question to a considerable extent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to pursue that. If I do this translation, mark-to-market effects; &#x20AC;1.25 million, and then &#x2013; billion. And then 1.924 is asset net liabilities. So there's &#x20AC;700 million, and they cannot be explained by mark-to-market. What is that? Included &#x2013; additional derivatives, or what else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I suggest is that we go together &#x2013; we get together, the two of us, and I explain this to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, excellent proposal. And with that we come to the last question. Mr. Sullivan? And I think that should be all. I didn't see anybody else raise their hand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My name is Dave Sullivan from AutoPacific. We're based in California and I'm in Detroit. Dr. Winterkorn, you mentioned that you invested $250 million in navigation system development, and we're seeing Ford has introduced Sync here in Europe. Sync has been around for years in the U.S. market. And then Hyundai, Toyota and General Motors have introduced similar systems recently.</p>
          <p>Can we expect an investment from Volkswagen for a similar system here in the future? It's something that &#x2013; it's almost become a requirement for sales in the U.S. now, and I know you have a very high sales target.</p>
          <p>And, my second question is in regards to the targets that you have for 2018. Could we see a &#x2013; the expansion of commercial vehicles into the U.S. market in order to help attain your sales goals is that &#x2013; could we see any potential there for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Start with a question number two. The U.S. market is 11, 12, 13 million; that's the size of the market depending on where development will go, and 15% of that market are commercial vehicles. In the United States you all know commercial vehicles as trucks. When you talk trucks you talk about huge trucks.</p>
          <p>In the last three to four months, the American way of life is back. You can see that people buy bigger cars again, and that can be seen in the registration. So we cannot exclude that we will enter the market with commercial vehicles, we are checking that. However, what we're thinking is we need to do our homework with the existing products; the growth call of the Volkswagen brand and the Audi brand and the premium vehicles must be promoted. So no decisions, analyses are being made.</p>
          <p>Mr. Sullivan, on your first question, these U.S. systems which show you where you can buy your rolls or buy your bread and butter or go &#x2013; where to go to the cinema. They're part of our modular system. The entertainment modular system is structured in such a way that sub-systems which are required in the U.S. or in Japan or in China or in Europe are part of this entertainment modular kit, or modular system.</p>

And those of you who want to take part in the tour of the factory meet at a quarter to three at the welcome desk. Mrs. Staudinger will meet you there and then you go on the tour.
