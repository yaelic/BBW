          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the second-quarter 2011 Anadarko Petroleum Corporation earnings conference call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" /> As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. John Colglazier, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for Anadarko's second-quarter conference call. Today's presentation contains our best and most reasonable estimates and information. However, a number of items could cause results to differ material from what we discuss today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements available in our presentation slides, our latest 10-K, other filings and press releases, for the risk factors associated with our business.</p>
          <p>In addition, we'll reference certain non-GAAP measures, so be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release and on our Web site. We encourage you to read the cautionary notes to U.S. investors contained in the presentation slides for this conference call. And, as we do each quarter, we've included additional information in our quarterly operations report that is available on our Web site. And we'll be filing our 10-Q for the quarter later this week.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim Hackett, our chairman and CEO, who will be joined by other members of our management team later in the call to answer your questions. Jim?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results and we'll now share this significant achievements and upcoming catalysts with you. First, the highlights.</p>
          <p>We achieved record crude oil and NGL sales volume is almost 300,000 barrels of oil per day &#x2013; excuse me &#x2013; of 300,000 barrels per day which resulted in significantly improved corporate margins and cash flow. We finalized the Lucius Unitization Agreement, which further enhances the economic efficiency of this future mega-project. We successfully tested three wells at the Caesar/Tonga development with each flowing at rates of about 15,000 barrels of oil per day. And we closed the purchase of the Wattenberg plant in Colorado, which will improve recoveries and enable future expansion in the DJ Basin, including growth in the horizontal Niobrara play.</p>
          <p>The depth of the portfolio allowed us to direct capital investments toward areas that offer higher liquids yields. As a result of this focus total liquid sales volumes for the quarter were 13% higher than the second quarter of 2010, amounting to an increase of 3.1 million barrels. The increase in liquids volumes contributed to a 29% increase in adjusted EBITDAX per BOE over the same period last year. This margin expansion was enhanced by the widening differential between WTI and Brent, as more than 70% of our crude production is based on BRENT-equivalent pricing rather than WTI.</p>
          <p>Our record sales liquids volumes also contributed to more than $1.8 billion in discretionary cash flow for the quarter. This cash flow covered our capital expenditures in the quarter including a one-time investment of $518 million associated with the Wattenberg plant acquisition, while still generating more than $100 million of free cash flow.</p>
          <p>Liquids growth was particularly strong in the Rockies. The Wattenberg field in Colorado delivered a 41% increase in liquids volumes versus the second quarter of 2010, and continue to set production records for the field. In the DJ Basin, we're encouraged by what we are seeing from our horizontal Niobrara program. We have significant running room with about 900,000 net perspective acres in the Denver-Joules per area, the majority of which is economically advantaged by our fee mineral ownership via the land grant.</p>
          <p>We're running three rigs that are focused on horizontal Niobrara opportunities in the DJ Basin, and we expect to add another rig to test multiple locations further north in the Powder River Basin where we hold an additional 360,000 net perspective acres.</p>
          <p>In the Greater Natural Buttes area of Utah, we set another field production record during the quarter with average sales volumes representing a 16% increase over the second quarter of 2010. We're currently operating six rigs in the area and recently initiated construction of a major pipeline and plant expansion that will increase our liquids processing capacity by about 250 million cubic feet per day.</p>
          <p>Additionally, last month the U.S. Department of The Interior recognized and supported our collaborative efforts to advance the Greater Natural Buttes expansion project. This is a significant step forward in the in-field development of this area that offers tremendous resource potential with more than 6,000 identified drill sites that will provide sustained production and economic growth for the region.</p>
          <p>Moving to our Southern and Appalachia region, liquids volumes increased by 24%, with oil volumes up 47% relative to the second quarter of 2010. In the Eagle Ford Shale we increased gross sales volumes to approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the second quarter, compared to 36,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at the end of the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>We continue to be very active in the Eagle Ford, with 11 rigs running. We achieved first production from 33 wells during the quarter and continue to improve drilling efficiencies, and recently drilled a total of 20 wells, each in less than 10 days.</p>
          <p>In our West Texas Permian oil projects, liquid sales volumes for the quarter more than doubled over the same quarter in 2010. We've also continued to improve drilling efficiency by reducing our average drilling cycle times by about 20%, or seven days, versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania, we're currently producing more than 500 million gross cubic feet per day from about 125 wells. Anadarko operates seven rigs here and we've safely reduced average drilling cycle times by about 20% relative to last year.</p>
          <p>Now as an update on our mega-projects, we'll start offshore Ghana at Jubilee. The partnership continues to ramp production toward capacity, which contributed significantly to our increase in oil volumes during the second quarter. Current gross production is averaging about 80,000 barrels of oil per day.</p>
          <p>In Algeria, the El Merk project is nearly 80% complete. Construction of the central processing facilities and associated infrastructure is progressing, and the project remains on track for full facility completion in late 2012.</p>
          <p>At Caesar/Tonga in the Gulf of Mexico we recently completed flow tests on three wells. Each demonstrated robust fuel rates of approximately 15,000 barrels per day of high-quality 27-degree API gravity oil. We're progressing two parallel riser solutions and expect to achieve first production in 2012.</p>
          <p>With unitization and expected sanctioning of Lucius in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we're eager to add it to our future list of mega-projects. As announced last week, we'll operate the unit with a 35% working interest. Subsequent to the unitization, we also signed a production handling agreement whereby natural gas produced from Exxon to Hadrian South Field will be processed through the Lucius facility in return for a throughput fee and reimbursement of all capital associated with expanded gas capacity.</p>
          <p>This agreement will also result in higher natural gas price utilizations for the Lucius partnership to reduce transportation costs. During the quarter we also completed a successful well test at Lucius. As designed, the well flowed more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day of high-quality 29-degree API gravity oil. The test reinforced our previous resource estimates and indicated that Lucius can be developed with a minimal number of wells.</p>
          <p>The economics of Lucius were already very compelling, and the results of the flow test, unitization agreement and the production handling agreement have elevated those economics to a higher level, making Lucius one of the most economically efficient projects in our portfolio.</p>
          <p>We've already begun ordering long-lead items including, the floating truss bar product facility that will be designed with a capacity of 80,000 barrels of oil per day and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. We expect to sanction this project later this year and are targeting 2014 for first production.</p>
          <p>Our offshore exploration and appraisal program is accelerating significantly. We're embarking on one of the most active drilling campaigns in the company's history. Let me highlight the activities of the coast of West Africa.</p>
          <p>The drillship has just arrived offshore Liberia to drill to Montserrado prospect. Following completion of activities in Montserrado, we plan to move the drill ship to Sierra Leone to test the Jupiter prospect and drill the first Mercury appraisal well. We also plan to remain very active in Ghana and Mozambique, with additional drilling activities in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, Brazil and China.</p>
          <p>In addition we expect to receive a permit to drill the Heidelberg appraisal well soon and look forward to resuming an active program in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>Turning to the financial results for the quarter, we reported earnings of $1.08 per diluted share. As with previous quarters we've provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability, without which second quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher. Although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior-year quarter, and discretionary cash flow was very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million --</p>
          <p>Sorry about the echoing. I apologize to everybody on the call. We lost power, I think, in the whole Woodlands area. So maybe we ought to take that $100 million of excess cash flow and put it towards power backup.</p>
          <p>Jeff, I don't know if you recall where I left off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sir, I don't actually recall where you were at that current moment. I know you're reading your financial --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me try this. Let's start with the financial results and it's just about &#x2013; it's just a little bit back.</p>
          <p>Just to repeat, we reported earnings of $1.08 per diluted share, and as with previous quarters we provided a breakout in the earnings release of certain items affecting comparability without which second-quarter net income would have been about $0.06 per share higher.</p>
          <p>And although we mentioned this earlier, it's worth repeating that adjusted EBITDAX per BOE increased by about 29% versus the prior-year quarter, and discretionary cash flow was very strong at $1.8 billion, generating more than $100 million of free cash flow after a one-time $0.5 billion investment in the Wattenberg plant.</p>
          <p>We ended the second quarter with approximately $3.4 billion of cash on hand in addition to the undrawn $5 billion credit facility, which has a term through 2015. We also entered into new hedges for a portion of our 2013 natural gas production through three-way collars, and this appears in the earnings release.</p>
          <p>As an update to the BP oil spill, we remain confident in our publicly stated position, and we have not recorded a contingent liability associated with this event. We'll provide updated information on this subject in our forthcoming 10-Q.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales volumes to be in a range of 58 million to 61 million barrels of oil equivalent. This reflects a risk to operational profile that includes assumptions for downtime related to weather and facilities.</p>
          <p>In summary, we're very pleased with the performance of the portfolio and our quarterly results, and we're excited about the numerous significant catalysts in the months ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>And with that, Jeff, I might ask you to open it up for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And it looks like our first question of the day will come from the line of Dave Heikkinen. One moment.</p>
          <p>And actually, gentlemen, I apologize. Looks like he probably dropped off. Let me go ahead and move on to Mr. Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi; good morning. Question related to Mozambique. Two-fold: one, that's a awful lot of core that you cut on Windjammer and Lagosta. What were you targeting? And second, on the Camar&#xE3;os, if I'm pronouncing that correctly, is the targeting oil or gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob; Bob Daniels here. On the core, we just cored the reservoirs that we had found in the previous discovery wells, and the idea there is to get really good petrophysical analysis, rock properties, so that we can put together our overall reservoir model and have a much better understanding about the flow unit and fluids. We're going to get DSTs later in the year to where we have a good idea about pressure communication, compartmentalization or not. And the whole idea is to get that data to a third party that could then do a resource certification for us through 2012. So that's the idea. The analysis, the lab work on the cores takes the longest, so we wanted to get that up-front and so because we got very big project here, we want to make sure we got all the data that we need up-front.</p>
          <p>As to the Camar&#xE3;o, it's not an oil project -- or prospect. That's in the same area as the <mark type="ph" /> Labarkan Jammer (13:20) area, and we're looking for an appraisal to the Windjammer prospect and also some additional sands that we did not encounter in the original well. So it's an exploratory well from that standpoint, and that should be spud second half of the year here.</p>
          <p>&lt;&lt;Q &#x2013; [0BS0N2-E]Bob Brackett &#x2013; Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., Inc.&gt;: Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Tudor Pickering Holt. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had an echo on my first one; sorry about that. As you look at your exploratory program, wanted to hit the West African ongoing program. First Ghana. Can you talk about thoughts around extension of West Cape Three Points and any of the prospects there first?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again, David, this is Bob Daniels. On the West Cape Three Points, we've got an active exploration program going there. We're on <mark type="ph" /> Acosta (14:11) right now, which we used to call the <mark type="ph" /> Updip Dahoma (14:14) prospect. And of course we got the Mahogany East that we've already drilled and appraised. We have Teak as a discovery and several other smaller discoveries in there.</p>
          <p>And what we're trying to do in the West Cape Three Points block is to see do we have enough resources there that can be aggregated together to have another development. And of course, we have to have the exploration and appraisal work done. We plan on getting back to Teak later this year for an appraisal well there. We also have a -- the Cedrela prospect that we'd like to get to. We had a rig lined up for it, and then it had an issue with the previous operator, so we're looking at how we're going to get that well drilled. But there's still additional activity on the West Cape Three Points, all focused on do we have enough for another project there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With Cedrela and the rig delay, did you get an extension to the timing on the license?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The operator filed a force majeure and we're going to have to wait and see how that all plays out. <mark type="ph" /> But we're asking for a (15:10) rig there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then going up West Africa into Liberia and then Sierra Leone, the other two prospect, Kosrou and Paon, can you talk about those? I know the other three.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Here those are the two in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, and originally at the beginning of the year, we said we were going to drill three to five exploratory wells in West Africa this year. And then we dropped to three, and that was because of the political situation in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire.</p>
          <p>That's been settled. We can now operate in C&#xF4;te d'Ivoire, where service companies are moving back in. Our office is up and operating. We've come out of force majeure. We've contracted a rig actually to drill those two wells, that will start with CI-105 probably November-ish timeframe. And then the CI-103 which is the <mark type="ph" /> PON (15:56) prospect will be followed thereafter immediately, so we have the first two slots on the rig that's coming, and we do expect at least the first one to spud this year and probably the second one to at least spud this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're good prospects. They look very similar to the Jubilee style that we're pursuing. Same target with the Cretaceous-age fans coming off the shelf, and we've wanted to drills these wells for a while, and now we can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Dave Kistler with Simmons and Company. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, guys. Real quickly looking at your exploration slide for the offshore campaign, I noticed in Gulf of Mexico that PHOBOS is no longer on that list. Is there any particular reason for that? And then in the Gulf of Mexico, what would you kind of rank as your top prospects for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>yeah, Dave; Bob Daniels again. PHOBOS is just off the list because of the timing. We're looking at a 2012 spud for that. Nothing to do with quality of the prospect, anything like that. It's just as we looked at how &#x2013; which ones can we move through the system as we &#x2013; the regulatory environment that we see, we need to get our appraisal work done, the wells that we were already working on such as Heidelberg.</p>
          <p>And then Spartacus looked like it was going to be an easier process to move through, more straightforward. So we've been pushing that one as an offset to the Lucius discover. It'd kind of syncline separated off to the northeast, and we do expect to spud that either very late this year or early next year. So we have a very good inventory of prospects ahead of us, PHOBOS is one of them that if you looked out into 2012 is on the list. Also tried to put here was what's going to happen over the next six to nine months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I appreciate that clarification. And then looking at your efficiency gains in the Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Bone Spring specifically, can you talk a little bit about what that does as far as accelerating a drilling activity program there, and then how that impacts cost? Obviously it offsets some of the cost inflation you're seeing, but aggregate cost if you are going to be drilling more wells could be going higher. Just trying to think about how that flows through to CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we're very &#x2013; this is Chuck &#x2013; we're very excited about how our drilling team's performed in each one of those assets. They're doing a spectacular job, actually gaining more efficiency in every element of the well construction process. What we think we're going to do, or how it's playing out right now -- we're drilling more wells with the same rig count, in the order of 40% more in several of these plays. And we're actually getting that many more wells drilled with the same effort on a given rig line, which gives us a much higher net present value for the production because we get it on quicker, and it costs less to drill any individual well. The aggregate CapEx is going up on a program basis in a given year because we are putting more tangibles in the ground, but our intangible costs are actually coming down. And so that all makes the economics better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay; great. Appreciate that. And then just one last one if I can. With respect to the Wattenberg plant acquisition that's allowed you guys to increase liquids yields there and have great visibility on your running room for liquids production, do you look at making investments, pretty substantial investments on the liquids side of things in some of these other fields like the Eagle Ford or potentially even parts of the Bone Spring to be able to &#x2013; well, be able to continue with that kind of similar visibility and forward projections?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dave, we're looking at each of those carefully when we have plans to maximize our revenues off of each one of those fields. So additional wells and plants are under consideration and in some level of progress right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that clarification, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I might mention, too, Dave on that is we don't see an immediate need to do a big step-out with capital on those infrastructure elements in those plays like in Wattenberg. That was a fairly unique situation where we had some very underwater contracts based on a very old plant arrangement. And there's plenty of competition in these other areas for new infrastructure. So I don't see the same kind of magnitude, if you will.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I want to thank you. Good morning, guys. Going to try a couple, if I may. Caesar/Tonga -- given the delays to first oil and the success you've had with the test results, is there any change to the development plan there? I seem to recall you are looking about 40,000 barrels a day through Constitution. But it seems that the fuel could do an awful lot better than that. Can you talk a little about that? And I've got some follow-ups, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Doug; this is Chuck. Actually we've drill <mark type="ph" /> steam (21:05) tested all three wells now and in excess of 15,000 barrels a day per well. And what we have between Caesar/Tonga and Constitution is a minimum capacity of 40,000 barrels a day. So if there's upside opportunity on Constitution, we could push the rates up with the wells that we have. And we also have planned an additional well down the road once we get the facility and WC system, et cetera, lying down.</p>
          <p>With regard to the riser, we're progressing two additional solutions, both of which have first production in 2012, and so we're on schedule to make that happen, and you should see that coming forward soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so no change to the original plan, Chuck?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up is first of all on Brazil. You've &#x2013; obviously you've laid out the three appraisal wells here, but what's the plan beyond that? With these three wells are you done &#x2013; will you be done in Brazil in terms of scoping out the scale, in which case what do you see as the running room there?</p>
          <p>And finally, if I could ask you just to talk a little bit about Mercury, I guess the commentary in the release suggested that you'd be looking at DST there at some point. Can you just maybe give us an idea of what you're looking for there? What you think the ultimate scale of that asset could be and perhaps what the plan going forward would be, because I guess that seems the closest to moving towards development? Or maybe I'm wrong there, but I would &#x2013; give me some color there and I'll leave it at that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Doug. Bob Daniels. On Brazil we do have the three wells going. We're on Itaipu right now. That's the first appraisal well of that discovery. So whether or not that's going to move us to a sanction point is &#x2013; we probably will need additional drilling after that.</p>
          <p>Wahoo -- towards the end of the year we'll be drilling the second appraisal well, second location really, for appraisal. That could help us define with now the previous DST and appraisal work what we have there much better.</p>
          <p>And the Itauna which will spud in September, remember that's shelf discovery post-salt, potentially a simpler development &#x2013; well, it's clearly a simpler development, potentially a simpler reservoir system. And we tried to design the program there that with very good news at Itauna we may have enough to actually have confidence we can move that one forward. So that's what the appraisal's focused on. We'll need something else at Itaipu. Wahoo can help us a lot get to a decision point, and then Itauna potentially with good news could be enough.</p>
          <p>As to Mercury, when we put a DST in there, we talked about it being Mercury as the most likely one, but we actually have the option to DST in West Africa any of the wells that we want to do. And so we're going to drill the wells and decide then what's the best place to run a DST based on the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, are you prepared to give any kind of idea of what you see as the scale of the opportunity there at this point, or is it still too early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can talk about that. In all of those, you know, these are Jubilee style or Tweneboa/Enyenra style, which there're subtle differences between the two, but they're the overall the same Cretaceous fan systems coming off. It's where you are in that overall fan system. One, you're down on the basin floor, where you have more low-bait-type geometries; another, you're up a little bit more in the channelized system. And so the combination of the three we're testing will look at both of those, but we're looking at things that are the Jubilee and Tweneboa style and size. The scales are very, very similar when we look at these, least the sand geometries and the sand scale. We're looking at very similar size and scale to what we see in Ghana. So we are looking for multi-hundred-million-barrel-type objectives.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob. Could I just squeeze just one more in very quickly? The sequential drop in volume guidance Q2 to Q3 &#x2013; can you just quantify what you're assuming in terms of downtime just in case we're don't get the kind of hurricane season that maybe you've priced in? And I will leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Doug, we always have and will provide sort of a risk operational profile as inclusive of what our historical weather patterns have been and the downtime associated with those, as well as what we anticipate downtime on our facilities around the world for planned maintenance and just normal outages. And you can see from historical performance that as particularly like in the last three years, if you look through the second and -- I'm sorry; the third and fourth quarter guidance, we've hit it very well on a risk basis through time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Christensen with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can you just spend a little more time on the Wattenberg processing plant purchase: how much more money you going to put into it and how accretive it could be and when that accretion could start to show up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Chuck. What we're seeing in Wattenberg -- just a big picture, if you step back far enough, the early returns on the horizontal drilling campaign have been outstanding. And what we've decided to do is make strategic moves to gather all the value chain we possibly can within Wattenberg inclusive of the plants, the gathering system and land.</p>
          <p>And through that we are going to put a very comprehensive development plan together, which includes the full utilization of all the plant assets we have out there, which now include the Wattenberg plant we just acquired from BP, the Platte Valley plant we acquired from Encana, and the facilities that we had, legacy facilities that we had at <mark type="ph" /> Fort Worth. (26:54).</p>
          <p>So the combination of all of those we think we can use to reduce our line pressures, increase our run time and increase our recoveries, both on our base production, which has historically been the Niobrara and the Codell and <mark type="ph" /> Jay (27:08) sand wells, and take full advantage of our horizontal program in the Niobrara, both inside Wattenberg and in the Greater DJ.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it fair &#x2013; the financial question, I guess -- to say, if I take that purchase out of the capital spending in the quarter, that I would add that to your $117 million of free cash flow, so that the quarter really was adjusted free cash flow of $635 million? Is it fair to look at it at your company that way? That would appear to be a little early for Anadarko generating free cash flow. I remember sort of thinking next year would be a free cash flow year. I know with -- that helped by $100 oil. But it appears to me free cash flow has arrived in quantity earlier than expected.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You -- no, that's exactly the way to look at it, and obviously that's driven liquids volumes and our substantial price realizations related to Brent.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

          <p>If I might just take one more, and it's a Macondo-related question. So when does the trial in New Orleans begin? Is there a date for commencement of the trial?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you; good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Brian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked -- touched a little bit on the Niobrara, but I was wondering if you could give some more color. With 15 wells now producing, your thought so far which zones you've drilled horizontally and are producing -- any additional color on what you're seeing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as we mentioned early, the early results look really good, and I think the uplift in our Wattenberg liquid volumes quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year are indicative of the type of results that we're getting. We still think it's a little early in the game to come out and say here's our type curve because we are exploring a very large area, as you know. We have almost 900,000 acres in the DJ Basin to look at. And so we're being very methodical about our approach to evaluating that acreage.</p>
          <p>And then in addition, we're going to start a program up in the Powder River Basin which is another 300,000 barrels, so -- 300,000 acres. So we have a very large area to evaluate. But again, our early returns look really well, really good, and you're starting to see that result come through our flow volumes that we report quarter to quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess what percent of the wells that you've drilled so far, the horizontal wells, are focused on the Niobrara zone versus the frontier zone or other zones? And is there a way you could characterize of that 900,000-acre position as what percent you feel like you've drilled and have confidence in, or have a view that it's repeatable in the absence of natural fractures?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most all of the wells we've drilled so far have been Niobrara wells. We're yet to drill -- we've drilled a frontier well several years ago, but are just about to start our campaign up in the Power River Basin here in the next couple of months. So the vast majority has been the Niobrara. We've actually tested a couple of other zones with one well. We're going to continue to evaluate the Codell and the Sussex and others for potential as well in the DJ.</p>
          <p>As to what's prospective, if you look in the DJ Basin, about 200,000 barrels or 300,000 barrels are -- I'm sorry; 200,000 acres or 300,000 acres of our position is in Greater Wattenberg, where we have a 3,000 or 4,000 producing Niobrara well. So we know it's very good in there. We've drilled in-fill wells with horizontals and have had -- the early returns still look very good. And we're out exploring. We've drilled about seven or eight wells, thereabouts, along with Industry, who's drilled another several dozen wells in the Greater DJ Basin, and some of those show very good potential for very good economic returns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great; thanks. And then lastly, following up on the last -- on a previous question or the previous questioner, if Brent prices stay flat or strengthen from here, you'd be in a very good position from a free cash flow perspective next year. How do you look at capital allocation? Does that make you want to hold on to Mozambique versus seeking a partner? Does it make you want to accelerate exploration offshore broadly, deploy more rigs onshore U.S.? How do you think about capital allocation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, in the past we've identified a capital structure keeping our debt-to-cap in that 25% to 35% range. And if we start generating free cash flow that would cause us to go below that range, then obviously we've got a ton of opportunities around the world. And we would continue to invest in those opportunities because we think they provide excellent rates of return.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you see at all any constraints on the infrastructure side to ramping up in onshore U.S., and how would that compare versus, say, an exploration ramp-up offshore internationally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, generally on the onshore assets, we're pushing really hard to expand our infrastructure position. Wattenberg's a great example with the new plants in the pipeline that we have taking our crude into Cushing. We also have expanded substantially our position in the Marcellus and the Maverick. So each one of those are available to us. And as we get incremental infrastructure built out, we can add rigs, and that's what we've been doing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on the offshore international side, as you might appreciate, I mean, I think we're in a good environment from a rig standpoint. The term market's a little tighter than the spot market, but the spot's available, so we can do some things there as well.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Let me hit a couple -- go back to Wattenberg. If &#x2013; would you have made that acquisition with or without the Niobrara? I.e., does the success of the Niobrara factor into the decision to make that acquisition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It certainly had to. We had early results that look really good, and we felt like it was important for us to control our destiny in the field so we could maintain very constant line pressures on our gathering system as well as reap the benefits of improved processing margins and increasing liquid volumes, plant liquid volumes with the associated gas in the Niobrara. So it -- the whole system worked for us to put that together. And it was a tremendous value proposition for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'm just going to state the obvious here. I mean, you're going to drill 40 wells -- you're going to drill 40 well this year. You just made a big plant acquisition. You won't give us well results, but it's &#x2013; you're obviously encouraged. I mean, am I....</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>Okay. Okay. I'll move on. Well, I'll circle back to that some point and try to get some production data from you.</p>
          <p>Let me jump to Greater Natural Butte. It looks like NGLs were down quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Is that the cryo plant -- when does that hit, and is that -- are you running into some processing issues up there and should that alleviate those?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David, what we have is <mark type="ph" /> Chapita (34:48) Train 2 is a cryo plant, and during the quarter we've had excellent results with it. It's been running great. During the quarter we had an electrical outage on one of our pumps, generators there, so we were down for a few weeks. And so if you look at instantaneous rates, it's equal to the first quarter. We just had a period of downtime during the second quarter. That's back up and running now and at full rate and volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what's the cryo plant -- you're going from 250 million to 500 million?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're doing &#x2013; we hope it's in the order of about 12 months, is our expectation, 12 to 15 months, right in there. We're just now starting construction, and a lot of the infrastructure that we need is already there. We're building it on the same plant site that Train 2 is on, and it's just a little early days to pin down a completion date, but in the 12- to 15-month timeframe.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>No. No, I don't think so.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, guys. Good morning. Just two quick questions. The first one is on Algeria. Could you give a little color on sort of the political situation there, where things stand with Sonatrach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Al Walker. Little bit on that. We certainly, like everybody else, have been watching the Middle East and North Africa with a lot of interest since the first of the year. We and Sonatrach entered into a formal arbitration process in Paris in June. That's concluded.</p>
          <p>We continue to have discussions around TPE. We're certainly open to ideas that could be independent of what that arbitration tribunal might decide later this year with a ruling. We think our relations with Sonatrach are, despite all of that, are excellent.</p>
          <p>At the field level we continue to have really good results. El Merk is progressing pretty much on track with the expectations now of having things completed in 2012. And let's say in general the unrest in North Africa has certainly been a concern. We don't see any evidence of its impact on approximately the 40% of the country's production that we operate, and hopeful the issues around TPE'll get resolved by year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only thing I'd add to that is that as you recall we had probably $7 a share taken out of our stock at the time the TPE was passed. It would amount to more than that currently. We don't think there's any equity value in there for a settlement or for a favorable decision. And so from our perspective it's all upside from here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John, we're going through all the normal process of kicking off this LNG project. We actually had issued in a pre-feed contracts to start working through the scope and scale of the development. I think what we're most excited is the results from the drilling and appraisal program and our exploration team where they found a tremendous resource. And we're going through the process the balance of this year and early next year to really size that up. And once we have definition around that, just how big it is and it looks fairly substantial, once we see how big it is, we'll start closing in on what the design parameters are for the plant and then get into the actual process of feed and sanctioning that project in 2013-type timeframe.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="ph" /> Joe Nagner with Naserine Capital (39:52). Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. There's been a lot of discussion in the marketplace recently about the possibility for a settlement with BP. I'm not going to ask you to speculate as to the possibility that, but could you just remind us where things stand, what the mechanics of the arbitration process are from the two companies, the status of your lawsuit against BP? You touched upon the multi-phase litigation, but the status of your lawsuit with BP. And then timeline with respect to any outstanding investigations or reports or anything else that might affect the process there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this is Bobby Reeves. Let me just mention first that there's lot more detail that'll be in our 10-Q in footnote two, as we've done every quarter we will update that disclosure in the 10-Q to be filed later this week. I want to refer you specifically to that for details.</p>
          <p>But briefly there was a notice of dispute submitted by BP under the joint operating agreement. We're in a process of timeline as provided under that agreement to consider whether or not resolution is possible. After a particular time period, then either party can move forward with arbitration. We have not reached that time yet. And then that would invoke the timeline for arbitration which, at the earliest, would be sometime next year.</p>
          <p>With respect to settlement, we feel good still about our position that we've talked about for over a year now, but at the same time remain open to discussions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for that. And then there's discussion about how the next six to nine months could be amongst the most active in the company's history in deepwater Gulf of Mexico &#x2013; or deepwater exploration front. You touched on Heidelberg. You expect a permit there and the thought that Spartacus could move through the process quickly. Can you just give us any additional detail on your anticipated recovery of permitting or any other regulatory developments that you can shed additional light on, as to where things stand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Joe; this is Bob Daniels. Just on the rest of the wells, I touched on Heidelberg or Spartacus because those are the ones we operate, and we're moving those through the system; we have a most control over those. But our partners in other wells are moving and have -- progressing very well through the regulatory environment. And that would include Coronado and Yucatan over in the Shenandoah mini-basin where Chevron and Shell are both moving permits through the system. Vita, which is one of our discoveries that we have an interest in that Shell operates, they're moving permits through the system there.</p>
          <p>And then we're presently involved with the Cacouna well which is drilling. We have a carried working interest in that well. So they have successfully obtained a permit on that.</p>
          <p>So, while the process has been slow, people are getting greater clarity around what the requirements are, and the EPs and APDs are moving through the system. It's just needs to move through the system on a quicker pace. But we do anticipate quite an active second half of the year in both operated and unoperated wells and continue on into 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to summarize, it's more the process -- kind of getting the kinks worked out of the process more than any other things that need to fall into place or any other major...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly it. It's just understanding the new process and then what the requirements are under that, and making sure that it's a lot of give and take, or back and forth, I guess I would say, until there's some clarity around each step of the process. And once you've done it once, then it's much easier in the subsequent applications.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That's all I have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from the line of Scott Hanold with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Hey, could you all touch on in China the Biwan prospect, of when are we going to spud that, based on your best estimate? And remind us of how long it could take to drill that well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Scott. Bob Daniels. Right now our best estimate is it'll spud in the fourth quarter of this year. The rig is under contract. We're doing all of the detailed planning for the well. And they are doing essentially sea trials on the rig to make sure it's all ready to go. So end of the year late fourth quarter is when we look to spud that well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how long do you think it's going to take to get down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's probably about a 60- to 70-day well at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with the, I guess, results you all see when you get down there, I mean, how is that news flow going to work? Are you going to sort of be waiting for <mark type="ph" /> Seaneck (44:29) to take the lead, or will you be able to put something out independently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I would say it's just like all of our wells. You have to get approvals from both the partners as well as the host government on these international, so it'll be dependent upon as you get the approval stacked up on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one last question. On the Niobrara, I know you all had talked about looking for a JV partner potentially. Is that thought process changed based on what you've seen so far and, I guess, coupled with the fact that as your prior questioners appropriately indicated, you've got a lot of free cash flow, given the strength in Brent and whatnot?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is Al Walker, I think as it relates to a joint venture opportunity in the Niobrara like we have done with the other shale plays and other things that we have monetized, we will look at that when we think the opportunity's right. That opportunity could present itself in the near term or it may be a little longer. I just think you have to look at the fact that over the last five years, we've monetized substantially amount -- a substantial amount, rather, approaching $25 billion in assets. So we certainly have a track record of doing it the right time, and I just think I would lean on that track record more than looking at it prospectively.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. Thanks.</p>

          <p>All right, ladies and gentlemen, this conclude the Q&amp;A portion of the call. I'd now like to turn the presentation back over to Mr. Jim Hackett for closing remarks.</p>
