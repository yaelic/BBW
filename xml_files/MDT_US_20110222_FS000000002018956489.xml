          <p>Good morning. My name is Charla, and I will be your conference Operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Medtronic's Q3 Earnings Release Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>Thank you. Mr. Jeff Warren, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Charla. Good morning and welcome to Medtronic's third quarter conference call and webcast. During the next hour Bill Hawkins, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Gary Ellis, Chief Financial Officer, will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2011 third quarter, which ended January 28, 2011. After our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>First, few logistical comments, earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and a revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call maybe considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement.</p>
          <p>Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement.</p>
          <p>In addition, the reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors' portion of our website at medtronic.com.</p>
          <p>Finally, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the third quarter of fiscal year 2010 and all revenue growth rates are given on a constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>And with that, I am now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Hawkins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you, Jeff. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $4 billion which represents growth of 3% both on an as reported and a constant currency basis. Q3 non-GAAP earnings of $922 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.86 increased 8% and 12% respectively.</p>
          <p>Our Q3 growth reflects the difference our new innovative products are making. Q3 also reflects another quarter of relative stability as Medtronic continues to grow in line with our markets. We remain confident that as the global macroeconomic environment improves, so too will our markets as the underlying demand for innovative medical solutions to treat chronic diseases is only going to grow.</p>
          <p>As I look across the company, I'd like to highlight three areas where we continue to focus. First, we have built and are executing on a very robust pipeline of differentiated value-added technology to drive share in our core markets and growth in new markets. Second, Medtronic is increasingly well-positioned and executing on our plans to capture the tremendous growth opportunities in emerging markets. And finally, we are leveraging our size and scale to deliver superior financial performance. The healthcare world is changing and Medtronic is well-positioned to take advantage of these trends.</p>
          <p>So starting with our pipeline, our focus on innovation remains our principal strategy for growth. We are committed to executing on our pipeline to drive share in our core markets and growth in new markets. Spinal is a good example of this, where we are starting to realize the benefits of the investments we made to reinvigorate this important business.</p>
          <p>We are ramping up the launch of Solera, our new flagship posterior fixation system. During this first phase of Solera's launch we are excited about the positive surgeon feedback we continue to receive on the advantages of this more durable, versatile and smaller profile system.</p>
          <p>Solera, when integrated with our neuromonitoring, navigation and imaging platforms is changing the way spine surgery is performed. Navigated spine procedures allow for extremely precise placement of spinal implants while performing minimally invasive surgery which should lead to improved accuracy and enhanced patient safety. This differentiated technology is something only Medtronic is doing and it is starting to change the basis of competition in the spine market.</p>
          <p>The Solera launch builds on the recent introduction of two other posterior fixation platforms; VERTEX SELECT and the TSRH 3Dx but these systems are only a portion of our new Spinal products. Over the coming months we will be launching several new products including our new Atlantis Vision Elite Anterior Cervical Plate, the T2 ALTITUDE Expandable Corpectomy System, the HA Coated TSRH 3Dx OSTEOGRIP Screws and the new DLIF instrument sets.</p>
          <p>When you combine all of our innovative technologies with the outstanding service and support of our field force, we are reasserting our market leadership. Although we are still early in this product launch cycle, we are starting to see improved growth and market share performance. We are back in a growth mode with a differentiated growth trajectory versus the other large players in the space.</p>
          <p>Breakthrough innovation is by no means limited to our Spinal business. In CardioVascular we are seeing our new highly deliverable Integrity stent platform take share in both the drug eluting and bare metal stent markets. In fact, in our addressable markets where both Integrity bare metal stents and Resolute Integrity DES are available, we have achieved the number one position in total stent share.</p>
          <p>In drug eluding stents, our recently launched Resolute Integrity has been very well received resulting in 2 percentage points of share gains in international markets this quarter.</p>
          <p>In bare metal stents, the success of Integrity has pushed us to the number one global position. Our bare metal stent share is up nearly 9 percentage points in the U.S. this quarter on the strength of Integrity.</p>
          <p>In Endovascular, Endurant, our market leading abdominal stent graft in Europe market is now launching in the U.S. ahead of schedule. Endurant is off to a fantastic start and we are focusing on extending our U.S. market leadership.</p>
          <p>Turning to CRDM, we are very excited by the recent FDA approval of our Revo MRI SureScan. This is one of the most important advances in pacing since we introduced a rate adaptive pacemaker over 25 years ago. Revo is the first MRI compatible pacemaker to enter the U.S. market and we have a considerable head start on the competition. This exciting new technology is clearly capturing the interest of both physicians and patients. We believe this product will help to drive share and alleviate pricing pressure.</p>
          <p>We continue to work diligently with the FDA to resolve outstanding warning letters so that we are able to launch key new products including Protecta, our next generation ICD and CRT-D and InterStim Bowel, an important new indication for our InterStim franchise.</p>
          <p>Turning to our new markets, we had a number of successes this quarter including our acquisition of Ardian, which positions us well in hypertension, one of the largest and most exciting opportunities in MedTech. In our AF Solutions business, we received FDA approval for Arctic Front, the only cryoballoon ablation treatment that is approved in the U.S. for Paroxysmal AF. This innovative technology eliminates the need for time consuming point by point ablation and complex mapping and navigation. The launch is off to a great start and we are excited that all U.S. electrophysiologists will have access to this unique technology.</p>
          <p>In transcatheter valves, we continue to experience great success with CoreValve in international markets. This quarter, we started the CoreValve U.S. Pivotal study. We were also pleased by the FDA's approved modification of the extreme risk cohort to a single arm with a performance goal and no randomization. This is very positive for patients and should allow us to enroll this trial more quickly and effectively. In addition, subclavian access has been added to both arms of the trial, an important new option for patients who cannot be treated transfemorally.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we welcomed the results of the largest CoreValve registry to date published in circulation. The results affirmed the high rates of procedural success, low rates of adverse events, low mortality and substantial improvement of cardiac function that we continue to experience with CoreValve.</p>
          <p>Another important area for Medtronic is our increasing focus on emerging markets where we are extraordinarily well-positioned to capture the tremendous growth opportunities. In Q3 I was pleased by our continued strong performance in emerging markets where we grew over 20%. Revenue from emerging markets is now annualizing at $1.4 billion and represents nearly 9% of Medtronic's total sales. Over the next five-years, we expect that revenue mix to exceed 20%.</p>
          <p>Next month, we will hold the grand opening of our new China headquarters and physician training center in Shanghai as well as our new Asia manufacturing facility in Singapore. These are just two examples of the long-term investments we are making in emerging markets to drive sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>Last month, we were pleased to join 11 other companies as the initial participants in the U.S.-China Public-Private Partnership on Healthcare which is intended to foster long-term cooperation with China in the areas of research, training, regulation and patient access. Medtronic was elected to the PPPH board and is taking a leadership role in formulating strategies and policies that complement China's vision for providing modern, quality healthcare.</p>
          <p>Before I turn the call over to Gary, I would like to comment on Medtronic's ability to deliver superior financial performance by leveraging the benefits of our size and scale. Our industry leading margins allow us to generate significant cash flow.</p>
          <p>We take a balanced and a disciplined approach to investing our capital for sustainable growth while also returning capital to shareholders. In Q3, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have returned over 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Medtronic remains committed to returning a minimum of 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we continue to strategically invest in areas with significant growth potential. We constantly strive to efficiently allocate and leverage our resources while ensuring Medtronic's cost structure is right sized to current market conditions. Accordingly, we announced this morning that we will be restructuring our business through a combination of cost-saving measures, tighter expense management and workforce reductions. And while these actions are in part due to current market conditions, they are more an outcome of our ongoing efforts to drive leverage across the enterprise. It is never easy to make these decisions, but we believe that this is the right thing to do for Medtronic to continue to position the company for long-term sustainable growth.</p>
          <p>In the new and changing healthcare environment, Medtronic's size and scale will be an important key to winning. Our market-leading technologies and the breadth of our portfolio puts us in a position of strength when facing our competition and serving our customers around the globe. Our functional expertise and world-class capabilities provide us with a significant competitive advantage in MedTech. We remain committed to executing our long-term growth strategies and delivering sustainable market leading performance.</p>
          <p>So, Gary will now take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bill. Third quarter revenue of $3.961 billion increased 2.9% as reported or 3.4% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for our $22 million unfavorable effect of foreign currency. Breaking this out geographically, revenue in the U.S. of $2.259 billion grew 1%, while international sales of $1.702 billion increased 7%.</p>
          <p>Q3 international revenue results by region were as follows: Greater China grew 29%. Growth in Latin America was 28%. Middle East and Africa grew 13%. Growth in other Asia was 8%. Europe and Central Asia grew 6%. Canada grew 1%. And Japan declined 7%.</p>
          <p>GAAP earnings and diluted earnings per share were $924 million and $0.86, an increase of 11% and 15% respectively. After adjusting for several unusual items which had a net after-tax impact of only $2 million, third quarter earnings and diluted earnings per sure on a non-GAAP basis were $922 million and $0.86, an increase of 8% and 12% respectively.</p>
          <p>This quarter's pre-tax adjustments included a $13 million net charge for legal matters, a $39 million net benefit from IPRD (sic) [IPR&amp;D] and certain acquisition-related costs which including an $85 million gain resulting from our minority investment in Ardian, a $14 million charge recorded in SG&amp;A for costs related to the retirement and transition of our CEO and a $44 million noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense.</p>
          <p>In our Cardiac and Vascular group, revenue of $2.099 billion grew 2%. Results were driven by strong growth in Structural Heart, Endovascular and AF Solutions, offset by modest declines in CRDM implantables.</p>
          <p>CRDM revenue of $1.221 billion declined 1%, roughly in line with the worldwide CRDM market. Looking ahead, we would expect similar market performance in Q4. Although we expect our results to be in line with the market, it is important to note that our Q4 CRDM growth rate will be negatively affected by tough comparisons due to the benefit from a competitor stopped shipment last year which had an approximate 500 basis point positive impact.</p>
          <p>Worldwide ICD revenue of $735 million declined 2%. Our U.S. ICD business declined 4% and the U.S. ICD market declined in the low single-digits. U.S. ICD pricing pressure trends remain stable this quarter with mid single-digit declines. We expect pricing pressure to improve when we launch Protecta.</p>
          <p>We continue to make progress on our effort to expand our CRT-D indications in the U.S. In Q3 we filed results of the RAFT trial with the FDA which showed CRT-D therapy reduced mortality in mildly symptomatic heart failure patients.</p>
          <p>Our international ICD business grew 1% and the international ICD market grew in the mid single-digits. In Europe, we estimate we lost 180 basis points of share sequentially as we faced year-end pushes from our competitors as well as increased pressure in the value segment of the market.</p>
          <p>Protecta continues to perform very well on the premium segment and we are pleased to see the positive impact it is having on share and price.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are launching a number of new products in Europe this month to further bolster our market-leading portfolio. In the premium segment, we are launching DF4 versions of our Protecta and Vision 3D devices. We are also releasing our new Cardia and EGIDA CRTDs and ICDs which will improve our competitive position in the European value segment.</p>
          <p>The majority of our international underperformance came in Japan where we lost several percentage points of share sequentially due to a competitive product launch as well as an unusually strong year-end push by our competition. In Q4, we expect to launch Protecta XT in Japan which should improve our competitiveness.</p>
          <p>Pacing revenue of $450 million declined 2% while the market declined in the low to mid single-digits. Our U.S. pacing business declined 6% driven mainly by pricing pressure. We are pleased to have received FDA approval for the Revo MRI SureScan pacemaker earlier this month. The launch is off to a good start and we believe this innovative device will improve pricing and drive share.</p>
          <p>Our international pacing business grew 2% returning to growth for the first time in six quarters. The international pacing market declined in the low single-digits. In Europe, the success of our MRI pacemakers continues to alleviate pricing pressure which is now only declining in the low single-digits.</p>
          <p>Our AF Solutions business grew in excess of 30% driven by the continued adoption of our Arctic Front Cryoballoon in international markets. As Bill mentioned, we are excited about the U.S. launch of Arctic Front and the early positive feedback we are receiving from electrophysiologists.</p>
          <p>CardioVascular revenue of $774 million grew 8%, including 10% growth in international markets.</p>
          <p>Coronary and Peripheral revenue of $401 million grew 4% which includes $33 million of revenue from Invatec. Worldwide drug eluting stent revenue in the quarter was $184 million, including $47 million in the U.S. and $22 million in Japan. While the stent market continues to experience year-over-year declines, we are taking share with our highly deliverable Integrity platform. Looking ahead, we are pleased to see that the Resolute U.S. one year data will be presented in a late breaking clinical at ACC in April.</p>
          <p>Structural Heart revenue of $241 million increased 13%. Structural Heart growth continues to be driven in part by the strong adoption of CoreValve in international markets. We continue to split the market with our competitor and we are the clear leader in the transfemoral segment. In surgical heart valves, our ATS Medical integration activities are going well, with ATS adding 700 basis points to our Structural Heart growth in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Endovascular, revenue of $132 million grew 12%. In the U.S., revenue growth of 6% was driven by the launch of the Endurant abdominal stent graft late in the quarter which increased our AAA share by 400 basis points sequentially. In Europe, we also gained 400 basis points of share sequentially in both the abdominal and thoracic markets on the continued strength of the Endurant abdominal and Valiant, Captiva thoracic stent grafts.</p>
          <p>Physio-Control revenue of $104 million grew 5%, driven by double-digit growth of both the LIFEPAK 15 for the pre hospital market and the LIFEPAK 20e for the hospital market. In Q3, we launched the LIFENET system 5.0, the next generation of our web-based data network for emergency medical services and hospital care teams.</p>
          <p>Similar to our competition, Physio-Control's growth was affected by softness in the pre-hospital market as municipalities continued to face budget constraints. We expect this weak demand to continue in Q4. In addition, we will face a tougher comparison in Q4 due to the strong growth we experienced last year from pent-up demand after we resumed unrestricted global shipments.</p>
          <p>Now that the business has been operating at full strength for the past year and performing well, we believe it is the right time to reinitiate our efforts to divest Physio-Control. As we are just restarting this process, we do not have any specifics on timing but will keep you posted on our progress.</p>
          <p>Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group, revenue of $1.862 billion grew 5%. Growth was driven by another quarter of solid performances in Diabetes and Surgical Technologies as well as renewed growth in Spinal.</p>
          <p>Spinal revenue of $861 million grew 2%. We continue to see stability in the global spine market with market growth remaining in the range of 3% to 4% for the third quarter in a row. We also continue to be encouraged with the improving growth trajectory of our spinal business.</p>
          <p>In core Spinal, defined in our reportable results as core metal core constructs, IPDs and Kyphon, revenue of $626 million declined 1%. However, it is important to note that excluding Kyphon and IPDs, core metal constructs were up 2%.</p>
          <p>In January, we ramped up the launch of Solera, nearly quadrupling the number of sets in the field and we are pleased to see the impact Solera is having on share and pricing. Our TSRH 3Dx System is also posting very solid growth. We continue to take share in the direct lateral market although competitive pricing is affecting market growth of this segment. We expect our DLIF solution to be navigation enabled this summer.</p>
          <p>Kyphon revenue declined 5% and was flat sequentially and we were pleased to see sequential improvement in our procedure volumes. We remain focused on generating evidence to support the clinical and economic benefits of BKP. Earlier this month, results from three BKP clinical studies were published, two in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research and one in The Lancet Oncology. All three studies continue to build the body of clinical evidence demonstrating the unique benefits of Medtronic's BKP technology.</p>
          <p>Turning to Biologics, revenue of $235 million grew 10%. Results were driven by our Osteotech acquisition which added approximately 9 percentage points of growth, stabilizing InFuse sales that grew 1% as well as a strong performance in Other Biologics. The Osteotech integration is exceeding our plans and the transition from Osteotech's distributors to our sales force is nearly complete with limited disruption. We estimate that our share of the U.S. DBM market has nearly doubled to over 30%.</p>
          <p>Neuromodulation revenue of $401 million increased 3%. Results were driven by mid-teens growth in InterStim and high single-digit growth in DBS partially offset by small declines in drug pumps and pain stim where we experienced softness in demand.</p>
          <p>In pain stim, our RestoreSensor with its proprietary AdaptiveStim technology continues to gain traction in Europe. RestoreSensor was approved in Canada and Australia in Q3 and we continue to make progress on bringing this breakthrough technology to the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>In Gastro/Uro, InterStim had high-teens U.S. growth and we look forward to the prospect of indication expansion to sustain its trajectory.</p>
          <p>Diabetes revenue of $341 million grew 11% driven by double-digit growth in global insulin pumps. Veo, with its Low Glucose Suspend feature and Revel continue to lead in their respective markets. Our market leading continuous glucose monitoring business continues to post robust growth as we remain the only company with sensor augmented pumps.</p>
          <p>Surgical Technologies revenue of $259 million grew 8% or 10% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Ophthalmic business in FY'10. The solid growth was driven by strong performances across the portfolio of ENT, Power Systems and Navigation product lines as well as balanced growth across capital equipment, disposables and service. Despite economic headwinds, hospital capital expenditures remained strong for our differentiated technology in both the U.S. and European markets.</p>
          <p>Turning to the rest of the income statement, the gross profit margin was 75.1% compared to 75.4% last quarter. While ASPs and product LBMs were consistent with our expectations, the gross profit margin came in 50 to 60 basis points below our expectations primarily due to obsolescence and post acquisition inventory adjustments. In Q4, we would expect the gross margin to be back to approximately 75.5%.</p>
          <p>Third quarter R&amp;D spending of $371 million was 9.4% of revenue. We remain committed to prudently investing in our core platforms and new technologies to drive sustainable long-term growth. In Q4, we expect R&amp;D spending to be in the range of 9% to 9.5% of revenue.</p>
          <p>Third quarter SG&amp;A expense was $1.394 billion. Excluding the $14 million expense related to the retirement and transition of our CEO, SG&amp;A expense on a non-GAAP basis was 34.8% of sales compared to 35.1% of sales last quarter. SG&amp;A expense was negatively affected by the recent acquisitions and additional bad debt reserves in certain markets. Exclusive of one-time adjustments, we expect Q4 SG&amp;A to be approximately 33% of revenue, which reflects our focus on an initiate to continue to leverage SG&amp;A despite the impact of slower markets, product delays and recent acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Net other expense for the quarter was $153 million, compared to $148 million in the prior year. Other expense includes $86 million of noncash amortization expense as well as $15 million in FX hedging losses. In addition, included for the first time this quarter is a $9 million expense from the recently implemented excise tax in Puerto Rico. This represents one month's impact and it is important to note that this additional expense is almost entirely offset by a corresponding tax benefit that I will discuss in a moment.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead, based on current FX rates, we anticipate Q4 net other expense will be in the range of $160 million to $180 million which includes an anticipated $10 million to $20 million in hedging losses as well as an estimated $25 million to $30 million expense from the Puerto Rico excise tax.</p>
          <p>Net interest expense for the quarter was $70 million. Excluding the $44 million noncash charge for convertible debt interest expense, non-GAAP net interest expense was $26 million.</p>
          <p>At the end of Q3 we had approximately $9 billion in cash and cash investments. Looking ahead, we expect our cash position to continue to increase over the long run, although it should be noted that we will have $2.2 billion of convertible debt repayment occurring in April.</p>
          <p>We expect low interest rates will negatively affect our return on our cash. In Q4, we anticipate non-GAAP net interest expense will be in the range of $25 million to $35 million. In Q3, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow defined as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Going forward, we expect to continue to generate free cash flow in excess of $1 billion per quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to tax, our effective tax rate as reported was 8.8%. Our adjusted non-GAAP nominal tax rate was 11.8% but would have been closer to 21% before adjusting for several discrete items including a $68 million net benefit associated with the resolution of our IRS audits for fiscal years 1997 through 1999, the finalization of certain foreign audits and changes to uncertain tax position reserves, a $28 million catch-up benefit associated with the retroactive renewal and extension of the U.S. R&amp;D tax credit and the previously mentioned $8 million one month benefit for the recently enacted Puerto Rico excise tax which offsets the charge recorded in other expense.</p>
          <p>Exclusive of onetime adjustments, we continue to expect our Q4 tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21.5%, however this is before taking into account the benefit related to the Puerto Rico excise tax which is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4.</p>
          <p>Third quarter weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.078 billion shares. During the third quarter, we repurchased $380 million of our common stock. At the end of Q3, we had remaining capacity to repurchase approximately 21 million shares under our board authorized stock repurchase plan. For fiscal 2011, we anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 1.083 billion shares.</p>
          <p>As before, we have attached an income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement to this quarter's press release and I direct your attention to these statements for additional financial details.</p>
          <p>Let me conclude by commenting on our outlook and guidance. This morning, we reiterated our revenue outlook and tightened our FY'11 earnings per share guidance. We believe the current Q4 revenue consensus of $4.3 billion appears reasonable and would reflect adjusted constant currency revenue growth of 3% after taking into account a $70 million benefit from a competitor's stopped shipment last year as well as an expected $60 million to $70 million positive FX impact in Q4 based on current exchange rates.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings per share, at this point in the year, we are comfortable tightening our earnings per share guidance range. Our previously stated guidance of $3.38 to $3.44 did not include the impact from our Ardian acquisition. After tightening the range to $3.40 to $3.42 and then including the expected $0.02 impact from the Ardian dilution in Q4, we expect FY'11 earnings per share in the range of $3.38 to $3.40. Current FY'11 earnings per share consensus of $3.40 appears reasonable. However, when we look at the current Q4 earnings per share consensus, it appears that most estimates have not taken into account the $0.02 of Ardian dilution.</p>
          <p>We are currently in the planning process for FY'12 and we intend to give FY'12 guidance on our Q4 earnings call in May. During this planning process, we are focused on looking at resource allocation and continuing to drive leverage in our overall cost structure. While these plans are not yet final, and we are not ready to discuss specific details, based on our current expectations, we intend to reduce our global workforce during Q4 by 1,500 to 2,000 positions or 4% to 5%. This would result in us recognizing a related restructuring charge in Q4.</p>
          <p>As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the fiscal year, nor do they include the effect of noncash convertible debt interest expense.</p>
          <p>I will now turn things back over to Bill who will conclude our prepared remarks. Bill.</p>

          <p>So thanks, Gary. Before turning to Q&amp;A, I want to note as you all know, I recently announced my intention to retire at the end of the fiscal year. Our Board of Directors is in the process of looking for my successor and their search is progressing well. And although we do not have any new information at this point, we will update you when we have more news to share.</p>
          <p>At this point, I expect this to be my last Medtronic earnings call. I would like to say that it has truly been an honor and a privilege to lead the finest medical technology company in the world. And while I'm excited about the prospects of new endeavors, I feel extremely proud of what we have accomplished over the past several years. When you take into account our robust pipeline, our outstanding leadership team and our ability to capture new opportunities in emerging markets and emerging technologies, I could not be more excited for the future of this great company.</p>
          <p>And with that, Gary, I'd like now to open things up for Q&amp;A. In the interest of getting to as many questions as possible, we would respectively request that each caller limit themselves to one question with one follow-up. Operator, first question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, when you look at the businesses this quarter, it looks like you're down to two businesses that are still kind of problem areas when you look at market share, ICDs and neurostimulation. So in your view, especially in the U.S., is it really a matter of getting Protecta out in ICDs, Restore and the InterStim indication that will drive you back to holding, maybe gaining share? Or is there more structurally you need to do? And then if you could layer in there also in Japan, in ICDs, you have lost a lot of share there the last couple of years. When do you see that stabilizing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Matt, this is Gary. Overall, as you said, what we've seen clearly in both CRDM and neuro and let me address each one kind of individually. CRDM, as you indicated, we have maintained share in certain markets. We lost a little share this quarter in some of the international markets, more so than anything else. We are excited about the new products. I think within CRDM as far as market share goes, we are seeing the impact of Protecta and the MRI SureScan product are having an impact both on international markets and we're excited about getting those in the U.S. So we think that will help not only maintain our share and potentially gain share but also stabilize pricing as we've talked about.</p>
          <p>So I think on the CRDM &#x2013; and then we've talked about obviously in the international markets, especially in Europe, where we lost share was in the value segments. And we're launching a couple of new products in that category to stabilize that share and gain share back in the European marketplace.</p>
          <p>Japan, as you said, we have lost share the last couple of years in various categories. Part of that was obviously related to the Fidelis, there was more of an impact in Fidelis in that marketplace probably more than any other. But I think recently here what we've seen is the new products, the Protecta that I mentioned we're going to be launching in Japan will clearly have an impact in our ability to again maintain share in Japan and regain some share direction. So in CRDM, we have been stabilized. These new products are important and we are seeing the benefits of those where they are launched.</p>
          <p>Neuro is the same way. We need to get some of the new products approved and RestoreSensor is important not only in the U.S., but also the other indication for fecal incontinence in the InterStim product line that will clearly drive that business because InterStim and DBS for &#x2013; in the Neuromodulation business continue to do very, very well, where it's been pain stim where we've been struggling a little bit. That's also been part of a market issue. The market has been somewhat soft also in pain stim. But we would expect RestoreSensor we're seeing that help us maintain share in the European markets and when we can launch that in the U.S., I think that will actually help us drive share also here in the U.S.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And Gary, just one little quick question. On the restructuring do you have a range of how big a charge we're talking about for next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We really don't at this point, Matt. It's too early to tell. We're still assessing where the employees are even at as far as geographically and what the impact of that is all going to be. So we really don't have an estimate at this point of what the charge would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Gary.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of following up on the restructuring, how should we think about the savings going forward from this plan as it rolls out into 2011 &#x2013; or 2012 rather?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Gary again. Again, we don't have the details on exactly what that amount is going to be. As we talked about, the effort we're trying to do here is just kind of an ongoing part of our overall process to leverage the organization and make sure that we are driving efficiency throughout the company. We also are obviously acknowledging the fact that our markets are somewhat softer and we've had to readdress the infrastructure to reduce it to what our market growths are at this point in time. What that savings is at this level, we don't have any estimate for that. We will by the time we put together our &#x2013; in our Q4 earnings call we'll have a better estimate. But again, right now, all we know is it's between 1,500 and 2,000 employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the gross margin, I know that you had said that if not for some of the obsolescence charges we would have been, I guess, more in line with where your expectations were. What specifically were the charges that were taken? What business unit were they in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the obsolescence charges, the good news about &#x2013; is we are launching some new products. The Endovascular Endurant product we mentioned, some of the other products, Solera we have some set cost but the impact of launching new products means that you have some old products that are becoming obsolete. And so the reality is we had some charges in our cardiovascular business related to some of those new products and also a little bit in the spine area.</p>
          <p>In addition, we had some of the acquisition costs. As we pull in the acquisitions, there's a step-up in purchase accounting you have to do and then there's also just some inventory adjustments as we brought some of these new acquisitions in that were impacting the quarter and obviously, those would have been also in Spine and CV where some of the acquisition were at. So it's primarily in those two businesses where we saw the one-time charges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the total of those two are 50 to 60 basis points you said?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with J.P. Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. A couple of clarifications, Gary, if I can, the fourth quarter, are you guys implying $0.91 to $0.93?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reality is with the Ardian dilution, what we're saying is again the $3.38 to $3.40. So if you just do the math, you're absolutely right that you'll end up with basically I think more around the $0.93, is where you're going to end up because I think the consensus right now is $0.95. And you take the Ardian dilution into place and you can kind of get to that $0.93.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Then let me ask just a couple of other items. The restructuring, can you give us &#x2013; and it sounds like it's very early but can you give us any insights into where you'll be making the cuts, either in what businesses will the cuts come and within what segments, R&amp;D, sales, manufacturing?</p>
          <p>And then second, just turning back to this quarter, pre-tax income declined almost 6% this quarter, which was worse than I think than probably the company was modeling, I think it's worse than the Street was modeling. So I guess I just would appreciate some visibility on the tax side in terms of when you saw some of these tax windfalls coming through? Because I know in early January, you guys had commented that you were comfortable with the consensus then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as the restructuring and where it's at, again, we're not going to get specific about which businesses or which geographies or even which kind of a function we'll be addressing because it's going to be across the company. I mean, we're going to evaluate our employee complement across the organization and determine where we need to make some adjustments overall.</p>
          <p>You can obviously assume from the standpoint of as we look at this, there are some markets and some businesses that are growing very dramatically. So whether it's emerging markets or some of the even emerging therapies or obviously in some of the acquisitions, that's not where we're going to be primarily focused. It's going to be more on those businesses and geographies, developed markets, for example, where it's been a little slower, where the markets have slowed down. But that's all we're going to say at this point in time. And again, it's primarily going to be focused on infrastructure cost, not to say there won't be some impact on the sales or R&amp;D side, but the fact of the matter is it's primarily infrastructure related to all those is what we're trying to focus on as we go forward.</p>
          <p>With respect to the pre-tax earnings and the complication really of all the things happening on the tax line here this quarter, overall yes, we would have expected our pre-tax earnings to be a little bit higher as we went through the quarter. And the primary surprise was really on that gross margin as I mentioned earlier. We would have expected as I mentioned in my comments the gross margin to be closer to 75.5% to 75.6%. So that was a little bit of a surprise that we had not expected. So that impacted us.</p>
          <p>The other thing that's compounding the issue on the pre-tax side and kind of complicating the whole issue is this Puerto Rico excise tax issue I mentioned earlier, which is actually reducing our pre-tax profits, but then there's a credit on the tax line itself. That's the accounting that basically the accounting firms have come up with for all of us that are operating in Puerto Rico are going to have to do. And so that complicates a little bit even your pre-tax, what's the growth rate or in this case as you said, a slight decline from where we've been at previously. So from our perspective, that's something we're going to &#x2013; the Puerto Rico tax thing is just something we're going to have to deal with going forward and it's going to be a reclass between pre-tax and after-tax numbers. So overall, that's kind of explaining what's going on.</p>
          <p>Now, back to the restructuring, that's the intent of the restructuring. We obviously are seeing that our pre-tax earnings are not where we need them to be. We need to continue in these little bit slower markets, we're going to have to take some costs out. And that's what we're attempting to do here and so we're getting ahead of the game and trying to address that as we move into FY'12.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, thanks for taking the question. Bill, I have a couple of questions. One on AMPLIFY. What's the likelihood that that will be approved? And if it's not approved, what's the risk to the franchise given commercial payer reaction or Medicare reaction?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the U.S. ICD market, I think it's down between 1% and 2% this quarter. Do you anticipate a kind of reequilibration at sites that were kind of noncompliant as judged by the JAMA article? And what do you see the trajectory over the next several quarters for that key market? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first on AMPLIFY, again we &#x2013; a point of clarification, this is not INFUSE. This is kind of a new indication and it is a new kind of formulation. We're continuing to work with the FDA to figure out kind of where they are on this. We were encouraged by the panel vote which was in support of the approval. And so as we learn more, we'll let you know. But it's really &#x2013; it's incremental to kind of our current business. And so if there was a reason for the FDA to delay this anymore, it's not going to have a significant impact. It won't have any really impact on our current business. It's really all upside for us.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify that, Bill, you don't feel that not having, like posterior lumbar fusion is probably the biggest off-label to use of INFUSE. And you don't think not getting AMPLIFY approved could result in a retrenchment there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We've been very clear with our people in terms of the appropriate indications for INFUSE. And so I don't see anything that would change as a result of AMPLIFY not getting approved. So again, really there is a different formulation. It's really a different product than INFUSE.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the ICD question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So on the ICD. Yes, the market was this quarter down about a percent. And the U.S., we think that there has been some sort of short-term impact because of the JAMA and the DOJ. I think that is a &#x2013; it's a short-term impact. I think that hospitals are having to adjust a little bit to making sure that they are in conformance with the appropriate guidelines. But, I take a step back. I continue to be encouraged that this is a large patient population. It is a big market opportunity. And I think we're in just a little bit of an air pocket here that's a result of the reaction to the JAMA to the DOJ article. But we did see this quarter a little bit of continuation of what we've seen in the last couple of quarters where the market is in that sort of flat to down here in the U.S. And it's modestly up outside the U.S.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Gary, first to start off, there's a lot of moving parts here in terms of tax rate to be thinking about and hedging gains and losses going forward and the restructuring. I was wondering as it relates to 2012, the current consensus is $3.64. Are you comfortable at this point suggesting that that is reasonably in the ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, Bob, I'm not going to give any guidance on FY'12 as far as what our guidance would be at this point in time. We haven't given any guidance previously for FY'12 and so I'm not at this point either. We'll do that in our Q4 earnings call. There were a lot of moving parts here in the quarter especially on the tax rate and the other income and expense. It's been complicated by this Puerto Rico excise tax issue. I think some of the things that you saw in the quarter with the retroactive obviously R&amp;D credit, et cetera, will be just based on the rate going forward so it's not going to be a catch-up, it'll just have it in the rate adjustment. So I think there's nothing that occurred here in the quarter that necessarily changes my outlook for FY'12 and that's about the only thing I can tell you at this point in time. But we're not going to give any guidance at this level as far as what is appropriate for FY'12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But then just to talk maybe a little bit more granularly about the tax rate going forward and how we should be thinking about that in light of all the moving parts and the hedging gains and losses going forward, how we should be thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall from the standpoint on foreign exchange overall right now, we see that relatively flat year-on-year. We have hedged next year a big portion of where we're at. We don't see a big headwind, we don't see a big benefit. Basically we are hedged at rates that are relatively close to where we're at here in the current year. We're not completely hedged but for where the rates are right now I feel pretty comfortable that there's not a big change there.</p>
          <p>On the tax rate itself as we indicated, our overall effective tax rate ignoring this Puerto Rico tax issue right now would have been more around kind of in that 21% range. And we think that's probably still going to be appropriate going forward. But again, this Puerto Rico excise tax thing will have an impact on probably reduced net effective tax rate as you look at it by about 3 percentage points as you go and move ahead because you're going to have $25 million to $30 million a quarter coming through the tax that's offsetting the other income and expense line items. So we have to go through the calculations and figure it out, but my guess is we get into next year, you're going to have effective tax rate that's closer to the high teens. And we'll give you more detail as we get into the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I want to maybe add one comment, maybe just an inference of your previous question, Bob, in terms of just sort of &#x2013; we're not going to give guidance on the outlook for next year, but I would just remind you that we do feel very good about kind of our new product portfolio. As we get through the warning letters, the CRDM with Protecta and now with the MRI here in the U.S., we think that that's going to be a catalyst. A lot of the new products that we're just now launching, the Endurant, the AF are off to a very good start so we're excited about CoreValve. I mean, there's just a lot in the pipeline, the neuro side as well with &#x2013; as we get through the warning letter and InterStim valve. So I mean we're making the tough decisions and the restructuring to position ourselves to deliver profitable growth. And we feel that we've got a good pipeline that's going to enable us to accelerate growth for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gary, just a quick follow-up on the restructuring. I know you're not giving details but as we think about this conceptually, should we be thinking about this restructuring as largely dropping through to the bottom line and being accretive to earnings or are there significant chunks of reinvestment that we may be missing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, from our perspective, obviously a lot of this will go to the bottom line. We do this as we focus on &#x2013; we don't think about these costs necessarily dropping to the bottom line. We take a look at our entire cost structure and say what investments do we need to make? What kind of profitability improvement do we need to have and where do we need to see the leverage occurring? And then we backed into where do we think we have opportunities to reduce our overall infrastructure cost.</p>
          <p>So overall, what you could assume by doing these things, that yes, you will see more leverage in the P&amp;L as we move forward. And so that will clearly impact and have a benefit dropping to the bottom line. But these continue to be activities that we take to make sure we're achieving our objectives on delivering the profits to our shareholders, but also to ensure that we can make the investments to drive the growth in some of the markets that we've been talking about, both the emerging therapies and some of the emerging markets geographically. So it's a combination.</p>

          <p>Okay. Then, Bill, just one quick follow-up here on emerging markets. It looked like the emerging market business accelerated a little bit this quarter sequentially. So I wonder if that was stocking new products or entrance into new markets. And maybe you can share with us, given emerging markets is becoming a much more substantial component of overall corporate growth, what we can think about in terms of a sustainable growth rate for those emerging markets maybe just the next few years? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we said big picture we think that we can see emerging markets becoming 20% of our mix in the next five years. I mean it has been growing 20-plus percent for the last number of quarters, if not number of years. Yeah, this was &#x2013; it was another good quarter. China contributed approximately $30 million of incremental revenue year-on-year and represents almost 3% of our total Medtronic revenue now. China is, again we said this for the last year or so, I mean, we've been making over the last several years big investments to take advantage of what we think that China will be a very strong market for years to come.</p>
          <p>India is a bit behind, but we're seeing very good growth rates in India. Latin America is doing very well. So it's really pretty balanced across many of the overall emerging markets. And so if you look at today again, as I said in my commentary, roughly 9% to 10% of our revenues come out of the emerging markets and we expect that to almost double the next five years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But overall profit margins, and again as we've said before on the &#x2013; international profit margins are basically the same as they are in the U.S. and emerging markets the same way. I mean in total, they are basically consistent with where we're at across the company. Obviously, it will vary by market, but in general the emerging markets have a profit margin that's very consistent with the corporate level.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the questions. Bill, I was hoping you could maybe extrapolate a little bit more on the new product launches. You launched Solera in January. And your Spine business although stable, we didn't see much of an improvement. Could you maybe help us understand the timing and pacing of when we should start to see a significant impact on the P&amp;L from some of the products you're launching? Maybe using, if you look at pacing for an example, I think this is the first quarter in several quarters where you've seen growth out of Europe and you launched Revo I think over a year ago. Is that the right thing to say, is it 12 months till we start to see traction? And maybe you could take us through the launch timelines.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is a bill of a flywheel effect here particularly in the Spine side. When you're making big investments in the capital and instrument sets to get out there and drive the procedures. And we commented in the last quarter or so that we've been investing in the instrument sets and we're now getting those into the field which are going to drive the procedures. And where we have the sets and where we are in the accounts, we're seeing very good growth.</p>
          <p>And so we are very optimistic that Solera is going to be a terrific product platform for us. But it's not just Solera. I mean, the TSH (sic) [TSRH] 3Dx, the Vertex Select as well as even some of the DLIF products. I mean DLIF had another very strong quarter. So we are very encouraged by the kind of the momentum that's building, particularly on the spine side.</p>
          <p>On the pacing side, again, I want to make sure that people understand there's a big difference between the U.S. and the OUS in terms of what we think is the opportunity for Revo. I mean, Revo is doing well in the European markets but remember Revo is dual chamber only and in Europe, dual chamber is roughly 50% or a little bit less of the total market. In the U.S., dual chamber is 80%. And the same thing for active fixation leads which in Europe it's roughly 50%. In the U.S. active fixation, which is what we have MRI safe is 80%.</p>
          <p>I was in the field last week on Friday with a few of our reps and I can just tell you there is tremendous excitement and enthusiasm about MRI safe. I think it's a different opportunity here in the U.S. than what we've seen in the markets outside the U.S. And we're pretty bullish that this is going to be a product platform that, as I made the comment, sort of like what we saw with the Activitrax years ago. This is going to enable us to gain real meaningful share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to add to Bill's comment, the only thing I would add to what he has said is the other thing you have to remember is we do see new technologies adopted quicker generally across the board in the U.S. And the reason that is to some extent is outside the U.S., especially in the European markets you have these tenders and everything else that you have to get things to be a part of. And just that takes a little bit longer process to get the products into the marketplace and them to really have an impact. But clearly in the U.S., we tend to see new products start off quicker. And back to Bill's point, we really do believe that especially with the MRI SureScan, that that clearly will be well received in this marketplace.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And are you willing at this point &#x2013; I know it's early in the launch &#x2013; to give us some sense as to directionally the relative pricing you're able to achieve on some of these new products and is the price premium on new products sufficient to fully offset the impact of negative like-for-like pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on the pacing side, we do think that there's real value in this product. And we, again, we're only out there for a week and we are seeing that customers are rewarding us with a premium for this product. So anyway, we think that that will offset, yes, the dynamics of kind of market growth and that we'll see that our growth will be positive with Revo.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how about on the Spine side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, same thing. In the Spine side, we're probably less of a premium on the Solera on a relative basis. But it's really in this case I mean, we're using Solera to actively go after market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking the question. Is there any update on the FDA warning letter? You're starting to get some &#x2013; or at least one product approved but anything that you can share with us on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we were encouraged that the FDA approved the MRI safe. And I was actually in the FDA again last week. And again, I am cautiously optimistic that this is &#x2013; we're going to see the warning letters get lifted and we'll be able to get these products on the market, as I said a while ago, sooner rather than later. But we have completed all the follow-ups with the FDA and we've been meeting with the FDA on a regular basis. And so I'm, again I remain optimistic that this is going to happen sooner rather than later.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is there anything that you can broadly discuss on price? It sounds like in certain areas you're still seeing negative 3%, negative 4% type of price pressure and other areas you're starting to gain that back, somewhat with differentiated products but could you give us a big picture view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's all about new products. And again, as I made the comment on the Revo MRI, I mean, we think that that's going to &#x2013; will enable us to bring the price back up. The same thing on Solera, less so but again when we bring out new product, that's our opportunity to really sort of move the price back up. So I mean as we replenish, as we continue to bring forth new products that we've been investing in, that's going to help us to offset some of the price pressures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My final question has to do with Spine. For a while now, you've been talking about trying to get back to the market growth rate, albeit the market growth rate keeps going down or maybe stable, I'd like your view on that. Could you please comment on how long you think it will take for you to get back to a market growth rate? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Gary again. From overall as I had mentioned, we think the market growth rate overall has been stable the last three quarters, kind of in that 3% to 4% range. If you take a look at our core metal constructs we grew 2% this quarter. And as Bill mentioned with Solera and everything else, we think as we go through Q4 here and we enter into FY'12, we will be back to market growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good luck, Bill.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have time for just a couple more questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On Physio-Control, could you give us a sense, Gary, as to how the operating margins for that division compare relative to overall company average margins? And I guess the question I'm getting to here, is it reasonable to assume that this will be a pretty accretive transaction if sort of the operating margins are well below company average?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Overall Physio-Control's gross margins and operating margins are probably some of the lower ones in the company overall and clearly below the company's average. So that will be accretive from the standpoint of our overall margins. Again, the primary reason we've talked about this strategically of divesting this business, that we talked about even two, three years ago, is we just think actually Physio-Control strategically is not benefiting Medtronic as much as we would like to see with that business.</p>
          <p>But more importantly, we think that they alone or being spun off or divested and can do much better themselves. It's just hard for them to, because of those margin issues I just mentioned, it's hard for them to ever compete against the investments we have to make. And so overall, we think this is better for them. It's better for the company in general. And we've talked about this, this has been a strategic decision that we made a long time ago, but we wanted to get through the, making sure the business was back and running effectively and it is. It's a nice business. But I think will be better if we divest from the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And next year you're going to be anniversarying some of the reimbursement cuts in Japan. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about which businesses might benefit most from that and overall from a company perspective, what's the level of impact that you would see on overall company pricing next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you said, we are yes, as of beginning of April anniversarying against those Japan price cuts. Which were probably the most felt in CRDM and also in CardioVascular. In general, the entire Cardiac and Vascular businesses probably had the biggest impact but CRDM and then on the CardioVascular side. So that will clearly benefit those two businesses because Japan as we've seen all year has been either flat to down primarily because of those ASP pressures and that will clearly help them as they go into next year. We won't have those tough comparisons that they'll be dealing with. Overall on pricing pressures, as Bill mentioned, we've seen the pricing pressures be somewhat stable the last several quarters. However, from our perspective with these new products and the innovation, we think that will actually help minimize some of the pricing pressures we've seen. So going forward, we would expect to see not quite as dramatic pricing pressures as we probably saw this last year for Medtronic in general.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Bill, Gary. And all the best, Bill, with whatever is coming up next. I wanted to touch on two things. One just on the Revo pacer, you had indicated that you think it's going to drive share. My impression is your Brady share is already in the low 50s. Maybe help us think just what kind of dreams do you have for what impact on Brady share? And if you could talk a little bit about when your next gen Revo is going to be launched in the U.S.? Have you filed it, just a little perspective there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So again I mentioned, the real addressable market for us is about 80% of the market because that's the dual chamber and active fixation. And I'm not going to give you a projection. The only thing I would say, Rick, is what I say to our people. I mean, why would you not want an MRI safe pacemaker if it's available? I mean, given the fact that we know that roughly 70% of the people who get pacemakers are going to need an MRI safe. So I just think &#x2013; and this is a different environment here. The whole issue of liability and everything else, I mean, in terms of just the forces are in place to really drive the adoption of this kind of therapy. So I'm fairly bullish that this is going to be a real big opportunity for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Turning to Spine, you mentioned that pricing in the lateral fusion category is getting more competitive. Can you quantify that a little more specifically? And maybe give us some perspective on what your DLIF &#x2013; you said you gained share and it grew fast. I sort of feel like in the first quarter, I remember you grew 40%, last quarter 25%, a little perspective about this quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's in that same range. It's up 25% to 30%. So the DLIF is doing well. And we're bringing out new instrument sets, which are going to we think even make it more competitive. And on the pricing, it's really &#x2013; we haven't seen major changes in the overall spine market. If you go back a few years ago, we saw price increases and now we're in that flat to modestly down. But again, it's all predicated on bringing out new technologies. And with all of what we have in the pipeline, we're comfortable that we're going to be able to manage through this very well with Solera, with the TSRH 3Dx, with the VERTEX SELECT, with the T2 ALTITUDE, I mean, the whole product portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one last one, Gary, if I could on gross margin, obviously, I understand why but gross margins this quarter were the weakest we've seen in some time. And you gave us the guidance for the fourth quarter. But as recently as last quarter, you were talking about 75.5% to 76%. What drives you to that upper end of the range as we look over not just the fourth quarter, but just directionally looking ahead? Is it all these new products and better ASPs? Is that, "all it is?" Can you help us understand what might move it higher over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well again, the &#x2013; we would have said the normal rate here for Q3 &#x2013; ongoing rate would have been around 75.5% to 76%. And that's the reason that we still feel comfortable. We're not saying we're going to increase our gross margins from where they're at, we just won't have the one-time items we had in this quarter. But overall, Rick, I would tell you that yes, we think, as we mentioned during the call here, we do think the new products will have an impact on stabilizing the gross margin and potentially giving us a little bit of an uptick because at the same time we're coming out with these products, we continue to focus on taking product cost out. So if we can maintain pricing pressures and minimize those and take product cost out, obviously, that gets us the benefit.</p>
          <p>There is no question that we have things that are pushing back a little bit the other way. Some of the acquisitions, the mix is such that their gross margins aren't quite as high as some of the other product lines. So it's a combination. There's a lot of moving parts in the gross margin overall. But what we were trying to get at is really on an ongoing basis, we think our gross margins still are running between 75.5% and 76% and we think we can continue to maintain those as we go through the fourth quarter and we would hope as we get into the future years.</p>
