          <p>Thank you for standing by and welcome to Full Year Result Announcement. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today Mr. Don Voelte. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I am Don Voelte. With me today are Mark Chatterji CFO, his finance group, some of our IR folks; Rob Cole, Corporate Center; and Agu Kantsler, from our Exploration Group.</p>
          <p>2008 was a good year for Woodside. We delivered outstanding results and record full year dividend, profit, revenue cash flow and production. This stands us in good stead to weather the current economic environment. And I'm pleased to be able to tell you that while other companies in our industry are shutting in operation and cutting down activity, we're maintaining our development momentum in all of our core portfolio assets.</p>
          <p>And to cut to the chase, we fully intend to deliver Pluto on schedule at the end of 2010. Within a few we'll be at 50% completion of the Pluto Greenfield and Train 1 projects.</p>
          <p>Of course we are as always very conscientious of our financial management and Mark here is to talk to you a little bit more about that in a few minute. But the key message is that despite the softening of commodity prices, we'll manage our fundings, so that we can continue to grow and deliver the long-term returns that we promised to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>One more thing before we jump in here. Earlier this year we unveiled the change to our logo. The change was intended to place a greater emphasis on the future of our liquefied natural gas business, and continue to acknowledge our foundation oil and gas project. Now it's the first substantial change we've had made in 32 years. And I'll tell you, it's about the only thing I remember in five years that everybody in Woodside seems to unanimously agree that it was a good thing.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Slide Two, our usual disclaimer applies, no changes in it from last time. Turning to Slide Three, as you can see from our results, we've continued to build on the growth of the last few years and delivered record performances and all of the metric on this slide are 15% jump in production to over 81 million barrels of oil equivalent built on last year's increase and represents the fourth consecutive year of annual growth.</p>
          <p>We've had a 56% growth in revenue to just under $6 billion and this represents the fifth consecutive year of increase. And our cash flow is up to 3.78 billion, again, the fifth straight year of increase. Our record reported profit comes in a $1.79 billion with an underlying profit of 1.8 billion, the fourth increase in the last five years.</p>
          <p>Going over to Slide Four, as promised our drivers for our production growth can be seen in the list of new producing assets on this slide. Our Train 5 and Angel producing facilities in the North West Shelf have listed total production capacity at the Karratha gas plant to 16.3 million tonnes per annum of LNG.</p>
          <p>Now after the flawless start up and ramp up Train 5 is currently running at between 80 and 90% of its full capacity. Now we expect that to achieve to its full design rate after our shutdown that we're going to take in May to fix the main cryogenic heat exchangers. And that's moved up from the last time, I told you to November.</p>
          <p>The start up of Neptune &amp; Power Play production in the Gulf of Mexico more than doubled our U.S. net production volumes from the beginning of the year. Now we had some trouble with the start up of Vincent offshore in Western Australia with completion fluid issues. However by year end we had ramped it up to around 35,000 barrels of oil per day and it is even doing better now today.</p>
          <p>Our intervention work on the Enfield was very successful with three new side tracks having lifted the overall production. Enfield and Stybarrow are now both exceeding our initial expectation of what the reservoirs will do at this time.</p>
          <p>On the Slide Five, it's been a very busy year for us on the development front as I've mentioned. We've progressed the construction of the Greenfield Pluto and Train 1 to just under 50% at this time; in a few days we'll reach that milestone of halfway finished. As you will see later on we have most of the foundation in place. We are beginning to place the first two modules, which started arriving during the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Now talking more about Pluto 1, Pluto 2 and 3, Browse and Sunrise later in the pack, I do want to mention that we continue to build our world-class assets at North West Shelf. Our North Rankin redevelopment is 23% complete and our North West oil redevelopment, which will enable production through the next decade is now 18% complete.</p>
          <p>I just want to draw your attention to fact that we continue to build -- continue to leverage future value despite the current adverse economic condition.</p>
          <p>On Slide Six, I just want to mention here about people, contractors, how we do our business. A very important event happened to us a couple of weeks ago. Two weeks ago over a long weekend, I and 30 of my senior operating project and development management team met with 70 senior leaders including many CEOs representing 35 of our biggest contracting partners at a very successful safety engagement session.</p>
          <p>This group of companies comprise over 90% of our spend and construction hours. I invited this key group of contracting partners to share their opinion, thoughts and experiences on how we can make Woodside work sites safer now and in the future. Also making appearances where our Chairman, Michael Chaney, Commonwealth Minister Martin Ferguson, WA Minister Norman Moore and the Onshore and Offshore safety chief regulators.</p>
          <p>I was extremely pleased with the overwhelming enthusiasm as a basis for action in those attending and bringing about a step change in the safety in all of our Woodside work sites.</p>
          <p>Now there are a number of immediate actions I am taking to improve its performance. First, the health and safety function will report directly to me. I will keep taking a greater personal leadership role as that takes place with immediate effect.</p>
          <p>Second, there is going to be a greater focus at all levels of safe &#x2013; of our staff and contractor workforce engagement on safety as a core company and contractor value.</p>
          <p>Third, we are going to create a more caring frontline workplace, where everybody has the same message and the same focus on safety. So as a company we have recommitted along with our contractors to achieving our health and safety aspiration that no one gets hurt and no incidents.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of our employees and our workforce here at Woodside, I am also pleased to share that we've conducted another survey &#x2013; employee survey 2008. And that survey indicated that our staff are proud to work with Woodside and even more committed to our success, which is borne out by the continuing downward trend in our voluntary turnover.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide Seven on reserves. As you can see from this slide, as a result of production drilling activities, studies, acquisitions, divestments during 2008, Woodside's crude reserves increased by over 100 million barrels during the year to 1.33 billion barrels of oil. The corresponding Proved plus Probable 2P reserves grew by over 15 million barrels to 1.7 billion barrels of oil.</p>
          <p>Now approximately 80% of both our reserves and our contingent resources are natural gas. You will notice that largely as a result of maturing Browse sub surface evaluation appraisal, our total contingent resources are now 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Now that's a P50 figure, which is a result of narrowing the range of uncertainty on the Browse fields as well as through the transferring of some Xena volumes into reserve category.</p>
          <p>Speaking of Xena, we are now well along with our drilling at our Pluto development well and the only surprises we've had have been very pleasant surprises. We had significantly improved our P90 reserves by 0.9 Tcf and affirmed our P50 position, all great results that reduces any type of reserve risk that we might have had with the project.</p>
          <p>Overall, this year has been a good one in terms of reserve. Our new reserve booking for Xena increased volume for Pluto mean that even though we had a 15% increase in production this year, we still have a reserve life of 17 years of Proved and 22 years of Proved plus Probable confidence levels respectively. If contingent resources were commercialized and considered along with reserves, 2008 production level could be maintained for another 46 years.</p>
          <p>Now, as you all are waiting for, really important this year is our financial condition. So I am going to turn it over to our CFO, Mark Chatterji to bring you up to date.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Don. I'm going to run through the building blocks of our results and then turn to funding our 2009 activities. I will start with production, which is Page Nine of your presentation pack.</p>
          <p>2008 was another record year of production for Woodside. The 81.3 million barrel of oils equivalent we produced in 2008 was a 15% increase from 2007. The production increase came from a suite of new projects Woodside brought online in 2008. Also from getting a full year of production of Stybarrow &amp; Otway, which were both started towards the end of 2007. And finally purchasing Shell's equity interest in North West Shelf oil in May of 2008. As you can see from the chart, since 2004 we've increased production 42%.</p>
          <p>Moving onto revenue and that's on Page 10 of your pack. We had a 56% increase in revenue compared to 2007, due partly to the strong production growth, which I discussed in the previous slide and partly to the increase in commodity pricing over the year.</p>
          <p>The average WTI oil price for 2008 was just short of 100 U.S. dollars per barrel versus around US$72.50 per barrel for 2007. Now some of this oil price increase was offset by our Greater Enfield area hedging program. This is this year some of the oil price decrease is being offset by the Greater Enfield area hedging program.</p>
          <p>Finally, although the slide mentions exchange rate, the effect of revenue for 2008 was the minimum. The average FX exchange rate for both 2007 and 2008 was about 84 cents. The impact of the exchange rate was lower down on the P&amp;L and we'll discuss that in a few slides.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Slide 11, oil production cost rose from 133 million to $245 million which equates to lifting costs for oil rising from $5.87 per boe to $7.77 per boe. Cash production cost rose from $134 million to $186 million, which equates to gas lifting cost rising from 293 a boe to 393 a boe.</p>
          <p>Now, starting with oil, part of the increase in cost was from new production of Vincent and Neptune. However, as we discussed in the half year, in addition there were about $47 million of cost that we expect be non-recurring in nature, namely repairs and kit replacement at Laminaria and Mutineer &amp; Exeter and also the intervention work that was successfully accomplished at Enfield. When you strip out these items as we've done on the dotted line, that gives you a figure of $6.20 per boe.</p>
          <p>For gas, part of increase in cost was from the start-ups of Train 5 and Angel. Furthermore, as we've noted in previous calls, North West Shelf has really been gone through a phase of intensive maintenance at both the onshore facilities in Karratha and offshore. After of these facilities expect to be producing <mark type="inaudible" /> liquefying gas for decades to come.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to 2009, we expect that higher throughput of gas particularly at North West Shelf will get a bit flattened or even bring down our gas lifting costs in Australia.</p>
          <p>For oil, in 2009, though looking forward, we have a number of fields that are now in natural decline, so that while maintenance costs might stay relatively flat, lifting costs are expected to rise as a result of reduced volumes.</p>
          <p>Moving onto the next slide, that's cost comparison. This page shows the view of JS Herold as a benchmark of various types of cost. Woodside's 2007 performance is shown in red. As you can see we tend to benchmark towards the top of other IOCs in the LNG business. Now I understand the lifting costs shown on the slide include, for us, PRRT and, of course, that affects Woodside disproportionately as a group as it is being compared to, as very of them have any PRRT exposure.</p>
          <p>Going onto cash flow, with Page 13. Despite the movement in costs on the previous slide, Woodside saw strong growth in its operating cash flow in 2008. This was an important factor in our being able to fund requirements for the latter half of 2008 without raising additional debt. Also similar to production, this continues the trend of growth in cash flows for the company over the past several years.</p>
          <p>Turning to profit, Page 14. Profit at 1,786 million for 2008, reported profit was 73% higher than it was in 2007. The slide that you see walks through the various analyses between the two years. Now revenue we have already discussed. The variance in cost of sales not only accounts for volume and price driven higher production cost in DD&amp;A, but also accounts for an increase in royalty and excise caused by the Commonwealth's decision in May to slap a new tax on North West Shelf Condensate. And that move cost the company over $100 million.</p>
          <p>The other large item I want to note is occurring in the other expense bar. This is the revaluation of our U.S. dollar debt. A brief explanation: While the company reports its results in Australian dollars, it has both investments and loans in U.S. dollars. The changes in the Australian dollar-U.S. dollar exchange rate caused us to revalue both the investments and the loans. Now some of the investments offset the loans, but the non-offsetting balance goes to the P&amp;L statement. This is not a new accounting policy; we have had it for years. However, this year, the combination of increasing U.S. dollar liabilities, that's the JBIC facility in midyear, decreasing U.S. dollar investment caused by the sale of Mauritania, and the sharp fall in the exchange rate from the end of the first half to the end of the second half, caused the movement of almost $300 million in the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>If you look back in the appendix, there is another explanation -- illustration of the debt revaluation and how it occurs, but I will caution you and you will see this in the appendix, it is impossible to forecast the debt revaluation in advance, because as you will see from the slide in the appendix, there are a lot of moving parts that aren't actually known, and so we balance the books every month.</p>
          <p>Also another expense is in our decision to suspend OceanWay and write-off $87 million of cost incurred since 2005 <mark type="inaudible" /> the California permitting law. Offsetting these other expenses items were lower E&amp;E cost.</p>
          <p>The final item to keep in mind of the various analyses, is that in 2007, we included the impact of discontinued operations caused by Woodside's exit from Mauritania, which are Woodside's exit from Mauritania, which are absent in 2008.</p>
          <p>Next slide is significant items. You can see that Woodside's 2008 underlying NPAT was 1,832 million, the largest difference being the OceanWay suspension I mentioned on the previous slide.</p>
          <p>Onto dividends, in 2008 Woodside paid a full-year dividend of $1.35, which was the $0.80 interim dividend paid in October and the $0.55 final dividend that was just declared today. This is a 30% increase in the full-year dividend versus 2007. And this dividend will be fully underwritten by the Dividend Reinvestment Program. As I previously noted, our intent is that the fully underwritten DRP will remain activated throughout the Pluto construction phase.</p>
          <p>The last slide I wanted to talk you about is funding. Turn to funding, at the end of the calendar year Woodside had no drawn debt against the then-existing bilateral and 364 facilities. So in other words, we had US$1.05 billion in dry powder. Since that time, we've added another US$800 million of additional capacity from our bank and we intend to raise more debt on top of that.</p>
          <p>Now all this is in line with what we announced when we made the FID decision for Pluto in July 2007. We intend to fund Pluto through a combination of operating cash flow, on-balance sheet debt and equity through the fully underwritten DRP.</p>
          <p>Given the fall in oil prices, Woodside has decided to tighten our belt. Since the November investment briefing, management has implemented a series of reductions in budgeted spending across all parts of the company, which total about $0.5 billion. Now this is a combination of eliminating some activity, deferring other activity into 2010, working more efficiently, and realizing benefits from a declining cost environment.</p>
          <p>I might hasten to add that we reiterate, our production guidance remains unchanged for the full year 2009 and furthermore, there is no change to the guidance that we've given on our projects. A further reduction of budgeted spending of several hundred million dollars is being contemplated.</p>
          <p>In addition, management has decided to review the portfolio to see if others may find some of the non-core assets more valuable than we do. Now by non-core, we mean assets located outside of Western Australia and the Timor Sea.</p>
          <p>What do these actions mean for our external funding requirements? Well, if you presume that the prevailing oil prices and exchange rate will be where they are for the remainder of the year, we expect to need another 1 to US$1.7 billion of funding beyond where we are today. Furthermore, and let me emphasize this, we intend to source all of this funding from the debt market.</p>
          <p>Finally, keep in mind that if the debt on offer is attractive, we may raise more than 1 to US$1.7 billion and use the excess to repay our bilateral and other short-term facilities, so that that capacity can be used again in 2010.</p>
          <p>Thanks for listening, and now I will turn it back over to Don to go over the outlook of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark and thanks to your folks for having a good plan to get us through this downturn and come out even stronger on the other side of it. I really appreciate everybody's efforts in the financing sector.</p>
          <p>We are pride ourselves at Woodside for being another Australian company that delivers, we do what we say. We don't just talk about building, we actually build and deliver and we deliver shareholder value. Currently we operate over 20 billion of project, $20 billion of project under construction management. We have about 20 to 25,000 direct jobs in our workspace every day.</p>
          <p>We have built or building six out of seven LNG trains that have ever been build in Australia and we're six of six in Western Australia. I remembered just 14 months ago during our Christmas break I received a phone call from a very senior executive of one of our North West Shelf partners. Conversation kind of went like this, ''Jeez, Don, you're actually building Pluto, our guys said you wouldn't do that. We thought it was a bluff, but you're actually building it. You know it's quite a jump from Woodside."</p>
          <p>Well, last week, I got a another phone call from another very senior executive from another one of our North West Shelf partners and that was, this person was seriously thinking about building LNG plant in Australia for their company. Conversation kind of went like this, ''Can it be right that you guys are almost 50% completed Pluto? How are you guys doing that? I am laying my projected timeline over your projected timeline, it's like a two times factor." But the point is, this is very special company called Woodside. We build an enormous capability and capacity, doing major things very quickly in Australia. Building Australia is very complex. I can guarantee that.</p>
          <p>We know how to anticipate obstacles, we see them learned over last 20 years, how to get around some of those obstacles and tackle the ones that we need to challenge technically. And we've seen it six times over now. So we learned a lot as we go along. That is the point. Pluto Greenfield and Train 1, if we keep to schedule will be a world record for LNG from discovery to production. The question is, Would it be if it was the first LNG plant we had ever built in Australia? And let give you the answer to that, Not even close.</p>
          <p>There is so much knowledge stored in this company, it just really amazes me sometimes. To be honest, if this was a first Woodside LNG built in this country for us at Woodside, we certainly would not have the ability to build it as quickly or efficiently as we are doing Pluto. This is the unique place to build and Woodside is very, very good at it.</p>
          <p>Now let's start on Slide 19, and talk about some of these development projects. First let's talk about production, where we're at currently. We grew our production 15% in 2008. This builds on our three prior consecutive years of growth. Over this period we've grown our production by 42% as a company.</p>
          <p>Now this blows away all of our mid-cap year official competitors companies. Most companies in this group are struggling to organically grow their production volumes. I'll just take one example, a production from another Australian company in our official peer group.</p>
          <p>Now it declined 11% over the past two years, while we've increased ours by 20%. That equates to a production growth differential of over 30% in the past 24 months alone. So this year, we thought we'd increased the competition to see how we do. And we included all the majors and super majors as you can see in the top right hand corner.</p>
          <p>And as you can see from this chart from JS Herold, same source, we've sighted a pretty unique growth story. And just wait until Pluto will come on. I wanted to say this for clarity sake, so that there is no misunderstanding, our 2009 production guidance remains unchanged as to 81 to 86 million barrel, and this we're going for our fifth consecutive year of growth.</p>
          <p>Over on page 20, our reserves. Well we did the same thing with the reserves, we looked at the majors and the super majors and you can see how we're doing, we're doing very well. On the upper left hand chart, our average organic three-year running growth of reserve replacement ratio is about three times what the rest of the big companies have produced.</p>
          <p>And when you include acquisitions and divestments, which is in the lower left hand corner, we still lead the pack. On the right hand side, you can see that Woodside's reserve to production ratio is 17 years versus 14 years for the next closest company. And when you average out all the other companies, it's about a 12 year life. Overall things are going well.</p>
          <p>Over slide 21, North West Shelf LNG contracts in the Japan utilizes a Japan custom clearing price called JCC, which is applied by various formulae with a three months delay. Therefore, while the oil price decline dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2008, the fourth quarter LNG price was still strong.</p>
          <p>In the future, there is no doubt our realized LNG price will come down as well as overall prices work through the three month lag effect. However, due to the effect of general LNG pricing indexation for oil our realized LNG prices will be cushioned from the full effect of a sagging oil price.</p>
          <p>Now, while I'm talking about LNG I can advise that the pricing out of range negotiation that have progressed, that they have progressed in documentation for the 1985 SPAs, Japan is expected to be finalized by the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the slide 22, let's see where we are at with Pluto. On slide 22, you will see our milestone charts. Pluto Greenfield and Train 1 is continuing a world record speed, will be at 50% complete &#x2013; completion during the next few days. Now, we are still holding to our FID budget, schedule and cost. Let me repeat that. We are holding to our FID budget and cost.</p>
          <p>As you can see here, we've met all of our 2008 milestones. This slide also identifies the key milestones we've set for ourselves for the first three quarters of this year. Suffice to say, we want the project to be 85 to 90% complete by the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>But 2009 is the year of major construction and 2010 will be year of commissioning. Let's take some pictures or look at some of the pictures here. On Slide 23, before we get to the Karratha slide lets show you a little bit of the international constructions sites that are all feeding into Karratha at this time.</p>
          <p>On this slide, you will see one of the preassembled units being built in Laem Chabang, Thailand. The first 57 modules and supporting structures out of the total of 261 have already arrived at our Pluto site. Now the last of these modules, of course, is expected to be arriving by about one year from today. In Thailand, more than 10,000 people are working on our Pluto modules and support structures.</p>
          <p>On Slide 24, this is another one of our modules in Thailand. This is the gas turban power generation unit and you can get a sense of the scale of these units and also the amount of work going on at these yards from this picture.</p>
          <p>Going to Slide 25, this is a liquefaction unit. Now, in the small picture on the right, you can see that this is almost the very same unit from our Train 5 North West Shelf, which we had on the front of our annual report last year. Our Pluto module is just like Train 5, which is on the &#x2013; Pluto is on the left here. The module will be one of the largest and weighs in about 1,800 tons and it stands about 35 meters high.</p>
          <p>Over on Slide 26, let's move over to China and the Jacket being assembled at Shenzen Chiwan Sembawang yard, and I think I got that pretty close to be in, right. Now you could be forgiven for thinking this looks an awful lot like the one we showed you launched at the Angel site just 18 months and it does, because it is very similar. The Pluto platform will be placed in 85 meters of water.</p>
          <p>Over on Slide 27, now, we are going to move over to Malaysia. Here, we see the topsides being built in Ramun &#x2013; I miss it, Ramunia in Malaysia. Again, similar to the images you saw of Angel, which are down in the bottom left hand corner. How you should look at this picture is on the Pluto topsides, the platform on the left, that facility, the topside deck is on the left. The deck on the right actually sits on top of the deck on the left, so it's a two-phase bit they after they get constructed. You try to do most of your construction as low to ground as possible in the construction yard.</p>
          <p>On to Slide 28, there she is &#x2013; a boat. This is our Woodside LNG tanker that under construction that is on schedule in Korea Samsung yard. The first deal was cut in June of 2008, the keel was weighed in 2000 &#x2013; in November of 2008 and the hull was launched just last month.</p>
          <p>Now, if you've never seen the inside of a new membrane LNG Ship tanker where we put our LNG &#x2013; just take a quick look at the PDF we sent out this morning of our annual report. We've put it on the cover of our report. So we are really proud. This is our first ship wholly-owned by Woodside and we've airbrushed out the name of it there and this is going to be a very special occasion when we name our ship.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Slide number 29, okay we are moving into Karratha here in the Western Australia. You can see the green work and Train 1 construction site; all the concrete foundations are being installed at this time to start receiving our really big module. The first 1,000 ton plus modules will be shipped in early July and will be placed directly on their final pads and piers as soon as they arrive.</p>
          <p>On Page 30, a different angle. I feel like I am almost a travel agent here showing you places to go, but here in the foreground, you can see actually the placements of our small modules that lead up to the pipe rack. The bottom right is the onshore approach to the jetty and loading piers, so the jetty will come to the right and that will be where our LNG and condensate gets loaded out.</p>
          <p>Middle left on the picture, are of the beginning of the two large and one small common condensate tanks. The combined capacity of each of these is 130,000 cubic meters of condensate. Now, built up to the right of these condensate tanks that are under construction are our two LNG tanks we've roofed in place and you can just barely see it there, but you can see the concrete walls now coming up from the base around the metal structure that is already built.</p>
          <p>The upper left construction, I'll show you a little bit here and in a few later slides. Let's take a close-up now on Page 31 of the condensate slide. Here you can see them under construction. You get a good feel for the size of these. If you take a look at that right tank, right on the left side of it, you can see a person up on the wall of the tank with his white hardhat and his orange work shirt. Now just at the pier here, that pier is a loaded LNG tanker departing North West Shelf in the background. So all-in-all Pluto Greenfield Train 1 are going on schedule by this time. It's all good right now and we hope to keep it all good.</p>
          <p>Now let's talk about our future projects. On slide 32, we'll show you that as you know when we got our LNG production up from Pluto Train 1, we will see our current equity LNG capacity increased almost 250% &#x2013; 250%. Even more impressive I think is that when Pluto comes on production, we will increase Woodside's equity LNG capacity by five-fold in a little more than six years.</p>
          <p>So where do we go from here? We've been working hard on Pluto Trains 2 and 3, Browse and Sunrise and I want to show about those projects in the next set of slides. So let's take each one of them separately.</p>
          <p>On page 33 &#x2013; slide 33, you can see the designated sites for Pluto Trains 2 and 3. The pad for Train 2 is complete and ready to go, although, we have some prepared fill stored on this site to be used for Train 1 later this year.</p>
          <p>And at the top left, you can see the Train 3 site taking shape. So, again Train 2 pad is virtually ready for foundation pads and piers.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Slide 34. Here you can see a close-up showing the Train 2 site with a various grades of site fills stored onsite. Very little has to happen to get train 2 pad to look like Train 1. And the infrastructure we're putting in place like the storage tank, it's all really have the capacity to support the second train. Also, we have the environmental approval already. We're up to 12.5 million tons of LNG production. And I was just saying, we've completed the basics of design and received three excellent proposals from contractors, from EPC contractors for the Phase 2 fee. So, where is the gas going to come from with Trains 2 &amp; 3?</p>
          <p>Moving over to Slide 35. As Reinhardt Matison told you all on November, the market demand is still there and not surprisingly we got a very strong customer interest for Train 2. So, the real challenge becomes the acceleration of Train 2.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to show you three options. The first option of course is exploration and discovery. And what I can tell you is that the first well of our six to eight wells drilling program this year, exploration and drilling program this year, is currently drilling. It is a prospect called Martell. We're hopeful but it is exploration. If we hit gas, it will be a very good thing for Woodside and the multiple prospects that we have in this region. While we liked this option in terms of equity, given appraisal and development options, it might be expected to take several years to mature the production from the field. So, hold onto that option for a minute, lets talk about option two. Is the outside resource gas? Now, this is something we talked about many times before with about 70 TCS gas out there in the Carnarvon basin, this option could take three to four years to develop into production once we get the agreements put in place. But that's option two. Let's try the option three. This is the one I like the best and excites me a lot because it really is the best one for Woodside. It combines the provision of capacity to third party with our own exploration success via the acceleration of Pluto and Xena reserve. In another words, borrowing Train 1 Xena and Pluto reserves, which of course adds value to those reserves, because of acceleration. Now, the timing for this option is ahead of the other two, and it lowers the amount of third party gas that is required. And remember I said earlier about the strengthening reserve position after we've drilled our Pluto well, and they're drilling to supply early gas.</p>
          <p>Now, over to Browse on Slide 36. I think it's appropriate to spend quite a bit of time on the Browse today as Browse represents well over half of our contingent gas and condensate resources and its initial LNG processing capacity will be in the range of 10 to 15 million tons per annum. Browse is very important to Woodside. Indeed, Browse is very important to Australia; just ask the politicians. I'm happy to say that significant progress was made on this development during 2008. One of the key areas of progress was a big increase in our understanding of the field. Three appraisal wells were drilled; we've now drilled 11 appraisal wells in these fields since 2005. When we started in 2005, we only had three exploration and two appraisal wells, which are of very old vintage in these three reservoirs.</p>
          <p>Significant analysis is now being conducted on the results of those wells and of sizing that we shot in previous year. Additionally, we've applied the same probabilistic reserves and mix that we apply in the North West Shelf. Now, as on side slide shows, the result of this work has been an update of our estimate of the resource. For Browse as a whole, the gas resource estimate has declined from 80 Tcf to 15.5 Tcf in reservoir and when excluding flared fills to 14 Tcf of sales gas. Now the condensate estimates has actually increased from approximately 350 million barrels to just under 400 million barrels. In 2008, we have narrowed the development location to two options. On this slide, we have indicated one of those options is the pipeline to the gas to our North West Shelf Pluto complex.</p>
          <p>So let me just reiterate, very few wells, very loose control of the reserves or the contingent resources in 2005. Now we know we have world-class facility at 14 Tcf of available and 400 million barrels or just under 400 million barrels of condensate, a world-class asset that we are really, really ready to get going and get those things into the development phase.</p>
          <p>Now moving over the other options, is the Kimberly option and significant movement here. That brings the gas to the onshore region of the Kimberly region. With respect to this option, I am happy to be able say significant progress has been made in this case. The progress hasn't just been in Woodside, but is mainly been WA and the Western Australia State Government. As you may be aware the state government has been seeking to establish an LNG precinct in the Kimberly area for gas discovered in the Browse basin.</p>
          <p>Now significant progress has been made with respect to the precinct with the state government announcing its preferred side of the James Price Point area which is clearly okay for us to develop. The government has contained and &#x2013; progressed the precinct with consultation with stakeholder.</p>
          <p>As mentioned the site chosen will be suitable for us as site for Browse gas, and we will continue to watch the state's progress and are very, very willing to participate as and when requested by the state. Now we anticipate choosing between the <mark type="inaudible" /> and Kimberly options in the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Let's go over and take at look Sunrise on 38. Our Sunrise development is also moving ahead and has the potential to add significant equity LNG for Woodside. We have narrowed the options to two via the best commercial option analysis and that is a branch of development at Darwin or a floating LNG concept. Now both have their advantages and both have their challenges, so we are working with the joint ventures and the government to ensure we make the right decision.</p>
          <p>On the government front, the Australian and Timor-Leste government jointly formed the Sunrise commission late last year, which we see as a very positive step. In 2009, we will select the best option and submit a field development plan due to Sunrise commission for their approval. Now that will be a major milestone towards the final investment decision.</p>
          <p>Now, let's take a look at our total Woodside LNG futures portfolio. On page 39, you see &#x2013; you know, we talked about LNG as an investment for Woodside, I think the folks that Poten and Partners in New York have heard us. If you want to have an LNG division in your investment portfolio, we say no &#x2013; look no further than Woodside.</p>
          <p>Now this chart shows you why. Our ratio of total investment of LNG equity over the next nine years, we have now divided by market capitalization of the company as of 31 December 2008. As you can see from this chart, even with the global downturn, we emerged stronger than ever. I think a lot of folks saw our statement and we are the most leveraged public company the LNG with a future projection and not current, but it's not. You can see now and even more so in the future.</p>
          <p>On page 40, we are maintaining the growth momentum, not only additional wells are all in our existing Neptune, Enfield, Stybarrow, Vincent and Laminaria Corallina fields, but where LGN projects are all progressing, North West Shelf, Pluto, Browse and Sunrise.</p>
          <p>Let me repeat that. Even though we are cutting back on some activities and projects, we will be drilling oil wells to get us quick payout on our Corallina fields, our Vincent and our Stybarrow and Enfield this year as we promised you and also at Neptune. Let's make sure of one more think, let me just tell you there is no change to our FID guidance that we gave at our November Investor briefing for our projects.</p>
          <p>Over on page 41, finally exploration. We continue to invest in explorations. Our main focus areas will be Australia, of course, with this multi well program predominantly in the Carnarvon Basin. We've completed our final Libya onshore commitment well and we will be considering our options with respect to the discoveries we've made there. And I'll say the last one F1, 210 is really good one.</p>
          <p>And we'll be participating now down the coast with the well in Sierra Leone in which our share cost will be almost entirely funded by Anadarko. In the U.S., we have at least one well planned this year in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a larger follow-on program for 2010.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, we plan to follow-up our recent oil and gas discovery at Panoramix with another exploration well at Vampira to the southwest and then there will be a third well following that. So where we can see good quality low exposure options, we're continuing to invest in our future growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, the last page here is to wrap it up. Let me just tell you that Woodside's weathering the storm. In times like these small companies really struggle but strong companies like Woodside gets stronger. We have world class assets. We have an experienced management team. We've got a great Woodside workforce, let me repeat, we've got a great Woodside workforce. We have dedicated contractors and we have access to financial markets.</p>
          <p>As I said, in times like these companies like Woodside gets stronger. And now we turn it over for your questions.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good day. I had a question for Mark. I'm just wondering whether you can spend a little bit more time on the deferral of expenditure that you had mentioned, $500 million during 2008? I'm just wondering where exactly you're cutting back, how much is CapEx versus OpEx? Can you just stretch that a little bit more, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, Mark. How you're doing?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you would have noticed in our Investor briefing in November, the majority of the spend in 2009 is capital. So you could expect, kind of the majority of cuts will come from capital. As you probably heard my presentation, it is the combination of some expenditure is eliminated, some expenditure is deferred, on deferral as Don took note of &#x2013; this has not changed out of production, this has not changed the progress or plan as far as the project goes, so it is really non-critical activity that's getting moved from one year to the other. The other thing that gets into those numbers is we are seeing a decline in cost environment and we are taking advantage of the decline in cost environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you revised by chit I think the last time you published that was at the Investor seminar and the CapEx budget was about $7.3 billion sign on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look as though we said, we are in the middle of going through a further round of this. We'll be giving updates guidance later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one on CapEx, I notice there's a difference in the slide, you talk about $5.5 billion of CapEx spend in 2008 but on your cash flow statement it was $4.8 billion, could you explain the difference?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The Mark put into the slide. You're talking about the slide in appendix. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Slide 46 that shows the capital expenditure of $5.5 billion in 2008, and it was $4.8 billion in the cash flow statement. Is that responsible for the increase in payables?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think what you're probably need to add to that, if you actually looking small on the chart, the footnote, the slide actually includes capitalized interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you wouldn't see that on the cash flow statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is that responsible for the full difference, the capitalized interest?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's going to be responsible for big chunk of it. I can't get to an off the bat answer on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay, I just had another question, well I got you Mark on DD&amp;A. DD&amp;A was a little higher than what we're going for. I was just wondering what contributed to that uplift in DD&amp;A in the second half, because it's Train 5, Angel, couple of other new projects kicking in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is a summation of the new assets that are kicking in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would it be possible to get some guidance on DD&amp;A for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you look at 2009 we won't have new project started. You will see some incremental contribution to projects that were started late in 2008. So that extent you will DD&amp;A go into the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just a question for Don. In the last few weeks, I think, Martin Ferguson has been in Media, calling for more cooperation between oil and gas sector players, particularly to share infrastructure in the LNG sector. I was just wondering with respect to Pluto 2, are there any ongoing active discussions with third parties?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're the most cooperative company in Australia. And number two is yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it with one &#x2013; is it with multiple parties that you &#x2013; where you see options or is it you're discussing anything specific with one client?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Question to Mark first. Mark in terms of what you said about your financing requirements, quite emphatically you said debt market, but I guess the caveat is that oil prices and exchange rate remain where they are. So what happens if oil prices deteriorate? What option will you then consider?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, couple of things on oil prices. First off, when you look at the current oil prices, Brent does a point there, but keep in mind Brent, where we price our actual sales off of, is a bit higher than WTI.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the first point keep in mind. Second point is, obviously we don't know what the oil price is going to be, nor do we know what the FX rate is going to be. In terms of sensitivities, obviously if the oil price goes down, if FX goes up, we will need more money. We'll use more money, but having said that, we have a lot more levers to pull than the ones we've chosen to pull. So in other words, if you think &#x2013; think it about chronologically, in November, we set down in the investor briefing, we gave a plan. We watched the external environment through December. Starting at the end of December we decided that we needed to take steps proactively to get in front of the decline in the external environment. Management got together and decided to start moving expenditures, I've detailed that, more of that is on the way and even more of that can be on the way as required.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay. So I take it then, that you are effectively discounting any equity raising in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Listen, John. I don't think you can discount the price of oil and gas, we don't know what it is. What I can tell you is that management has the plan, and the plan is reductions of expenditures, reviewing our non-core assets. As a result of that, we expect the 1 to $1.7 billion funding requirement, and we intend to hit the debt market and we expect that the debt market will give us 1 to $1.7 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks, Mark, that's very clear. Okay. In terms of &#x2013; another question, if I can ask Don. You've always said, Don, in the U.S. you had to get bigger or getting out. Where are you at with U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, on OceanWay, we've suspended that project. I'm sure you're talking about the Gulf of Mexico?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The WSA is maturing there. We have a really good prospect inventory down there now. We're developing our leads into prospects. We have a high seismic spend this year. Actually the rig that we have coming in is late to come in. So we've &#x2013; I actually got the benefit to move some of those wells into 2010. At the same time, we do plan to drill three broader wells over the next several years. We will take them slow and easy, learn from them as we go, and we will take a moderate equity interest in these, so that we don't put too many eggs in one basket down there. Thus, the point is we like our Power Play, we like our Neptune. We're down to just a few Shelf properties now. We will not be exploring the Shelf at all in the future. We have nobody spending any time exploring at that at this point.</p>
          <p>The lease sales, we've done well on those in the last couple of rounds. We think we have a nice portfolio going forward. And the key thing is, we've got some great partners who are sharing their portfolios and we're doing a little bit of mixing and matching with some of the prospects that we have. So we're going slow, but we do expect to grow. But we're not going to over-expand and over-expose without having the proper learning that goes with it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And one &#x2013; let me just mention one other thing, while I've got a flow on from Mark's first question. I just want to reiterate one thing, we are continuing to develop, obliviously Pluto 1, we're continuing to work in all of our core assets in Australia, Timor, and Western Australia. In other words, all of our core LNG assets are continuing to go on, no cut back. We're continuing to drill the tie-in wells to all our facilities here and in Neptune and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>We are looking at activities that are outside of those and deferring and cutting activity. The issue is we have some non-core assets we're taking a hard look at, the first action you saw was OceanWay. We are deferring some other things and some other activity. But we still are in with our major program of production and development. I just want to reiterate that. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much gentlemen for the presentation, some very good peer group comparisons. Just looking at Pluto, Pluto Train 2, you really haven't given us any indication of what timeline you are working with to potentially commit to that, and obviously securing the gas is the key. I am just wondering if there are other factors driving it in terms of the workforce and potentially exploration results. And if you could just give any guidance on, what would be the optimum time path to move forward with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. This is Don. Clearly, if we have &#x2013; the issues that we are working on come to a successful conclusion, and that's either exploration or some negotiation. At this time, like we said, we have three really good proposals for fees from our contractors. We've got the pad ready to go. It would be a matter of getting the long lead-time items put in. But we would be, at this time, still looking at a successful RFSU for Train 2 in the first half of 2013, that's the first half of 2013. That requires &#x2013; let me repeat, that requires some success in both, probably exploration and in negotiation. And we have the proper people working on those items. I will just say this, one other thing is the government certainly looked at those pads up there and the ability to move gas through there. And they certainly are interested in seeing Pluto 2 and 3, not only for the fact of evacuating  gas, but, boy, we create a lot of jobs up there, and they know it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly for me, just on the CapEx again. So the previous guidance of 6.9, after we strip out exploration for capital expenditure for 2009, we can immediately take 500 million off that. But coming back to you Mark, you are talking about potential target of another 700 million, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Gordon. Can you repeat the question? You seemed to have asked a question and answered it yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The question was, just trying to work out what expenditure you will make in '09. You've indicated that you've got cuts in place of potentially of around 500 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. But that's not &#x2013; sorry to interrupt, that's not fully out of capital, right? So it is across the company and all categories of spend are being looked at. What I was &#x2013; I think I was telling Mark earlier &#x2013; obviously, as most of the spend in aggregate in 2009 is capital, you can make an assumption most of the reduction is being capital.</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think &#x2013; and it's the American accent once again. It's several hundred million more, not 700 million more.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just coming back to Browse base little bit, and you were saying there. But just looking at the reserves today appear to be smaller than what they were a year or two or three ago? And I was just curious to find out where you are with the marketing. I am aware that 14 months ago you agreed to key term agreement with Taiwan. It just seems to me that existing expect is slipping off the radar, and looks better today than ever. And it certainly doesn't seem that the marketing side of this paralleling the other progress that's been <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I beg to differ with you. The reason is, is that in 2005 when we started the appraisal, we had very little reservoir control and we made a P50 estimate of 20 Tcf when you take out field flares it is 18 Tcf is what the numbers were in 300 million barrels of condensate. That was based on some 1970 era wells, and we basically had one well in each of the three plus &#x2013; maybe two in a couple. But the point is, our P10, P90 range in 2005 was tremendous. I think it was like 3 Tcf on a P90 basis and a P10, I can't even remember, it was like 30 Tcf. So we were really, really a wide range. So we really knew very little about control of the field and the &#x2013; what the edges might look like. Now we drilled another 11 wells &#x2013; along the way, 14 I guess it is. And we have completely narrowed the range of P90. We have a lot of confidence in our P90 now that will support a 2 Train operation in Kimberley. And our P50 has come down a bit, but it is a much more solid P50 at this point.</p>
          <p>You look around the world and you look at the waters that we're in and out there and you take a look at the government environment here and the contractual environment, companies like ours give their right arm for a 14 to 15 Tcf fill with the appraisal almost finished, like we have it at this point. The reservoirs, two of them look really good. One of them is a little bit more &#x2013; take a little bit more work to get done. But I would say we have a 90% confidence factor of what the final appraisal looks like. The reason is we moved the number this year is, we didn't have enough confidence and what we made an agreement was, we weren't going to move the numbers during the appraisals 'til we got to a confidence level. So now we have that. I'll also just mention that the CO2 level appears to be 10%. That was much better than our worst fears.</p>
          <p>And that along with the state government is doing with the Kimberley site, I think we've moved quite a ways along. We've got certainty on our contingent resources. Our P10, P90, has really narrowed. We've got confidence on our P90 gas that we can actually support the two Trains. And then you ask about marketing, we've got two of the best KTA contracts that are in the industry. And let me just remind you, not only do we have the CPC contract in Taiwan, but we also have the PetroChina in China. The &#x2013; I think it's going along quite well and I think the team downstairs is pretty motivated to push this over &#x2013; we've got a principal's agreement from the joint venture partners to finish up the appraisal and to do their environmental marine studies and we are just chomping at the bit to be able to get moving on the James Price Point opportunity. So sorry about the longwinded result, but I think you are basically headed the wrong direction from where I'm at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I appreciate that. Thanks for the expansion. And just moving over to Pluto, a lot of work to get done this year and looking at the site, pretty flat and the 57 modules have got to be fixed together there now and it just looks like a lot of work's got to get done in short space of time, so I guess the question is, how confident are you of getting it done by year-end '10 and what can go wrong, if anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well in this business, you do have risks. We like a lot of parts about this, number one is we are fully functional in all of our facility sites. We're almost finished with engineering. At Karratha, we've geared up. We don't have bed restriction anymore. We've got over 1,500 beds at our construction site, moving to 2,100. We've got 120 other new builds up there. So, we've got all the accommodations, all the capability. All of the, virtually all of the modules have what we &#x2013; we have every module up in Thailand. What we called green light, amber light, red light. And we modularized, basically every one of these. And we watch, we shift the workforce to where we need. Basically everything right now is running green light for the next couple of months on shipments. The shipments are all looking good. We have a lot cushion in the areas with some of the lead times, if valves don't show up et cetera. So we have a lot of flex in that capability. We are staying ahead on the pads and piers on Train 1 site to be able to accept the modules and to be able to place them as soon as they come in. At least for the big ones we'll have that. As I was saying, we just got done with the board meeting here and Lucio Della Martina and Phil Meier came in and gave a 60-minute presentation, not presentation, but a discussion of the status. And I will tell you, we feel pretty darn comfortable where we are at right now.</p>
          <p>Things can go wrong. The, one of the biggest risks is the productivity of the onshore labor in Karratha. And that's an area that we've changed our contracting strategy. We're also seeing some first evidence of reduced pricing and contract around the world. We hope we see more that here. But I think by April, we'll have all the contracts let for the project. We have everything lined up and so far everything offshore and onshore and, well offshore, the pipelines and onshore going our way. We do a deterministic schedule and do a probabilistic schedule and we both feel pretty comfortable either way on our P90 schedule and our P10 schedule, nothing there is concerning to our commitments for our contract.</p>
          <p>And let me just say our contract our Pluto contracts, we've got great partners there, and they are pretty darn excited about what they're seeing up there. We've had some of their management down to Tokyo. And I will say they are looking forward to deliveries of our LNG and also say, they're right with us going and we've got good solid Pluto contracts for the gas marketing side. I'll like those Pluto contracts as much as any other contract we have in the company at this point.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi. Couple of questions for Mark if I may, first of all can you just confirm that the 1 to 1.7 funding that you need for the rest of this year is on top of the 500 million CapEx reduction, there is an underlying increase of 1.5 to 2.2. And also can you tell me what that number might look like if the oil price stayed at $40 a barrel for the rest of the year. I see you're pricing off the future curve, which implies a rise around 55 by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Your first question that 1 to 1.7 takes into account all of the things I detailed, which include kind of the expenditure, reductions that have already been budgeted at this point. And then the other items. So yeah, yeah, the short answer to your question is, yes, 1.1. Could you tell me point number two again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just I see that you're coming up that estimate, based on the future's curve, which obviously rises to $55 a barrel by the end of the year. I just wonder how much that number might grow if the oil stayed flat for the rest of year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean &#x2013; number one, obviously the futures curve is Contango, but the average is not $55 for the rest of the year. Second point is &#x2013; as a reminder if you are quoting WTI, we do not price of WTI, we price our Brent. And Brent is actually higher than WTI -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Third, the FX. Exchange rates plays into it as well. So you can't actually kind of give what happens to $40 without giving the corresponding change in FX. What we've seen, obviously, historically is oil and FX have been moving up and down together and that is the benefit in terms of exposure, we are buying a lot of Australian dollars this year, we could launch on Pluto construction activity -- primarily unsure of Pluto construction activity. The falling Australian dollar is offsetting to some degree this fall in oil prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Okay. And second, I see that you've overspent at Pluto by around about $300 million versus the estimates you gave us back in November. And I appreciate Don said there were no costs overruns at the project. Can you just confirm therefore that that $300 million cuts the expected CapEx on the project in 2009? Or is it &#x2013; are we still with the old numbers you gave us back in November for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so the guidance that we've given at FID is the total life of the project expenditure. Obviously, phasing is at our discretion. And so we may kind of run things fast, we may run things slow depending on kind of how things are going on the ground. But there is no change in the FID guidance, which relates to the total cost of the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just try and clarify little bit of the &#x2013; maybe the confusion there, as we talk about $12 billion spend. We did an $800 million long lead-times item prior to the $11.2 billion FID for the cost forward. So you put the two together to get the 12 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Okay. Thank you very much. And then just finally, you allude to, in some of the slides that you may be looking at potentially selling some non-core assets. Can you give us any indication as to what you may be looking at? Would some like the Otway development in Victoria or the <mark type="inaudible" /> stuff in Algeria potentially be on the block?</p>

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

We have listed our intention for Africa though. And I would just say that OceanWay we've listed our intention. But everything else is basically we are working with our employees to take a look at what might be more valuable to other people than us, and also something that gives us good return on our investment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Don, can you just give us an indication on the CO2 content, it's fallen from 12.5 to 14 to 10, you said. And does the reduction of approximately 2 Tcf over the past 18 months include the 15% WA Government reservation policy play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The &#x2013; first off, the second question first, is &#x2013; no, the 15% is not involved in those numbers, those are straight reservoir numbers. So the 15% would have to be included in both of those. And I will just say that we certainly look at domestic gas being priced for these new facilities fairly well equivalent to our LNG pricing on a net back basis. That's what we will demand. The other issue, I guess you'd say, is the CO2 content. Yes, we have had 12 to 14 out there on some of our reservoirs. I understand from our reservoir folks working on Browse that actually that number may be on the conservative side when they headed out there. But what we have found is now on the three reservoirs in average it is 10% now. That was our taking into effect as to what the actual gas for sale is in those numbers that we have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon gentlemen, two questions. First of all, just going back to Mr. Greenwood's question regarding the CapEx spend highlighted on the slide 46 that is mostly in the cash. Just to clear, it looks as that what you've done is at reduce down on payable, a 0.5 billion which I assume you've included in your chart to get to 5.5 million and that explains most of the deficit in cash flow statement of 4.8 billion. At the chart on page 46 you are showing that you spent 5.5 billion, is that the key?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Mark you are right about that. The difference between accrual basis and cash flow basis. Hello, Mark you are still there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I did. Thank you. Thank you. The second question, if I may. I understand that when Mr. Voelte took his position at Woodside there was a five year tenure on the initial agreement, which would suggest that the renewal of the contract will be up in April for Mr. Voelte. So just interested to see what movements if any are being made there, would &#x2013; you be committing to stay on and committed to at Woodside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's in the Annual Report. Look, I know it is a five-year deal it is only that was based on tax laws at the time that now have been changed. I think we have been pretty clear about that. the Board about 18 to 2 years ago, 18 months 2 years ago changed my contract. They asked me to change it to an evergreen day-to-day. And it's a great contract. And I've got a great relationship with the Board. I've got a great relationship with my management team and employees. Well, hopefully, with employees. I like what I am doing here. I have got some goals. I really want my job to be replaced by one of my managers there. The Board has asked me stay on a while longer to achieve some goals. And I am having fun and frankly I am not even thinking about the end day.</p>
          <p>But there will be a time when its time to get some fresh blood into the game. And we've got some really wonderful people here that can run this company to a much better place than where I've been able to take it. So enough said, we don't even talk about it around here any more. We're just moving on. I know one of the guys told me that a year- the five years ago yesterday they announced I was coming over here. And I have to say career wise, the best decision I ever made. I just really love it, love Australian and I love what we are doing here. So hopefully, with this long answer we kill off this answer forever until I ride off into the sunset.</p>

We also have &#x2013; let me kind of give you a little timeline here; we hope to have 85 to 90% of the constructions finished by the end of 2009. We were already being commissioning. We have our complete commissioning team already formulated, most of it populated, we know who our first plant manager is going to be, who will run it, who happens to be involved in the whole operation. And we know what the synergies are with North West Shelf and the capability. We have over &#x2013; well, I think at last count 52 operators already assigned to Pluto. So the commissioning will happen over the period in 2010. For instance, on Train 5, we have gassed into the Train 5 facility as early as May of last year, although we didn't really go into the commissioning activities, what you call start-up pulled down activities until about five months after that. So these are kind of long drawn out processes where you start introducing gas and taking care of things. So that's all well on Train. We've got a really, really experienced group of people to do this and the commissioning part will hopefully go off just like clockwork again. We have always said that we want to put gas in by late 2010 and first cargos out &#x2013; first thing 2011 and that's our current plan.</p>

          <p>Thank you. In regards to LNG ramp up, has there been any change to the plans over the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I hope we don't have any problem to cryogenic heat exchangers because we've made the changes to the cryogenic heat exchangers and they are being shipped down to Thailand as we speak. So we think we've got that fixed. We like our turbines and everything. So what we expect is, is that Pluto will ramp up in the same advice that we've given before. And let me just say there, these things when they go on and again they &#x2013; when they come up, they tend to come up very fast and clean if we don't have problems, what you do as you usually take it down and after 30 or 60 days &#x2013; appear with a small problem. Other people have had major problems in start-ups, we haven't had those fortunately. So we're expecting a good clean, smooth ramp up and we'll go with guidance at this time, not know anything more than we have today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. I was just interested in the comments you're looking after non-core asset for potential trial, with 90% of Pluto and 50% of the Browse basin, is that an opportunity you are not considering as equity sell down on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are absolutely not considering any sell down of our core LNG assets or facilities here, that's not even contemplated or discussed with the Board at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I mean, that to some extent you think &#x2013; I mean, there are your premier ranked assets and in this market it might be easier to sell them, perhaps than some of the other asset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just say that we have some assets that are well placed in spread strategic areas where we're not big player and potentially other people desire those maybe more than what we do. In our backyard nobody does LNG in Australia like Woodside does. You know, they'll have to probably haul me out of here horizontally before I give up any equity in any of our projects.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's good. Just another question on the two options for the Browse Basin, and taking it down to Karratha or to the Pluto project, would it be easy to see that into Pluto rather than the North West Shelf?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's an option that we have and it's an option that the North West Shelf partners understand and saw part of the potential option there is that we're very clear that gas could come down to North West Shelf and/or Pluto.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I mean, you have your own gas sort of rather than having to rely on extra rates and on the North West Shelf although that's obviously strategic to bring it in from the North West Shelf from Martell if that's successful or one of the other wells?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I will just say that we keep all options open.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one please, Don, just on Sunrise, just looking for you to put back the dates a couple of times, so the concept selection there, now it's in the second half of the year. Can you just talk us through sort of where you're going with that and I guess give us your latest thoughts on the floating option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me tell you what's happening there. Both options are still in play. We're having both of them developed at this time. We're looking at the costs. We have finished our appraisal up there. And the situation is, is that in this world right now of steel prices coming down, Sunrise has a lot of steel in both options, either pipeline or ship. And we're kind of taking the few extra months, you're correct. We slipping a few, but it's pretty early in the second half we'll make this decision. But I will just say that we're kind of delaying to get better pricing on the steel and there is a little bit more to it. But it's all part of the cost analysis of the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just one another, one on your views on the coal seam gas to LNG, obliviously, there's been a lot of money that's pouring into the other side of Australia into that sphere with some big companies involved. Have you changed your views at all as to their potential effectiveness of that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not playing, so we really don't have the view of it. I would just say that we're really busy and we like our business where we're at. And I just leave it at that. I look over there and see the prices too and I am quite, it takes me back.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Your next question comes from Paul Scarvey from Financial Review. Please as your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, Don. I am just wondering if you are able to quantify at all what sort of job losses may have come about from the cutbacks that we are seeing today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've been reading with great &#x2013; with great interest all the same review analysis of our capital raisings. So let me make very clear to you. Let me be very clear, we don't anticipate capital raised. I am just going to answer the question to you on that one, but also Paul on people we have worked really hard to develop a really great workforce here. We're interested in deferring and cutting back activities not people. And yes there will be some contractors and consultants that don't work here, may be for the while. And it will be possibly from performers that decide to leave, but there is absolutely no across the board cutback that we're planning. I mean we've been through this too many times and we've seen too many different examples in 19, I can give start 80s &#x2013; I can start in 77 go to 82, 87, 97 and people decimated their companies for years and they go after their people first. It's too easy to do that. The hard work is cutting back the activities and the unnecessary cost. That's what where we're going after in our company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So core employee shouldn't really change dramatically or anything?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We need our core employees, that the basics for the company &#x2013; you can have great assets, but if you don't have great people to run them, they ain't going to do anything out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And with all the commentary you've given on your financial situation today, I'm just wondering how contingent that is on succeeding in divesting any of your assets there given it's not a great market to be trying to sell projects at the minute, is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not giving a range, in the presentation we did give a range of what our fund requirements may be. And so when you look at kind of the variation, it accounts for a lot of things that still have to go under the bridge. As I said there is other expenditure cuts are being considered at this point in time. There is a review of assets which we mentioned and you have to put that against the backdrop of I think as one of the previous questioners did you got a shifting oil and FX rate. So you can't actually quantify what the future is because it's unknown.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But I mean in terms of your &#x2013; how necessary it is to sell assets mainly, we are happy not to assets anything if the right price is on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Once again it's impossible to quantify an answer because we don't know what future holds. We don't have any particular thing that's under consideration we are doing a review of assets outside of Western Australia and the Timor Sea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Would you agree it's an inopportune time to be trying to sell assets given what the oil prices and where markets are in general?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. Look at some of the price of being paid up in coal seam <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Did you say Don how much &#x2013; did you say you are chomping the bit to get the James Price Point settlement happen? Does that mean you are leaning towards Kimberley LNG?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, reviewing both options what we are saying is, is that James Price Points was a acceptable site for us. We had two or three that we liked; its one of them. There's a lot of work to go on to get the stakeholders all aligned to make sure that everybody can live with that. The phase working and all that at this time, but we told the state, they've asked us can you develop LNG there and we said yes. That doesn't preempt the ultimate decision we have to make between the Burrup which is either North West Shelf/Pluto or that. So if we said anything earlier in this conversation that you would pick up that we favored one over the other, we do not at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what's the hold up with that decision? You said last year that you were going to make a decision before Christmas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And clearly the amount of work that the state has to do with the northern developed task force, we had the change in government. They changed the process a bit. Nothing wrong with that, it just taking them a little bit longer to get down to their preference per site and some of other issues around the aboriginal and the city of Broom and some of the local stakeholders out there to get them in line before we go too far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also do you anticipate the slowdown in Japan will impact on your future projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At this time we have multiple different places that will take our gas. We have a lot of market &#x2013; we have other things happening in the world such as the supplies from like Indonesia is declining and other things. So there is an awful lot of leverage that you have put into this. At this point Woodside is probably known as one of the most reliable, focused and best suppliers of LNG in the Japan. And they know what we can do and I will just say at the end of the day, we will have a very solid customer base there and I don't anticipate any issues there and we have other customers around the North West &#x2013; I'm sorry the Northern Pacific Rim that we can put our gas into. We have not seen a reduction. There is also a cleaner global energy future that these countries are absolutely being demanded by their citizen. And LNG is just the &#x2013; it is THE energy choice of the future and people are not looking at reducing that component of their energy.</p>
