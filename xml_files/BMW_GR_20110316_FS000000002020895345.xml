        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Take your seats. I think we are on time, it's 10:00. I hope you all had a pleasant evening yesterday. Given the extremely unfortunate situation in Japan, we appreciate that you are all here today. As Dr. Reithofer said yesterday, we are all deeply moved by these tragic events. Our thoughts are with the Japanese people.</p>
          <p>We assisted our Japanese associates and their families by offering to relocate them to the south of Japan. Additionally, we arranged for our German associates to be flown back home. The board has decided to offer immediate aid to the victims. In addition, we are responding to a large number of requests from our associates worldwide to help by establishing an account for donations.</p>
          <p>Now ladies and gentlemen, let's begin with our meeting. As usual, we will start with a statement from Dr. Norbert Reithofer, Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG. This will be followed by a statement from Dr. Friedrich Eichiner, Board Member for Finance. After both statements, we will have time for a Q&amp;A session. Then you are all invited to join us for lunch.</p>
          <p>That's all from my side, Dr. Reithofer, the podium is yours.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. The BMW Group has a promising future. We are the world's most successful premium automaker and we continue to set new standards in our industry. We are building the foundation for our future, sustainable mobility, and securing the long-term success of the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>We are able to do this, because our Strategy Number ONE outlines the roadmap for our business activities; because our Group has a sound financial basis; and because our associates are innovative, efficient and highly motivated.</p>
          <p>And creating mobility solutions is our passion and we have a clear vision for the future. We aim to be the leading provider of premium products and premium services for individual mobility. This means, first, we focus exclusively on premium. This applies to our products, as well as our internal processes and our business activities in general.</p>
          <p>Second, in the future, we will offer our customers a wide range of customized services for individual mobility. And third, and by doing so, we will strengthen our lead in the automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Our performance in the business year 2010 shows we are clearly on the right track. &#x20AC;4.83 billion, this is the best pre-tax result in our company's history. &#x20AC;3.23 billion, this is the highest profit we have ever generated. And 1.46 million vehicles, this is the second highest sales volume ever achieved.</p>
          <p>Financial services contributed &#x20AC;1.2 billion to the Group's overall earnings. Our share price has seen a positive development as well. There are two things we have always stressed. BMW is a sound long-term investment and we want our shareholders to participate more in our corporate success.</p>
          <p>From year end 2009 to the closing price at the end of 2010, the BMW share price increased in value by 85%. This made the BMW ordinary shares the most successful in the DAX index last year. In September, it was included in the EURO STOXX 50.</p>
          <p>At the Annual General Meeting, the Board of Management and the Supervisory Board will propose to raise the dividend to an all time high of &#x20AC;1.30 per ordinary share and &#x20AC;1.32 per preferred share.</p>
          <p>It is an inherent part of our corporate culture to include all shareholders in the company's performance, which also includes our associates. Since 1989, we have offered our associates the opportunity to participate in our employee share program. As a result, many associates benefit from the dividend as well. Moreover, all permanent staff in Germany will receive a profit sharing bonus for 2010. It will amount to almost 1.6 monthly salaries, exceeding the previous record set in 2007.</p>
          <p>So, what are our goals for 2011? We intend to do the following: top our 2010 record earnings, sell more cars than ever before, significantly more than 1.5 million and reach new record sales with all three brands, BMW, MINI and Rolls-Royce.</p>
          <p>I would like to focus in more detail on two points: first, what did we accomplish in 2010, and second, how do we intend to lead the BMW Group into the future? Regarding the first point, our 2010 accomplishments. First, a quick review of our sales figures. BMW sold more than 1.22 million vehicles. This figure was topped only once before in 2007, sorry. I was already ahead of my time. MINI posted a new record of over 234,000 units and Rolls Royce reached an all-time high of 2,711 cars.</p>
          <p>In the Motorcycle segment, sales of our two brands, BMW and Husqvarna, increased 9.7% year-on-year. This totaled over 110,000 units. BMW Motorrad also managed to increase its market share, despite the trend in the international markets. In European key markets such as Germany, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium and Austria, BMW Motorrad is the segment leader. Since December 2010, BMW Motorrad has also been active in the Indian market.</p>
          <p>All new BMWs, MINIs, and Rolls-Royce cars truly capture the spirit of the times and meet our customers' expectations. One example of this is the new BMW 5 Series. In Germany, the readers of the ADAC magazine named the new BMW 5 Series Sedan their Favorite Car of the Year. The 5 Series Touring just won a gold medal at the iF Product Design Award 2011, the highest distinction presented by the International Forum Design in Hannover. And the new BMW 5 Series is also a huge success internationally. It is the market leader in its segment.</p>
          <p>In a nutshell, our product offering is young, emotional and most of all, in great demand all over the world. And just last week, the BMW Group was again ranked as the "World's Most Admired Company" in the Motor Vehicles Segment by Fortune Magazine. And we were among &#x2013; it was the first time we were among the Top 20 Global Corporations.</p>
          <p>Handling the level of demand has been a tour de force for our international production network. All in all, our plants mastered 14 product launches at the highest quality level in 2010. In the beginning of the year 2010, we were still facing an under-utilization of production capacities, an effect of the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>However, by the fourth quarter, we had managed quite a leap, posting an all-time high in production. Never before have we manufactured so many cars in only three months. At the end of the year, we had about 100,000 units more on the books than originally planned in our budgets. Just to give you an idea of this scope, 100,000 units represents half the capacity of the Munich plant.</p>
          <p>Dealing with volatility has become a constant in our business. Market and political conditions are rapidly changing. In addition, the world we live in faces sudden political events and uncertainty, like we are currently observing in several countries or like the unfortunate natural disaster in Japan.</p>
          <p>In addition to this, automotive markets around the world are developing differently. Because of this, we are taking a targeted approach, first, by ensuring maximum flexibility among our associates and our production. For example, temporary labor is an important tool to meet growing demand. Through this, we manage to safeguard both our competitiveness and employment of our permanent staff. And second, by striving to maintain a balanced performance in the various markets of the world.</p>
          <p>Our key sales markets in 2010 were Germany, the Unites States, China and the UK. But we also managed to grow dynamically last year in many smaller markets, such as Brazil, Russia, India, South Korea and Turkey, the so-called BRIKT countries. I mean, you know the world BRIC with a C at the end, and we call it now BRIKT with K&amp;T at the end, K for Korea and T for Turkey. More than half of our vehicles are sold in Europe. Obviously, it is a major advantage that Europe has a common currency.</p>
          <p>In the first two months of 2011, we also recorded further growth in almost all markets. We saw double-digit growth rates in Europe, Asia and America. All in all, we delivered nearly 217,000 cars to customers. This was the best start to any year we have ever had.</p>
          <p>We aim to maintain this global balance in the future. This is why we are investing worldwide. In the United States, despite the financial crisis, we invested in our Spartanburg site, increasing capacity to 240,000 units, in other words, to about 1,000 units a day. This includes the BMW X3, X5 and X6 models. And we are taking full advantage of our flexibility, which will allow us to build more than 260,000 units in 2011.</p>
          <p>In India, since 2007, BMW has been market leader in the premium segment. Since the 1st of March, we have raised our local production capacity to 10,000 units. Since 2007, we have invested around &#x20AC;17 million in our plant in India and currently, our plant in Chennai assembles BMW 3 Series and 5 Series Sedans and the BMW X1.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will also assemble the BMW X3 in India from the second quarter onward. Another important step is the expansion of our retail network to a total of 22 dealerships. So we will be present in all relevant regions in India.</p>
          <p>In China, in Shenyang, our new Tiexi plant is scheduled to start production in 2012. The site will, among other models, produce BMW X1. This move allows us to increase our production capacities in China in the mid-term to over 150,000 units annually.</p>
          <p>In Germany, plant investments for the years 2011 and 2012 stand at &#x20AC;2 billion. And here are a few examples; Leipzig, over &#x20AC;400 million, Munich, approximately &#x20AC;250 million, Regensburg, over &#x20AC;350 million and Dingolfing, &#x20AC;500 million.</p>
          <p>As a next strategic step, we are considering to set up further sites, for instance, in South America. However, final decisions have not been made yet. Our credo has always been, production follows the market. So it is a matter of course that we observe the BRIKT countries very closely as well.</p>
          <p>That brings me straight to my second point. How do we intend to lead the BMW Group into the future? We at the BMW Group think ahead and focus on the long-term in every aspect of our business. We are pleased, of course &#x2013; don't get me wrong, we are pleased with the positive results for 2010. However, we see it as our responsibility to ensure the future success of the BMW Group.</p>
          <p>Our industry continues to face enormous challenges, including rising volatility in the markets, as well as greater volatility of raw material prices and currencies, increasingly strict ecological standards in all parts of the world, the global trend of digitalization and networking, varying diversity requirements from market-to-market. The demographic development that is changing customer requirements, as well as workforce capabilities, due to the average rising age and social responsibility, particularly society's expectations of corporate behavior.</p>
          <p>Since the fall of 2007, Strategy Number ONE has been our compass. Initially, we concentrated on profitability targets, the evaluation of processes and the reduction of costs. At the same time, we took strategic decisions for the development of our company and now, the focus is on further shaping our future, which involves topics such as technology leadership.</p>
          <p>Let me give you four examples to explain what this means. First, sustainable mobility, second, innovative mobility services, and third, the new BMW EfficientDynamics engine range and fourth, strategic alliances.</p>
          <p>First, we have a clear roadmap toward sustainable mobility. This year, the BMW Active E test cars will be handed over to customers. Meanwhile, MINI E is currently being tested in Beijing and Shenzen. This move makes us the first premium car manufacturer to put electric cars on Chinese roads. A highlight at the Shanghai Motor Show in mid-April will be the presentation of our New Energy Vehicle.</p>
          <p>This model will be our e-car from China for China; a long version of the BMW 5 Series as a plug-in hybrid. This car will benefit from the strength and the excellent reputation of the BMW brand. Today, BMW stands for sport-inspired and efficient driving. It is for these and other reasons that we have decided to launch our e-vehicles under a BMW sub-brand, BMW i. By doing so, we are enhancing our brand value through sustainability.</p>
          <p>From 2013 onwards, BMW i will offer highly sustainable and efficient e-cars. The BMW i3 will be our first all-electric vehicle for the world's urban centers. With its plug-in hybrid, the BMW i8 will combine the performance of a sports car with the fuel consumption of a small car. And as a first, both vehicles will have a passenger compartment made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic.</p>
          <p>Through MINI and Rolls Royce, we have shown our ability to develop and strengthen brands, so they are able to thrive for years to come. The BMW Group is making sheer driving pleasure ever more diverse &#x2013; the BMW Group is making sheer driving pleasure ever more diverse and future proof.</p>
          <p>Second; Mobility Services. Connected Drive is our second key area of innovation, besides EfficientDynamics. BMW has long been a pioneer in this field. All BMW models are already available with Connected Drive. And we are going to expand our offering considerably. This means communication between the car, the passengers and the surroundings and in a later step, car-to-car communication.</p>
          <p>Another interesting endeavor in this field is our new venture capital company, BMW i Ventures. As we announced at the BMW i launch event, we have already acquired a stake in the New York-based company My City Way. My City Way is a mobile app that provides information on over 40 cities in the United States. Another 40 cities will be rolled out as part of the global market launch.</p>
          <p>Third; our new BMW EfficientDynamics engine range. This technology is based on our BMW TwinPower Turbo package, combining maximum dynamics and minimum fuel consumption. Our current six-cylinder petrol engine won the Engine of the Year Award 2010. And In Geneva, we presented our latest four-cylinder petrol engine. Its peak torque is 13% higher, while it runs on 16% less fuel than its predecessor.</p>
          <p>We are gradually utilizing the BMW TwinPower Turbo technology in all petrol and diesel engines within our new BMW EfficientDynamics motor range. This innovative engine technology package is based on a modular strategy. This holds true for future four- and six-cylinder engines as well as our anticipated three-cylinder drive. This modular system will generate significant economies of scale. It will also facilitate the standardization of interfaces and processes. The combustion engine will continue to be a crucial part of individual mobility for a long time. Our new BMW EfficientDynamics engine range and the modular strategy put us in an excellent position to continue providing our customers with sheer driving pleasure.</p>
          <p>Fourth; strategic alliances. Strategic alliances with suitable partners are an inherent part of our strategy. We have a purchasing cooperation with Daimler AG and we have set up a joint venture with the SGL Group that produces carbon fibers. And I'd like to add that we will be the first automaker to apply this material on a large scale. This will be used in our BMW i3 and i8. And now, as we all know, other manufacturers are following our lead.</p>
          <p>We have also collaborated, because one year ago, they said it's definitely not the right way; it's changed in the meantime. We have also collaborated successfully with PSA Peugeot Citro&#xEB;n since 2006, with the production of four-cylinder engines. And in addition, we will expand our cooperation to include hybrid components and, at a later stage, also e-drive.</p>
          <p>To achieve this, we plan to set up a joint venture, <mark type="ph" /> BMW Peugeot Citro&#xEB;n Electrification. At present, we are waiting approval from the respective competition authorities. We aim to open the new joint venture to third-party business. This marks an important contribution to structuring and strengthening the European car industry further in the field of electrification.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, our company &#x2013; for our company, there will be no more either-or. Instead, our future approach will include both this and that. Combustion engines and e-mobility, steel and carbon, premium cars in the luxury segment and in the small car segment, mature markets and growth regions, and productivity and a focus on our associates.</p>
          <p>To successfully balance these elements, we must position ourselves with the right talent, including top-notch leadership. This also applies to our current team, which needs to be trained in new technologies, as well as future generations.</p>
          <p>In general, our trainee programs are geared at high-performing individuals and at the same time, we help teenagers acquire basic professional skills who perform poorly in school or have problematic social behavior. About three out of four program participants manage to secure a regular training contract afterwards.</p>
          <p>All in all, 3,800 young people are currently undergoing apprenticeships at the BMW Group across 27 professions and 27 locations. These programs &#x2013; this program is an important step toward satisfying our demand for skilled workers at all locations in the long-term.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group is a global company with a global workforce. As we see it, there are three key aspects to diversity. First, even though our workforce is aging, we will manage to improve our productivity level and we have found some mixed-age teams are particularly productive and innovative.</p>
          <p>Second, we aim to understand our customers in the markets even better. This effort can only succeed with international expertise, which can be acquired through a greater share of managers with an international background. And third, we will promote more women to management positions. We understand that women can contribute different and complementary leadership approaches.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, 2009 was the year of the economic crisis. 2010 was our year of a new beginning. 2011 will be our year of opportunities. We will capitalize on all of the opportunities available, moving closer to our targets laid out for 2012. You know that we strive to achieve an EBIT margin in the range of 8% to 10% in the Automobile segment for 2012. And we see good opportunities to achieve this range sustainable in the Automobile segment going forward. This, of course, depends on stable conditions across the globe.</p>
          <p>Our customers can look forward to attractive models being launched in 2011, the new BMW 6 Series Convertible and Coupe, the new BMW 1 Series M Coupe, the new BMW M5, the new MINI Coupe, and the second generation of BMW 1 Series. A company that is successful in the long-term consists of more than just key figures. It requires desirable products, strong brands, a corporate culture that promotes a sense of identity, a deep sense of responsibility and a clear vision for the future.</p>
          <p>Because we hold all these qualities, we are convinced that the BMW Group is well positioned for a very promising future.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Norbert Reithofer and now, Mr. Eichiner.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome you all. Our 2010 results clearly demonstrate the earning power and financial strength of the BMW Group. This performance underscores the effectiveness of our strategy. And it shows that our focus on premium is the right approach. These two success factors &#x2013; a clear strategy and our premium business model have given the BMW Group the necessary tools for achieving outstanding results.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we were able to strengthen our competitive position. We achieved structural cost and process improvements and boosted our long-term efficiency. As a result, we are closer to the targets we set for 2012. Our strategy and proven business model provide the foundation for future success. The steps we have taken will open up attractive prospects for our business over the coming year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to our business figures. I will just focus on select key figures. You will find all the detail in the annual report. With record revenues of &#x20AC;60.5 billion, the BMW Group was able to achieve unprecedented pre-tax earnings of &#x20AC;4.8 billion. Our return on sales, based on pre-tax profit, amounted to 8%.</p>
          <p>A good fourth quarter played a big part in this. We generated strong quarterly revenues of &#x20AC;16.75 billion and pre-tax Group earnings of just under &#x20AC;1.7 billion. The Automotive segment achieved revenues of &#x20AC;54 billion in 2010. The operating result for the Automotive segment totaled &#x20AC;4.36 billion for the full year.</p>
          <p>Our EBIT margin was exactly 8%, which shows that our 8% to 10% target range is within reach. Our RoCE of 40.2% was considerably higher than our target of at least 26%. The Automotive segment ended the fourth quarter very strongly. Revenues totaled &#x20AC;15.6 billion, with a profit before financial result of almost &#x20AC;1.6 billion and an EBIT margin of 10%. The improvement in earnings was also bolstered by economic conditions and dynamic growth in many car markets.</p>
          <p>Our new models generated strong demand in 2010. Our high-value model mix and good price positioning had a positive impact on revenues and earnings. We were able to increase our average revenue per vehicle quite substantially.</p>
          <p>Thanks to our new models, it was possible to scale back the sales discounts we had used during the financial crisis. We were able to regain about two percentage points of the price potential we had lost the year before. That is equivalent to an EBIT of about &#x20AC;1.1 billion on Automotive revenues of more than &#x20AC;54 billion. We continue to work on improving our transaction prices.</p>
          <p>The progress we made reducing costs also strengthened earnings. On the variable cost side, we were able to lower the cost of materials. Our purchasing benefited from synergies from the use of modular components.</p>
          <p>However, these measures did not affect the quality of our vehicles, which is crucially important for a premium car company. We implemented major cost reductions and efficiency improvements in development and our purchasing processes, as called for in our Strategy Number ONE.</p>
          <p>We also expect lower manufacturing costs for our new models in the future as well. We are emerging from a phase of high volatility and significant risks. For this reason, we once again implemented a comprehensive approach to risk management in 2010.</p>
          <p>We were properly hedged against raw material prices and currency fluctuations to limit a future negative impact on earnings. We were well positioned in our foreign currencies overall in 2010. This resulted in a gain of &#x20AC;334 million versus the previous year. For the most part, this reflected better transaction rates for our main currencies, the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and the Chinese renminbi.</p>
          <p>For 2011, our planned foreign currency exposure has largely been hedged at favorable conditions. We expect our earnings to benefit from a currency tailwind against this year. This is predicted to create a positive impact in the low three-digit million euro range.</p>
          <p>Regarding raw materials, we were able to limit the adverse impact on earnings in 2010 to negative &#x20AC;97 million. This was thanks to fixed price contracts for steel and derivative hedging for base and precious materials. As the worldwide economy recovers, prices for raw materials and precious metals are increasing. We have implemented various measures to mitigate the effects of this trend. As a result, we aim to limit negative effect on our results.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, we expect a negative impact on earnings in the low triple-digit million euro range this year. The positive trend in earnings gave our free cash flow in the Automotive segment a major boost. We stated our free cash flow in line with the industry standard. You can easily see the details of our free cash flow in the annual report and on this chart. Free cash flow in the Auto segment amounted to &#x20AC;4.47 billion at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>From now on, this figure will include the net investments in marketable securities. In 2010, we purchased more than &#x20AC;1.8 billion in securities. We acquired &#x20AC;1.74 billion in securities solely for the purpose of funding our German pension obligations. This brings to an end the outsourcing strategy in Germany.</p>
          <p>Since 2007, assets amounting to &#x20AC;4.7 billion were transferred in the BMW Trust. As of the end of 2010, a total of &#x20AC;5.2 billion in fund assets has been reserved for future pension payments. The pensions of our associates in Germany have been completely secured now. The positive trend in free cash flow strengthened the company's liquidity position. Group liquidity totaled roughly &#x20AC;9 billion at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In the Auto segment, we also profited from the positive trend in free cash flow. Net financial assets increased to &#x20AC;11.3 billion in 2010. The items cash and cash equivalents, as well as marketable securities, increased to &#x20AC;6.7 billion. Net financial receivables and net financial liabilities declined compared to prior year.</p>
          <p>In light of our record earnings, we'll also be returning more of our profit to shareholders than ever before. This year's proposed dividend payment totals &#x20AC;852 million, just over 26% of our net profit for the year.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, we are aiming for a higher payout ratio of between 30% and 40% over the medium term, so our shareholders will receive a larger share of the company's profit than in the past. This year's planned payout is a clear step in this direction. We consider this a sign of the company's growing earnings strength.</p>
          <p>Last year, the BMW Group made considerable progress in optimizing its capital employed. We optimized our production structures for the vehicles currently ramping up and we were able to re-utilize machinery used for production.</p>
          <p>We invested a total of &#x20AC;3.3 billion in capital expenditure, thus decreasing our expenses from the previous year's level. Due to the increase in revenue, the investment ratio of 5.4% was below our targeted CapEx ratio of less than 7%.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we also increased process and product communality and were able to generate economies of scale by using shared components. Our development process became even more efficient, thanks to the use of virtual simulation and safety technologies. This gave us additional financial latitude to develop more models and invest more in future technologies.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we increased our expenses for research and development to &#x20AC;3.1 billion. Due to the substantial increase in revenue, the R&amp;D ratio of 4.6% was lower than last year. This puts us just below our target ratio of 5% to 5.5% for research and development.</p>
          <p>Our BMW Peugeot Citro&#xEB;n Electrification joint venture will enable us to share the cost of developing and manufacturing all of the components necessary for electrification. We will take advantage of economies of scale in purchasing, development and production.</p>
          <p>The major increases in efficiency resulting from the joint venture will enable us to make pioneering investments in the future. Our efficiency measures have proven to be the right approach. Our company is well prepared for higher future investments in R&amp;D and CapEx. When we talk about future investments, we are talking about two main areas. First, the further internationalization of the company and second, alternative drive train technologies.</p>
          <p>Over the next few years, we expect expenditure in both of these areas to rise. Investing in the field of alternative drive technologies will enable us to meet future CO2 requirements. We will secure the BMW Group's technological leadership without exceeding our target ratios.</p>
          <p>This brings me to another highlight, our Financial Services segment. This is another area where we exceeded our targets, as seen in our record earnings of &#x20AC;1.2 billion and the return on equity. On the basis of our balance sheet equity ratio of 7.1%, return on equity was 26.1%. On the basis of a target equity ratio of 8%, return on equity was 21.3% and well beyond our strategic target of 18%.</p>
          <p>Financial Services profited in 2010 from very competitive refinancing conditions in the capital markets and the improvement risk situation. Low interest rates worldwide and significant improvement in credit spreads also benefited our Financial Services business.</p>
          <p>Moving onto our business activities in this segment. We concluded almost 1.1 million new contracts with retail customers in 2010. This represents a 6.6% increase over the previous year. The number of contracts in place with dealers and retail customers rose by 3.4% to just under 3.2 million contracts.</p>
          <p>The total business volume, as disclosed in the balance sheet, increased by 8.2% to &#x20AC;66.2 billion in 2010. The penetration rate decreased slightly to 48.2% in the financial year just ended. Leasing and customer financing activities each accounted for 24.1%.</p>
          <p>Overall, the risk situation in the financial services business improved in 2010. The used car markets in North America and the UK have recovered. Markets have also begun to stabilize in Continental Europe and Germany, in particular. An improved end-of-lease business resulted in an exceptional gain of about &#x20AC;122 million in segment earnings in 2010. Our dealer resale programs also actively contributed to improved pricing conditions. We also benefited from the shift from leasing to financing during the financial crisis.</p>
          <p>Although conditions improved, we increased risk provisions again last year in order to prepare for future market volatility. We have kept our residual values at an appropriate level. We nevertheless expect the used car markets to remain stable this year.</p>
          <p>Our credit risk situation also improved in 2010. The credit loss ratio fell to 0.67% from the previous year, a significant decrease of 17 basis points. We expect a continued stabilization in the credit risk situation as well. In order to optimize, our comprehensive risk management for Financial Services, we are continuing with our expansion of the BMW Bank.</p>
          <p>As part of the EU Passport project, our previously legally independent financial services company in Spain was converted into a BMW Bank branch in 2009. Last year, we successfully completed the integration of our Italian subsidiary. Over the next few years, we'll transfer financial services activities in other European markets to the BMW Bank, which is regulated by the German Banking Act. We're examining possibilities for further integration.</p>
          <p>In preparation for the incorporation of further subsidiaries in the BMW Bank, we have increased its equity. To meet the stricter capital adequacy requirements prescribed by Basel III for banks in the future, we will be contributing further equity in 2011. By expanding the BMW Bank, we are increasing the flexibility of our liquidity management. In the future, we'll optimize our refinancing potential through our deposit business and increased access to central bank liquidity.</p>
          <p>The Motorcycles segment generated an EBIT of &#x20AC;71 million in 2010. We do not expect, however, to be able to maintain the same level of earnings this year. The initial consolidation of the Husqvarna Group will entail further expenses for the strategic development of the brand.</p>
          <p>Let's finish by taking a look at the financial year now underway. What do we expect? We intend to expand our position as the world's leading premium car company in 2011. The BMW Group is aiming for record sales of well over 1.5 million vehicles and new sales highs for all three brands.</p>
          <p>In the first six months of the year, in particular, we expect to see significant sales increases on account of our new models. Keep in mind that the new 5 Series Sedan and 5 Series Touring have been segment leaders since last October. And then there is also the X1, the X3 and the MINI Countryman.</p>
          <p>Growth rates will be overstated, however, due to basis effects. In the first two months of the year, volumes grew by 25% year-on-year. We anticipate a slower pace of growth in the second half of the year. It will not be possible to maintain the growth rates of the first few months of 2011, mainly because of the more challenging comparative base and lifecycle factors.</p>
          <p>We will continue to reap the benefits of our ongoing profitability measures on the variable cost side this year. Efficiency improvements we have achieved will be embedded in our processes and structures over the long-term.</p>
          <p>We are aiming for an EBIT margin of more than 8% for our automotive business in 2011 and a RoCE of more than 26%, in line with our strategic goals, assuming that conditions remain as they are. In the Financial Services Segment, our aim is a return on equity of more than 18%. We are confident that we will be able to keep our returns within our target range beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>Starting this year, we will be launching new models that will, for the first time, take full advantage of recent efficiency increases. In these models, our modular strategy will be leveraged going forward, achieving further economies of scale. Our performance speaks for itself.</p>
          <p>The BMW Group's strategic focus on the premium auto and motorcycle business, backed by an efficient financial services organization, is the right approach. We will continue to refine this business model, which is based on continuity, future orientation and a clear focus. Sustainability will continue to be part of the strategic DNA of our business approach.</p>
          <p>We are committed to long-term, strategic management. What sets the BMW Group apart is a strong drive to perform, an unrelenting commitment to quality, and a passion for innovation. The perfect complement to these qualities is, of course, our determined focus on prudent financial management.</p>
          <p>Together, all of these attributes drive the long-term success of the BMW Group. As always, our aim is to continue increasing the company's value in the interest of our associates and all other stakeholders. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Eichiner. Now we'll begin our Q&amp;A session. Please remember you need to press the red button first when you want to ask a question. Who wants to start, Mr. Burgstaller and then we go here? Yeah.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Stefan Burgstaller, Goldman Sachs. You mentioned that your intention now is to have a 8% to 10% EBIT margin sustainable. The word sustainable in the auto industry is obviously a very difficult one for financial markets. Can you just explain how conceptually you think about this? I guess you think about raw material cost inflation, input cost inflation, productivity gains, CO2 costs, modernization. But what drives the range? What makes it 8%, what makes it to 10%?</p>
          <p>Second, if we think about 2012 and beyond, we see higher CO2 costs, we see &#x2013; I would argue, I would assume a non-profitable i3, lower margin front-wheel drive cars. Again, you know, why can you be confident that you can sustain the profitability in this range?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, how does the commitment, the external commitment to have an 8% to 10% sustainable auto margin translate to the internal control systems? What has changed? What will change the way you run the business for you to be able to deliver this, given that there is an increasingly more volatile world you are facing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mr. Burgstaller. I think we start with the strategic overview from Norbert Reithofer and then Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I expected that question. I mean, what we will do in future, in principle, you can say we will use four different modular systems. One modular system will be a front-wheel drive modular system. The second modular system will be a rear-wheel drive modular system, 3 Series cars upwards and front-wheel drive new products, new MINI and BMW products and, of course, known products from BMW and MINI.</p>
          <p>So then you can say we will use one engine modular system, three-cylinder engines, four-cylinder engines, six-cylinder engines. We will use the modular engine system for both our front-wheel drive and our rear-wheel drive cars. So &#x2013; and number four will be the modular system coming out of the joint venture with PSA &#x2013; with the PSA group.</p>
          <p>So and if you see the BMW Group in the past, it is the first time that we use modular system in such a wide range, if you would like to say it like that. So &#x2013; and that gives us confidence combined, by the way, with the launch of the new BMW 1 Series cars and the new BMW 3 Series cars from next year on, our cost basis, that means coming from the supply industry, is much lower than in the past. So and you have to see the combination.</p>
          <p>We were already able to achieve advantages, as already mentioned, the new 1 Series cars and the new 3 Series cars. We are building up four different modular systems for front wheel drive cars, for rear wheel drive cars, for engines and for components what we need for electrification. So &#x2013; and that is &#x2013; how should I say it, a very wide scope of using modular components. It's the first time that we do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the question was what makes us confident that we can sustainably achieve the range of 8% to 10%? Dr. Reithofer already mentioned some approaches we are taking on a technical side. I mean, we have to see that this year, we will start the launch of the new 1 and 3 Series, which is our volume product. And we know what this car is capable to deliver. So we know the cost base and it's all included, so this car has not only cost targets to achieve it, it should be a very attractive car and has to deliver CO2 targets as well, and that is already in the plan. So that's why we are quite confident that with the introduction of the new fleet of 1 and 3 Series, we should be able to support that target.</p>
          <p>Having said this, there are other issues that are really important. Let's look at mix on the one hand and on pricing on the other hand. So mix, our strong footprint in emerging markets, which is one of our strategies, supports our mix. And you can read it out of our numbers, that this is &#x2013; the mix is on the way up. The revenue per car is on the way up, despite the fact that we are increasing our footprint on the lower end at the same point in time.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is the pricing. We've not yet achieved the pricing level before crisis. So we have still a way to go and this opens up further opportunities with the introduction of volume cars of the 1 and the new 3 Series to make further improvements on this side as well.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we've talked a lot about our achievements in purchasing, you're aware of this. This is something that will benefit the 3 Series and 1 Series program as well, and should help us. And the same is true for the cooperation projects with PSA and other OEMs, where we try to gain more economies of scale. So basically, those are the levers we are using in order to maintain our profitability over the mid-term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. Next one is Georges Dieng and then Mr. Ellinghorst.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Good morning, Georges Dieng, Natixis. I have three questions. Just a follow-up on this issue of efficiency gains and to maybe put some color on that. When we look at the work-down of the EBIT for 2010, you had close to &#x20AC;1 billion gain from, let's say, Number ONE-related efficiency gains. And I was wondering with the move towards <mark type="ph" /> major strategy this year or next, whether this &#x20AC;1 billion figure should be exceeded in 2011 and '12?</p>
          <p>The second point on financial services, if we disregard the possible gains from off-lease business, what would drive the improvement in earnings in 2011 in the context of higher interest rates? And finally, also on Financial Services, you mentioned the BMW Bank. And I was wondering what was the magnitude of the equity contribution in 2010 and the amount that you plan to contribute in 2011? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, with the efficiency gains, well, we already disclosed what we achieved to the 5 Series and of course, the &#x2013; as I said, with the introduction of the new 1 and 3 Series, there will be further improvements. I think we will be able to reduce manufacturing costs significantly and it will definitely be a higher one digit percentage number against the predecessor in the bottom line. So this should help and the one-off expenditure will be reduced at the same level as we did it for the 5 Series, so that supports our approach in order to achieve this range.</p>
          <p>Going forward, I mean, we already stated that we achieved the targets and we overachieved the targets, been selling for the Strategy Number ONE on the purchasing side. That's what our director already mentioned and this is now in a basis. Right, so that will help up on the way going forward because it's product related and as long as the 5 Series will be on the market, it will benefit from the savings.</p>
          <p>Now talking about the FS business, Financial Services. Going forward, actually clearly, we have a solid portfolio and on the way forward, we're expecting that the record low interest rate should increase over time. That is clear. We expect that the cycle will come back and this should have, on the one hand, certain pressure on the margins.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we are expecting some relief on the risk side, because we see improvement in the used car business, supported by lower volume. So just to give you an example, in U.S. for example, in 2010, we had to sell roughly around 150,000 used cars. This year, the number will be below 100. So this is a big relief and this will stabilize our residual values in this market and therefore, have an influence on our residual values as well.</p>
          <p>So overall, we think that Financial Services is in good shape and it should be able to achieve the 18% return on equity target sustainably in the mid term, of course, without any financial crises, that's clear. Now equity, we will have to inject some equity for the growing bank. That's absolutely right and we are talking about a lower three-digit million number that will be the amount, it's not exactly fixed now. We have to see how big the volume is and but this will be the range. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next one, Arndt Ellinghorst and then <mark type="ph" /> J&#xF8;rgen Peeper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot. It's Arndt Ellinghorst, Credit Suisse in the back here. My first question, Dr. Reithofer, is on pricing and the competitive environment, on pricing and the competitive environment in the market. We see Mercedes, especially in Germany, being fairly aggressive with 1.25% financing rate and 50% guaranteed residual values. So your plan moving forward to increase your net pricing, could you just talk a bit about the environment and then also maybe could you be a bit more precise on how much you could improve net pricing this year after you mentioned roughly 200 basis points last year?</p>
          <p>Secondly, Dr. Eichiner, on your savings or efficiency gains target, you did &#x20AC;990 million last year. Could you be a bit more precise how much you are expecting this year and next year or just give us a feeling of the bandwidth? Will it be more than you did last year or less or in the same order of magnitude?</p>
          <p>And then finally on Financial Services, your credit loss ratio came down to 67 basis points for the full year last year. I remember you had 58 after nine months, so could you give us the fourth quarter number and talk a little bit about why the credit loss ratio has increased towards the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Arndt Ellinghorst. I think pricing competition and net pricing improvement is the right question for the CEO. We'll start with Norbert Reithofer and then Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean first of all, if I &#x2013; Germany is, for me, a very good example as a market. And if I compare the market performance from a financial point of view in Germany in 2009 and 2010, then 2010 was for the BMW in Germany, a very good year from a profitability point of view. I mean, the volume was nearly the same, but the profitability was much higher and I mean really much higher, not just &#x20AC;50 million, much higher. So that means it was a very good year in Germany, and why? Our crystal clear focus was to balance three different figures, first, volume. We decided during the year to take more than 10,000 units out of the German market and move the 10,000 units to other markets.</p>
          <p>So that was a very good step towards improving the cost of retail situation and of course, if you see the residual value situation, we were able to improve as well. And if you compare the BMW brand with brands of our competitors, we are in the meantime from a residual value point of view in a very good shape. So that means we were able to balance volume. We made a management decision to take out volume from the German market.</p>
          <p>But despite that fact, we were able to achieve the same volume or nearly the same volume as in 2009. But because we were able to manage cost of retail at the same time and residual values at the same time, we were much better from a profitability point of view in the German market. By the way, that is the same strategy we use for other European markets as well and with success.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But excuse me, I mean, that's talking about the history, could you talk a bit more about the future, maybe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will not change our strategy for the future. I mean, you asked what will you do in the German market? We will carry on in the future as well, like I said, in the German market. And what is important for us, I mean, the German market is just one example. But I said last year several times to the press and to a couple of you that for us, it's important to have a balanced situation between the markets in North America and South America in Europe and in Asia.</p>
          <p>So and we were building up in end of 2009 and at the beginning of 2010, a management system to steer contribution margins in the various markets. So and that was a management decision and the result was a very good one. And the future, of course, we will use the management system in future as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe some remarks from my side. Basically, the strategy is that we should be able to improve pricing with the introduction of new models. I mean, and around that situation, old 1 Series, everybody knows the new one is coming. We always have higher sales of product. It's quite normal and will be the same with our volume product with the 3 Series. But with the change to the new model, this is a one-off chance to really make a further step-down. So that is the reason why we think this year, we cannot expect as much improvement as we've seen last year and so it will be more around 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>So this is what we expect. And the same is true for the savings on material cost side, for example. I mean, we are now in a phase where we change from our old volume product to the new one. Though, this year, I don't expect the same level of savings or material cost, or I'll just say, number one savings. As we've seen 2010, it will definitely be a mid three digit million number that what we are expecting. And then with the introduction of a full volume of the new 1 and 3 Series in 2012, we should see further improvements.</p>
          <p>You'd have to come along with all the initiatives, we've explained to you we have implemented on this new program. And I'm not too excited about the basis point increasement &#x2013; increases on the credit loss in Q4, because usually, this is a seasonal effect that will wash out now in the first quarter. That's what at least we are expecting. So, we are not too concerned about that. It's more a seasonal effect and not a different trend that was implemented at that point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what was the number, if I'm asked? What is the number of credit loss for the credit loss ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, we disclosed it for the full year. It's now 0.67%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next question comes from <mark type="ph" /> J&#xF8;rgen Peeper and then Horst Schneider [HSBC]. [ph] Mr. Peeper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions from my side. The first is on your growth perspective, your comments. You stated that the first half should be very good, maybe not as good as January, February, but probably double-digit. And the second half growth would be slower. Is it I understand &#x2013; do I understand you correctly, is it first, just a mathematical reason, just basis effect? Secondly your product cycles, namely the 3 Series and really not so much a market caused by weaker markets or slower growth in your key markets? And the second question, the catastrophe in Asia, is there anything one could expect on your supplier side, on constraints your &#x2013; over the next few months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, you have to look back into 2010 and as you maybe are aware, the first quarter was a weak quarter and we always said that in 2010 with the introduction of the new 5 Series, then we expected more growth and it's exactly what happened. So we had a very slow start in 2010 and then the momentum picked up and we gained more and more. And that is the reason that we have this kind of base effect. I mean, if you look at the performance against 2007, you get a better picture what's going on and how good it is. So we had a low base in the first quarter and this is the reason why we are saying now the growth momentum we have in the first quarter was 25%. We cannot really predict that this will be a going-forward basis.</p>
          <p>And of course then in the second half of the year, we start the change of the &#x2013; our volume car of the 3 Series, and we prepare for that. So the volumes on the 3 Series side will go down because we have to manage the run-out. And then the ramp-up of the new cars will take place. Those two effects are relevant for the development on the seasonality in this year.</p>
          <p>Now your next question about the supply chain issues, or the effects out of the crisis in Japan. Basically, we have to say actually we don't know the order of magnitude of this crisis, because that is &#x2013; it could be much bigger than maybe we think today. But our dependency is not such high. We are sourcing, for example, gearboxes out of Japan, but this is delivered via ships, so we have a certain supply available for the next, let's say, five to six weeks.</p>
          <p>And it's more an issue for our suppliers, so we have to look at second tier and third tier even, because they are supplying out of Japan electronic and semiconductor parts and we are on our way to analyze what risk is on this side, and it will take another week or maybe another 10 days to really know what's going on on this side. So that's where there is a certain risk we have to look at and to find a way to compensate.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Horst Schneider from HSBC. Three questions, if I may. The first one relates in general to your visibility in the order book. When I look at the current situation, it seems to me that it's a bit comparable to the beginning of 2008. We have got rising inflation, interest rates are rising in some areas, the general macro uncertainty is rising, and you've provided us with an outlook that sounds very promising in terms of volumes. And I would like to know how safe is that order book that you have? Can these orders also be cancelled for which reasons, ever?</p>
          <p>And then the second question that I have relates to potential cash flow target. I remember last year, you provided us with a cash flow target for 2010. Could you do that also for 2011?</p>
          <p>And the last question is your dependency on China. I know, Mr. Reithofer, that you stress always, don't get too dependent on China. And there was recently an interesting article also in the German Manager magazine, where you said &#x2013; where you were quoted as saying to the other carmakers, don't transfer any technology to China as well. So I would like to get your view in general on the dependency, on the risks that you are maybe faced in China with that the Chinese government gets more demanding? Because I have got the feeling you only can get approval for more capacity expansion if you give them the favor that you deliver them also technology? So maybe you can make a statement on that as well. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question. We'll start with Mr. Reithofer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, let me first give you an answer regarding dependency from a volume point of view. I mean, if I use 2010 as an example, 12% of our total volume was China. That means 88% other markets. I mean, from a dependency point of view, that is still on the right track, in my opinion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But it was 20% in February, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pardon?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was 20% already in February.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said 2010. Yes. And I still stick to what I said. I said what we need is really a balanced volume distribution worldwide and it has to be balanced between North and South America, Europe and China. And I mean, I used the example Europe. We sell more than 50% of our volume still in Europe. And I mean, Europe is very good, because we don't have to pay import duties. We have the same currency and so on.</p>
          <p>So in the meantime, we are able again to have two digit growth rates in North America as well in January and February of 2011, because of our new 5 Series available in the United States, the new X3 available in the United States. And China, as I said, last year, 12% of our volume. It can be that it will be slightly higher in 2011. That will happen. So but for me, 30%, just to use a <mark type="ph" /> roughhouse number, should not be the case. That is not a balanced volume distribution anymore, to give you a crystal clear on that.</p>
          <p>So then, you ask growth perspective, and I mean, if I see our product momentum in the year 2011 and in the year 2012, I mean, Mr. Ellinghorst asked in principle the same question. We have available still a fairly new X1, a new X3, a new 5 Series Sedan, a new 5 Series Touring, and we will launch during 2011 the new 1 Series BMWs and we carry on to do so in 2012.</p>
          <p>We will have the market launch of the new 3 Series in the year 2012. That means if I compare us with other car manufacturers in 2011 and 2012, and I think it's true for 2013 as well, then we have the best product momentum. I mean, our situation in 2008 and 2009 was, we were in the middle of a crisis situation. And from a product portfolio point of view, we were not as good from an age point of view as our competitors. But now it's different.</p>
          <p>So you ask me, China, the question, what does it mean? Will you use knowledge in China from a technology point of view? I mean, it's a big market and just let me answer like that. It is give-and-take &#x2013; it is give-and-take and there is no such thing like a free lunch. I mean, we earn a lot of money at the moment, but as I said, there is no such thing like a free lunch.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much. The last question from your side was about the free cash flow. This will be answered by Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are expecting a strong free cash flow this year as well. And the number will be more than &#x20AC;3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next one, Michael Raab [Kepler Capital Markets] and then Jochen Gehrke.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, gentlemen, right over here. You stressed several times that, you managed to increase production efficiency which admittedly seems to be state-of-the-art in the industry, while at the same point in time, not apparent product quality. How fine a line is it from your point of view to walk on, that is, how much further could you push that, in order not to impair quality? Because I have to say, my most recent experience with your product contradicts your thesis and against this backdrop, what is your planning internally for the budget regarding warranty provisions per vehicle going forward?</p>
          <p>In the same context, in terms of production efficiency, how many more efficiency gains do you need per annum in the future on average to offset the rising fixed costs induced on you as well as the whole industry by the tightening regulatory framework?</p>
          <p>And then, finally, regarding your engine strategy mid to long-term, is there still any space to live for the V-shaped engines, because you didn't mention them earlier? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Should I start with the efficiency and quality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, clearly, for us, this is not a conflict. We have to achieve both targets and it's a way how you handle modules and how you treat that in a development and in production phase. We cannot sacrifice on the quality in order to achieve &#x2013; save things on the material cost side. And in order to deliver this &#x2013; to deliver both targets, you have to focus more on modular systems, because as soon as I've got a modular system in place that is reliable, I'm able to use it across all the models and the whole portfolio. And this is then a good way forward to achieve both the quality target as well the cost target.</p>
          <p>If I would do the opposite to have different modules in every and each model line, then the challenge would be much higher, because then you have to test all those models again and things like that. That's one of the reasons why we are concentrating on this modular approach in order to really have a focus on one module that achieves both cost targets, functional targets and the quality. And we will never be prepared to sacrifice on quality for cost savings. So that's not our strategy, very clearly.</p>
          <p>The second question was engine...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the right question is that...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You asked V engines, right? Do you have in mind eight-cylinder engines, 10-cylinder and 12-cylinder or do you mean below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good counter-question. I was predominantly thinking about V8 and above, but also if you think about changing shapes in the lower cylinder area, that would be nice to elaborate on, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you see the 12-cylinder engine, I mean we have a new 12-cylinder engines for our BMW 7 Series cars, and for our Rolls-Royce cars. And we will carry on to produce our 12-cylinder engine at least during the next five to six years. And how we will carry on, will as well be &#x2013; it will depend on how will the regulations develop. I mean, if we are, let me say in the year 2013, in a situation that a lot of cities say, you are not allowed anymore to drive into the city if you use a 12-cylinder engine or a 10-cylinder engine or you have to pay an awful lot of money to be allowed to do so, then it's a different situation.</p>
          <p>But at the moment, we have no reason to stop our 12-cylinder engine, for example. We would carry on to produce it, let me say, at least until 2015, 2016 and how we will carry on at the moment, no final decision.</p>
          <p>Eight-cylinder engine is safe. The V8 and below V8 and V12 of course, we will use in line petrol engines, six-cylinder, four-cylinder and three-cylinder. So you ask productivity and quality, I mean I was for nearly seven years responsible for production. You can do both. And my experience is, if your productivity level in a plant is high, your quality level in a plant is high as well. And if your productivity level in a plant is low, your quality level in a plant will be low as well. You have to do both, in my opinion. You have to improve your quality on a constant basis and you have to improve your productivity and in my opinion, we are not yet at the end what we are able to do.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. If I missed out on that one a bit, I guess you didn't answer the question regarding warranty provisions per vehicle going forward in your budgeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Mr. Eichiner?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly as we have &#x2013; as we get a growing car park, the warranty cost overall will increase. But the relevant figure is warranty per unit and this figure is going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Next one. Yes, Jochen Gehrke and then Norbert Kalliwoda.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Jochen Gehrke, Deutsche Bank. Three questions. First of all on your hedging strategy, Mr. Eichiner, when I look at your annual report, it stands out that renminbi is now by far the biggest currency exposure of the BMW Group. To my understanding, that's not a currency that is very easy to hedge, at least longer term, while at the same time, there is obviously a market developing for that. If you could just talk about your thoughts how you secure that risk within the Group?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly to the numbers and the bridge you provided, last year when I take the volume mix market, about a &#x20AC;4.4 billion increase and I divide it by the revenue increase, I get 42% gearing or &#x2013; and I appreciate the fact that this is because of a huge shift towards more profitable markets. Now, two questions in that. Could you give us any understanding on how we should think about gearing in BMW going forward? So how big will this number be assuming no major market shifts as much as happened in 2010?</p>
          <p>And on the same note, you take out the &#x20AC;695 million personnel cost number. Why is that? Isn't that normal course of business that when a company becomes more profitable, personnel costs just go up? I think you will have in this audience at least a lot of people that have sympathy with that thought that bonuses rise with rising profitability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jochen Gehrke. Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let's talk about the hedging first on renminbi. Of course, we are applying financial hedging there and the increasing portfolio is a matter of fact and it's derived from our success in China. But on the other hand, you know that we are preparing for investment in China. We're building our factories. We're building up operations there, so more and more supply will be shifted to China. So on the other hand, we will try to compensate part of that. But actually, it depends on the growth in this country, where the exposure at the end of the day will be and for 2011, I think we have to calculate for our growing exposure there.</p>
          <p>Personnel cost, the increase is mainly due to the bonus. So, in the crisis, we didn't pay any. Now it's coming back and we have to provision for that, that is a major influence on the personnel cost side.</p>
          <p>I think another question? What was left? Yes, the gearing, your question about the gearing. Well, we had a very strong result in the fourth quarter, and I mean, we saw more cost and we will be selling in the first quarter 2011, I mean, there is some seasonality. You are aware of that. So, we have usually strong quarters. The second quarter, the first quarter is usually a stronger quarter than the first and the second. But overall, we roughly achieved 20% to 30% in average and I think that is &#x2013; now that is a good range for the gearing on the way forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I may just come back. When I look at your balance sheet, your renminbi exposure has almost doubled &#x2013; is almost the same size as the pound/dollar exposure combined. The question was really much more about what you can do in this market to hedge? Is it any different? Can you really go out and also do the two, three-year hedges in the currency or are you much more limited by the depth and the availability of financial instruments in that currency? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, actually, there are more opportunities now for hedging. This is a market that is delivering more now and we are able to hedge for one to two years. That is actually the range, not longer. And we have to see how this develops.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next one, Norbert Kalliwoda and then Charles Winston.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Norbert Kalliwoda from Kalliwoda Research. I've got two questions for you. First, the market for components or resources is partly highly fragmented. And do you think for avoiding the risks of <mark type="ph" /> an insured, might it be necessary to create some suppliers redundancies contracts, maybe?</p>
          <p>And the second question is regarding the MINI, the iPhone applications, are those features already finished from the technical research and finish? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean it's always a question using single source or using more than one source? I mean, we think at the moment that if it comes to very critical components, it can be better to use more than one source. But the situation in 2010, I mean, that was the background of your question was, I mean, after the crisis, the whole supply industry &#x2013; we asked the supply industry in 2009 to reduce the capacities, all of us, Volkswagen, Daimler, BMW and the others.</p>
          <p>And then we ask, now we have to produce a lot more and we all asked at the same time. And because of that, of course, you are right. We had shortages. But the shortages, you can combine with the financial crisis and the situation that we had to ramp up very fast, all of us at the same time. And I mean, if you see our gearbox suppliers, for example, we nearly use all the same, for example, ZF. And if we say now we need eight-speed gearboxes and we all would like to ramp up at the same time, then you have shortages.</p>
          <p>Or we were confronted with the situation that we needed more cars for China. I mean, the question was asked before and the market in China asked for more automatic gearboxes. That means we had to switch from manual gearboxes to automatic gearboxes and the shortages you have to see as a combination of all these factors. So but if it comes to, for example, electronic parts, we really have to ask ourselves when we do at the moment, do we need more than one source?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next one was Charles Winston [Redburn Partners] and then Stuart Pearson. Charles?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Charles Winston. Thanks. I have two questions, please. Firstly, back in your in 2007, when you gave the Strategy Number One presentation, you talked about achieving cost savings of, I think getting on for &#x20AC;6 billion cumulative from '07 to the end of '12. You are talking about I think perhaps &#x20AC;400 million, &#x20AC;500 million, &#x20AC;600 million next year, the answer to a previous question and then perhaps more, 1 billion-plus in '12. Does that mean you have already achieved &#x20AC;4.5 billion of your &#x20AC;6 billion? In other words, are you on target? If not, why not?</p>
          <p>And the second question is just on the provisioning charge in the fourth quarter. It looks as though you charged about &#x20AC;1 billion of provisions into the Auto division in the fourth quarter. Some of that will be bonuses, but what else was it and what sort of guidance can you offer for the provision charging that we should expect in 2011? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I confirm that we are on track with our saving targets and actually we are ahead of our target, especially on the material cost side. So these targets will clearly be overachieved. And provisioning, in quarter four, clearly a big part of that was bonus, the provisions for bonus. Another one was, we had to accrue more provisions for warranty, because business increased heavily in 2010, especially in the fourth quarter with high mix, high priced cars. That was another reason we had to accrue more.</p>
          <p>And on the way forward, I mean, as I said, we are on a good track. The consumption -- the warranty consumption per car is going down. And this shows that we have a good quality level overall, and so we think that we have to increase warranties under-proportional to the volume growth in the year 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Stuart Pearson [Morgan Stanley] and then Max Warburton.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of questions, firstly going back to China, just reading earlier that BMW has now beaten Rolex and even Apple to be the most desired brand in China. Quite impressive, I guess. So, I wonder if you can just talk about your pricing point in China specifically relative to peers and how that's developed, I guess, over the last six or nine months even?</p>
          <p>I don't know if you could give any more specific guidance on the split between local productions and imports for 2011? I know you've given some midterm guidance. Anything more specific for this year would be helpful.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is a more general one on fuel efficiency as a strategic advantage. When we, I guess sit back and listen to what we heard last night, and hear again today in the megacity vehicle, it seems BMW is a company intent on really staying the fuel efficiency leader among premium car makers. But as Mercedes and Volkswagen spend to catch up, are we at the beginning here of an arms or technology race to really drive down emissions that in a way, could cap the margin potential of the whole premium sector?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with Fritz Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly in China, we are positioned as a clear &#x2013; as a premium brand and I see in the price levels we are achieving in China, there is only 1 Series competitor actually close to that level and depends on the model who has a better price position. That is Mercedes, whilst other brands like Audi are positioned below that level, coming out of a different history in the development in China.</p>
          <p>So, I think we have very high level, which is adequate for a luxury brand in China and we do everything to maintain that high price level. And then the guidance for the local production, I mean clearly, we will ramp up our local production in China. That is due to the implementation of the new plant and of the capacity we will have to increase for the existing older plant and the share will be roughly 40% local production in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fuel efficiency, Mr. Reithofer? Technology raise in the premium segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, the situation, let me start with the current situation. The current situation is the figures lying in front of me, is the BMW Group ended the year in Germany with 154 grams CO2 per kilometer. If I compare, for example, with Mercedes, it was 173 grams CO2 per kilometer. If I use not the BMW Group, because MINI is included with 132, if I use the BMW brand it was 157, compared to Mercedes was 173. That means it's still a gap between the two of us.</p>
          <p>But you are absolutely right, others are coming closer. For example, Audi ended the year with 158 compared to us to 157. It's already very close, you can say, even on the same level. Others, for example, it's interesting for you as well, Lexus overall is on the level of 173 as well, on the same level like Mercedes-Benz as a brand.</p>
          <p>So if I look into the future, I mean, Mr. Gehrke, you ask the question very often as well. I mean the future is in the year 2020, we, all of us, we have to achieve certain targets. And the target in the European Union is 95 grams CO2 per kilometer. And what we need is a balanced mixture of highly efficient combustion engines. I think my colleague Klaus Draeger was talking about earlier today.</p>
          <p>We need in future plug-in hybrids and we need, of course, battery electric vehicles to be able to achieve these figures. And if I see the situation in the United States of America, we will have nearly the same situation in the United States of America between 2016 and 2025. That means we have to improve year-by-year. Otherwise, we can be forced to pay as a car manufacturer.</p>
          <p>So, what does it mean for our targets, for example, the EBIT range between 8% to 10% for the Automobile business? I mean, we said we will not go up, from a target point of view, above 10%, because we know that we have to finance all these technologies and we have to finance all these technologies in the coming years. So that was the reason we said we will stay with 8% to 10%, because we have to finance that. That means your question was absolutely right.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Max Warburton from Bernstein, up here at the back. Two questions, please. I remember sitting here a year ago and the company gave guidance of, I think it was a low single-digit operating margin in the Automobile division and obviously, we've had this fantastic, fabulous results.</p>
          <p>In terms of the regional contribution to that big profit surprise, obviously no one is going to dispute China was the big driver, but can we come back to some of the other regions? Dr. Reithofer, I was surprised that you said that Germany improved its profitability so much. In the annual on page 12, it actually shows that German revenues went down on flat sales. So it looks like revenue per unit went down, if I read page 12 correctly. Could you just give us an idea of how Germany improved its profitability so much and whether the U.S. beat its budget for 2010 as well?</p>
          <p>And then just the second question, small cars. You talked last year about a big, big expansion of small cars, maybe 1 million units on the small car platform in the end. When does the company need to make a capacity decision? And could you just talk a little bit about Oxford <mark type="ph" /> draughts and maybe an extra plant? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, you're absolutely right with what you said about Germany, but the difference is that we really could improve our pricing in Germany with the introduction of new cars, pricing compares to the 2009 levels was much better, and we've made a big step forward in Germany and that's supported our earnings in the German market. And it was the same in the U.S. So our focus on pricing was essential for the improvement there and the two markets, the U.S. and Germany, that contributed a lot to the 2% overall improvement that we discussed already.</p>

          <p>Next one, Thierry Huon [Exane BNP Paribas] and then Brian Johnson. Also smart car explanation, yes, new plants needed, Oxford, yes, Mr. Reithofer, yeah, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, as you know, we decided to produce the Countryman. Magna Steyr is doing it for us. That means we have capacity available in our plant in Oxford. And in my opinion, with low investment in Oxford, we could go up to 300,000 units. If we need 300,000 units for our new front-wheel drive cars, that is one additional capacity.</p>
          <p>And we have to have in mind last year, we were able to produce around 160,000 units in our Spartanburg plant. We said now we have a capacity available in the United States of America of 240,000 units and if we use our flexibility tools, we can move up to at least 260,000 units already in 2011. That means 100,000 units more capacity available already from 2011 and of course, the following year. And if you have the &#x2013; and if you have in mind, we announced that we will move up our Dadong plant in Shenyang in China, because the long version of the BMW 5 series is a very successful product in China, that is additional capacity and from 2012 onwards, our new Tiexi plant in China will be available at least with half the capacity that is &#x2013; that comes on top.</p>
          <p>And we announced yesterday we are in a thinking process, do we need at least a <mark type="ph" /> CKD plant in South America, for example, in Brazil? If we decide that we need a plant in South America, then it would be additional capacity for the BMW Group as well.</p>
          <p>So all-in-all, what I said at the moment, even if I go into the year 2013 or 2014, we will not have capacity restrictions.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I'd like to come back to China. There are lot of fantasies in the market about the Chinese contribution to BMW's profit. Could you help us to have some flavor on the contribution from the GDs and maybe also what part of the revenues are generated in China, but consolidated in the BMW accounts?</p>
          <p>Second questions regard the Number ONE strategy and the savings you are expecting. You just said that you are ahead of schedule. Does that mean that we should revise the total savings expected from this Number ONE strategy or are you just in advance of schedule? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about China again, I mean, clearly, if you say, we have roughly 20% of our sales in China, then the contribution for China after tax, I mean, the real number is between 20% and 30%. So it's more than the sales.</p>
          <p>And a part of our business clearly is in the JV, where we have profit of equity that if you look at our figures in the fourth quarter, we had an improvement of &#x20AC;50 million in first quarter coming out of the Chinese joint venture business with the introduction of the new 5 Series, long wheel base, though this is a upward trend now, they benefit from this highly successful car. And I think we can expect more profit coming out of our JV in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Now total savings, Number ONE, as I already said, we will definitely overachieve the target number that was disclosed in 2007 with the introduction of our Strategy Number ONE. Actually, we can say, especially on material cost side, we will be in a better position. We could achieve more within the programs, the new 5 Series and of course, the new 1 and 3 Series that will be launched this year. So it will be definitely overachieved, but we are not disclosing in the number yet.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Brian Johnson, Barclays Capital. Three questions. Two relate to the mid-term goals financial and strategically and the third more around the management system you referred to earlier. The first two are, as we think about the mid-term 8% to 10% targets, the mid-term CapEx target of 7%, dividend payout of 40%, is that all there is in terms of use of cash or could the dividend or share repurchases perhaps in the future use some of that cash?</p>
          <p>Question number two is, we've heard a lot about the product initiatives between now and 2012, how the average age is coming down. You've talked about cost offsets in the mid decade period, higher CO2 costs offset by modularly costs. But how are you thinking about that product age and product cadence around the mid decade and how that might support the 8% to 10% profit growth?</p>
          <p>And third question is, this is probably the first time, at least I've heard of, the new management system from 2009 focused on contribution margin. Could you maybe tell us a bit more about that, what kind of change in thinking, change in decision making, change in managerial performance metrics that that entailed and how that helps you or factors in going forward to balancing engineering and investments versus these profit targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, talking about the dividend payment and what you could expect from us, basically, we are not thinking about buying shares back. It's all about cash, so we would like to let our shareholders participate via dividends, that's our strategy. And I think, as I said, we are expecting to move our ratio up to the 30% to 40% in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p>If I look at the CO2 cost, you have to see the introduction &#x2013; with the introduction of the new 1 and 3 Series, we are already covering the years ahead up to 2018-20 with our volume product, because it will be a staggered introduction with many derivatives and those cars had to fulfill as a target in their program very ambitious CO2 targets. So on this side of our portfolio, we are expecting a high contribution from the introduction of these new models. Will it be enough to achieve the targets that are set for 2020? I don't think so, and Dr. Reithofer already referred to that. I think we have to add more.</p>
          <p>But the base volume, the major volume will be covered with this technology, with our EfficientDynamics technology that will be implemented in the new programs and further developed. But we have to add electrification tools that will be hybrids, plug-in hybrids and battery electric vehicles and you know what? We start battery electric vehicle now with our new sub-brand in 2013. So we will be in a &#x2013; nearly close to this second lifecycle then at the end of the decade. So this is our way forward and that is in our plans. So we will not be surprised now by the investments, because that is what we have in our long range plans and we know what we are talking about.</p>
          <p>And what is the other question? Sorry, your third question was about the internal management system, how this works. Now, it works like this. In the budgeting process, we set targets for sales support for every and each market. That is linked to &#x2013; the profit target is linked to the volume target. And now, we have a process that is running in a way, if they want to sell more, right, and they can do it without increasing their sales allowances, this is something they can decide locally. If they can sell more only with additional sales support, this is a central decision.</p>
          <p>And in many cases, in the central decision, we not allow spending more sales allowances, because we take opportunity in other markets where we have a higher contribution, or maybe we don't have to give additional sales support. So it's a very straightforward process that we applied in the crisis in 2009 and '10, and that really show that is very sufficient.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So ladies and gentlemen, it's 10 minutes to 12. I think we have time for two additional questions and then we could speed a lot of this for lunch. I think next question will come from John Lawson, yes.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, John Lawson from Citi. Coming back to China, are you or your joint venture being asked at the moment still to produce a local brand for the market? And if you are, what is your response to that? And I think one of your peers recently said that profit per unit in China had probably now peaked. Is that also your view? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The right question for &#x2013; who wants to start? I think the Chairman starts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, regarding a local brand, we are at the moment in negotiations. And I would leave it like that at the moment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next one, Jose Asumendi and then Aleksej Wunrau.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Jose Asumendi, RBS. Just going back to raw materials &#x2013; back here &#x2013; coming back to raw materials, I was wondering if you could just share, especially on the steel suppliers, what kind of price increases they are requesting and whether they can pass on these raw material price increases on a quarterly basis?</p>
          <p>And second on pricing, I see or I hear very conservative comments from your side, and could you just put into context how much pricing power did you lose during the crisis and how much have you recovered already until 2010? And then third one, on electric cars in China. I believe you want to introduce an electric car with your partner in China. I was wondering, which platform will you use and second, will it be sold under a BMW brand? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll start with Mr. Eichiner.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in order to manage the material cost, we apply two different strategies. One is hedging which we basically have for precious materials and a few others and the other is long-term contracts. On the steel side, we are using long-term contracts and so actually, we are on the safe side up to the middle of the year and then we have to &#x2013; up to this point in time, we have to &#x2013; fear those contracts will run out. We have to renew those sales contracts and then the pricing we paid basically takes a certain role. So that's why we see some risk on this side as well. But as we said, we try to handle the volatility on the material cost side with those two instruments.</p>
          <p>Now, the question about the pricing and what we lost during the crisis. Well, we lost between 4% to 5%. And as I said already today, we could regain 2% in 2010. That's why I'm saying there's still a way to go. I mean, it's still half of potential is to improve pricing with the introduction of the new volume models.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So last part of the question, the E cars in China, plant platforms, Mr. Reithofer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, our new energy vehicle for China will be a 5 Series plug-in hybrid. And the development phase is already underway. And we will start to produce the car before 2015.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So last question, Aleksej Wunrau?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Aleksej Wunrau, BHF-Bank. Just one question remaining. I wonder if you could elaborate on the extent by which low interest rates helped not only the profitability of the Financial Service business, but also underlying demand in 2010, especially given the fact that your Financial Service assets increased by quite a lot? And based on that, my question of whether demand could adversely affected, if we were to see a reversion of the interest rate trend not only in China, but also in Europe, and possibly in the U.S. this or next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, right. Question for Mr. Eichiner?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, clearly the favorable interest rates in 2010 supported Financial Service's performance. The margin was really high. It was a record margin. We could realize in this year and looking forward now and we all know at a point in time, interest rates will increase. There will come some pressure on the margin side and the question is, how much of this will be compensated by lower provisions on the risk side?</p>
          <p>So we have to look at both sides. It's clear in the cycle with increasing interest rates, there will be some pressure on margin. But we have to look at the same point in time, what's going on, on the risk side and then you get the complete picture. And as I said, my expectation is that we get some relief on the risk side as we see signals that our used car pricing is going up and is quite stable. So that maybe we should be able to maintain our guidance for a 19% return on equity over the next couple of years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would that ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, would that mean that you have to pass on the burden of higher refinancing costs on to your customers and would that mean that they would have to pay higher prices for their cars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, there is always a question of price acceptance in this context and we all know out of history that this is lagging. So it will take some time until consumers will accept that there is now a higher level of interest that has got to be paid. So we are talking about the time lag if this development will really happen, right? So that's why I'm talking about the pressure until we are able to increase interest rates in our contracts for a certain period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your question. Let's have lunch together. Both Mr. Reithofer and Mr. Eichiner will be present for lunch. This will give you all an opportunity to chat with them.</p>
