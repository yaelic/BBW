          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Greg . Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2010 Results Conference Call. Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat, Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements we will welcome your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the opening remarks, I'd like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is available on our Web site or upon request.</p>
          <p>And now I will turn the call over to Simon.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.</p>
          <p>Excluding charges, first quarter income was $0.62 per share. This is down $0.05 sequentially and down $0.16 compared to the same quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we recorded $75 million or $0.06 of charges. $40 million related to the reduction of future tax deductions relating to our retiree medical plan as a result of the passage during the quarter of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the U.S.</p>
          <p>We also recorded $35 million of merger-related transaction costs pertaining to the Smith and Geoservices transactions. We anticipate that we will continue to incur merger and integration-related costs. These amounts will be most significant in the quarter that the Smith transaction closes and the quarters immediately following the merger. We will continue to separately identify these charges for you.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services first quarter revenue decreased 1% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue decreased 14%. The sequential decline in both revenue and earnings per share can be primarily attributed to severe winter weather that hampered activity, particularly in Russia, combined with the absence of the surge in multiclient, SIS software and other product sales that we experienced in the Q4. These declines were partially offset by an improved performance in North America.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $969 million decreased 4% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield Services margins slipped by 46 basis points sequentially to 19% as improvements in North America were offset by a decline in Europe/CIS/Africa. Overall international margins in OFS were 22.3%.</p>
          <p>By area Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margin highlights were as follows: North America improved by 594 basis points to 8%, primarily due to an increase in activity across the area, supplemented by some pricing improvements for well stimulation services. Latin America increased by 174 basis point to 17.5% mostly as a result of the more favorable revenue mix in Mexico/Central America and the effect of the currency devaluation in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 18.1%, 353 basis points lower, principally due to lower activity in Russia and the North Sea and lower testing services, equipment and SIS software sales. Finally, Middle East/Asia margin declined slightly by 136 basis point to 31%, primarily due to less favorable revenue mix in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar and Indonesia GeoMarkets and the absence of the year end artificial lift product and SIS software sales in the Q4.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco, pre-tax income of $67 million reflected a decrease in pre-tax margin of 659 basis points to 14.3%. This decrease was largely attributable to the absence of the strong year-end multiclient sales that we experienced last quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges was 18.9%. This was higher than last quarter, primarily due to less favorable geographic earning mix in Oilfield Services. As you are aware, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earning mix and as such, we do experience some volatility on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Net debt was 75 million at the end of the quarter as compared to 126 million at the end of Q4. We ended the quarter with $4.9 billion of cash and investments on hand, and short term debt of only 934 million. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $337 million of stock repurchases and $444 million of CapEx.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we repurchased 5.3 million shares at an average price of $63.72. Subsequent to the announcement of the merger with Smith in February, we repurchased the maximum number of shares we could under the SEC's Safe Harbor provisions.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we are projecting a significant increase in our net debt as a result of the closing of the Geoservices transaction combined with the ramp up in CapEx. These increases will be offset in part by the expected conversion to equity of our $299 million of convertible debentures during Q2. Oilfield Services CapEx is now expected to reach approximately $2.8 billion in 2010, while WesternGeco CapEx is still expected to approach $300 million.</p>
          <p>And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Simon and good morning everybody.</p>
          <p>Schlumberger's first quarter revenues of $5.1 billion registered a marginal sequential decline as the strong performance in North America and continued strength in the Middle East and Asia offset an overall decline in product and software sales from the high levels of the fourth quarter and a sharp drop in the North Sea and Russia resulting from lower drilling efficiency and adverse weather conditions. WesternGeco registered an expected sequential decline in multiclient revenue while marine activity improved slightly with higher vessel utilizations.</p>
          <p>Looking at the areas in more detail, in North America all GeoMarkets saw revenue growth sequentially. U.S. Land grew on increased drilling activity coupled with some pricing improvements that benefited well services technologies. Canada experienced significant growth as a result of the strong winter drilling season, particularly for the oil basins in the West. This led to higher demand for well services, wireline and drilling and measurement services. U.S. Gulf of Mexico revenue was higher sequentially on increased shelf and deepwater activity that resulted in strong demand for drilling and measurement, testing services and wireline technologies. Alaska revenue grew from seasonally high exploration activity.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, Mexico/Central America, GeoMarket revenue decreased sequentially, primarily due to weather-related slowdowns that affected offshore activity and to delays in the finalization of contracts for SIS and data consulting services activities. In Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago, revenue fell from the impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and from the absence of deferred revenue recognized in the prior quarter. But these effects were partially offset by increased demand for SIS software. Revenue in the Brazil and the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarkets decreased sequential, mostly due to lower completions and SIS sales, partially offset by an increase in IPM activity. On Argentina/Bolivia/Chile GeoMarket, revenue decreased primary due to lower ISIS software sales.</p>
          <p>Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area fell sequentially as a result of a combination of lower sales of testing services equipment and SIS software with the effect of lower pricing and the weakening of local currencies against the U.S. dollar. Among the GeoMarkets, revenue in the North Sea decreased, resulting from a combination of lower drilling activity that impacted drilling and measurement, delays in project start-ups that affected testing services and lower well services stimulation activities. Russia revenue was lower mainly due to the severe winter weather, while Libya and the &#x2013; revenue in the Libya GeoMarket fell on early completion of offshore exploration campaigns.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East &amp; Asia, revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter as growth in the Australia/Papua New Guinea and East Mediterranean GeoMarkets was offset by lower sales of artificial lift products and SIS software, following the surge in the fourth quarter, and by lower activity in the Arabian, Gulf, Qatar and Indonesia GeoMarkets.</p>
          <p>We gained a number of significant contract wins during the quarter. In Iraq, BP awarded us, together with our joint venture drilling partner, the Iraq Drilling Company, a number of wells on an integrated services basis. In Angola we were awarded a series of 6-year contracts for wireline logging, tubing-conveyed perforating, well testing, well completions, coiled-tubing services and well stimulation vessels. And in marine seismic, WesternGeco was awarded a number of acquisition surveys on the Norwegian Continental Shelf as well as a contract in Brazil for the region's first multi-azimuth survey.</p>
          <p>We also announced 2 significant events during the quarter. The proposed merger with Smith International and the planned acquisition of Geoservices, which closed in about an hour after the time our press release went over the wire this morning. In the proposed merger with Smith, our complementary products and services will lead to the development of an engineered drilling system that optimize all the components of the drill string to allow customers to drill more economically in demanding conditions. What we consider to be a step change in drilling performance and well productivity will come from combining measurement and steering capabilities with the engineering and design of complete bottom-hole assemblies and their various components, including the drilling fluid and the drill bit.</p>
          <p>The addition of Geoservices mud logging technology to the Schlumberger portfolio will also be an important step in the development of higher performance drilling systems. The combination of Schlumberger's real-time downhole measurements with Geoservices drilling mud analysis will help customers better identify and react to drilling hazards, while the combination of the mud logging with Schlumberger formation evaluation measurement will bring a more complete understanding of rock lithology and fluid content. In addition to Geoservices mud-logging technology and expertise, Geoservices footprint, expertise and technology in slickline well intervention and field production surveillance will complement existing Schlumberger activities. I look forward to welcoming both the employees of Smith and Geoservices to Schlumberger.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for the remainder of 2010 confirms the optimism we expressed at the beginning of the year. At WesternGeco, while the second quarter will see increased vessel transits, strong tendering activity in marine is leading to much improved visibility on the remainder of 2010 and utilization will be higher than originally planned. However, new capacity entering the market is likely to limit pricing gain until later in the year.</p>
          <p>In North America, commitment drilling to hold leases as well as interest in domestic oil plays should sustain current activity levels in the United States through the second quarter, while Canada will experience the normal spring breakup. Beyond that the picture is less clear as natural gas prices and the fundamentals of natural gas remain uncertain. Higher oil prices are leading to tangible evidence that operators are contemplating higher levels of activity than originally planned in international markets.</p>
          <p>We reiterate our comments from the last quarter, that we see improvements in some offshore markets, notably the U.K. sector of the North Sea, Latin America and West Africa as well as on land in Russia. In order to prepare for this increase in the latter half of 2010 and in 2011, we have increased our CapEx guidance by $400 million, the bulk of which will be aimed at drilling and measurement and high-end wireline technology.</p>
          <p>Finally, I am on record as saying that I felt international margins would bottom at the end of Q2 2010. I am pleased to report I was mistaken. International margins appear to have bottomed and are likely to resume positive trend from now, absent any exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. And I will now hand the call back to Greg.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question will come from the line of Mr. Dan Pickering of Tudor Pickering and Holt. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, you &#x2013; earlier in the year you did express optimism, but then you sort of dialed the numbers back a little bit for 2010 indicating that maybe the Street had got a little bit too optimistic. Do we interpret sort of your uptick in outlook to mean that 2010 numbers may now have some upside room?  And can you talk a little bit about exactly what you're seeing that gives you sort of the increased confidence over the past month or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Firstly, I feel pretty comfortable with the sort of overall consensus where it is now, Dan. And secondly, we are seeing clear signs of increases in activity in the North Sea. I mean, you can count them. And similarly, we're seeing the results of some of the exploration campaigns in Latin America, which are leading to very high quality revenue for us, particularly in the wireline and testing.</p>
          <p>And similarly I've always thought that some of the idle rig slots in West Africa would get picked up if the oil price was higher than people were planning and that's exactly what seems to be happening. So it's just &#x2013; it's confirmation that's come through in the last 3 months of what I was alluding to in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're seeing some concrete examples it sounds like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know that you're transitioning your role a little bit at Schlumberger. And the company's done, I guess about 10 billion in acquisitions here in the first quarter; one closed, one yet to close. Do you think the acquisition side slows down a little bit, Andrew?  Or does the focus change in terms of the things you look at? Can you maybe walk us through what you're going be working on the next year or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, we, apart from niche technologies or opportunities we can't say no to, yes, we have shut down or, if you like, severely restrained the acquisition pipeline. And Paal Kibsgaard will be running the day-to-day operation as COO and I will be taking care of the integration of Geoservices and Smith, as well as obviously helping Paal when he needs help. So that's basically how we're splitting the roles for the next couple of years, Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question will come from the line of Mike Urban of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Wanted to talk about Russia a little bit. Obviously some weather issues there. But it seems to me there's been a bit of a disconnect in the markets. A lot of this stuff, especially in the mature basins, spending down a lot there, hasn't recovered much, but yet we're still seeing a lot of the forecast out there for production growth. I was wondering if you could reconcile those two things?  And what you see in terms of activity levels?  Is there a need to ramp up there significantly going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that last year the &#x2013; they were able to sustain and increase their production largely, because they got a lot of help from Vankor and one other field I can't remember the name of. But this year, if they want to maintain their production at current levels, they're going to have to go back to working in Western Siberia and tendering activity would indicate to us that they do have the intention to do that and as well as for us, we will have an even stronger year in Sakhalin than we did last year.  But the big shift from last year is that we think there will be a lot more drilling in Western Siberia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In order to sustain their production, Michael.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then shifting to Iraq. As you noted, some nice contract awards there. And there's again, some conflicting trends there. There's a need to ramp up quickly in a number of cases but also still some uncertainty there surrounding the status of the government. And so just what is your thoughts on what the trajectory looks like there? Do you expect additional awards or are we just going to be executing on what's already out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean for the oil companies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the oil companies and then what that means from a service standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that it's highly unlikely that there's any more licensing rounds. Or contract rounds for the oil companies. I think that the future is more likely now to be with the Iraqi national oil companies. I don't think that the oil companies will hesitate to spend on the first phase of the activity in Iraq, just because at this point in time there is no stable government.</p>
          <p>I do think that two or three years down the road, if they don't have a satisfactory judicial, fiscal and political atmosphere, they will hesitate before they go into the very large spending that will be required for the new developments, because actually they're spending for rehabilitation of existing fields. In terms of the budgets of the size of companies we're looking at, it is not huge.  So I think that activity will, as sort of &#x2013; as it's been advertised, it will go ahead, Mike.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So any delta from here would be from the NOC there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Kurt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, I want to just come back to the macro theme again here and flesh it out maybe a little bit more. Obviously you're referencing in reference to Dan's question, some tangible evidence that you're now seeing that gives you the confidence now. Increased your CapEx, which I think pretty much underscores your conviction that the market cycle is starting to turn and probably turn in Schlumberger's favor.</p>
          <p>I was wondering if you might give us some insight as to how you see the cycle evolving and how it will in your view accelerate in the international markets?  And if you can give us maybe benchmarks and comparisons to prior cycle periods. Is it going be a faster acceleration? In line, maybe a little bit slower? If you could give us any color, that would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there is a bit of a difference between this cycle and sort of the 2004, 2008 cycle.  In that 2004, 2008 we had a huge amount of natural gas projects going on overseas that were not going to be going on this time around. So we had the whole Qatar LNG ramp-up, we had Yemen; we had other stuff in Africa. While there will be some of that this time around, I don't think it's going be anything like the volume of what we had between 2004 and 2008. So this cycle is going be far more, in my opinion, related to oil outside the United States, even inside the United States.</p>
          <p>And there I think that if you look at the latest demand figures from the non-OECD world, you look at the flattening of the demand drop in the OECD world and you look at the potential call on OPEC, I don't see any reasons for the price of oil to decline very far from where it is today, in which case gradually, confidence is going grow to bring in a lot more of these &#x2013; particularly offshore projects that we all know that our customers have lined up. And on land, it's going to increase all the activity in production enhancement.</p>
          <p>So I think absent a double dip in the developing world or a huge double dip in the OECD, that the oil cycle is probably going to &#x2013; I hate to say this again, but going to be stronger for longer. But the gas cycle is going be very much affected by the amount of LNG that's just been put on stream and, of course, by the advent of shale gas or unconventional gas in the United States.</p>
          <p>Now in terms of our CapEx, what is very satisfactory is these deepwater rings are starting up on time. We had more &#x2013; the startups we anticipated in Q1 have gone on time and pretty flawlessly, which means that we're getting more deepwater activity earlier than we thought. And if that carries through, that means we have to accelerate the CapEx curve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Now, in connection with that now, the cycle may be evolving in Schlumberger's position. There seems to be a line of thought in the marketplace that Schlumberger's losing share in some certain geographic markets. And some product lines and I understand this Angola project that you referenced in your press release today, I think there's some element of significance that may be worth mentioning.</p>
          <p>So I was wondering if you can just talk about your view of Schlumberger's market share position, both from a geographic market and from a technology standpoint. And would you generally agree with the view out there that Schlumberger is at risk from the competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me deal with Angola first. The whole Angola thing that's been announced by us and others is a renewal. It is not new work. It is a major, major renewal. And in that renewal, we have renewed segments we already had working there and we have added segments that were not working there before.</p>
          <p>In terms of &#x2013; I don't &#x2013; it's difficult to believe your own people on market share data, but we constantly look for where we've lost market share and we've constantly fail to find it. I can only think of one major piece of market share we've lost in the last 2 years. And then I go to the Spears data, the Spears data if you look at it Q4 '09 over Q4 '08 says we've increased our market share more than our principal competitors. So I'm sorry, I don't see it.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome back into the camp of more bullish people again, Andrew.  It's good to have you back.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's nice to be back but, you know, prudence has always been my watch word in these things, Ole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know, absolutely. I hope you of course stick with that. On the jackup side we're seeing big tender activity in North Sea and West Africa, Middle East, on a broad basis, of course, that's the world you're talking to but we're not really seeing much in the deepwater market in terms of a pickup of increased tender and contracts. Can you give us a little bit view on how you see sort of the exploration side turn into more of a development drilling kind of kickoff? Both in West Africa and in selected deepwater markets in Asia? Can you give us a little color on what you're seeing there compared to...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think &#x2013; so firstly, the deepwater programs that have been announced and the rigs have been contracted for are happening. As I mentioned earlier, they seem to be happening on time which is unusual. Secondly, I think that the operators generally will make sure that deepwater rig rates come down a bit. And once they've done that, they will do some exploration.</p>
          <p>They hate paying top dollar for exploration rigs. So in fact I think an adjustment down similar to what we've seen recently in the big deepwater rigs or even the second or third generation rigs that can do an exploration well in deepwater is very positive for us.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On exploration again, on the seismic market you mentioned that you saw a firmer tone into the back end of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit? Is this you realizing higher prices, is it leading edge, are you expecting to bid at higher &#x2013; firmer prices today...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the answer is that we &#x2013; our utilization for 2010 is pretty much wrapped up and therefore we're expecting to bid higher. Whether we'll be successful or not is another question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just one more question. On the pricing on renewals, if you could reprice national work, for example you highlighted this Angolan contract rolling over and renewing, could you give us a little bit of a feel for how rollover pricing has changed compared to let's say three months ago? I mean is it back in the positive territory again or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no I don't think so.  I don't think there have been any change in large tenders &#x2013; in the large tenders in international pricing in the last 3 months, but you probably, I'm not exactly sure when this was bid but with the evaluation process and the award process, it was probably bid early last year, Ole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay. Would you expect at this point to be bidding higher prices than prices rolling off? Or are you still in negative territory if you're looking forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we look forward from here, I think for specific high end technology, we will be looking to push price.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, along those lines here, I was curious as to whether you could provide us with a roadmap, if you will, for international margins. You said that they've troughed in Q1. But really what I'm looking for is how you see them evolving second half of 2010 and next year and really talking about the interplay between volume, mix and price. And what I'm trying to reference here is back in '06 and '07, we were generating 40% incremental margins, and how long do you think before we get back to that? And what will it take to get back to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well firstly I think, for the balance of this year, there are two elements of price that will dominate and they are firstly volume and mix.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In other words, volume is better utilization of equipment. And mix is a shift toward &#x2013; you know the big shift towards deepwater and offshore that's taking place at the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that the other thing that will happen in this year, but this depends very much on us, is at $80 oil, the &#x2013; our customers will loosen the purse strings on using the high-end technology that in the downturn the engineers were told they were not allowed to buy or they should go easy on because it was expensive, kind of work. So we &#x2013; if you like, it's the difference between a cheap bottle of wine and feeling you can afford a good bottle of wine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I like it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we think we'll see a little bit of that. Not a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But I do not think we will get real pricing traction until we start to have volume issues, in other words, that people start to move into equipment shortages. I don't think there's any way that, that could happen next year &#x2013; this year; sorry. I think next year, in certain segments, particularly drilling and measurement, if the level of drilling stays where it is, you will start to see operators wanting to tie up equipment and therefore that gives you some demand pull pricing power. But I don't think it's this year. I think it's next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it's unreasonable to expect us getting back to those really flush incremental margins some time next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have to be demand led, Bill. So it really, really does depend upon the level of activity, and I can't see that yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because you know we really, really get pricing power when our customers are desperate to have the equipment. So in fact in the 2005 cycle, one of the things that provoked that was the huge sucking of equipment into Saudi Arabia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, that frightened operators elsewhere. So if Iraq went very, very fast, which personally I don't believe, that also could suck in fairly large amounts of equipment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see it yet for 2010, yet you're not necessarily ruling it out for next year?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'll just &#x2013; question on WesternGeco. I don't think a choppy recovery will surprise anyone. Taking into account your remarks on pricing, I was wondering if you could just kind of compare for me how this business is positioned now to where it was in '02, '03? It seems to me that with multiclient de-emphasized there should be a much quicker uptick in margins. And that with your limited capital requirements going forward that maybe you should be hitting mid-cycle returns at a much earlier stage than the past cycle. Am I right on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only reason I'm &#x2013; so firstly, I think on multiclient you're right. In other words the &#x2013; our library is extremely healthy. And that, to the extent that activity remains robust, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa, then library sales will probably go faster than they did in the last cycle, and a lot of that will be to do with technology. Because we have made major strides, the industry and us, have made major strides in the quality of multiclient over the last 4 or 5 years.</p>
          <p>Then &#x2013; but in marine, there is going be &#x2013; there is something like 14 or 15 3-D boats that are either new or can come back into the market fairly shortly. So that, that's what's going to, if you like, slow pricing uptake in marine seismic, whereas last time around we &#x2013; the boats were not in a build cycle and therefore the excess capacity got sucked up faster. You're quite right to point out that the Eastern Echo deal means that we will not be in the market for building or huge CapEx commitments for our marine fleet in the next few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just a different subject. On your last call it sounded like you were focusing a little bit more on the emerging shales in North America. But more recently, E&amp;P's been taking up a lot of headlines, a lot of talk about a shift into unconventional oil. Just wondering if this kind of changes your thinking at all in this market? Should we be looking for Schlumberger to perhaps be more aggressive going after this business? And kind of what's your sense of service intensity of the oil versus the gas plays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean I think my competitors have commented that they're very similar. And I think they're right. I do think, and I'm not going &#x2013; please don't ask me what, because I'm not going to say, we do have certain technologies that in these unconsolidated oil plays are quite advantageous. And obviously we will be introducing those, probably later this year. It's adaptation of other technology that we have. But it's &#x2013; and it's not hydraulic fracturing. But we think that we probably have some tools that can make a difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Interesting. Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>To take another cut at the international margins, you peaked in 2007, 2008, about 28 to 30% margins. Today at 22%. Do you think that we will return to those peak margins, or even potentially go beyond? And is that a 2013 event or could it actually be earlier? And finally, do you think that the increase in IPM risks those margins in returning to those levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So firstly, I think that the comment I would make, which is, if you like, an indication of the relative mildness of the cycle overseas is that for our margins to only go from 28 to 22 instead of &#x2013; you remember what they dropped to, Simon, in 1998, 2001 internationally?</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the teens. Probably in the mid-teens, is a pretty remarkable situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But how fast it can go back, Angie, really, really does depend on how fast activity accelerates. And that's a judgment &#x2013; still a judgment, I'm afraid, on the general economy. There's no doubt that oil drilling is going be very solid. But how fast it's going to go is going to depend very much on the general economy. So can we get back there one day? Yes, I'm absolutely convinced we can. But please don't ask me to say it's 2013 or 2014. I don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks. I guess to follow along that, as far as talking specifically about Iraq, do you think that it &#x2013; how much time do you think will pass before you get to margins that you're happy with there? And do you need scale as far as the number of rigs operating in the region to reach those margins? And are you &#x2013; do you have any concerns so far on how your competition is bidding in the region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't think the first phase in Iraq, in other words the rehabilitation of the existing fields, and the &#x2013; just the drilling of wells in known locations is necessarily going to produce for anybody the sort of margins that they like. And also, we're all going to have set up costs. We're all going to have &#x2013; it will be pass-thorough but you'll &#x2013; nonetheless will affect the margins you see. Security costs for example.</p>
          <p>Have I seen any irrational bidding behavior? So far, no, I haven't actually. Not that the &#x2013; we haven't seen &#x2013; we don't really know, obviously, know what other people bid but given the pricing we've been using, I don't think we've seen totally irrational behavior so far.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think it's scale or time that pushes you to margins...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scale in Iraq is a difficult thing. I think it's going to go project by project. For example, you do not want to build out infrastructure in advance of work because every time you build a new piece of infrastructure it adds to your security risk and your security cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Every time you have a new base, you have to have more security and it costs you more. So I think people will build out, certainly we will build out project by project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Fair enough. And then finally, going along with the scale side, do you want to give us your thoughts on Mexico, on the labs, the incentive contracts and do you think that over time we could go back to the recent highs as far as activity levels that we saw in 2009? Or will that take some time or just lack of clarity so far?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean everyone &#x2013; our lab is started, like everybody else's. We in fact have had a group in Mexico City studying this problem for the last 2 years. So we're not &#x2013; we have some ideas. And actually I think that it will be quite a long time, at least a couple of years, before PEMEX is in a position to judge whether or not the production potential justifies the scale of drilling program that they previously had. So I think it will be a couple of years before we know that. And in the meantime, yes, they will drill, but I don't think they'll drill on anything like the scale they were drilling before.</p>

          <p>Well, yes. Yes, I think. At this level of rigs, when we've completed the various initiatives we have underway to improve our utilization and improve our decision-making, I think that we can reach a level of profitability that we're satisfied with, yes. But we're only a little way into that process so far. Therefore, the improvement we got in Q1 was a good job on the part of our &#x2013; the people who were involved.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No. I think I'm going to say, I mean I think I'm going to say it applies globally, because you can always have a mix effect that will uptick or downtick a particular region in a particular quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Andrew, just to finish that question, you know, we can look back and see over the last years that Schlumberger's margins in North America have been almost exactly comparable to its peers and for the fourth quarter and first quarter clearly was below. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...it sounds like you believe that with the initiatives you're taking, you will be back very much in line with the other multi-service companies in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would be very disappointed if our people in North America didn't have at least that ambition, Robin. The only thing I would say is that with one of our competitors we have a comparable mix. With the other one we don't yet, but they will shortly. So the mix effect can affect &#x2013; the mix effect can affect what the overall margin is for each company. And when we finish &#x2013; close the Smith transaction and when Baker closes the BJ transaction, we have to re-look at the whole margin landscape.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I see. Okay. Then just on the deepwater market where you had I guess a favorable comment about the timing of the deepwater rig start-ups, so if we think about all of the rigs that are under construction today and the timing that we can see that they're scheduled for delivery, it certainly looks like 2012 would be the first really full year. And what is the order of magnitude of that increase in deepwater drilling 2010 versus '11? I mean, the bulk of the rigs really seem to be mostly coming in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So I mean, it means that &#x2013; I don't have the numbers in front of me, Robin. But certainly '10 is much bigger than '09. And then again '11 is much bigger than '10. And actually '12 I haven't even looked at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When a rig comes into the market, if you take the number of rigs that people announce are coming into the market in any one year, you basically have to divide it in two because they only &#x2013; they average &#x2013; they arrive halfway through the year. So this year we get the full effect of the rigs that came into the market in '09 and half the effect of '10 and next year we get the cumulative of '09 and '10 and half of '11. So you're probably quite right that '12 will be the high point of deepwater activity.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, just curious as it relates again to Latin America and the margin performance being surprisingly good, unlike your peers you didn't identify specifically the Venezuela devaluation as a nonrecurring item. I'm just curious as to what kind of impact that had negatively to the quarter and what kind of add back can we have expected in the results in Latin America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, I'm going to let Simon discuss the Venezuela valuation and then if you want more granularity on the rest of it, I'll talk about it afterwards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take this in two parts, first why we didn't see any impact from the devaluation. We obviously have an impact on the devaluation. The reason it was not apparent because in Venezuela we do take a very prudent approach to &#x2013; within the rules &#x2013; to our accounting. We anticipated this kind of devaluation. And we have deferred certain gains from exchange that we experienced during '09 to be ready for this eventuality. And it did take place and we covered it from within the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Now as far as the impact on the business, obviously the revenue drops because we have a <mark type="inaudible" /> portion of our revenue. But on the cost side, it has a positive impact because the cost reduced given the new rates and as a result was slightly a positive impact on the margin overall in Venezuela. So this is basically the story.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say the other element that helped us is that a lot of the adjustment of our cost base in Mexico took place in '09 as well, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. That's been a big difference for you, Andrew, right, is that you don't feel like you're carrying additional costs that some may be doing as they await what happens in Mexico in terms of spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well we don't own rigs, very many of them, anyway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fair enough. My follow-up would be &#x2013; I guess, Simon, a question for you. You mentioned the limits on the first quarter share repurchases here under Safe Harbor. I'm just wondering if there's any limits that we should think about on share repurchases either in the second quarter or until the Smith acquisition is closed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon's going to answer this, Bill.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean there are certain rules that we have to follow. We are &#x2013; we continue to buy now under the Safe Harbor rule. And as soon as the proxy is mailed to the shareholders of Smith, there is a blackout period that we have to respect until the shareholders vote on the transaction. Then we'll be free to buy without limits except the normal limit for buy-backs. So there is a period of time where we hope it will not be too long between the mailing of the proxy to the shareholders and the voting on the transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And we should probably still expect, Simon, that you're buying back enough stock to offset any dilution as a whole for the company; is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. Andrew, I wanted to follow-up on North America and sort of the reshuffling process that you have going on there. You've actually grown in line with peers sequentially, but your incremental margins are in line with peers as well, but I'm assuming you're carrying some extra costs associated with this. I know you don't like to break that out, but are we talking incremental or additional costs in the 20 to $30 million range that at some point through the year will fade?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I don't think you should think of it as incremental cost. I think there is still cost we have in North America that we need to eliminate. So it's idle facilities, things like that. And that will take place over the balance of the year. So there is incremental cost associated with the re-organization or the restructuring, whatever you want to call it, but it really is fairly marginal. It's a group of people.</p>

          <p>I wouldn't take it as something that's just going to disappear. But that group of people is working at getting the whole cost base down.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So we should measure the success of this reshuffling as higher incremental margins to allow you to catch up to peers...</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Brad Handler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I guess a couple of unrelated questions. First just a follow-up on the North American market. In the assessment you've made to date, are there changes to your capital commitment that you expect in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the effects of what we're doing should be much higher equipment utilization. And therefore the revenue dollar per hydraulic horsepower, whatever you want to use as a measure, should increase. And therefore the &#x2013; ultimately the amount of CapEx that we'll need to cover what we do, compared to what Schlumberger did in the past, will probably go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the additional 400 million, it does not sound like is being directed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh no, the &#x2013; I was very clear. The additional 400 million is drilling and measurement and high-end wireline. It's not pressure pumping.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep. No, that was clear. Okay. That's helpful. And then the unrelated follow-up. Can you tell us how much of your percentage of revenues is coming from deepwater today? And maybe how you expect that to evolve over the next couple of years then, given all that we've talked about with deepwater?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't disclosed that. I don't think we want to at this point in time. But it's a substantial &#x2013; it's a substantial portion and it obviously has a very high growth factor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Sure, that's why I figured I'd probe. How about if I ask it a little more generally just in terms of offshore as a percentage, offshore revenues as a percentage of total?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not 50%. But it's &#x2013; I would say it's somewhere between 30 and 40.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, very good. Thanks, guys, I appreciate it.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to get a sense from you about the outlook for Venezuela and what does the payment schedule look like now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I would describe the payment schedule as thoroughly under control. And a very good understanding between ourselves and PDVSA as to what is necessary. And the activity, actually I think will pick up slightly this year, particularly for us given the amount of success they've had with gas. So I think Venezuela will finally have a slightly better year this year than it did last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, do you see any recurring expenses from this healthcare bill?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From the healthcare bill, Simon?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, this is, basically there was a write-off of some deferred tax assets so we're not going to see this as ongoing. No. It's a one-time only.</p>

          <p>And your final question today comes from the line of Kevin Simpson from Miller Tabak. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for getting me in. I just wanted to get a clarification, Andrew, on your &#x2013; those deepwater comments you made earlier, I guess in response to Robin's question. You said peak in 2012. I'm assuming you meant based off of the equipment we know has already been ordered and is being built now rather than an actual peak in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peak on what we know is going to come to the market, Kevin, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not anything that gets launched now or &#x2013; and it assumes that all, most &#x2013; there's a very high re-utilization rate for deepwater as well &#x2013; for deepwater rigs as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess just one other unrelated follow-up as well would be in Russia, you're talking about a little bit more of a swing to Western from Eastern Siberia. Would that imply that margins will, while they recover nicely, may not be as high on the individual work since it's less, whether it be smaller fields and so a little more competitive and higher versus...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that while you're quite correct to point out that Western Siberia margins are not as high as Eastern Siberia or Sakhalin, the sheer volume will compensate for that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You don't think there's &#x2013; some of these expansions of your competitors trying to be like you guys, will limit upside pricing power or limit pricing power?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

          <p>Okay, short answer. Thank you. That's it.</p>
