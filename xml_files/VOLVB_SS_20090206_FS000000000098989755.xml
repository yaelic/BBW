          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Volvo's Conference Call and the Report on the Full Year 2008. It will start with a presentation, and thereafter, there will be a question and answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. The conference will be chaired by Mr. Leif Johansson, CEO of Volvo. Mr. Johansson, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Most welcome to this analyst conference call. We, over the fourth quarter of 2008, we have as we always do around the table, our business area leaders and our CFO. And also people from Communication and Investor Relations. And as we walk through the presentation, we will guide you with slides that are available at our home page. What we will do then is to go through the different business areas, talk a little about the financial specifics, and then open up for Q&amp;A towards the end.</p>
          <p>If you look at slight two in the handout, you have Group highlights; we had obviously a very interesting 2008. A brilliant start of the year with very good numbers and actually we had our best quarter ever in second quarter of 2008, and we actually now came in with our fourth quarter, one of our worst quarters. I don't know if that is the worst ever, but it's a certainly a very bad quarter. That shows you how quickly the world market around us has come down.</p>
          <p>Sales, as we had recorded, was down 9% in Swedish krones and that actually translates into 15%, adjusted for currencies, the real volume down by 15%. We had a great desire to free up working capital and reduce inventories. We did that like you say very successfully in the quarter, but of course that translated them into an operating loss of almost 1 billion Swedish krones. We have made very rapid adjustments of production capacity as we will walk you through this presentation and we feel that that is the appropriate thing to do given what we can see in terms of order intake, et cetera.</p>
          <p>For the full year then almost looks like a long time ago, net sales came in at 304 billion, actually a record numbers and above last year's of 285. We had an operating income of almost 16 billion against last year's 2007, 22. Return on equity at 12% mark compared to 18 in 2007 and earnings per share close to 5 krones. The Board proposal is that we dividend out 2 krones per share. We feel that that is a reasonably good balance between the year that has gone where we made almost 5 krones in earnings per share and the requirements of the Group as we move forward into a more difficult 2009. And the balance there of course is striking a balance between what we feel we can do in funding and what capital requirements we may have.</p>
          <p>Two krones then suggested by the Board to the general assembly, and in the final end it's the general assembly that decides in the beginning of April where that should be. So far they've never changed the Board recommendation.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide three, we have this in a little more detail; you see the minus 15% there adjusted for currency. You see a very, and I should say surprisingly, big drop in Europe at minus 27%. Those are the type of numbers, but you'll hear us say that many times that we have never seen before if you go back into the history of the Volvo Group, with the whole of the European markets coming down by as much as 27%. And as you will see later on in the presentation in the &#x2013; all our business areas in the main, we're actually taking market share. So it's really a downturn in the world markets around us.</p>
          <p>North America, and I should say still surprisingly low there as we see the effects of the financial crisis in North America. Our basic feeling was that North America had we not had a financial crisis would have started to come back up. That certainly didn't happen in the fourth quarter. And then as we move through the quarter and you actually don't see negative numbers in Asia and South America. If you took the last part of the quarter, you would actually have seen negative numbers in Asia and South America, as the quarter went on, that too started falling.</p>
          <p>And of course what we're doing here is that we're operating with a global financial crisis; that's really what you see reflected in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating income then obviously was much lower than last year; you see that on the slide to the left or on the figure to the left. Lower volumes and of course most dramatically so, we had an under absorption of 2 billion, and we had direct lay-off costs in the quarter of 750 million, as we started adjusting to much lower levels of demand.</p>
          <p>We also saw in the quarter, quarter-on-quarter comparison 2007-2008, an increase of raw materials of almost 1 billion, and obviously, some of that has been offset by pricing, and we also know that raw materials have come down in the latter part of 2008. And gradually in 2009 that's going to reduce that high cost level for raw materials as the whole of the commodity markets have started to come down.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses were up by 800 million, that's a consequence of the very large emission programs that we are running in the U.S. and in Japan for 2010 and then later on also &#x2013; and Tier 4A and then later also Tier 4B and Euro 6.</p>
          <p>We had a dramatic drop in Volvo CE and Olof Persson will speak a little more to that. The drop in Volvo CE was actually 39% in the global markets, an unheard of reaction and response to the financial crisis. And obviously U.S. truck operations, they are unlike what we had hoped the market coming back, actually had a further decline in North American market as it responded to the financial banking crisis.</p>
          <p>If you go to slide four, you actually see progression then over the different quarters, and you see the very strong part of the 2008, quarter one and quarter two with very strong growth and then actually flat in quarter three and then real numbers down 15% in Q4 '08, very big changes in a very short time.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide five, the one that says workforce related cost; you actually see the effect of all of the notices that we have given to a lot of people, unfortunately, around the world. You see the spread on the nationality side there. And you also see how we think that cost is going roll out and you see we actually have quite a lot cost left in Q1 and Q2 '09. And given present levels of sales, we would have to come down to at least the levels that you see in Q3 and Q4 before we can say that we have really gotten cost down to levels of present sales.</p>
          <p>We also, of course, are in many ways depending on the different national legislation. In Sweden for example, we have to give notice, we have a long delivery time on those notices; six months in this case and that's what you see in this slide. Even though we have given notice to lot of people, it takes six months to actually deliver that cost reduction.</p>
          <p>In other countries, like in France or Belgium, there is a possibility to run short term, short hour, weeks or days and have the costs go down by 80% from our point of view, so different systems in different countries, and we've tried to describe that in that curve for you there.</p>
          <p>If you look at slide six, it is important to recognize that you could look at the Volvo Group and across the different business areas now there as two parts. We have what we call hard products or new products here. First event of the sale of a equipment or a truck or a machine or any kind, that is a labor-intense business. We are clearly in the mood of downsizing. We feel that we have very competitive products. We have the products that our customers would want to have. They simply just in the quarter could not buy them for financial reasons. Some of that all still in Q1 in 2009, and gradually we have had more customers coming to tell us that they are now affected by the downturn. And I should say not only in sense of not being able to buy our products but also in the sense that their markets &#x2013; for example, contractors, their markets respectively are going down as a consequence of the downturn. Of course that's how the real economy gets damaged by the banking crisis.</p>
          <p>The other side of the Group, which is what we call soft products or aftermarket services, represents 26% of the Group's turnover. It is population driven. That's the part of the Group where we deliver aftermarket parts and services, and I should say a lot of different services to our customers. 10 million service hours there in 2008, to say it's a quite respectable number and you see the population there with millions of trucks out.</p>
          <p>High margin and of course utilization drives revenues here. And we are not completely isolated from a downturn there either. If we take, for example, the event of excavators standing still on construction sites where financing has stopped the construction in itself, that certainly means that we're not delivering any aftermarket services to those excavators. But often what happens sooner or later, those excavators start working again and then we have a good business with the population there.</p>
          <p>With that, let me switch to slide seven in the handout, and we will have Mikael Bratt, our CFO here go through the next couple of slides and deal with the balance sheet and the way we are progressing on working capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. We are happy to announce here that we had a positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of 1.8 billion to a large extent resulting then from our achievements when it comes to reducing inventory. Good work done there by all the business areas in the Group I would say. We are a very focused Group on cash efficiency in general and I would say especially in times like these. And we have done good work here in the past and we will do it going forward as well. So driving cash flow from the balance sheet &#x2013; out of the balance sheet here is definitely top priority for us. And you can see the dramatic change here where we actually have reduced half of what was built up during the first three quarters during 2008 was really seen in Q4.</p>
          <p>Moving on them to the financial debt page eight, we have on the left-hand side here a pie chart over the currency distribution of our debt structure. And as you can see, we have a large portion denominated in Japanese yen, as well as the U.S. dollar and that has of course affected the gross debt there significantly as the currency rates have been moving and you see it only in the Quarter Four alone. The Japanese yen against the Swedish krone have moved with 32, almost 33% and the dollar with 14, and that of course affect the net debt figure. And let me here just point out that that debt is for the purpose of the businesses that we are running in yen and dollar.</p>
          <p>So that's clear and also that we have here a situation where we have lower equity than the average in the Group in U.S. and Japan and therefore you'll get this affect whilst those assets have also increased in value. And with that into account, we have then, a net debt-to-equity of 39.7 including the currency and if you take that effect away we are at 31. Worth notice is also that we have pension liabilities including in our net debt definition here. And as you all know, it's a very long-term debt, so if you adjust for that the ratio is 27:7 adjusted for pension liabilities. And we feel therefore that we have a very strong balance sheet going forward here.</p>
          <p>Switching over to page nine, and the refinancing needs and the funding needs both in &#x2013; first in industrial portfolio, you see here that we have about 15 billion maturing during 2009 and about 9 to 10 billion here in the first quarter, here. And on the left-hand side you see the reserves under committed facilities that we have available for the Group and we are talking about 24 billion on the cash side and 27% on the committed facilities side.</p>
          <p>So let me here point out that we have no negative clauses or rating triggers in the committed facilities, which we for that matter don't have in any loan documentation in the Group. To match these refinancing needs we are having a long list of funding activities where we are progressing to securities funding and we are in a good way. We have for example, what you see here on the right hand side, European Investment Bank with about 400 million euros coming in seven year money. We're also looking to opportunities in Japan and we are having discussions with Development Bank of Japan and also domestic banks there and really leveraging, you could say, on the Group's global presence.</p>
          <p>Bond issuance from an opportunistic point of view, I would say, we have programs for both euro, yen, SEK and dollar, so forth, which gives us access to that market. And if the opportunities are there, we will of course take them. And a number of other agency fundings are looked into. The key point here on industrial side is, I will say, that we have all that refinancing need secured.</p>
          <p>On page 10, if we flip over there, you will see the customer financing debt portfolio and the maturity structure of that. And as you have heard before, we have a customer-financing portfolio that is fully matched and there is no refinancing need other than for new businesses, so to speak, and it matures as the assets are maturing as well. So a fully matched position there.</p>
          <p>On the short-term funding, the red part of the bars here is really the dealer financing to say, it's about three months' money here. And we have been using the commercial paper program here in the past. And, for your information here, even though we had a fourth quarter that was very difficult, I would say, from a funding perspective, much more difficult than we have seen in the past, and we managed to roll over 14 billion during the fourth quarter. And we kept basically the outstanding debt in commercial paper from Q3 to the end of Q4.</p>
          <p>So everything we needed to roll over was rolled over in the commercial paper market at reasonable rates. So good progress there, I will say. On top of the commercial paper programs, for the short-term funding we are working also on the long-term side of course. And also there we have a number of alternatives available for us.</p>
          <p>I've lifted a few here, on the bank market you have the bilateral agreements and bilateral funding there, regional funding lines, for example, China, et cetera, once again taking the opportunity of our global footprint. And even though we have about 24 billion to be refinanced here in Q1, about half of that is already done now in January. So also here very good position and we feel very comfortable with the future there.</p>
          <p>So before I conclude here, let me just mention a few words on the pension side. We have pension liabilities probably in five countries, in U.S., Sweden, U.K., France, and Japan, and we have only plans where we have access against these commitments in U.S., Sweden and U.K. And you see the performance on top &#x2013; on the list here and I will say even though the financial market has been tough during 2008, I would say that we have managed to run these assets at reasonable levels. We have utilized the same &#x2013; used the same interest rates while we have done the actuarial  assumptions &#x2013; the calculations at end of the year here, as we had in 2007.</p>
          <p>And with that we have a situation where we had not posted any pension costs for 2008 and we are utilizing the corridor method for any liabilities going forward. So no P&amp;L effect in the 2008 numbers coming from pensions. And going forward here on the cash side, we only have one plan and that's the U.S. plan that would require additional cash infusion. And it's in &#x2013; as you see here on the slide, about $35 million, so limited need for cash infusion coming year here.</p>
          <p>So with that I stop my part of the presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, come with us to slide 12 then and the Truck group, specifically then our four brands. And you saw sales then obviously coming down. We had a very strong effect on the operating income driven then by lower sales, but also by under-absorption, then, as we reduced manufacturing rates way below our personnel availability and of course that's what happens when you have long delivery on cost reductions related to personnel. What we are now also have done is that we have gone through also production systems and overhead cost in production systems to make sure that we can &#x2013; when we roll out this come the second half of '09 we will be able to also say that we had good &#x2013; and in relative terms reasonable overhead costs compared to the present sales volumes at the time, whatever they may be. Good news here is also that inventories came down by actually 13%, so huge drop in inventories and of course that is good for cash flow reasons, but it's also good from the point of view that we don't think that we will end up having to discount inventory of &#x2013; over inventories of new trucks.</p>
          <p>On the operating income side, we're focusing here downsizing and flexibility; it's easy to say that we would want to be even more flexible. We are making sure that we can gain cost efficiency and productivity even at lower levels of manufacturing. And of course we have the desire here to drive inventory down further. So we will be producing in the first half here below our selling rates.</p>
          <p>We are also much interested of course to drive aftermarket and services, and especially as sales are coming down and we see, in this case, transport volumes staying up fairly high; we are interested in getting an even bigger share of that aftermarket and services, which as we said before soft products and more profitable and actually much more sustainable and less impacted by the downturn. And then of course we are in the midst here of preparing for new emission regulations both in the U.S. and in NLT in Japan and then come gradually to Euro 6 version of trucks in end European market.</p>
          <p>You look at the net order intake, it is actually still then slightly negative here in Europe and positive in the other areas for quarter &#x2013; the last quarter of last year. There has been a lot of discussion on order intake and understandably so, because these are difficult numbers. But what happens here is that if you buy a truck from the inventory, then they don't come up as an order intake. The only thing that comes up as an order intake is if the customer places an order for future deliveries, which is new to the system and goes into manufacturing them. So in reality what's happened here is that the source of sales, actual sales is coming from the going production and the going production you don't see in the order intake here but you actually saw that in quarter three, then. But a couple of months here of order book and then of course from the inventory. So in many ways it might be better to say that the real demand is really where the sales are, where the actual deliveries are rather than what you see in the order intake.</p>
          <p>We actually have a situation here where if you want the truck very quickly, you buy it directly from inventory and then that doesn't come up as an order at all in these statistics or if you want a truck a couple of months down the way, there is really no reason why you should put in an order right now, as everyone knows the delivery times are very short. So, it's difficult, but I think it's correct to say that the net order intake is not a, right now, particularly good indication of where the real demand is and actually that sales and deliveries might be a better way. And obviously with sales and deliveries much down, we are still talking about very much a down market.</p>
          <p>Look at slide 14, now, we have the heavy-duty truck market in Europe where we last quarter said, we cannot actually forecast the market at all. We are still actually saying that we cannot forecast the market, but we have tried here to guess at least. We have given a range here of 180 to 220, but frankly there is a big question mark there too. We don't know where this would be heading, but if we &#x2013; this is not a good forecast, this is not a solid forecast, but it's a guess at least that the market would end up somewhere around 200,000 units in Europe.</p>
          <p>And as you can see then that's a point that we will be making through the presentation here, 200,000 units, we will be much below the historic trend line. And we therefore think we know that the market will come back to the historic trend line. We don't think that is the issue. We think the issue is, how long will it actually take. But we don't think that we have any lack of good products to be able to service that market and we think the market will come back, but we don't know when.</p>
          <p>The same discussion is correct also on slide 14, which is the heavy-duty truck market in North America. There you could probably add another argument and that is that the fleet of trucks on the roads in North America is now getting very old and over time as customers come into better financial availability of liquidity, they will start looking at what the maintenance costs of trucks are to run them as old as they are now. And we then start looking for a new truck and come out better with that.</p>
          <p>So we think again with the same question mark here, 165 to 185,000 market is from a trend line, historic trend line, actually at low levels. And we again think the market will come up, but it's going to take at least a couple of quarters here. Then we have the issue of course whether there will be a pre-buy effect in 2010 and in normal times, we do certainly think we would have had a little of the pre-buy effect here, but we don't know how that will roll out, come the second half of 2009. Our guess would be that we will see a little pre-buy effect in 2009, we don't know.</p>
          <p>Come to slide 16 and look at the different truck brands. There are &#x2013; shared among the different truck brand, market shares gained in general. We think that's good. We think it sends the message or gives us the message that we have the products that our customers want to buy.</p>
          <p>In general and that's across all of our four brands, we have had inventories come down, and as you saw then, the whole of the truck grew by 13% which is good progress. We also have released the new Volvo FH16 700 horsepower, the world's strongest truck for the most difficult assignment and obviously in market segments, which we think are can be quite profitable.</p>
          <p>We notice on the Mack side here that obviously, we still have union negotiations going on. UAW have not been willing to sit down and have a real discussion here, because they are in the midst of a negotiation with the big three car companies. We think that's very unfortunate, but we are going to have to move on and do what we need to do anyway and we are in process of doing that. But that leaves open the issue of a potential VEBA arrangement and it also leaves open whether we should move the production that we had in New River Valley on the Mack brand into Macungie and obviously that's up more for the unions and for management at Mack Trucks to try to come to an agreement. As long as we don't have an agreement, we won't make that move. And therefore we are also not taking any cost associated there.</p>
          <p>We're quite pleased with the way EPA term is advancing and we think we have good products coming out in term when it comes to emission standards, fuel efficiency and reliability of products.</p>
          <p>With that let's shift to the page 17, and Construction Equipment and we have our new President of Construction Equipment, Olof Persson to talk to that slide.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Leif. If we start with world market conditions you can see from the slide that the total world market was down with almost 40% in the quarter or compared to the same period last year. And an example, Europe, it's even worse, there we've seen a decline with almost 50%.</p>
          <p>Of course that did heavily affected our sales and that was down with &#x2013; 27% lower, and if you adjust for currency that was actually down 38%, so quite substantial reduction there. Adding that to low volumes together with under absorption and the negative currency effect, then led to us reporting a loss in the quarter of 1.2 billion. The good news there is that we have been able to increase our market shares on most markets and also we have done that with a good pricing discipline.</p>
          <p>In order to adjust production capacity and inventory levels to this new customer demand we have &#x2013; constantly have our factories closed on actually 24 out of 60 working days during the quarter and that is corresponding to 40% of the available working days. I'm also pleased that with those actions we have done there we've been able to reduce our inventory with almost 20% since October. And as Leif was saying, we have firm plans in place to reduce our inventories with another 20% during the first half of this year.</p>
          <p>Starting in October, we have given notice of redundancy to a total of 3,400 employees during 2008 and since then we have given notice to another 300 since beginning of this year. By the end of December last year around 1,100 people have left the company compared to December &#x2013; September, excuse me. Our focus is of course now very much related to the downturn management and with a continuous adaptation of the capacity and then in order to further reduce the inventory and securing a good cash flow.</p>
          <p>And when it comes to the mid and long-term activities, we have this week introduced a new organization and business model for Volvo CE where the focus now is really on capturing synergies in procurement technology and production and also to reduce overlaps, increase internal efficiency and speed up decision-making and execution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Very good, Olof. Let's go to slide &#x2013; the next slide and have H&#xE5;kan Karlsson, speak about buses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Leif. Starting with the global bus markets, we can see that it continued to be affected from the global downturn and, I will say, the financial constraints in the market. The coach segment declined in the fourth quarter and our best judgment just now is that we will see a downward trend in the range of 20 to 30% compared to last year. And that will that hamper our businesses mainly in Mexico, Peru and Europe.</p>
          <p>The city segment's still holding up, and we hope that the financial constraint really is up, because then we think we can have a fairly good city segment during 2009. And so far in quarter four we have a good order intake in the city segment, so we are fairly good in our capacity planning for 2009. The fourth quarter was a decent quarter, I think with a sales increase of 6%. The result was positive, slightly lower compared to last year, but we had a significant negative effect on currency and the high R&amp;D spending in the range of 150 million.</p>
          <p>In focus, we continue to execute our turnaround program with an additional cost reduction to counteract, I will say, the downturn. The turnaround program delivered a quarterly plan and that will strengthen our profitability. We also work hard to reduce coach inventories to secure a positive cash flow going forward.</p>
          <p>And on the product side we are preparing for Euro 5 introduction this year and also the hybrid product have reached an important milestone with a field test in London and Gothenburg starting in February. All in all 2009 will be a challenging year regarding volumes, but we continue to strengthen our profitability through our turnaround program.</p>
          <p>So back to you, Leif.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Then we have slide 19, we have Volvo Penta, and the President of Volvo Penta, G&#xF6;ran Gummeson to speak to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, Leif. The world market for marine engines dropped dramatically during the last quarter and we saw reductions in Europe of 30% and actually in the U.S. more than 50%. And we have continued to gain market shares in the marine market, but we have not been able to offset the sharp decline of course of the total market.</p>
          <p>The global market for industrial engines remain relatively strong even during quarter four and we increased our sales actually with 8%. And during the year, we've sold more than 27,000 engines based on the Volvo diesel engine platforms and the majority of these engines are then for industrial and power generation applications.</p>
          <p>We have an operating loss in the quarter mainly due to lower sales, overall 21% actually, but also due to non-recurring downsizing costs in our operations. We have reduced the number of employees by roughly 350 odd positions and from our global operations then the permanent and temporarily employed people and consultants, and the cost for these adjustments have been taken during the quarter. And we are now focusing on securing the operating efficiency and this new downsized operational structure and then manage our operating capital in order to secure a positive cash flow.</p>
          <p>We are investing in a new logistic and delivery system that will secure efficiency in the production systems and also reduce our operating capital. This new system will be implemented now starting during quarter two actually in '09. And as earlier mentioned, we have a strong momentum in the industrial engine business and we have strengthened our market positions in some of our core segments in that market. And now it's important that we capitalize on this momentum and contribute then to the profitability of the further Volvo diesel engine synergies.</p>
          <p>So that's all from Volvo Penta.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, G&#xF6;ran, thank you. Then we have Volvo Aero and for the first time we have the new President of Volvo Aero, Staffan Zackrisson with us. Welcome Staffan, and you need to speak then to the Volvo Aero slide 20.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Starting with the market we see a declining air traffic, November came in for a negative and for the whole year we see that the market will end with a zero growth for '08. That means that there is growing surplus of aircrafts building out there.</p>
          <p>For ourselves, the business has been positively affected by the high dollar, you can see it in the sales number and the effect between '08 and '07 is down to the dollar. If we had also been affected by the push-out of new programs, the 787 from Boeing and the new Airbus 380, the engines for these aircrafts and that has affected the planned volumes that we had in our workshops and thus the margins.</p>
          <p>We have had to lower capacity utilization in our system. We have made announcements of layoffs, but totality for all our sites is about 420 people. We are here now a little bit later than the rest of the industry and in the cycle that goes for aerospace versus other segments in the market. So we're preparing ourselves now for the downturn when we have to adapt to the surplus building up and we're very early in the supply chain as well.</p>
          <p>We see our operating income that is also affected very much by the dollar impact between '08 and '07. We're adjusting now for the downturn, putting in very stringent cost management and have that in place. We have on the aftermarket in our American aviation services sales profitability that we have to focus. That has also affected the result for fourth quarter and we are executing on the new contracts that we signed during the summer for the new aircraft that are just now in the product development phase, which will go on for a couple of years.</p>
          <p>Also on the agenda for us in focus is securing our space activities, which is linked to the political decisions here in Sweden and we're waiting for that decision to come at the end of first quarter. And that's all from Volvo Aero.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Staffan. Then we have Financial Services from Sal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Leif. Our retail finance volume and penetration was at a good level in the fourth quarter of 2008. We're able to provide and continue to provide vital financial services to the Volvo Group customers and dealers with strict underwriting discipline. We're definitely looking at our portfolio management in a heightened way. We have been in a downturn in North America for the last 18 months and I feel we've been performing quite well in North America in that downturn. However, now in the third and fourth quarter, we see that Europe and international regions are fully in the downturn.</p>
          <p>Delinquencies, repossessions and write-offs have increased in the last two months of the year, which has caused us to increase the need for provision and therefore operating income has decreased in the quarter to SEK 238 million.</p>
          <p>Looking at what's in focus, I have to say we are highly focused on our portfolio management, working with our customers continually, looking at the difficulties that they're having making payments, assessing them and we're appropriately repossessing the equipment and liquidating it. We're working very closely with Volvo Group Treasuries as to secure good funding at competitive rates. And just to reiterate, we have a short-term funding need which is matched to our lending, to our dealer inventory financing, which is on average between 60 to 90 days.</p>
          <p>Our retail financing portfolio is on average 42 months in duration and is matched funded, which means the loans we make to our customers are matched by term with funding less 8% equity. So therefore we're removing any interest rate risk.</p>
          <p>Looking into 2009, we will continue doing our new dealer financing and our new retail financing and this will mirror the sales of the VAs based on a penetration rate of about 25 to 30%. So, therefore as volumes increase or decrease, so will our need for refinancing.</p>
          <p>While maintaining the portfolio and managing it in an effective way and securing good funding, we're also focused on providing liquidity to good credit quality customers and maintaining profitability throughout the downturn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, let's go to slide 22 and 23 on the Group summary. We have earnings per share then a shade below 5 krones, we have a dividend at 2 krones of that striking the right balance between profits made and also the need for capital going forward.</p>
          <p>Sales were down by 15% and obviously that means that we have a slow pace going into the first half of 2009. We will be having production significantly under sales and the reason for us doing that is that we are very intent on not building inventory, actually the other way around, releasing cash from inventory with that providing good cash flow and also not have an inventory that's going to have to be discounted away some days later. It's a matter of pay now or pay later and we would rather say let's pay now.</p>
          <p>We are in the midst also of making sure that over time when we have stopped taking, stop days and stop weeks, which is a not particularly efficient way to use production, we would come back into more normal territory of efficiency and productivity and make sure that we can deliver that also in 2009.</p>
          <p>And then we have developed an introduction of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient products. We are happy with progress of hybrids and most notably so on the bus side, where products will be released and are actually now rolling, production coming &#x2013; getting into second half or later half of 2009. And then of course we are quite focused on making sure that we can make U.S. ten and Japanese equivalent as good products release come early parts of 2010.</p>
          <p>And with that let me conclude the presentation from our side and let's have a Q&amp;A. And I hope the operator is there to start the Q&amp;A.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everybody. I have two questions. It's Arndt Ellinghorst from Credit Suisse. Firstly, on inventories, I think you mentioned this morning that you're planning to continue lowering your inventory level; I think you reported 55 billion SEK end of the year. So what's roughly the normal inventory level that you are looking at? It's something mid-40 billion SEK? If you could give us some flavor there?</p>
          <p>And secondly on Financial Services, you run a book of roughly 100 billion Swedish krones in customer and dealer finance receivables. Could you talk a bit about the credit default rate that you're currently seeing? I think historically you were at 1.4%. If that level would &#x2013; could maximum go and how much did you provision for, so far? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with inventory turn and I'll have Sal talk about Financial Services. Obviously inventories must be related and normally inventory must be related to sales. And you could say we were at normal inventories when we were in our second or at quarter two and then sales started dropping. At present selling rates, you could probably say we should be able to take, let's say, 15 billion out of that inventory to have a more normal inventory. Financial Services, Sal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me add the write-offs since how we measured to the overall portfolio of the 100 billion that you mentioned, through the year we had 54 basis points in write-offs. And for the fourth quarter isolated, we had about 77 basis points in write-off so you can see the increasing trend. Our reserves at the end of the year were approximately 1.4% of the entire portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very clear answers. And how bad could it really get? Could it get to something like 2 or 3% when you look at your book right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have any clearer crystal ball than anyone else, and in the Volvo Group we don't typically make predictions into the future. We have reviewed the portfolio, we have reviewed our customer base and at the end of the year we're comfortable with our reserves.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Patric Lindqvist from HQ Bank. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I had one question on raw materials just to get a sense for it in 2009. Obviously you will be hit in the beginning of the year, but if you look at the year as a whole and given the current contracts, the current levels where spot rates are, would you expect that to be a net positive year-over-year in 2009? And that's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think positive quarter-on-quarter of course is very much dependant on the volumes that we have. So I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On year, or full year though.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We would have probably have to sit down with you and make the calculations there. I think if the trend then certainly continues to be high in the beginning of the year and then come vacation will start coming down. I'm looking at all of year. Is that a reasonably good description?</p>
          <p>And then if you do quarter-on-quarter comparison, Patric, you will have to make assessments on which volumes we're talking about, otherwise that won't work out. But the overall scenario is remaining high first half and then coming down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the net for the whole year, if you would look into '09 against '08, would you expect it to be neutral, positive or still slightly negative?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it all depends on the volume again. It depends on how the volumes roll out. And I'm not prepared, I cannot. Not that I don't want to, I would like to, but I can't give you a volume forecast there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. One short for, Sal, provisions obviously increased and also relative to write-offs, basically saying that things are getting uglier out there, which <mark type="inaudible" /> are saying. But can you give &#x2013; just remind us on the write-offs on what levels they peaked last time? Since obviously nobody has a crystal ball, we can look backwards at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It really depends upon where in the world you'd have to look at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't typically break out by region, the write-offs. But I can say that we have a different portfolio mix today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have more of a portfolio in Europe than we did in the United States and obviously, we're a bit more diversified and international. So in looking at it, we reviewed the different regions, and we're counting on Europe to be somewhat stable, as it has been over the last seven years that I've been &#x2013; eight years now that I've been here, with some slight increases. And we're looking for the U.S. organization to actually perform much better than in the last downturn. And we've been in the downturn in the U.S. for over 18 months, and I can say this, we have performed a heck of a lot better than we did in the last downturn.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Fredric Stahl from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Could you tell me if the situation with your suppliers, has that changed in the last two or three months, when you've been cutting down production very dramatically, if you have noticed any more stress in the supply chain or even amongst your customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think on the customer side fairly little, both dealer-base and customers in general are sound and doing quite reasonably well. I don't think there is an issue on that side of the Group. On the supply side there is certainly a number of issues, and short-term when we pull down as much as we do here, and our payable as you can see actually is negative from a cash flow point of view, of course that represents slower invoicing from our supplier base. And with the cuts coming down as sharply as we have here, and the availability of liquid funds being low, we have a number of suppliers that have difficulties.</p>
          <p>A way we have addressed that is with supply chain financing, and we have a program of supply chain financing where we are then borrowing, you can say, or helping a bank pay the invoice immediately. And we are then using the savings on our balance sheet to help with that. That is actually working quite well, and of course it doesn't give us an exposure because we have a collateral, the products have been delivered to us. That seems to be working quite well for many suppliers, and we wouldn't exclude still that we would have one or two that would still &#x2013; could end up in problems. Not so much perhaps because of us, but because they are delivering into industry and potentially also automotive car industry, but nothing that we see as very effectful either on our production or on our finances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what you're saying is you're helping your suppliers to sell their receivables so to speak?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mikael, do you want to go into the details of that if you're interested?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically what we're &#x2013; you could say that the suppliers are borrowing money on the credit of Volvo, meaning that the exposure for us is only that we should pay invoices we have already committed to pay. So the bank goes stepping between there and pay our invoices in advance. So it's not affecting our balance sheet other than that we get the payment terms we want and the supplier gets a shorter payment period than it would otherwise get. And the bank charged an interest rate that is much more favorable than if he would have borrowed on his own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our overall impression is that that is helping short-term for suppliers who have liquidity problems, but not really profitability problems. There are some suppliers that you can say probably have had profitability problems for some time and obviously, a period like this puts a lot of pressure on them too, and there this program doesn't help. But all in all, frankly, so far so good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just two points of information that I think usually comes with your with your annual report, if you can tell me what the annual &#x2013; the total cost for components and raw materials was, and employees in the full year, if you have that data?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Say again so that we &#x2013; we had trouble hearing you there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What the total cost for components and raw materials was for the year 2008 and the same for employee costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> annual reports.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If you look at, let's see is that in the annual report? If you look at cost of goods sold, I don't think we make that split here. But typically you can say, it's different in different business areas, but typically, you can say, if you take cost of goods sold and then between 60 and 70% is actually material and components coming from the outside.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a combination of overhead and direct salary; direct salary typically between 5 and 10%. But as you can see there, let me continue on that, because I think that's important when you look at the part of the Volvo Group that we've said is labor intense and new products, if we can reduce costs in that, the fact that we have factories at very low utilization rate from a capital and overhead point of view won't kill us. If we just can reduce cost we will take components and material out and we can take labor cost out. Then we can actually, if you want to call that, survive at very low levels of manufacturing, we're not like a steel company or like very heavily capital invested manufacturing facilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Alexis Albert from Natixis. Please go ahead, Sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Alex Albert, Natixis Centres, just two questions. The first one is regarding the provision you took for the &#x2013; for the people that left the company in 2008. On slide five, you said that around 5,800 people left the company in 2008. That means roughly a third of the people you would like to see leaving the company? So does that mean that we're going to see two thirds of the provision in 2009?</p>
          <p>And the second question is that, I would like &#x2013; if you can speak about the used truck prices and the correlation between used truck prices and new truck prices, because I have heard some competitors saying that used truck prices are under pressure, especially due to the fact that dealers would like to lower the inventories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, on the quarterly impact on the number of people who have left us, you can say the 750 that we have specified are for people that have left us, and where we have paid and settled for the cost of having them leave us. The two billion that we're looking at is underutilized underabsorbed labor costs that we had while producing much less. And obviously in the first &#x2013; the number of people that left us for the fourth quarter are the easiest, they are temporary workers and they are consultants et cetera, and you could probably expect in release cost, higher cost, but even so the real cost is going to be the underabsorption. The fact that we have much too many people in some places and &#x2013; especially Sweden that are redundant in terms of not being able to use them for manufacturing. So that's the best guidance we can give you there.</p>
          <p>Used truck prices is reasonably easy; we have seen used truck prices coming down, and we were saying before that in Europe between 15, 20% and in the U.S. between 25 and 30% on used prices. We have not seen that impact new trucks. But we do see that impacting on the used trucks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one follow up if may, on your total sales in Europe and in the U.S. or just for the truck business overall, what is the share of used trucks? What is the share of the turnover coming from used trucks and the difference would be new trucks of course?</p>

          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Ulrich Scholz from Oppenheim Research. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Ulrich Scholz from Oppenheim Research. First, a question regarding R&amp;D and CapEx in the running year. Could you give us a guidance for both plans, what budget you have? And second question regarding the dividend, is there a specific payout ratio you're looking for but into the future or what's your plan with this respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the first one was CapEx. Was that what he asked us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And R&amp;D.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And R&amp;D. CapEx we said earlier in the day here that we came in with a PPE of around 9.9, almost 10 billion. We would guide you to say rather between 7 and 8 there, a reduction of about 2, 2.5 billion. On the dividend side &#x2013; say that again, so that we answer correctly, what was your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it a specific payout ratio you're looking forward in the future? You've come basically from a time period now of increasing dividends every year, and when you're now going to tougher times what's your plan? Is it a predictable &#x2013; update us &#x2013; will there be a specific relation to net earnings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you could probably say that had we had a normal year in 2009, dividend would have been higher than it is right now. So we don't have a ratio in on the last year's profit that we are adhering to. We're saying the Board takes a look at in the beginning of the next coming year after the year that's gone by, and we take a look at what were the profits of the last year, we take a look at what are the funding needs and the opportunities that we have ahead of us, and the capital &#x2013; you remember a couple of years ago, for example, we held on to capital because we felt that it would be good to be able to make acquisitions.</p>
          <p>In this case we have done just that, we have concluded that we had quite a reasonable result for 2008 that probably in its own right could have justified a higher dividend. We're looking at a difficult market ahead of us, including potentially at least some problems with funding. We're not seeing any big acquisitions or anything like that in the near-term future. And all of that balance made us this time make a recommendation to the general assembly of two krones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's your R&amp;D plan for the running year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>R&amp;D right now in 2009 remains fairly highly, driven by U.S. 10, Japanese and Euro 6. Obviously U.S. 10 and Japanese will &#x2013; the Japanese investment there will actually start going down in 2010. But we have a desire, provided it's possible, we have a desire to continue to try to invest in R&amp;D and make sure that we have the most attractive products also going forward. Short-term, I don't see much that can be changed from today's levels. Longer-term if you come into 10, then there may be opportunities if we have to, to start reducing there a little as we come by or come past the emission standards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with the lay-off costs, did I get it right, that we can basically expect around 1.5 billion for the first half of the running year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I could forecast exactly what our lay offs could be, then I would have to forecast volumes and I can't do that. I cannot confirm that number. We're trying to give you a guidance on the curve on that slide, but we don't know how that will fall out across the different business areas. It all depends on volume. We're starting the year certainly with very low volumes and we have manufacturing volumes below sales volumes, so there will be underabsorption cost in Q1 and from what we can see today also in Q2. But our horizon here is a couple of months out, not more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Jose Asumendi from RBS. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jose Asumendi from RBS. Three questions please. First one, the way I see it you've got a couple of challenging quarters to go through in terms of cash generation. But you're still proposing a 4 billion dividend payout in 2009? Do you plan to maintain your committed lines over the next quarters, or do you think that the likelihood of using them are going to be somehow higher?</p>
          <p>The second question would be on Construction Equipment, could you please share with us the number of days you plan to close your plants in the first quarter. And on the third, the third question would be on the payables. I think you took a hit of around 3.6 billion. I was just wondering if you could comment how do you see the payables helping you over the next quarters in your cash flow. And when would you expect to see the first positive impact of payables in your working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. I think should we start with the VCE question there, Olof, number of days or production rates in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's &#x2013; as we see it today with the information we have, we believe it would be at least on the same magnitude as we've said in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slightly different in different product lines. It's difficult to give you casual numbers. VCE is a variety of many different products and differently impacted. I think on the payables side, and Mikael, correct me if I'm wrong, it's easy to say that payables won't help us from a cash flow point of view. When we reduce as much as we do here, payables are actually going to go negative from a cash flow point of view as we reduce the production rates. And how that rolls out and when that will turn, it all depends on when we will stabilize production or when we'll start turning back up so and we &#x2013; again, we cannot forecast that. Then on the funds available to us, Mikael?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Committed facilities there and the committed facilities for us has been untouched, and we are not planning to use them either going forward, and I believe we have a very good funding plan for 2009 going forward here. So for us the committed facilities is absolutely a backup reserve and our plans have not increased to use them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question comes from Mr. Maximo Bianchi from EE Sharp. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Thank you for taking the questions. Basically the first question would be, I understand your industrial net debt is somewhere in the area of 29.7 billion. If I look at the break down, there is a page on your annual report with the balance sheet broken down by segments, so there is industrial operation and customer finance. Why a big portion of your loans and their current liabilities seems to be attributed to the industrial operation while it should be to the customer finance division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Mikael, do you want to speak to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think it's a rather complicated question. And it's more of a technical nature in the way we operate Volvo Treasury here and I think in pressures of time here, maybe that's something we could take separately. So if you contact Investor Relations department here we could work that out with you. But it's more from a technical nature because we are having Volvo Treasury as the base for all the funding.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's not related to the fact that you're basically borrowing money through the industrial &#x2013; it's not related to some inter-company borrowing or inter-company transactions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is. Yes it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. And the other question I had was on your funding, on your liabilities, basically the credit lines that you have &#x2013; you're saying there, they've no covenants in relation to ratings. Does this &#x2013; is the same regarding to covenants, is there any negative pledge in there? Are you planning to draw down the facilities in even &#x2013; we've seen some of your competitors, they're drawing down the facilities even if they don't need the money right now, just to make sure that the money will be there at some point. I was wondering, your facilities are still fully untapped, I was wondering if you're planning to do something around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as I said, our committed facilities are really what is meant to be a backup facility. And we have not in our plans to utilize that amount. And it's correct as you said we have no negative clauses or rating figures or anything else in that documentation or any other loan documentation we have for the Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good afternoon. Could you give us an idea of the extent to which your service hours in the aftermarket business were down in the fourth quarter? And secondly, can you give us any idea of the number or the extent of the used vehicles or used trucks that you expect coming back to you this year and how that might compare to a normal year if you like?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see, your first question was service hours in the fourth quarter, was it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we have a annualized number on one of the slides that we showed you there. And I'm looking at my colleague <mark type="inaudible" /> Investor Relations would there be any reason to think that that would not be split reasonably well in four quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but David, you're asking for &#x2013; if it be dropped in the fourth quarter, in the number of sold service hours?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We commented, David a little on that before. We have seen some, but then you're talking zero to 5% decline in some segments in different product lines, trucks or excavators et cetera. Some of the product lines like excavators are standing still on construction sites. There you see more of an effect, more so than on the rolling material like on the truck side. But those are more orders of magnitude than the drop on the new product side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And the other question was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The used trucks, can you give us any idea of the number of trucks that you might have returning to you as a result of off-lease vehicles or guaranteed buybacks that you might have given over the past couple of years? Any idea of how many trucks you have coming back to you this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're asking that question on an overall truck situation. I don't think we would be able to provide you with an answer for that right now. It all depends on how it plays out. We had &#x2013; and here you're talking about that at a truck level too, different in Japan, different in Europe and different in the U.S. I don't think we can give you a detailed number on that right now.</p>
