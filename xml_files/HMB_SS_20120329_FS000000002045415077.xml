          <p>Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the H&amp;M Three-Months Report Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct the question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you, this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the chairperson, Head of Investor Relations, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting, sir and I will be standing by.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's first quarter results. The presentation slides are found on our website, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me today and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>We've had a good start to the New Year with strong sales in the first quarter as well as now in March. Between the March 1 and the March 27, sales increased by 22% compared to the same period last year. The strong increase shows that our spring collections have been well received and we continue to take market share.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, first quarter 2012. In the first quarter, sales including VAT increased 13% in local currencies and in comparable units, sales were up 3%. In SEK net sales were SEK27.8 billion. And we are present in 44 markets today and we see the strong sales performance as a proof of that customers worldwide appreciate our strong offering. We continue to strengthen our position in a very challenging fashion retail market.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide, sales per market. Germany remains by far our largest market and sales continue developing well, with an increase of 9% in the first quarter in a slow clothing market, particularly in February. We have close to 400 stores in Germany and our growth continues.</p>
          <p>The U.S. is now our second largest market and we are growing fast. Sales rose 29% in the quarter. Including Canada, we have nearly 300 stores in North America today.</p>
          <p>Sales were strong also in the U.K. with an increase of 21%, we grew considerably more than the market.</p>
          <p>In China, sales were up by 50%. China was our single largest expansion market last year and will be so also in 2012.</p>
          <p>In addition to our own strong collections, we have launched a long-term collaboration with David Beckham in the quarter. And in March, we had Marni at H&amp;M, which was also very well received around the world.</p>
          <p>Turning to the slide of the gross margin development, gross profit for the quarter was SEK15.5 billion corresponding to a gross margin of 55.8%, down from 57.8% last year. The decrease from last year may appear large but if you look at the development, you get some perspective of this year's first quarter in comparison with the development over the years.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. We do have a genuine long-term perspective. We are investing for the future and we always have the customers in focus. We're committed to our strategy of strengthening our market position relative to competitors by strengthening our customer offering. Like we said before, this includes even better prices, even higher quality and more sustainable fashion.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, we chose not to raise our prices to customers despite increased purchasing costs. The situation in the sourcing markets was still considerably tougher at the time of sourcing for the first quarter than in the corresponding period a year earlier, particularly due to higher cotton prices. But the increase in purchasing costs is also related to a number of important and long-term investments aimed at broadening the total offering of the group. To do this, we are strengthening areas such as the buying organization and the production offices with more new employees and new IT investments.</p>
          <p>A number of long-term projects are underway and in the first quarter there is larger proportion of investments than previously. One of our new initiatives is the launch of an entirely new store chain that will open already in next year. We have a great team in place for this and we are looking forward very much to launching this exciting new brand. It will be a very good complement to our existing offering, but for competitive reasons, we cannot say much more right now. We just want to clarify though, as some media reports have speculated that the new store chain would be a luxury version of COS but this is not correct. It will be something else. But we do, however, build on the positive experience we have from COS as COS works very well and perform strongly both in terms of sales and profits.</p>
          <p>We also want to broaden the ranges of our H&amp;M stores by adding new concepts and new product categories. We are looking forward to share this with you in more details as we come closer to the launch.</p>
          <p>Looking at fashion retail in general in the first quarter, it was a period characterized by markdown activity in most of our markets. This was a consequence of the historically warm autumn that led to weaker demand for winter clothes.</p>
          <p>Increased mark downs in relation to sales affected the gross margin negatively by 90 basis points year-on-year. Together with our strong sales performance, the markdowns contributed to a good level of stock-in-trade as per the February 29. I would come back to that when we are looking at key data.</p>
          <p>The negative effects on the gross margin were partly offset by weaker U.S. dollar against most of our currencies at the time of sourcing for the first quarter compared to the corresponding sourcing period the previous year.</p>
          <p>Looking at operational costs, cost control in the group remains good. Cost in comparable stores decreased from the first quarter last year, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of sales. SG&amp;A was SEK12 billion in the quarter, up 12% in SEK, and 11% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The increase is explained mainly by the expansion and by continued long-term investments in IT, online and marketing. The operating margin was 12.7% and net profit for the period was SEK2.7 billion corresponding to earnings per share of SEK1.65.</p>
          <p>Now some words on our expansion. Please turn to the slide expansion. We had a total of 2,491 stores at the end of the quarter, franchise and our other brands included. For 2012, we plan to open around 275 stores net. We are growing in all markets. China, the U.S. and the U.K. are the countries where we plan to open most stores per market.</p>
          <p>We're also opening in five new markets this year. One of them is Bulgaria where we opened the first store on the 10th of March. Customer reception has been fantastic and we will open many more stores in Bulgaria.</p>
          <p>This autumn, H&amp;M will open in Latvia, Malaysia and Mexico and via franchise in Thailand. COS too is opening in five new markets this year, Italy, Poland, Hong Kong and Finland and via franchise in Kuwait.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M is also expanding online. This autumn we will launch H&amp;M shop online in the U.S. the world's largest retail market where our sales growth is high and our brand is strong.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our expansion and now looking at some key figures for the first quarter please turn to the slide key data. Stock-in-trade was SEK12.4 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the same time the previous year. The increase is mainly due to the expansion but also to higher purchasing costs. Both the level and the balance of the stock-in-trade as of the 29th of February are viewed as good, thanks to strong sales in the quarter in combination with markdowns.</p>
          <p>As you can see on the next slide in relation to sales, the stock-in-trade was 10.9%, which is still good looking back over the past number of years. And as always, one should keep in mind that the stock-in-trade is a snapshot at a certain moment in time and that the picture can change significantly over a week even.</p>
          <p>Cash from current operation, cash flow from current operations was just about SEK2 billion. The main explanation for the increase is that stock-in-trade decreased more in the first quarter of this year than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Investments were SEK1.1 billion and are expected to be between SEK5.5 billion and SEK6 billion in 2012, like we've said before. Our finances remained strong. Liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK22 billion.</p>
          <p>Before we start the Q&amp;A session, a few comments on the future. We have great collections in our stores for spring and summer. One example is our new Conscious collection, where our designers combine environmentally smarter materials with high fashion content. Conscious collection will be launched on the 12th of April. We continue strengthening our position and we take market share. The customer service that we conduct in all our markets, show that never before do we have such a strong position as we do today.</p>
          <p>We've had a very good start to 2012 with 13% sales increase in the first quarter and 22% in March until the 27th. We are in 44 markets today, few retailers in the world have a business model that works as well as globally &#x2013; as well globally as ours. Not only when it comes to expanding to new markets and big cities, but also when it comes to working well in mid-size and small towns. This allows us to go deeply into each markets and it leaves us with great potential for future growth.</p>
          <p>We can offer fashion for everyone. This is a strength as we do not take our success for granted in any way. Instead, we're looking harder &#x2013; we're working harder than ever both on delivering strong sales and profits here and now, and also on securing many years of continued successful expansion. Therefore, we are investing in our customer offering in broadening our total offering, like with a new and exciting store chain we're launching next year and in new employees as well as in IT in order to support our multi-channel growth. It would be easy for us to boost profits short-term by, for example, raising prices and avoiding long-term investments. It would be easy but for us unwise.</p>
          <p>We will always put the customer first. We are convinced that this is the right strategy for us going forward, so that we can continue our profitable growth for many years to come. We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Can you hear me, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I can hear you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Jyrki. Yeah, hi. Afternoon, sorry. Can I just ask you then about this plan for this new brand? Just a general question really, why you feel you need a new brand given the development of COS and obviously purchase of Weekday, Monki brands a few years ago. Why do you feel that you need another brand as from next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more that we have identified a gap in the market and we're very excited about this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, does that suggest that you feel that you're better or you're better advised to create brands from scratch rather than buying them now given the relative performance of COS versus the brands that you bought &#x2013; the fabric brands that you bought a few years ago? Should we expect now continued sort of organic brand development from &#x2013; rather than acquisitions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are pros and cons with both &#x2013; strategies, so to speak. But it's no secret that COS is organic and we started from scratch and it's come the furthest and it's a very good example, going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think also with COS we have shown that we have the knowledge and experience of building up an organic brand. It's a great success and we have good turnover development and it's good profitability as well. Also it gives us strength to open a new chain where we see the opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And just one on the buying organization and production offices that you're doing, could you just talk about how you're strengthening both of those? What improvements are you making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's &#x2013; I mean, this is related to the new initiatives and the new store chain for example, we're strengthening with new designers and also we're looking at broadening the offering at the existing H&amp;M stores as we've said; new categories et cetera.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the cost of that is presumably mainly people and some IT spend, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct. As Nils said, we have to build up a new design team also increasing a number of staff in the buying office and our production offices and also the IT investments. That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. All right, thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Anne Critchlow. Please announce your company name and go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, it's Anne Critchlow from SG.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got a question on pricing in the first quarter. You said you didn't pass on the higher cost of goods sold into prices, but did you actually lower prices in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is a &#x2013; I mean normally we don't really comment on our pricing strategy, but we felt it was necessary at this time because there was &#x2013; some interpreted our figures that we had increased prices and we want to be very clear that we have not increased our prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But did you actually lower them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Nils said, we normally don't comment on our pricing strategy. We just want to be clear that we haven't increased the prices to the customers during the first quarter. But otherwise, how we have been treating our prices, our customers that we wanted to keep to ourselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And then just one more question about the March trading figures, was there a positive under effect in that period 1st to the 27th?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, there isn't. But if you look at the total month of March, we will end up with a Friday and Saturday and compared to last year, it ended with a Wednesday and Thursday, I think, or something like that. So, it will be a positive for the complete month of March. And that would reverse to negative in April.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the impact &#x2013; the positive impact, would that be 3% to 5%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's difficult to say at this time, but it should be a few percentage points at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Adam Cochrane from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Adam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You talked about the long-term investment in gross margin. Just wondering if you could really clarify in terms of the Q1 being bigger, how long has it been going on for and what would be your sort of expectations with regards to the long-term please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have to have some effect in previous quarters as well, but not as significant as in Q1. And as these are long-term investments, they will continue during the quarters this coming year. But looking at the decrease in the gross margins from last year, the biggest single component affecting the decrease of the gross margin is the 90 basis points related to the increased markdowns. The rest of the decrease in the gross margin of 110 basis points is primarily related to the increased sourcing cost in combination with our decisions not to increase the prices to our customers. But, as we also state, it's also connected to our long-term investments which are aiming to broadening our total offering. But, as always, there are a lot of different components affecting our cost of goods sold and also our gross margin. But, the most important is how we choose to act when it comes to our custom offering; that will be decisive for the gross margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, in terms of the fact that you've made a comment about it at all, I presume it's got to be something &#x2013; 50 basis points or more; otherwise, you probably wouldn't have commented at all, would you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, the single biggest component is relating to the increased markdowns of 90 basis points and the rest of the 110 basis points is primarily related to increased sourcing in combination with our decision not to increase the prices to our customers. But, then there are also these long-term investments and other components as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll take that as the answer. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Simon Irwin from Liberum Cap [Liberum Capital]. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you just talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of sourcing because you obviously mentioned cotton again in this quarter? The same period last year, you were saying that your margins were impacted by significantly higher cotton prices. And so, I'm just trying to get a feel for how cotton impacts you over such a long period when the spike was relatively short from that perspective. And also, whether there have been any other shifts in the way that you source by shifting geography or anything else material?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we start with the cotton prices, then we talk about spot prices. It's true that they peak some time in &#x2013; a year ago. But, it wasn't until September, October that they were back on same period &#x2013; same level as the previous year. And that's the spot prices we're talking about. And, as you know, we don't buy cotton. We buy &#x2013; we design products and we have them produced and our suppliers buy the fabric, buy the yarn. There is a considerable lag before the effects hit us so to speak. So, yes, there's definitely been an impact from increased cotton prices in Q1 and there will also be a slight one in probably in Q2.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And, in terms of the FX, you obviously saw I assume a slightly bigger FX gain in 1Q than 4Q. Am I right in thinking that that now becomes relatively immaterial for the next couple of quarters?</p>

          <p>Okay. And, in terms of what you're doing in terms of buying and production of things, are there any changes to the physical infrastructure of your business which you haven't talked about for a while? So, am I right in thinking you've opened the Belgium RDC and is that now up and running? And, are there any others planned?</p>

          <p>That's up and running; that's correct. And, then I would say there are always things going on and &#x2013; in our infrastructure, in our sourcing. But, it's about small steps in evolution, rather than revolution. So, there is no huge projects &#x2013; mega projects going on at the moment, no.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. I'm calling from Stifel Nicolaus. And, if you could just remind us at how quickly COS grew that is to say once you had the conviction and started to roll it out. And, do you think that could be a good proxy for this new business, the unnamed business, in terms of rate of growth, how fast we should see it accelerate? And, where would we best see these new stores? I would assume in Stockholm. Are you going to enter other countries immediately? And if so, where that might be?</p>

          <p>Okay. Good morning to New York. When it comes to COS, yes, it gives us, of course, a lot of experience that we can use on the new brand.

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. This is Chris Chaviaras from Barclays Capital. A question on....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Chris.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. A question on the breakdown of the gross margin if possible because can I clarify you were talking about investments. It looks like you were talking mostly about investments in the operating cost line. In terms of the gross margin, trying to understand what kind of investments you're doing there, you did mention the markdowns were 90 basis points now and then the biggest was cost inflation. Was &#x2013; how much of an impact relative to 4Q was 1Q cost inflation at one &#x2013; the first quarter? And, also how positive the FX was if you can give account there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, could you please take one question at a time because it gets confusing? Start with the first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What was...? Sure. So, in the gross margin, if you can talk about the impact that you saw in the first quarter from &#x2013; coming from cost inflation relative to the fourth quarter of the previous year, if that was similar or it was lower or higher? And, the second &#x2013; it's in the same question, how much did the FX offset your gross margin decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, looking at the effects year-on-year, Q4-to-Q4 last year and Q1-to-Q1 last year, it's more or less the same effect year-on-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, then the second question is how much the FX was &#x2013; you mean the dollar effect, mainly euro-dollar effect...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the &#x2013; my first one was on cost inflation; how much was the impact in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter? Was it higher or a similar impact that you saw from cost inflation this quarter versus the previous quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as I said, more or less the same impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The same impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, FX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, FX as Nils already said that in the buying for Q1, it was a positive dollar effect, more positive than for Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, okay. And, then very last one, if I may; the markdowns, did we have any markdowns in the second quarter? I remember the last time you reported you had reported that you had seen increased markdowns in the first quarter but you haven't mentioned anything about the second quarter. Do we have &#x2013; do you have any visibility and did you have any kind of markdowns during March year-on-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year in Q2, the markdown levels was flat to the previous year. Is that &#x2013; that was your first question, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but what about this year, second quarter? So, you started the second quarter with a plus 22% in March, roughly. Does this come in any association with markdowns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's far too early to say anything about the markdown levels for the second quarter. We have still two months to go. But as we say in the report, we have a well-balanced and a good level in stock in trade when we go out the first quarter. We have had a good start in the second quarter, but when it comes to the markdown levels for the whole Q2, then we still have two months to go and it will be dependent on the turnover development during April and May.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. My first question is really with regards to the additional OpEx investment that you're making with regards to IT and then marketing. You said there was a larger proportion of Q1. Do we expect &#x2013; are we in a ramp-up phase where as we get into Q2 and Q3 that proportion is going to increase or should we expect higher investment cost as the year progress as a percentage of the quarter OpEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When looking at the long-term investment, some of them goes into the OpEx and some part of them goes to the cost of goods as we are having an income statement by function. So, previous, the most of the long-term investments that we have talked about last year, they were more effective, the sales organization and the administration thus ending up in an increased investment in OpEx.</p>
          <p>Now, we are in a phase as where we are building up a new design team building up new employees within the buying office and production office and that will affect the cost of goods sold. And when it comes to level as it is a long-term investment and this will continue during the coming quarters during this year. But exactly how the effect will be between the different quarters that will, of course, vary but they will be on a higher level this year that compared to last year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>That's &#x2013; if we're talking as a share, that will, of course, be dependent on the turnover development as well. But if we are looking at the absolute...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Could you just talk a little bit about the collections that you've launched recently particularly in terms of you've obviously had Versace Phase 2 and Beckham as to whether those would've had a material impact in the quarter in terms of either your cost or your margins? And how big is Beckham Bodywear in terms of the number of products or range or anything like that just to get a handle on it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I must say we are very happy with the &#x2013; first of all, the Versace sold out very quickly and then we have the &#x2013; we launched the David Beckham which is different because it's going to last for at least two years. And it &#x2013; we're looking forward to new product drops that we will see. But all in all in the big assortment that we have, the broad collections, it's not material, of course, not when it comes to profitability or the volumes or anything. And when it comes to quantify the collection, we will not do that, of course.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And there's no material impact on cost given that obviously there's a lot of &#x2013; there's been a lot of noise around those two and obviously presumably some of the Marni costs would've fed into the quarter as well, I assume?</p>

We will talk about increased investments in &#x2013; also in the OpEx and the IT online and marketing, and I mean already last year, we saw an increase in marketing and I mean, this year &#x2013; this quarter has been very &#x2013; in terms with the Beckham and the Super Bowl, of course, which has been very appreciated and talked about not just in the U.S. but worldwide. But &#x2013; I mean it's part of that but not the only reason.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Sorry, I have a follow-up. In terms of the CapEx, seasonal you have announced the creation of a new brand. What does this &#x2013; how does this impact your CapEx for this year, for fiscal year 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, these investments will fit in in the CapEx estimation as we have given in the beginning of the year. That is somewhere between SEK5.5 billion up to SEK6 billion. So, that's still our best estimate for the total CapEx for this financial year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions. Firstly, I realized you don't want to say too much about the new business you're starting. But can you at least confirm that it is clothing rather than something like house wares, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, sorry. We will &#x2013; when we know more, we will come back to you. When we have more to say, we will come back to you. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you're not prepared to confirm it's clothing, okay. And secondly, are you now happy with your customer proposition because obviously your new ranges are being taken well and your sales are very strong at the moment. Does that mean you have invested enough you think? I mean I appreciate you've got investments for the future in terms of more staff and buying functions and so on, but are you happy with your &#x2013; the quality and the price positioning you're offering your customers now in your stores given the investments you've made over the last 18 months or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're happy in the sense that our customers are happy but we will never be satisfied because we will always strive to improve things and then we have a very long-term view as I said before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; I mean that suggests that the gross &#x2013; well, okay. No, fine, I'll leave it there. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>... hello, there. You may have answered my question already. I had a technical glitch. But it's regarding the sourcing environment and I just wanted to confirm that given the evolution of cotton prices, Q1 is likely to be the worst of it in terms of the sourcing environment that you're actually seeing in the gross margin and that it should improve from Q2 onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Did I hear the answer right that you said that the largest single effect affecting the gross margin in Q1 was the discounts of 90 basis points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, cost inflation did not exceed that or positive effects either?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. When we're talking about the sourcing &#x2013; increased sourcing cost, then we are netting the negative factors from increased cotton prices but there is also a positive U.S. dollar effect. So...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then it's the net effect is smaller than the 90 basis point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But most likely the &#x2013; excluding the FX effects, cost inflation should be larger?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
