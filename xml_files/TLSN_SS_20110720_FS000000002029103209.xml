          <p>Okay. Good morning and welcome, everyone, to a sunny Stockholm. We are here, of course, to present our Second Quarter Report. My name is Andreas Ekstr&#xF6;m, Head of Investor Relation.</p>
          <p>We will follow the normal procedures. We will start with a presentation from our President and CEO, Mr. Lars Nyberg, followed by a review on the financials by our CFO, Mr. Per-Arne Blomquist. After that, we will take some questions both here from the floor and also from the conference call.</p>
          <p>With that, I will leave the floor to Lars Nyberg.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. Welcome. I thought we had a decent quarter. I hope you agree with that. Looking at the big numbers; net sales, I think that's maybe the thing we are &#x2013; well, there are two things we're very happy about. This is certainly one, that we had growth of 3% in local currency.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the currency is headwind on all lines, but we have now for several years talked about the local currency, and that's sort of the underlying performance of the business. And I'm pretty happy with 3% and that's also to jump to the last slide, is why we don't change the outlook that we presented a quarter ago.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA increased. The percentage increased again. It was 1.2 percentage points, and I'll come back to this. And because of &#x2013; mainly because of the currency, the earnings per share is down from SEK1.17 to SEK0.89. It is mainly currency, but it's not only currency. It's also the performance of the associated company, Turkcell.</p>
          <p>TeliaSonera is the biggest owner in Turkcell, Turkcell being historically an icon in Turkish business. However, in the last four or five years, it has lost its way by what I would call mediocre performance. This picture shows the development of the EBITDA margins for the last couple of years. Ultimately, the responsibility for this performance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors in Turkcell. The Turkcell Board has been in deadlock for more than a year now as the only so-called Independent Director, the Chairman of the Board, Mr. Colin Williams, has chosen to side with &#xC7;ukurova, who owns less than 13% of Turkcell.</p>
          <p>To me, it's amazing that Mr. Williams, an English citizen brought up in the Anglo-Saxon governance model, refuses us, the biggest shareholder in Turkcell, to bring the issue of who sits on the board to the general shareholder meeting. For this, we have sued him. Over the past 10 years, in Turkey, significant reforms have been introduced, which has made the country actually prosper. It's a great country and a great market to be in, I think, over time. And also, all these reforms also encouraged foreign investors.</p>
          <p>So, we put, at TeliaSonera, we put the trust that the Turkish authorities sees the mismanagement and gives us and other shareholders the possibility to bring back Turkcell to former glory and not allow people continue playing games that belong in the past. Another year of the current situation will destroy Turkcell, and therefore, it's time for the authorities to step up. That's the only thing I'm going to say about Turkcell.</p>
          <p>This is actually the same picture, but this time the curve goes the other way, because this is TeliaSonera. I'm particularly proud of the rolling four quarters EBITDA margin development for the last four years. We are now 35.2% and this is a result mainly of the cost-cutting, having a decent growth rate, and working very hard on the gross margins. Those are the three drivers of this, I think, pretty impressive development.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I think we should be honest to say, we also have the benefit of operating in nice markets. We are not an operator in Greece. We are not in Italy. We are not in Ireland. We are not in Portugal. We are in Spain and we are doing very well in Spain, but as you can see, where we are that's where you expect GDP growth in the upper quartile in Europe. So that's, of course, helps us.</p>
          <p>What drove the growth this quarter? Mobility Sweden continues to grow: Kcell in Kazakhstan, nearly 20%; Ncell in Nepal, 100%; and 43% in Yoigo, Spain. These are the main drivers for our growth this quarter.</p>
          <p>This is amazing. We've had now 18 quarters of growth in Mobility Sweden. I think I have told you before, I have predicted it will stop and I have said I've been wrong every quarter, and I continue to be wrong. I do think, however, we cannot assume that this is going to go on forever, but it's really impressive, 18 quarters.</p>
          <p>Kcell, we are now the leader in Kcell or in Kazakhstan in 3G. We have launched now 1,000 3G sites and we have 4 million data users. This is a real opportunity in this part of the world and I'll come back to that in a minute.</p>
          <p>We entered Nepal a couple of years ago. We have now more than 5 million subscribers; 5.4 million subscribers. We are the number one. There are only two operators; the incumbent, we have now surpassed the incumbent when it comes to the GSM. Very happy with the performance in Nepal.</p>
          <p>And, of course, Yoigo, the ugly duck for many years, I think, takes step-by-step proving its performance. And you noticed maybe that we did acquire a license for the 1,800 megahertz, which certainly indicates that we are serious about playing in the second half, as I use the expression, about the plan for Spain.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we did this. This turned out to be, I think, a very great thing internally. I think it also was very positive externally, but the purpose was, mainly internally, to unite 18 companies or something like that, to try to start becoming one company with one set of values and the same way of working. And I'm very happy with the execution of the branding activity and the result of it and the response from the 30,000 employees. I was actually personally in Farsta. I have never seen Farsta rock and roll that way. They were truly happy about it.</p>
          <p>One of the benefits of the branding campaign, we were very clear on the must-be-tangible benefits for our customers if we're going to do a branding campaign. Who cares what the color is? Well, we care, and I think maybe you care, but you can't expect the customers to be that excited unless there are some tangible benefits. So, we decided to do something we maybe should have done a long time ago, we decided to do &#x2013; lower the data roaming prices in the Nordic and the Baltics by more than 90%. And this is a really interesting discussion, because a lot of people in our company were very nervous and said, "We shouldn't do, it costs us too much money." And I said, "I'm not sure it's going to cost us anything in the end."</p>
          <p>Because I stand at the Arlanda Airport waiting for the plane to Helsinki or Copenhagen or where I'm going, and I hear everybody in front of me and everybody behind me say, "Turn off your roaming, it's too expensive." And that's exactly what people do. And we are a telecom operator, we want people to turn on their phones, not turn them off. So, what happened is, we lowered the prices to SEK29 for one day and then one higher, SEK49, I believe it is. And you can see what happened on this drop, 200% growth in the quarter, international roaming, in these countries.</p>
          <p>I am convinced that this will continue, and I am convinced that it will cost us nothing. You can take a parallel, which we've also have been doing. If you look what a voice minute in Sweden costed 10 years ago, it costed about 10 times as much as it costs today. Do we make more money now or did we make more money then, when we had it at 10 times higher price? The answer is, we make more money now because of the volume. This is a volume industry.</p>
          <p>So, I think the data roaming volumes will also grow, and therefore, we'll make more money, not less. However, we've talked about this several times before. The whole industry will have to rebalance the pricing models within Mobility. Not only Telia, everyone has to do it because the financial reality, as we call it, is that 80% of the invoice is for voice, while the traffic for voice is only 20% and 80% is for data, which means that we have to change the pricing model. Prices or cost for voice will go down. I would even predict &#x2013; you know I've been a strong opponent of flat fees for data, and I think everybody has realized in the industry that flat fees for data is impossible.</p>
          <p>I will now make a prediction; we will have flat fees for voice. That will be flat fees for voice; it will take a couple of years. But we have to distinguish the fee for data on volume, speed, and quality. I, together with several of my colleagues in the industry, <mark type="ph" /> Wasted Brussel and Neelie Kroes (10:42) last week and we argued exactly these things, and I think there is a degree of understanding, very exciting.</p>
          <p>Yes, the data opportunity in Eurasia is the next growth engine in Eurasia. Voice will continue to grow in Eurasia, but data is the next one. And if you take Russia as a proxy, on the bottom right-hand corner, we have shown you the value-added service as a percentage of total revenue and the gray things there are for Beeline, MTS, and Megaphone, only Russia.</p>
          <p>So, the penetration of value added service is much higher in Russia than in Eurasia. That's the opportunity. I am convinced that mobile data will be a huge thing in Eurasia, also because they lack a good fixed network. They don't have that alternative to the same extent that we have here.</p>
          <p>Finally, I believe, I said it many times, the appetite for bandwidth is unlimited and the best way to provide that unlimited demand to fix locations like homes and offices is via the fixed network via fiber.</p>
          <p>We are convinced on that. We are committed to roll out fiber. We have got the regulation in Sweden that we can live with. So, we are rolling out something like SEK5 billion of fiber this year in Sweden and an additional SEK3 billion in the rest in this area and we will continue for a number of years, and I also find that this is very exciting.</p>
          <p>Now, as I said, we didn't change the outlook, so there's no news there. And I think I'll hand over to Per-Arne and then we'll take your questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. I would even claim that it's not just a decent quarter, I think it's a very solid quarter. Of course, you can see this from different angles. The underlying business in our majority-owned companies are performing very well. We are, however, impacted by two items here. First of all, as Lars just mentioned, the associates, and also the currencies.</p>
          <p>Today, if you look at the result, we have roughly minus 6% on impact in the quarter on FX. This has been the problem for the last, I would say, four or five quarters. We have had a very high volatility also during these times. I assume, and I'm not especially <mark type="ph" /> from FX (13:31), but I assume that if we keep at the level that we are today, especially when it comes to the euro, we will have less and less of the impact from FX the coming two quarters. It will level out at the end of the year, given that this keeps sort of the same level as we have today.</p>
          <p>Underlying performance, strong. What I think is especially good this quarter is that we continued to have a broad growth. If you take Mobility, it's not only Spain and Sweden; we could also see growth in the Baltics. We have also seen improvement in Norway. I would say that from the market perspective, I think that Norway and Denmark has improved. Finland is still a tough market. But as I said, we have seen broader growth, which I think is good for us.</p>
          <p>If we take Eurasia, continue to have very, very good growth, especially Nepal, with more than 100% in growth in this quarter. And in addition to this, I think the strength is that we actually also increased our EBITDA margin. And we do that also in the business area, Broadband, where we they have a decline of close to 7%. So, that's what I mean with a solid result.</p>
          <p>This is built up from a couple of different things. First of all, if you recall the Capital Markets Day, we talked about functional cost. We are looking at costs from different angles, and one angle is to make sure that the production cost is as low as possible. That helps us to improve our gross margin, which we have continued now to do for a couple of quarters.</p>
          <p>Even though we are, which I'll come back, are a bit, sort of, not this important, but we have taken actions to make sure that our cost side will improve even more. We have had a rather stable cost development over time. And if you take what we call the addressable cost base, the OpEx, it's more or less in relation to sales the same this quarter as it was four quarters ago, even though their costs are increasing to 3.5%.</p>
          <p>We have a bit of concern that the cost development has grown and the OpEx development, I will <mark type="ph" /> grow to (15:56) say, has grown a bit quicker than we have had on the top line, and that was the reason why we initiated certain efficiency measurements at the beginning of this year.</p>
          <p>We also started with our multi-market operation and cross border activities to make sure that we could mitigate cost increases. We have now done the efficiency measurements that we have talked about. That means roughly 550 people in Sweden and 170 in Finland and the effects of this will definitely be visible in the second part of this year.</p>
          <p>So, if you look at outlook and, I mean, you're good in calculating the numbers, you will see that we will have very minor cost increases during the second half of this year. And we expect to grow, more or less, at the same rate as we have done at the first half year.</p>
          <p>Lars showed it, but I think it's worthwhile actually showing once again. It is a good development. The work we have done with the cost during the last, I would say, 14, 15,16 quarters has gained result, and we are improving our EBITDA margin quarter-on-quarter. And we have done that now for 11 quarters in a row, which I think is very, very good.</p>
          <p>However, we are concerned by the result development in the associates. It's not only one issue that creates a weak result in Turkcell. We have three different issues. First of all, one-off items which is connected to Belarus, and the devaluation in Belarus.</p>
          <p>We have an underlying performance which is weak, unexpected. And we also have an FX effect from the Turkish lira, which means that if you look at associate results today, the contribution from Turkcell is more or less zero in this quarter.</p>
          <p>And that, of course, also impact our EPS. As I said at the beginning, it's a solid result from the majority-owned companies. They're actually contributing SEK9 to the EPS. Meanwhile, the associates are sort of declining with SEK18. That, in combination with the FX side, takes down the EPS with SEK30 in this quarter. We have also the one-time charges nonrecurring, which will not come back during the coming quarters. Meanwhile, FX will continue to impact us, but as I said in the beginning, I hope to a minor &#x2013; or less extent than we have seen during the first half-year.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in our business, and you could see right now that we are close to 50% in CapEx-to-sales, including licenses and spectrum fees. Underlying, 13.4, which has been well in line with what we have said in our outlook. And we're happy with what we have this year been able to start to invest from the first quarter, not waiting, as we have done a couple of years before. We have had sort of been full speed already from the Q1, which I think is good for the business. And we are very focused on making the right investment, both when it comes to 4G and also the fiber rollout in the Nordics.</p>
          <p>However, the licenses that we have paid out and also the higher, you could say, CapEx that we have, the cash CapEx that we have within the different business areas, had lowered our free cash flow down to SEK1.4 billion. We also have a delay in Turkcell, which I think that the dividend will come at some point in time. For me, this is more a political issue, and I'm not so worried about that. But, overall, I would expect the cash flow to be strong here in the second half-year. We have taken quite a lot of cost value in the first year, which had hit our cash flow. But what I see today, I will say that the cash flow looks pretty solid also for the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Given our payout, both when it comes to dividends and also buybacks, we paid out more than SEK22 billion in this quarter. And that means that our net debt to EBITDA has increased up to 1.8, close to 1.9. We'll also come down during the rest of this year. Still, we are in the range that we have talked about, 1.5 up to 2 in net debt to EBITDA.</p>
          <p>Very pleased with our debt maturity schedule. As you can see, it's a rather even spread. We have also done more on long maturities. It is a tough market right now, if you are depending on the Eurobond market. We still have access to the market when we want, but we are opportunistic and we take the opportunities when we have them. And as you can see, in the short-term perspective, we do not have any larger refunding needs, which I'm very happy with. So, we could take the opportunity when it fits our needs and not being pressed into a very, very tough market.</p>
          <p>So, concluding, improving trend when it comes to net sales growth, as Lars said, 18 quarters in a row in Mobility Sweden of growth. We could see that Ncell now had become the market leader. Yoigo is actually reaching the 5% market share. We continue to improve our EBITDA margin, 11 quarters in a row. And we will see effects from our cost-efficiency measurements in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>We are exposed to markets with good and high GDP growth. And if we take a look now at the Baltics in this discussion, it's good to see that they are growing, but you could also now see, as I mentioned at the beginning, that our companies are now gaining a certain momentum that we haven't seen before. And I hope that we could say that this is a trend shift going forward.</p>
          <p>With an unchanged outlook, we're going for Q&amp;A.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Per-Arne. I will invite Lars. He's already here, and back to the podium. And we will take a couple of questions here from the floor. And we will start with Stefan. Please introduce yourself with your company name as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Stefan Gauffin, Nordea. I have a couple of questions, and I'm sorry to focus on slightly on the negative side. I would like to start with Eurasia development. Although still really strong organic growth but it was slightly below, at least, my expectations, and there are two markets I would like to focus on. First of all, Kazakhstan, you mentioned a price cap explaining the development. I would also like to hear if you have seen any impact from the launch of Tele2?</p>
          <p>Secondly, also the development in Uzbekistan, why the sales organic growth came down a little bit in that market. I would also like to talk a little bit around the Wholesale division, which, again, reported weak performance, if you could talk about the development there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I start, maybe, Arne wants to add something. The good news is, you were maybe a little bit surprised, but we were not. So, this was actually predicted by the management of Eurasia. So, I think they are very much in control over the business. And there are different reasons; there are price caps, and the ARPU in Uzbekistan is low, et cetera. And I'm not worried at all.</p>
          <p>I think this will continue to be our growth engine. We don't make predictions for what growth numbers we are going to have by business area, but what we got this quarter was exactly what we expected to get. And I think I feel pretty good of what we expect to get in the third and the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We haven't seen any impact of Tele2 yet in Kazakhstan. I'm sure we will one day. The question is not only what kind of &#x2013; or what number of subscribers you have. It's also a question of, who are they? You can ask people who operate in India. There's a big difference between certain customers and other customers. ARPU is sort of pretty important. We'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we take the wholesale business down there, I think it contains two different parts. First, you have the international carrier, where we have deliberately taken down the top line, and that's still the case, but where we actually increased our profitability. I think we have now to double or perhaps triple the result of what we have seen in the last year.</p>
          <p>But then we also have the domestic wholesale, and of course, they are affected by that. Our competitors are using <mark type="ph" /> Centrific's (25:24) network to less extent. I mean, we have had a drop in <mark type="ph" /> PST (25:29) and that's affecting the wholesale business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I'm allowed to elaborate a little bit on the Eurasian business. If we start with Kazakhstan, there are two things from a regulatory side impacting. You mentioned yourself the price cap or retail tariffs that were introduced in mid-May. There's also a second one, and that is the move to push second billing that came, I think it was mid-March, that also had an impact. In total, I'm allowed to say by the management that, that took away some 5% to 6% of the revenue growth versus the previous quarter. So, that had an impact.</p>
          <p>In Uzbekistan it was, I think, during the quarter where local or private entrepreneurs were forbidden to sell subscription for a period of time. And you can see that our subscription intake was lower this quarter than in previous quarter, and that is now removed or revoked. So things are back to normal in Uzbekistan, which we'll see the benefit of coming quarters.</p>

And therefore, we have to accept that the responsibility lies with the Board of Directors. And that's why I'm focusing on what kind of Board of Directors should we have, what should they be focused on, and I should not stand here, or anywhere, by the way, and start telling people in Turkcell what they should do. That's not my role, that's not my responsibility either. But I'm just not happy with the performance.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Lars S&#xF6;derfjell, &#xC5;landsbanken. I'll stay on the subject of associated companies. MegaFon, there were some one-offs, there were some currency impact, but could you give any comment about the underlying trends that you see in the Russian market and for MegaFon in particular? And perhaps also share if there's any progress whatsoever in the discussions about the ownership situation there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, the ownership situation, we've said all along, we'll focus on Turkey first. I think that's the most important. I think, in a way, both the most complex but also the easiest, so to say. So, we'll focus on Turkey. So, well, I don't have anything to report on MegaFon. I think, contrary to Turkcell, I think if you go back four years, the performance of MegaFon is spectacular. I think they've done a really good job.</p>
          <p>And the fact that, supported by the Board of Directors, they decided to take the leadership position in mobile data, was a very smart move. You could see on my page, I don't know if you've observed it, but they have the highest share of mobile data in Russia and they were the number three players up till, what is it now, a year ago, they became the number two player, so. And the Russian economy is helping the business, of course. It didn't do that a couple of years ago. I'm very pleased with the performance of MegaFon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, what I am aiming at is basically, you don't see a risk right now that you could see the same type of deterioration in margins as you have seen in Turkey? I mean, the underlying trends are positive?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think they're positive. I think, if you want to be fair, maybe I should add that, if you look at the EBITDA margin deterioration in Turkey, it's not wholly-owned, done by the company. It's also the regulator has been very tough. But part of it belongs to internal reasons. I don't foresee that kind of activity in Russia. We have three strong competitors, plus a fourth or a fifth. I think the competition is pretty fierce in Russia. I don't foresee the regulator to do anything like they did in Turkey. Don't forget, Turkcell had something like 60%-plus market share. That normally indicates that the regulator will come soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they also have the Russian business. I mean, they still have double-digit top-line growth. I mean, they <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:55) when they integrated the retail change, but I think it's more stabilized right now. And I think they're doing a good job there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which brings me now to the second question now about duration margins. I mean, we saw some actions from regulators putting some tariff caps in and so, on into place. Going forward and looking at the margin levels are, I mean, pretty good right now, I have to say, 52% almost. What do you think is the risk that margins will start to drop in the years, quarters to come, down to, say, levels similar to what we see in Europe for, say, Prepaid business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Per-Arne said on the Capital Markets Day, that over time, the margins will come down, and they probably will come down below 40%, maybe not down to 30%. And I think we'll make it up in volume. Again, I think we'll make it up in volume. How fast will they come down? I don't know. I don't think it's going to happen next quarter. But if you take five years from now, the margins will be lower, that's for sure.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Lars. We have tons of questions from the conference call. So, please, operator, can I have the first question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Peter Nielsen from Cheuvreux. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, as announced at the Investor Day last, you're moving, or at least there's ambition to move from all your &#x2013; from six network operations in the Nordic, Baltic countries on the mobile side into one by the end of this year. Is this on track? Is this still your target, to have this completed by the end of 2011?</p>
          <p>And then my second question, when would you be prepared to give us a bit more information operationally and technically and financially, on the network sharing agreement with Telenor in Denmark? And thirdly, just a question for Per-Arne. Again, in this quarter, we are seeing a large negative adjustment on the working capital side and the free cash flow of more than SEK1 billion, which seems to be a recurring item now. Could you elaborate a bit on why that is, Per-Arne? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we haven't changed our ambitions. It was only three weeks ago, I believe, or four weeks ago we had that meeting, so we don't change goals that easy. On the Danish, I think it's important that you understand, we didn't do the networking cooperation with Telenor in Denmark to immediately save a lot of OpEx, or immediately save a lot of CapEx. I think it's more over the longer term, to ensure we have a better quality in the network at the same or lower CapEx. So, it's actually future CapEx to improve quality that we are saving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to working capital, for me, it's very much a question of phasing. I mean, the working capital contains basically all the accounts receivable and accounts payable. And given the huge volumes that we are working with, you could have one or two days could mean quite a lot in this. And it's more or less the same negative amount this year as we had last year at the same time. So, for me, it's more a question of timing than anything else.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. At the Capital Markets Day, you made a point about EU regulation, and you made the point for the EU perhaps looking &#x2013; needing to ease the regulatory burden and perhaps the high termination rates. It appears they've listened with the announcements we saw last week. Just curious to get your reaction, Lars, in terms of what was announced, especially regarding the potentially more hands-off approach taken by the EU towards the free-riding over-the-top players? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think I have an answer that is sort of two sentences, and it makes everything crystal clear. I think there is an openness in Brussels, an understanding that, if we are going to be able to deliver on the objectives set by the commissioner, Neelie Kroes, that everybody in EU should have either 30-megabit-per-second or 100-megabit-per-second broadband connection by 2020. If that's going to happen, somebody has to put up something like &#x20AC;200 billion. And if somebody's going to put up &#x20AC;200 billion, that somebody would like to have a return on that money.</p>
          <p>That's what's been our argument. And, of course, over-the-top players cannot have a free ride. Somebody has to pay, and I argue that, in Brussels, that the consumer will have to pay for volume, for speed, for quality. But I also think there is a possibility that we could have what we call a two-sided business model, whereby some suppliers of apps could also pay.</p>
          <p>I'll try to explain what I mean by that. Take for a second the thought that you are a supplier of a gaming app. Latency times are very important in gaming. So if you are supplying this gaming thing online, maybe you would like to ensure that your customers, the consumer who plays, has the best quality to ensure you can really enjoy this game.</p>
          <p>I could even envision some playing companies saying, "I will pay for latency at the best quality." Like a 1-800 number, I want a number, anybody can call me. Fee is short for them, I'll pay for it. There's no doubt in my mind that absolutely the majority of the revenues who is paying for this is going to be the end user, there's no discussion about it. And I think there is an understanding in Brussels that: one, there's a lot of money to be invested; two, there must be a convincing business case; three, somebody has to pay and it is most likely the majority is paid by the end user. That's where we are with Brussels, I think.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, that's great. One quick follow-up; on Turkcell &#x2013; sorry to come back to it, but if you don't get the agenda item added, in terms of increasing the number of independents, what options are open to you? And then how strongly will you put &#x2013; you made the point that you expect the dividend to come. That's obviously something which is in your gift.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will not speculate what I will do when something that will happen won't happen. I just assume it will happen. It has to happen. This is the icon of Turkey and it would &#x2013; it's not us actually. It's the capital markets board, the SEC of Turkey, who has been asking for years to increase the number of independent directors at Turkcell. And we have been saying, yes, absolutely, until Kroes said absolutely not.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's time for the authorities to show who decides these things. 35% is float in Turkcell. That's their argument. They think there should be more than one independent director, especially if the so-called independent isn't independent anymore. So, I just assume it will happen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Two sort of short questions, please. The first one is following up to Stefan's initial question on the wholesale fixed business. So, just to clarify, have you changed cost allocations between the wholesale and the retail business, or in the transfer pricing between the wholesale and the domestic retail business in any way?</p>
          <p>The second question regards Norway. You had a very good EBITDA result there with a good margin. You're commenting in the report that the competitors &#x2013; you're seeing signs of competitive situation stabilizing. Now, my question is, is the result we're seeing in the quarter already a manifestation of the stabilizing competitive situation, or is that something you observed only towards the end of the quarter and you would expect trends to improve in the second half, beyond what we've seen in the second quarter? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll cover that question about Norway. What I said was that we are &#x2013; I think we're seeing a better situation in both Denmark and Norway that we have seen before. How long that will last, you never know. It depends on what happens with our competitors. But for the time being, it's good to see sort of the development in Denmark and Norway. Then when it comes to cost allocation...</p>

      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Andy Parnis from UBS. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, guys. It's Andy Parnis at UBS. Just two questions, one of which is a follow-up. The first one though is on Swedish Mobile. It looks like the strong performance in Swedish Mobile was primarily due to actually growing voice revenue. I think on one of the slides, slide seven, this is up 2%. How long do you think you could continue to grow voice revenues in Sweden, because it looks like that's really the main driver of the strong growth, rather than sort of higher data growth than some of the other European markets?</p>
          <p>And second question was just sort of a follow-up on Maurice's question. In terms of your &#x2013; looking at sort of a two-sided pricing model, have you had any conversations yet with any of the suppliers of apps, with them actually paying for quality over your network? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the last one. No, no, no. I showed a slide here that we really have to change the pricing model and it's still a conceptual discussion. I think everybody understands the direction we're going. We're not ready to implement all these things and certainly not the two-sided model. I think the most important thing that we need to get an agreement on and understanding from everybody is, mobile prices will be not flat. They will be differentiated by volume, by speed, and by quality.</p>
          <p>And I think we are slowly getting that kind of acceptance in the total industry, and that's more important than whether it's two-sided or one-sided. And even if it's two-sided, I said before and I want to underline that, it is the end-user who's going to pay the majority of the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the voice business in Mobility, yes, you're right, 2% growth, and of course that helps the growth for the whole Swedish operations, given that more than 50% is voice. It's difficult to predict how long that will go on, but as long as we have a transition from fixed into Mobility, I think that will be a help. And then it's just a question of how we could keep up the price levels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Barry Zeitoune from Berenberg here. Just two questions, please. The first is Spain. We've seen increased competition over the quarter. Yet at the same time, your churn has come down, and your net additions have continued along a good path. Do you feel that there isn't any need to respond in pricing to your competitors? And is your current price differential enough to keep growing at the current pace?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, looking at your broadband, I'm just wondering what the initial uptake is from SDU to your fiber to the home proposition? And then, also extrapolating that, given a big chunk of the SEK5 billion fiber spend that we expect in Sweden over the coming years is to do with SDUs, do you think the current revenue and margin estimates are taking the upfront payments from those SDUs properly into account? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Spain. When we were confronted with the moves by the competitors, we and the local management there took a decision that we thought we could handle that without moving our prices. And you just confirmed that that is exactly what happened in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We will continue to monitor this. I believe that Yoigo has an extremely strong brand name in this segment of the market. And we will be cautious, if need be, of course we can, because we have a very light cost structure in Spain, so we are very flexible. But, as I said, if need be; we'll see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now when it comes to the fiber. I mean, the uptake that I think is necessary and that we see right now is roughly 20% to 25%, that <mark type="ph" /> to me is (43:48) initial phase. And yes, I mean, what's in the estimates that people take to the upfront payment into account, I don't really know, but it's a pretty big range. We said that we ask roughly between &#x20AC;1,500 up to &#x20AC;2,500 for an upfront payment. And, of course, if you could get that, then, I think, the pressure on the cash flow is, of course, much less than if you go for end use.</p>

          <p>Yes, Stefan Gauffin, Nordea. Just to follow up on that question regarding the upfront payment. How will that be booked in the profit and loss statement? How would that &#x2013; would that be in the wholesale division and will you take the total upfront fee?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, first of all, yes, it would be taken &#x2013; I suppose it will be taking the wholesale division. And then it's &#x2013; I don't know if it's <mark type="ph" /> a little less spreading (45:18) at all out of the time or the contract period. Otherwise, you will have enormous impact on the results.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. First, the one question on Sweden. And I see that handset sales have picked up this quarter after probably a weak quarter last in Q1. I was going to check, is this mainly from Tele2 being less aggressive or have you also increased on some promotions in the quarter?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on Denmark, I know that your service revenue has worsened somewhat to minus 12%, offset by very strong handset revenues. And I was just wondering if you can explain a bit more detail on the dynamic going on this market with this shift in the service revenue impact.</p>
          <p>And also, I mean, you mentioned stabilizing prices. Yet TDC did cut prices quite aggressively only two weeks ago, and just sort of clarify that you don't see that as a big impact or a risk to your pricing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take both of those questions, starting with the handset in Sweden. I think that we were quite clear on that on the Investor Day some three weeks ago that the equipment sales would pick up this quarter and it was more due to availability of handsets that dragged us down a bit in the first quarter. Now we got the availability that we wanted in the second quarter and that's where you can see the improvement.</p>
          <p>On Denmark, we are aware of the price cut that we have seen from both Telenor and recently also TDC. But we feel on the margin that things are a bit more positive. We have a number of events in the second quarter in the Danish market. The acquisition of Onfone, for example, our network JV that we announced with Telenor. And we have also scaled back subsidies in our own channels. So, on the margin, we feel that the Danish market is improving a bit, although it's probably the worst of our markets when it comes to price competition. And the question is if prices can come down very much further from the low levels that we are already.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. I was wondering a little bit on, first of all, revenue growth, I think you had 2.8% local currency for the first half of the year, and you reiterate your guidance of 3%, you're very close to that. But at the same time, you have tougher year-over-year comps in the second half of the year. So I was just wondering, I mean, you've said that you are more confident on the Baltics, but what other areas do you see sort of better growth in for the second half of the year to be able to reach the 3%?</p>
          <p>And then also finally on Swedish mobile, did you say something about the equipment sales growth. You say that it's higher this quarter and that you see that also in the chart that you've provided. I was wondering sort of how much of the 6% is equipment sales? And then also finally on cost cutting, I mean, my understanding is that the vast majority of the people were laid off already at the end of April, so how much of a full run rate could we expect already in the third quarter on the cost cutting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First off, the last one. No, they weren't laid off in April. I mean, the effects will come out from July and onwards, so we have not had any effect on that in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I think you announced them. I mean, they were announced or whatever in the end of April and you should have the effects, most of it in Q3, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And will you have a full effect in Q3 or how much of a full effect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, then we will have the effect, because we have taken the charge now in Q2...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there was a question on handset sales in Sweden. I think that that was about 1 percentage point on the growth rate in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you asked about the comps. It will be tougher comps for the second half year, you're right. But I also hope that &#x2013; I mean, as I said, the broader growth in Mobility could help. And I would also expect that the International Carrier, which started to take down their top line, I think it was in Q4 last year, will also help a bit, because that's what's actually affecting very much the broadband business.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Jakob Bluestone from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I've got two questions. Firstly, just returning to the wholesale division, given the deterioration in the business and the sharply negative revenues and EBITDA, do you think this makes the <mark type="ph" /> expose them (50:11) more likely or less likely, given the comments that you made at the Investor Day that you were potentially doing a sale of the asset?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, there have been some press reports about MegaFon making further large fixed-line acquisitions in Russia. And I was just wondering, what's your thinking about that as a shareholder. Is that something you support?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First off, with the wholesale business then, as I said at the beginning, it contains of two different parts. You have the domestic business and the International Carrier. And International Carrier has actually &#x2013; even though they have taken down their top line, they are earning more money today, which I think is the right way to do this. And then we will see what is happening with this business during the coming half year. And of course, we will look at that as we are looking at all other businesses as well, from a strategic perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to paint with some numbers there because, Carrier, the business is down 20% on revenues. At the same time, the EBITDA margin is up from 2% to 6%. So, the management is doing exactly what we have requested for them to scale down revenues and focus on high-margin business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the MegaFon issue, more general, I think the fixed network is a crucial asset for a telecom operator for the reasons I have stated even in this meeting. Whether we support that in MegaFon or not, that's something for my two colleagues who sits on the board to discuss with the board, because it's a board decision. It's not our decision. And I don't want to make our positions or opinions public on that level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We do have another Swedish operator with a press conference later today. So, we have about 10 minutes maximum to finish this, but we will continue with some questions on the conference call. Operator, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Two questions left. Firstly, on Swedish fixed, just to check if there is any news from the Swedish regulator on fiber regulation? And more specifically, do we know by now if PTS is going for <mark type="ph" /> x anti-cost plus or x plus three term minus (52:28) regulation?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just a update on your M&amp;A policy and shareholder return, any news there now as you went away from the Polkomtel deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We have information or decision from PTS. I don't know exactly which methodology they used. For me, it's the most important is that we can live with the regulation. We think that it will give us a chance to have a return on our investment in fiber when we allow colleagues or customers, competitors, pick your word, to use our network. They will have to pay an amount of money that allow us to return an interest and return to our shareholders. So, yes, that concern is pushed aside a little bit. We'll watch it, continue to watch it, but now, we go full speed ahead with the roll-out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On accounts to the favorable returns, I mean, our policy remains. We have said that we should return at least 50% of our net profit. If we have excess cash, we will return it, which we actually did just two months ago, SEK10 billion extra. And now, we have a net debt to EBITDA of SEK1.9 billion and the range would be somewhere between SEK1.5 billion up to SEK2 billion. We did not start to talk about returns yet. I mean, we will see what happens with the development both in the market, the debt market and also in our industry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you also talked about merger and acquisitions and the policy, the prime target is, continues to be that we would like to increase our ownership in core holdings. That's the first priority we have. Then we will look at neighboring market and in-market consolidation. Those kinds of things we are always interested to look at. We are pretty prudent and careful, so we'll let a few things pass and maybe someday, we'll buy something.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dominik. There is a slide actually on the Investor Day Presentation where you can see the regulation from PTS and where we highlight the positives and the negatives in our view from that decision. I think it's Slide Number 25, if you go back to that material.</p>
          <p>Okay, we'll take another question from the conference call.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of points, just clarification. Firstly, just returning to the Wholesale division, given your comments on how you're hoping for a recovery in the international wholesale unit in H2, can you just clarify and remind us when that business really entered the double-digit decline phase, just so we know when to annualize it and how we can think about that division into H2?</p>
          <p>Secondly on MegaFon, you've mentioned in the press release the inventory write-down that you suffered in this period. Can you just tell us how much that is and what it relates to, just so we can see what the underlying contribution is?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, on the Sweden mobile margin, clearly a very strong performance in this quarter. I guess just looking for a bit of granularity on what cost efficiency that's contributed to that and whether you feel there's any sort of read-across that we can apply to what you might be doing in some of your other Nordic markets? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we start with the margin in Mobility, which was close to 45%, if I recall it correctly, a bit on the high side. I don't think that we really expect that to be at that level. They have been around 43%. So, there are sort of different factors now in the second quarter that has made it a bit higher. But I think 43% is what we have seen. When it comes to the International Carrier, I recall, I think we have also &#x2013; later in Q4 or in the middle of Q4 last year, where we started to take down the top line in the International Carrier business.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Just one question, please. Lars, you mentioned in the presentation that you're surprised that mobile keeps growing in your home market. I guess, could you just clarify your expectations for how ARPU develops as you move to flat rate pricing on voice? And also, are we to expect mobile growth to now slow in the second half? Is that what you're expecting? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I'm sort of making a little joke about it, because I don't like to be wrong, but I've been wrong sort of 15 quarters or something like that on Swedish mobile growth. Now, if I'm wrong, I prefer to be wrong this way than the other way. It actually started with me pushing the management to look at cost, because you know when you have growth, if you have a growth of 5%, 6%, it covers up a lot of mistakes or potential mistakes.</p>
          <p>So, I was saying to the management at that time, "Assume you don't get any growth, because it will happen soon. What are you going to do about the cost structure?" And that's how we had the dialogue, and it never happened because the growth continued. And I continued to use my argument. So, I'm not expecting the growth to slow down in the second half.</p>
          <p>We should make clear that it is the voice business growing 2%. That is the big difference between other markets, because a typical market is growing mobile data, but declining in voice, and therefore, the growth is maybe 2% or 1%. We have 2% in voice and data on top of that, and therefore, we get the 5%, 6%, 6.5%, whatever it was. I don't see any signs yet, and as Per-Arne said, the transition from fixed voice to mobile voice supports, of course, the voice business in mobile, but it hurts us, of course, in the broadband side. I don't see any signs of change, but I will continue to argue, we need to look at the cost in mobile.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Going back on the pricing on voice on Sweden, when you look at the KPI on minutes of use, you see 2% growth and you were suggesting recording an increase of revenue of 2%. So, voice pricing is flat in Sweden, is that correct? I'm thinking about mobile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if they're flat as opposed to, I think prices are always down in voice. We'll explain that by volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, last year, if I remember well in Sweden, prices were then only 3% versus minus 10% or 15% on average.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. That is true. That is absolutely true that the price in the Swedish mobile market has been good. And I think we can claim a bit of fame for that, because we are the market leader and as the market leader, you have to act responsibly and put up an umbrella, which we have done. And sometimes, you take a hit for it, but over the longer term, I think it's good for us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="ph" /> our cash has (1:00:24) been very stable in Sweden, even looking at it sequentially quarter-on-quarter, Sweden actually improved slightly in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I simplify a bit. If you take the ARPU divided by minutes of use and look at that compared to last year, you will see that there is a price erosion of about 3%, which is better than in the previous quarters, so &#x2013; but there is always an underlying price pressure in the market.</p>

          <p>Yes, just quickly, I noted, Lars, you made some comments about not really influencing Turkcell and the operations of Turkcell. Do you feel like your boardroom presence has a valid influence over the operation of that business at this particular juncture?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are the biggest owner with 38% of the company. Of course, we should have a couple of board seats and we have very competent people on them. But we have a deadlock between the different owners, that's the problem.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, on that basis, do you think that you have operational influence today through the board?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not really, but I don't think anybody has.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there a case for sort of deconsolidating the asset down to investment level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. No, we're going to do exactly what I said before. We're going to strive for what the CMB has asked for. We need more independent directors on this board, and we certainly need an independent chairman. And if we get there, then we resolve the deadlock. If the deadlock is resolved, we'll get the functioning board and we can start talking about the real issues, which is the performance of the company.</p>

          <p>Very quick question on the <mark type="ph" /> Turkcell (1:02:25) division. Just spoke about the International Carrier division, anything specific on the domestic side?</p>

            <mark type="ph" /> The modem (1:02:38). I think as I said at the beginning, I think it's more that <mark type="ph" /> TSN (1:02:41) is going down, and our competitors are buying less of this. They are less sort of focused on the fixed line.</p>
