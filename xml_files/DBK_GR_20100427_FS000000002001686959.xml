        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Maria. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It's also my pleasure to welcome you to our first quarter earnings conference call. As usual our CFO, Stefan Krause will go through the presentation in the few seconds, which is available on our website. Of course we will take your questions at the end.</p>
          <p>If because of time constraints, you cannot ask all your questions you might have, please come back to investor relations and we will follow-up. Last but not least I would like to remind you to have a look at the slides in the back of the presentation that covers forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>So let's get going, Stefan please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much and Guten Tag from Frankfurt to everybody. Let me start on our first page on the highlights page with the summary of our results. Our quarterly pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;2.8 billion is the second best ever. This resulted in a net income of &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Our pre-tax return on equity of 30% is up on a substantially higher capital base versus the first quarter of 2009. Our Tier-1 capital ratio came out at 11.2%, well above our target of 10% and our leverage ratio, as you can see, is flat at 23 times.</p>
          <p>If we move on, on the next chart we put what we think was the very strong first quarter in its historic context. Once again Deutsche Bank has demonstrated its basic strong earnings power. We have achieved the second best quarter ever in both revenues and pre-tax profit as you can see from the chart.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you saw we recorded strong revenue of 9 billion compared to 7.2 billion in the first quarter of 2009. As you may remember first quarter 2009 revenues included markdowns and impairments of 1.5 billion in CB&amp;S. This compares with only 241 million in markdowns this quarter, which predominantly related to our monoline.</p>
          <p>Revenues in the first quarter 2010 also include 148 million from the first consolidation of Sal. Oppenheim, which resides our consolidated from the 29th of January onward.</p>
          <p>To move on to page six, provision for our credit losses, as you see, almost half to &#x20AC;262 million versus the first quarter of 2009. Provisions related to IAS 39 reclassified asset were &#x20AC;104 million in the first quarter, which represents less than half of the 218 million we had in the quarter of '09.</p>
          <p>I think that this confirms our guidance that obviously the magnitude of IAS 39 reserves booked in 2009 does not represent a trend going forward at that time. And I would like to highlight again that obviously this is a one time may jump and that we might see continuously volatility in this position.</p>
          <p>The core loan books so in CIB which means the loan book excluding these IAS 39 assets experienced very low net provisions in this quarter. Main reason for this number was the successful completion of many restructuring with German mid cap, particularly here in manufacturing and automotive.</p>
          <p>Loan loss provisions in PCAM continued to develop favorable, see the decreasing delinquency ratio in small corporate mortgages and consumer loan was put in the appendix.</p>
          <p>So to give you further outlook obviously despite this encouraging outcome in the first quarter we would be very hesitant at this point extrapolated first quarter into the full year 2010. There are still as you know many market uncertainties as the economy continues to be very fragile the recovery is very fragile and of course we intend to further reduce our IAS 39 assets, but we don't think we should at this time extrapolate our first quarter results to the full year.</p>
          <p>We will therefore not yet change the general guidance that we have given you at the Investor Day at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>We move on to page seven, so you can see that our non-interest expenses of 5.9 billion an increase of 1 billion versus the first quarter of '09 which I'll explain obviously in more detail.</p>
          <p>Compensation and benefits in the first quarter 2010 were up about 600 million which reflects the higher deferred compensation of approximately &#x20AC;350 million of which 298 million relates to the acceleration of deferred expenses. This relates to our early retirement rules that were applicable to the February 2010 grant.</p>
          <p>There was no comparable effects in the first quarter of 2009. &#x20AC;120 million related to the U.K. bonus tax on a portion of the deferred compensation element, which many of our peers as you know have not yet recorded and there will be more to come in terms of U.K. bonus tax in the second and third quarter. With this payment, U.K. tax authorities will be due in August 2010, but we will not clearly quantify the exact amount yet as the legislation is not final.</p>
          <p>And last but no least, obviously the improved business performance resulted in higher compensation accrual.</p>
          <p>So our compensation ratio overall was 40%, excluding the effect of the U.K. payroll tax, it was 38%. The increase in these expenses also related to the consolidation of course of Sal. Oppenheim as you can see on the chart. Non-compensation expenses versus the first quarter 2009 were impacted by an increase in IT and professional services.</p>
          <p>We move on to page eight. Here the cost basis specific first quarter effect and this effect has a much higher magnitude than in previous year. We wanted to provide you this first time disclosure and there will be a one time disclosure, by the way. We just wanted to make sure that you understand this career retirement effect and its &#x2013; has impacted quite a bit the performance or the numbers showed of our different divisions.</p>
          <p>The slide obviously, gives you more details on this career retirement effect and especially shows that by our separate division. As you can see 230 million were allocated to CB&amp;S, 69 million were allocated to our classic banking business, which were impacted more severely in relative terms.</p>
          <p>Furthermore you will notice in this quarter we have already digested nearly 40% of the 2010 portion of the deferred compensation expense for the award made in February of 2010. You can also see that the end of 2010 will already have absorbed almost 60% of the deferred grants awarded in February 2010.</p>
          <p>We have included in this chart just to show you the timing and the allocation of this increased deferred compensation expenses and obviously I want to say that we will not foresee to repeat such disclosure in every quarter going forward because it is a specific Q1 event.</p>
          <p>We move on to page nine. We saw that in the first quarter 2010 our income before incomes taxes is &#x20AC;2.8 billion, an increase of 54% versus the first quarter of 2009. We generated a return on equity of 30% as I already said on an active equity base which is roughly &#x20AC;4.5 billion higher than the one in the year before.</p>
          <p>If we go to page 10, we saw our net income in the first quarter which was &#x20AC;1.8 billion, 50% higher than one year before. Our Effective Tax Rate in the quarter was 36.4%. This first quarter ETR mainly reflects the following items, with a significant change in the regional mix of our result and we obviously have the U.K. bank payroll tax which is not tax deductible. As a result of these two effects, we expect the full year ETR to come in slightly above 35% at this point in time.</p>
          <p>On page 11, we discuss our Tier 1 capital ratios. Our Tier 1 capital ratios came in at 11.2 as of March 31. The decrease compared to year end 2009 is mainly driven by the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim, which had an impact of negative 117 basis points. Please bear in mind as we disclosed that we decided not to raise capital for this acquisition due to our strong capital generation at year end.</p>
          <p>Moreover a change in the regulatory reporting of certain securitization provisions in our trading book led to an additional Tier 1 capital deduction of 1.4 billion and we had an &#x2013; a corresponding deduction in Tier 2 capital, translating into a decrease of 49 basis points in our Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>These effects were partially obviously offset by the net income generated in the first quarter which gave us a positive 61 basis points. Our core Tier-1 ratio, which excludes hybrids was the 7.5% at the quarter end.</p>
          <p>Our risk weighted asset increased by &#x20AC;23 billion to &#x20AC;292 billion, was also mainly driven by the Sal. Oppenheim acquisition which represented &#x20AC;17 billion and obviously significant movements in the FX effect in the risk weighted asset.</p>
          <p>We've provides further details on the development of our Tier-1 capital and risk weighted assets on page 45 of the appendix for your information. In the second quarter, the Tier-1 ratio will be impacted by the acquisition of the ABN AMRO business. We give you this heads up already that we reduce the Tier-1 by 30 to 40 basis points approximately including the expected positive impact from the negative goodwill.</p>
          <p>Just to say an additional point, the change in our reporting of our trading book securitization, will reduce the impact of future trading book rules on our book versus our previous estimates.</p>
          <p>We move on to page 12, we move on to the balance sheet. Total IFRS assets increased by 169 billion about 11%, mostly driven by higher settlement balances, the strengthening of U.S. dollar, and as I said already the consolidation of Sal. Oppenheim. The U.S. dollar impact on Sal. Oppenheim were also that two main reasons for the 87 billion or 10% increase in our U.S. GAAP Pro Forma asset, which is our balance sheet after netting. The consolidation of Sal. Oppenheim contributed of approximately 30 billion and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar about 28 billion, if you know we make this U.S. GAAP Pro-Forma asset calculation to calculate a comparable leverage ratio with our U.S. peers. The leverage ratio therefore remains unchanged at 23 times, as higher assets are partly compensated by higher equity and increased pro-forma fair value gains on our own debt.</p>
          <p>As we move on now to the segment results. On page 14, this slide gives you an overview of the segmental performance during the quarter many of the divisions include some of the negative items which I already talked about and some additional negative items that I'll talk to, as I go through them individually.</p>
          <p>Let me only highlight here that the consolidation adjustments reflect the negative trend in revenues of almost 400 million versus previous year quarter. As you may remember in the first quarter of 2009, we benefited from positive timing differences between our segment reporting and our IFRS group reporting due to the situation we had on the interest rate development in the last quarter of 2008. There was a swing back in 2009 that's part of the strong explanation.</p>
          <p>And obviously this C&amp;A gets always impacted by timing differences between our segment reporting and our IFRS group reporting overall. This difference is due to a different treatment of an underlying position and its economic edge.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter 2009, the bulk of the positive revenues were due to a significant decrease in euro interest rates again these strings do not show real losses or gains, but only reflect timing differences between our segment reports.</p>
          <p>On page 15, we show CB&amp;S. we've achieved the best pre-tax profit ever despite the fact that we have some mark-downs of approximately &#x20AC;250 million and the aforementioned increase amortization expense for deferred compensation so we must say we were extremely happy with this result. Obviously the reduced provision for credit losses also contributes to this really outstanding result and pre-tax, return on equity is at the remarkable 69%, which was apart from the record profit situation also benefited from a significant risk reduction. We also could show in this business and therefore lower allocated capital.</p>
          <p>On page 16, we show that first quarter 2010 was the second best quarter ever for our global market sales and trading businesses. Previous record was in the first quarter 2007 when we had a very different risk for finalizing, this makes this result even more impressive, this compared with the respected peaks in 2007 and subsequent we have cut our global markets balance sheet by almost 50%. We've cut our level three assets by 35% and we have cut our concept input volume 40%. So I think a very impressive result. Sales and trading revenue came in at &#x20AC;4.7 billion, after &#x20AC;255 in markdowns mainly related to monoline exposures. This compare to &#x20AC;4 billion revenue in the first quarter '09 after &#x20AC;1 billion of markdowns in certain other losses we had.</p>
          <p>Our competitive position reflects the strong client franchise. Our results also do not include material legacy asset appreciation nor high levels of profit trading. Most impressive was the strong performance from our credit and equity businesses, which have gone through a substantial restructuring as we've reported to you in several occasions.</p>
          <p>In sales and trading we brought a further development, which Anshu Jain has forecasted for 2010 on our Investor Day. In two weeks time, he will speak at Investment Conference and provide an update on the development in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>In total this business is fully on track to deliver contribution to our 2011 profit target.</p>
          <p>On page 17, we show that revenues in sales and trading debt were very strong and so we saw we expected normalization of revenues and our flow products such Money Markets, FX, and Rates. These businesses continue to generate very good revenue.</p>
          <p>We have a high market share with clients and continue to invest to be here at the leading edge. In credit our recalibration has totally paid off. We have reoriented the platform to be more flow and client focused. We have been able to respond to investors to increase appetite for credit across investment grade, high yield and distressed product lines</p>
          <p>In other areas we are also doing very well.  The emerging markets franchise continues to, the emerging market franchise continues to generate excellent revenues across all regions but we especially also highlight here Latin America. In commodities we are yet to see all of the benefits of our investments in key hires and obviously we have seen a less favorable market conditions than in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me move on to page 18, in which we also show that in equities we had our best quarter since the fourth quarter of 2007, we have narrowed the gap to our peers, having gone through the significant recalibration of this business area. Our results were strong and positive in every product, also the contribution from our designated top trading platform remained at a very lower level this quarter.</p>
          <p>In Equity Derivative, we've done some subdued client flow, but there has been demand for lightly structured products and we have changed our risk management approach here. First quarter 2009 as you remember was impacted by significant losses. In Equity Trading, cash equities market uncertainty impacted the volume.</p>
          <p>In Prime Brokerage, we've maintained our market share and seen no balances, hedge fund clients are more active, also the environment is much more competitive than a year ago, but we are still doing well. We continue to commit very low resources to dedicated prop trading as shown at the Investor Day, this is not a driver of our business model and makes up less than 5% of our equities revenues.</p>
          <p>One page 19, we show Origination and Advisory. We're very proud to announce that we rank number four globally for the first quarter 2010, up from number seven at year end 2009. In EMEA we have been number one, benefiting from a very strong performance in Germany. Some of our landmark deals in Advisory include Kraft Foods and Procter &amp; Gamble as you know.</p>
          <p>In origination Deutsche Bank was also involved in several landmark transactions in the U.S., which were obviously and are very significant for our franchise.</p>
          <p>As communicated we are on the process of selling legacy assets in the first quarter 2010 this took place particularly in the Leverage Finance area but also in Commercial Real Estate. Overall in the first quarter we saw 645 million of CIB assets reclassified under IAS 39, in the first quarter at more or less they are carrying values.</p>
          <p>We will continue to take any opportunities to reduce our exposure to legacy assets. And by the way, if we look into the second quarter we've seen a very strong momentum so far.</p>
          <p>So let me move now on to the Global Transaction Banking business on page 20 you see the P&amp;L, on page 21, you see the GTB reports in income before income of &#x20AC;100 million in the first quarter, and certainly weaker, as far as disappointing results in a difficult environment for our Transaction Banking business. Revenue remained subdued driven by obviously the low interest rate environment in both U.S. dollar and Euro rate. The interest in non-interest expenses by 82 million versus the first quarter of '09 reflects an impairment of intangible assets of 29 million. The career retirement acceleration effect of this business was impacted by 20 million as well as obviously higher regulatory expenses due to the deposit protection fund in Germany.</p>
          <p>On the 1st of April, we must say we finally closed the acquisition of ABN AMRO's commercial banking business in the Netherlands. The operating P&amp;L impact is anticipated to be roughly breakeven by 2010 due to one time integration costs, we look forward to a significant expansion obviously of our Dutch business with this acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Let's go to PCAM on page 22. Let me highlight as we also did in our press release that after the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim, we now manage invested assets of over &#x20AC;1 trillion.</p>
          <p>On page 23, let me start now with asset management, as expected, we have seen no further significant impairment in the first quarter in asset management, first quarter has traditionally been a weaker quarter in the performance fee cycle as you know. However portfolio and fund management revenues further improved in an increasingly positive market environment. Profit of 30 million after again the deduction of 25 million for the aforementioned career retirement effect.</p>
          <p>We have generated in this business. 4 billion of net new money mainly in our insurance assets. Our cost structure has further improved, head count have been adopted to the new environment with run rate cost savings down by approximately 25% year-on-year. So all the work we put to recalibrate and restructure asset management is starting to pay off and we have some additional measures underway to further improve our cost income ratio, for instance, the consolidation of our equity investment platform into Frankfurt.</p>
          <p>On page 24, we see private, our Private Wealth Management business that adjusted for Sal. Oppenheim and compensation effect, the pre-tax profit was &#x20AC;24 million as we show you on the chart excluding Sal. Oppenheim revenues were up 15% year-on-year mainly due to higher transaction days, the revenue predominately due to increase in Asia Pacific, Northern Europe, Middle East and Africa and Germany.</p>
          <p>We recorded very strong net money inflows of &#x20AC;5 billion mainly from Germany and Asia which fits our strategy to grow especially in these regions and again as the chart shows the PWM results was burdened by the consolidation of Sal. Oppenheim &#x20AC;59 million and the career retirement effect of &#x2013; effects of 12 million.</p>
          <p>Page 25, we show the P&amp;L for the PBC business and at a glance if I move on to page 26, we saw PBC had a pre-tax profit of 189 million and that's the best result after the Lehman collapse if we adjust again for the non-operating items. So in the underlying a good performance. The first quarter of 2009 PBC profit had benefited from a release of credit losses &#x2013; for credit losses of approximately 60 million on the year-on-year comparison in each, we take this one-time effect into account.</p>
          <p>As forecasted we did record higher revenues from our investment business. Revenues from lending activity remain stable, while deposit revenues went up notably due to the improved margins. Credit provisions further declined which demonstrated again I think the quality of our PBC asset in generally &#x2013; general and then also showed how our efforts, our improved collection efforts particularly for example in Spain has supported our good performance in this division.</p>
          <p>Expenses benefited from efficiency measures as planned on the one hand but were more than offset by specific integration expenses and the affect from career retirement; an increased mandatory regulatory expenses, we were exposed to especially in Germany. All in all going forward we expect much healthier levels of underlying performance then in the pervious year.</p>
          <p>Finally, to end my presentation, I just like to cover three key current issues. The first one is obviously the closing of the acquisition of Sal. Oppenheim in the first quarter; our complexity reduction programs and the quarterly performance in the context of our 2011 profit target.</p>
          <p>As you know we closed the Sal. Oppenheim &#x2013; on page 28 &#x2013; we closed the Sal. Oppenheim transaction in the first quarter. The purchase price of 1 billion was paid in cash. That obviously excluded the BAS business, which was sold to Onz. We have now structured this business into four clusters. Cluster 1, comprises the wealth management in German &#x2013; Germany and the asset management businesses in Germany and Luxemburg and that business for us represents the core franchise in Germany which is we will keep with distinct value proposition that's we will drive separate brand strategy.</p>
          <p>Cluster 2, summarize Oppenheim's key international activities which will be combined or aligned with PWM's international activity where we are looking for a maximum of synergies and we will have a one brand approach. Cluster 3 includes all other Sal. Oppenheim businesses, some of this will be wound down or exited, but as you know the investment banking business, the private equity and the asset management and insurance business will be integrated into our corresponding DB activities and Cluster 4 is BHF where we're currently examining all our strategic options. So this highlights the approach.</p>
          <p>And on page 29, beyond the impact on risk on capital that I already alluded to, this page summarizes the impact of Sal. Oppenheim Group on the division under division of P&amp;L, so you have an idea of how much of the business got allocated to the different divisions.</p>
          <p>PWM includes Clusters 1 to 3, however some of the asset management activities in Cluster 3 are allocated to asset management. The final allocation I want to say this very clear has a final allocation to this division is still under review and may change. This just represents our first and initial project.</p>
          <p>On page 30, we show you our invested assets reporting for Sal. Oppenheim Group. We have now applied Deutsche Bank's invested assets concept in terms of the definition for the past and present numbers, to make it comparable with our numbers. Invested assets have grown mainly due to the consolidation of the insurance asset management business as well as due to market appreciation. You can see there was an insurance asset was not consolidated previously in the Sal. Oppenheim Group that led to this increase. A net new money outflows have been only marginally above 300 million in our corporate provision since the consolidation. So we see a very positive development.</p>
          <p>With this acquisition on page 31 we give you some of its rationale, we obviously want to have undisputed leadership in Private Wealth Management in Germany. We want to have the complementary and added on client profile in the ultra-high network, net worth, individual client segment. We want to obviously have a second brand with a second wealth management propositions in the competition. We support obviously the acquisitions of Deutsche Bank to expansion in non-investment banking activities. And thirdly, we will represent a broader diversification of Deutsche Bank's earnings mix.</p>
          <p>For 2010 and 2011 we expect some significant impact obviously now from integration, exit and synergy costs. This year we anticipate approximately 120 million in restructuring costs mainly severance costs, from 2012 onwards we expect then a positive contribution. All in all we see substantial upside potential from this acquired business.</p>
          <p>On page 32 I want to give you a brief update on our complexity reduction program. As you know efficiency gains in complexity reduction is expected to result in about 1 billion of cost savings coming from a cost income ratio of 72% for the group by the end of 2009, and a very strong 66% by the end of the quarter. We target the cost income ratio of 65% by the end of 2011.</p>
          <p>On page 33, I show you what we &#x2013; how our process works. Since our Investor Day in December, we've set up a process in government structure and we've specifically committed cost savings accounting for about 550 million in efficiency gains with our different businesses. And this process obviously will continue on and all our initiatives will be centrally listed, quantified and further developed. The progress will be regularly tracked by our executives committee.</p>
          <p>So on page 34, to sum up. Let's look at our first quarter results in the light of our 2011 profit target. Note that due to the typical seasonality in investment banking should not analyze our near record first quarter results. At first sight, the GAAP between the first quarter results in our classic banking business our profit target is quite remarkable.</p>
          <p>However, if you look at the underlying performance we are not concerned as the operating performance of our business in the first quarter appears really in the reported number weaker than it actually was.</p>
          <p>I remind you 298 million of career retirement charges are front-loaded and absorbed during the quarter, 120 million of U.K. bonus tax were recorded in PRBM digested a negative 558 million of Sal. Oppenheim, which was also driven by the integration so I think that we feel that we are very well on track. If we add up the range is about 3.2 to 3.3 billion of underlying business performance so even applying the usual seasonality affects of our business, we seem to be well on track on a Group basis to achieve our 2010 target.</p>
          <p>So with that I conclude my presentation and I welcome any questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Jernej Omahen, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, it's Jernej Omahen here from Goldman. I just have a couple of questions. The first one, I guess, is the obvious one on capital. You made a reference to market risk at some point in your presentation and I was just wondering whether the estimates for the increase in market risk at the end of the year still stand, so the 15 billion figure. And whether the timing of those &#x2013; of that increase stands as well?</p>
          <p>The second question is &#x2013; also relates to a reference you made to the credit risk development during the quarter, I think that the suggestion was we shouldn't annualize the Q1 figure and I guess this is a relatively straight forward question, to what extent do you think that Q1 undershot your expectations for the run rate for the full year?</p>
          <p>And then the next two questions, I guess more topical. The first one is the question on the disclosure you made at the back of your report from the subpoenas and requests for information. And you'll understand I feel slightly awkwardly positioned to ask this question, but can you maybe elaborate what those subpoenas relate to, I think you highlight the product so the RMBS and the CDOs is this the current investigation we are looking at in the U.S. or is that something different?</p>
          <p>And then just the final question I guess, the Deutsche Postbank February 11 deadline is getting close and the discussion about potential actions of Deutsche Bank are getting louder and I was just wondering if you could update us on your thoughts here I guess given that we are relatively close to the timeline at this point? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Jernej. Let me go through your questions. The first on capital and expected increase to market risk by year end. As you know, the rules on capital are still under discussion. As you know, the European Parliament vote got delayed. We therefore expect now some delay in implementation so &#x2013; overall we feel very comfortable with what we have always said that we believe that will continue to take some time and be less critical then many have assumed in various estimates. And I think what has happened since year end in this topic basically shows that we are right in terms of our views on this issue. So I think we will wait until final resolution gets, no change and that's I think the main message of &#x2013; no change to our views, rather position and process developments that indicate that our forecast that we also gave at Investor Day is fine.</p>
          <p>On the credit risk provisioning, yeah, we had a very good Q1 and no question and as I said you shouldn't project it out. We obviously based on the experience of 2009 did not give any specific guidance on capital position and I don't want to go into it but we would definitely think if it would trend high up in our current point of view than what an annualization of Q1 would suggest. Again there is still uncertainty in the environment, whilst we are very confident that our portfolios will perform well, IAS 39 assets might also bear a surprise, that's the reason why they are IAS 39 assets and therefore we might or could see volatility in this position as we experienced throughout the last year.</p>
          <p>The subpoenas and legal situation, honestly there is no new information towards year end, we had that same, obviously based on what's going on in the external environment, disclosures of this nature generate some more attention. It is a standard and we had the same. It's not related to any current issues. It's not related to the issue you allude to. In fact only to clearly, as stated here, we have done our internal review we &#x2013; of our transactions. We do not see that we have any similar situation than the one that is being discussed and therefore we don't have any concerns in that area.</p>
          <p>Thank you also then for the Postbank question, because again I &#x2013; will very loud and clearly say that our position on Postbank has not changed. The fact that the market has become a little bit more aware that there is some timeline considerations in the way we build the optionality structure in our structure. It's not new for us at Deutsche Bank and when we previously have indicated to the market that, number one, we have all the time of the world; number two, we see no pressure to move on quickly. In fact we even think that and see what the Postbank management is doing in terms of de-risking Postbank and continue to work an improved result this is very encouraging.</p>
          <p>You know that we also have &#x2013; continued to have very good reports on our contract with Postbank to get to synergies. So we are recovering all the synergies or getting to the synergies that you would normally expect by consummating a transaction sooner there will be no big difference, if we would be the owner of Postbank. So there is no incentive to move on quickly here and therefore again we can only say that we continue and our view is unchanged. There is no rush. There is no hurry to move on Postbank as the Postbank business itself and our synergies are going in the right direction.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Good morning, everybody. Could I just ask three questions please?</p>
          <p>Firstly on trading, obviously a very good result this quarter. But I wondered if you might be in a position to estimate what kinds of drag there might be from a liability tax. I know the German press have put a few figures around. And whether that might affect your 2010 goals?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the core Tier-1. It's obviously a little low at the moment, but your core profitability will build back quite quickly. However, given regulatory developments, how should we think about dividends this year? Is it likely to be another year of fairly low pay out?</p>
          <p>And final question is just on Greece. Would you be able to quantify your exposure to Greek government bonds? And would you expect any mark-to-market losses in the second quarter? Have you been able to hedge through CDS or some other mechanism? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jon, yeah, well, the big priority, we hear a lot about taxation around banks right now in the market, and we read in the newspaper. Though our main problem is we don't really have specific plans. We don't really know what the numbers are going to really look like. Therefore to make any focus at this point in time, it's just too early. We will have to wait what comes around.</p>
          <p>Of course, again, like in every change, like the one we see in the rights capital exchange at the beginning, there is always big concerns that this may impact us significantly. I guess we will have to wait and see what finally comes before we can make a prediction how this will impact.</p>
          <p>On dividends, it's very early in the year, as you know. In our financial statements, we always accrue versus our previous year basis, and obviously as you and I have to do the disclosure every year, to the dividend point, there will be decision of the AGM based on the proposals of our supervisory committee. We have no estimate at this point in time. We will have to see how the year develops.</p>
          <p>And I think this is always a decision made quite late in the year depending on how our profit developed. But, as you know, we continue to be a committed to be dividend paying organization, and as we move on and as the environment allows us, obviously we will go back to increase this. But please accept this is too early to make any forecast.</p>
          <p>To your Greek bond exposure, we were locked in the second quarter. We don't have much exposure to Greece directly &#x2013; that's what we have always said. So we are not concerned. Obviously it always depends what the Greek situation then causes in the second magnitude of it. And obviously, we could not completely isolate ourself, if the situation in Greece gets somewhat worse, that there might be issues of a second nature or second category that might impact us. But our direct exposure, we're not concerned with.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'd like to come back to your risk-weighted asset guidance of the 50 billion net impact. So it's &#x2013; then basically, the capital reduction you've published today, due to the securitization, is this an amount which wasn't in the guidance and which is now basically done and covered? Or would you expect further charges throughout the year? So could you just comment on the front loading part of the pain, which we've seen today on the Tier 1 ratio?</p>
          <p>Second question would be with respect to the regulatory environment in the U.S., in particular with respect to the derivatives, what's currently being discussed in the Senate and has been now agreed by the Agricultural Committee in terms of moving the most of the OTC derivatives to exchanges &#x2013; I was just wondering, is that covered in your chart on the Investor Day in December, in terms of the annualized 10% regulatory negative impact on sales and trading revenues in general? Or did you back then rather refer to the gearing impact, which should have been much more modest?</p>
          <p>And then finally, could you just confirm that you haven't received any new wealth notice from the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philipp, thank you. I am going to go in reverse order.</p>
          <p>We have not received a wealth notice, to say it very clearly.</p>
          <p>And your other question that referred to the application &#x2013; or let me take your first question first. You have checked the application of the current rules. And we very clearly said this helps us in terms of our forecast, because it is already a rule application that we take that does lower our expectation for future impact, because that's exactly the type of impact we would expect to see in our securitization book. So it will reduce our further impacts. In that sense, it's front loaded, stretched to it.</p>
          <p>Last thing &#x2013; and you see what &#x2013; said we have some taken pain here, but again, when we are &#x2013; when the newer rules will come out, this will ease the difference &#x2013; it will lower the difference that we will have to absorb at this point in time.</p>
          <p>By the way, and I clearly want to say it here, this has not changed the profile, despite the fact that, based on the rule, we have to put some more tier capital on the books, the risk profile of the bank has not changed at all. This is &#x2013; has something to do with the fact that according to this rule, any portfolio hedging we do to the securitization positions that are not one-to-one hedges basically do not count for the regulatory capital definition.</p>
          <p>And therefore, whilst our VAR has not changed, and whilst our risk position and our balance sheet position to this securitization has not changed, we have to account for a higher capital charge, because portfolio-type hedging cannot be considered for this type of capital charge. So in that sense, this rule is very much in line with what we expect to come in terms of securitization capital charges.</p>
          <p>Your derivatives regulation, as you know, we don't get tired to tell that all the time. Of course, when you do a forecast for profitability, you make a lot of assumptions. At that point our assumption was a different one in terms of what will happen with the derivatives portfolio and book, and therefore obviously we'll have to assess what this U.S. situation really means. But it is a change to what we had assumed the structure of the business will look like in our forecasted 10 billion target.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry. If I may follow up on your last comment, but you've said in your statement that you are reiterating the CBS pre-tax profit guidance for -</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Of course, what we don't know &#x2013; at this point of time, we don't know exactly what is the impact &#x2013; real impact going to be, because we don't know how it's going to look like finally, yeah.</p>
          <p>So in that sense from our current point of view we can reiterate our target and there is no question about it. We don't know if all, if it's only OTC, what portion of the business would move, how the revenue distribution is going to be, et cetera, et cetera. So it's just &#x2013; we'll have to wait to comment, then we'll give you, but everything we know at this point and the assumptions we have made lead us to confirm our target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry, just a quick clarification on the first point of your 50 billion risk weighted asset guidance. So you've always left it open what the impact would be in terms of the securitization rules. So are you now saying, with this charge in Q1, basically the 50 billion is the only remaining impact, or are you saying the 50 billion will essentially be lower given the charges you've done today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is difficult to estimate again. We continue to be in an environment of uncertainty. As you know, we continue to be in discussion with regulators and with politicians on the clarification, et cetera. As you know, there is a lot of movement in the position. So at this time, I would not like to give any change on our 50 billion estimate. I have no new information.</p>
          <p>The only thing that from &#x2013; the charge we had in Q1 would represent a lowering of any difference in GAAP that there exists. But we've not done yet a new calculation on this deferred implementation we expect. And to change some of the changes, we are continuing to discuss with the regulators on our 50 billion number.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Perhaps I'll just ask two questions. One, you often give us a bit of color on how the current quarter is going. Is there any particular update you would like to share?</p>
          <p>And number two, I guess one disappointment today was that the stable businesses &#x2013; so GTB, Asset Wealth Management and PCAM &#x2013; were all a bit light. And I think if I annualize Q1, they're about 2.5 billion short of your target for next year.</p>
          <p>In the light of investment banking over 90% of your earnings today, how quickly do you think you can get to the more diversified earnings base. Is it going to take well to the end of '011 or would you think one could see slightly earlier progress? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the current quarter update, I know that's always something interesting. I alluded to that in our corporate finance business we are doing quite well. And we continue to see a good business environment going into first quarter there. So the update I can only &#x2013; we continue to be positive.</p>
          <p>And especially don't forget that as the deferred comp asset cannot be analyzed and taken over, we expect obviously some of the one time negative signings we had in the first quarter obviously not to impact Q2. But there is also seasonality in the business, and we will have to see how that develops. But everything we see makes us positive for Q2 as well, and the start of the business has been good.</p>
          <p>The second &#x2013; the stable businesses or the classic banking businesses are clearly short of some of the targets, if you don't take out the one offs. If you take out the one offs and we look at the performance &#x2013; and especially I can say that if I looked at the performance versus budget, and the seasonality that is included in the budget &#x2013; we are actually tracking well towards our 2011 target.</p>
          <p>I know it's a surprise that I make the statement, if you look at the bare numbers, but taking as a statement &#x2013; take it as such, when we look into how we have calendarized and cleansed for the year, how we expect &#x2013; and again, that's an important assumption we have made &#x2013; how we expect the environment to further improve throughout 2010 and 2011, which is obviously an important assumption we've made as we track towards the achievement of 2010 targets and then 2011 targets.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget that our classic banking business were the businesses that went into the crisis later then the investment bank. We saw the recovery of the investment bank first. And that could help our plans out <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So the net, I think the indication that Q1 showed us that we are recovering in all these businesses, that certainly GTB still has to suffer under the interest rates, but I think you can make your interest rate &#x2013; I know what your two-year interest rate forecast is. As interest rates improve, this business will benefit, and especially will benefit because of their additional customers and the additional volumes this business has been able to gain throughout the year.</p>
          <p>In PBC, in our retail business, you've seen a good Q1. That shows in the underlying business improvement. As markets get better, this should also not be an issue. We have had &#x2013; obviously we have some cost in our cost right now that are investment costs into the efficiency program that we'll not receive in 2011, of course because we need to get to this efficiency. If I go to asset management, you know all our work to recalibrate this business, to refocus this business is starting to pay off. We will finalize some of these measures at the beginning of this year, which will further pay off increased profitability of this business.</p>
          <p>And obviously, Private Wealth Management, that development will be contingent on how quickly the Sal. Opp situation and the Sal. Opp business can be brought on track. But you &#x2013; as I forecasted to you, we are taking some money in hand to move as quickly as possible to integrate and to structure the business, so we can bring it to its expected performance level.</p>
          <p>So, we are very happy with our results in April, and we are very confident that we are on track to our 2010 and then obviously for our 2011 target.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Carsten Werle, Macquarie. Good morning. You've already touched the efficiency program. Could you perhaps give us an update, when exactly you expect the full &#x20AC;1 billion of cost savings, how much we may already have seen as achievement, and how much of it is likely to come in compensation of benefits, and how much in the general cost line?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, our program is targeted to, obviously, mainly non-comp related topics. Of course, if we have efficiencies, they will impact the cost line. But we do &#x2013; our program is not targeted to change the structure or the quality of our compensation at all. So therefore only obviously it's targeted at mainly non-cost items. Just only to say it very clear. In so far that we will not have &#x2013; certainly at the one or other area also &#x2013; eventually head count reduction.</p>
          <p>The 1 billion is &#x2013; we mainly are targeting, obviously, efficiency. Efficiency in that sense, obviously, as we grow the business &#x2013; and that's what we've always said &#x2013; that we are at the same time growing and developing the business, obviously we will have some increased cost based on the effect. So the billion will be measured as an efficiency gain, and therefore should translate mainly in our cost income ratio target. And that's &#x2013; we like to call it the exit rate to 2011. That's what we are targeting there.</p>
          <p>So that &#x2013; to give you some light, we are well &#x2013; the progress is good. We're moving along. What I want to caution you for 2010 is, as I said already, there will be some costs to achieve these synergies, that we have to invest in one or other business areas, that obviously we would try to frontload in order to move on quickly and get to these synergies.</p>
          <p>So that's the way you have to look at it. The cost base could overall increase as we move obviously along and grow our revenues and grow our business, because we don't want &#x2013; with the program, we don't want to restrict the growth opportunities that are presenting to the bank as we move out of the crisis and have opportunities to grab market share and build new businesses.</p>
          <p>So that's &#x2013; I think hopefully that sheds some light on this question for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Two or three questions please.</p>
          <p>Firstly, I just wanted to come on to the wording of your outlook statement, because it looks like your investment banking revenues, on a clean basis, were flatter than your slide or actually up slightly year-on-year, but your outlook comment talks about most market segments being down versus '09. So I just wondered whether &#x2013; did that refer to the rest of the industry, while you're flat, everyone else is down? Or what is behind those comments? Are you expecting a big slowdown from here? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, just around Sal. Oppenheim. Could you just go back over the decision to pay in cash, not shares? What your thinking was around that?</p>
          <p>And then following-on on Sal. Oppenheim, just to understand the outlook from here, I think you said there is a 59 million drag in this quarter, out of a total 120 of charges overall. Does that mean that the drag falls away quite quickly from here, in as early as Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let me see. Now understand, I'm trying to reconcile in time what part is attributed in our investment banking. You know overall, we've had record development but we've had a quite substantial change in mix.</p>
          <p>And the only statements we made towards this slowdown was that, if you remember in Q1 '09, we had for example the FX part wherein extraordinary well improvement that there was based on increased margins and increased development. At that point in time we talked about the extraordinary high margins we had at the beginning of the year. All that has &#x2013; as Anshu also said at the Investor Day, we expected some normalization.</p>
          <p>So I think your statements are based on the fact that we expected normalization, and that normalization has presented itself. We still are tracking, as you saw from our numbers, at record levels in many of our businesses, but we've had a shift in business mix from this flow, I think. So our investment banking &#x2013; and we say very clearly in the report, our outlook continues to be on the path of another very successful year.</p>
          <p>So don't misunderstand the comparison to extraordinary items in 2009 -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But actually, extraordinary &#x2013; excuse me, sorry. Your own slide, slide 16, shows sales and trading revenues are flat year-on-year, and then your side on origination advisory shows that up that is up.</p>
          <p>So your clean numbers in total are up year-on-year, but your outlook comment makes us think about revenue levels in most market segments are likely to be lower than in the previous year. So you seem to be showing an increase, but talking about a decrease. And I just wondered how that squares.</p>

          <p>Yeah. That's only, it has only to do with the effect that we see between margin development and volume development. It's a normalization.</p>
          <p>So if that generated a view that there's something negative, that's totally incorrect. That is not what we are &#x2013; we have a very strong performance in the investment bank. We have a very strong performance in the business. What we saw was the normalization that we expected, in terms of pricing effect. We see increases in market share, we see strong volumes coming.</p>
          <p>And just to very clearly say, an overall positive outlook for the business. If some statements on the comparisons look odd, then that has really -</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>&#x2013; nothing to do with our basic feeling of it.</p>
          <p>The Sal. Oppenheim, your question was why we paid in cash for Sal. Oppenheim. Well, because we &#x2013; obviously, as we had a very good year-end development in 2009, our position was strong, our capital position was strong. We had plans that we would create at the end of 2009 some surplus capital. And we told you that we will &#x2013; did this planning ahead, very much knowing what exposures we had to deal with into &#x2013; coming into the year 2010.</p>
          <p>We therefore also very clearly told you we were not changing our target of 10% to Tier 1, to say it very clearly. And we continue to track well in our view versus our target, as we take the capital charges relating to our positions and these other capital charges in account, which overall, as I also said as the good news, that will ease down any further capital charges we have coming down the road. And we are moving still well above our 10% target, and as long as we are above our 10% target, we &#x2013; I think it does make sense for us to use our capital for these investments. And that was the reason we decided to pay in cash.</p>
          <p>And if I may add even if we look at our outlook this year and our ability to build capital, that's why we're not concerned at all in terms of our further capital development.</p>
          <p>Sal. Oppenheim. You also ask what to expect in terms of its performance. Of course, we &#x2013; as you know, since January 29, we own it, and we consolidated it, and I gave you a first glimpse on how we are approaching the business.</p>
          <p>As we now work the clusters, I think we will get more clarity throughout the second quarter and I might be able to give you and shed more light then in to the mid-term cost and expenses, and also the profit development. That's something we are currently assessing. We just first wanted to make sure that we have different clusters and we have the strategy clear for the different clusters. As it comes to financial numbers we will share them with you as we go on.</p>

          <p>As an example. So &#x2013; but that's an early estimate, and as we move on, as I told you &#x2013; as we really find also the allocation of the Sal. Opp business to our different divisions, and I also told you something, we will finalize throughout the second quarter &#x2013; I think we'll be able to shed more clarity on that.</p>
          <p>So there is &#x2013; on the &#x2013; then last question was on the U.K .bonus tax. There is something to come in the second quarter and third quarter, but we definitely expect this to be much lower than in Q1.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good morning. Three questions actually.</p>
          <p>Firstly, to take up the capital question again. Obviously, with the kind of combination of the 50 billion potential market risk hit at the end of the year, 30 to 40 basis points coming from ABN AMRO. Right here, right now, that could mean the core Tier 1 ratio is the equivalent of 6%.</p>
          <p>Now of course, you have retained earnings coming through, but over 90% of those in the first quarter came from the investment bank. So my question being, how much are you reliant on the environment being stronger for the investment bank and/or regulation not being kind of more adverse?</p>
          <p>And on the question on regulation, I think one of the key developments in the U.S. is the &#x2013; obviously the proposal that banks might need to spin off swap dealers. So just wanted to get your commentary on what do you think the likelihood of this is and what the implications of that could be?</p>
          <p>And the final question is to come back on your provision commentary, i.e., not to extrapolate the first quarter. IAS39 assets could provide surprises. One of the disclosures you provided in your annual report, was that the junior debt portion of your impaired, leveraged finance exposure &#x2013; that's about 2.1 billion &#x2013; was only 38% covered. To me that sounds a bit low, but I wonder if you could provide some commentary on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start on the capital.</p>
          <p>I see that we have had this capital issue speculation for over a year now, and it continues to be endless speculation of what's going to happen and what's going to come in at the end. We've seen that, in our view, the environment easing somewhat. In our environment the expected more reasonable is happening in the discussion. When we talk to regulators and politicians, I think our view is now that we have a much more down-to-earth discussion.</p>
          <p>The impact analysis that has been made has provided some further insight on how significant this can be, and has certainly impacted views and opinions. I think the view in general is to hit on a near term, short-term the banking system with significant capital charges doesn't make any sense for the world economy and the developing I think.</p>
          <p>So I can only answer your speculative question with the broad trend that we've seen since this discussion started, and with verifying our point of view that discussion &#x2013; I've always used the term nothing gets eaten as hot as it gets cooked, and this applies here as well. And again, when I talk about &#x2013; here again the new proposal, there's daily proposals on taxes, there's daily proposals on reg changes. I think we continue to believe that that will ease off.</p>
          <p>Of course, as we look into our capital planning, in our earnings power, in our ability to generate return to earnings is core to our view. We are above our Tier-1 capital target right now. Everything we see in the plan leads us to believe that we will continue to be fine on the capital side.</p>
          <p>But I &#x2013; nobody can at this point exclude that the environment worsens, and then we will have to make a new decisions if that occurs, which by the way we don't foresee at this point in time. And the second issue that is open, we will have to wait for regulation. We definitely expect regulation to come, which is also fine from us, and I think it's also correct from our perspective. But the impact of this regulation be further delayed and further deferred over many years. That's the current view we have.</p>
          <p>So I think that's why we &#x2013; I can only say very loud and clear &#x2013; we are not concerned in our capital plan at this point in time as we move along.</p>
          <p>I think okay, then the covered of leverage, finance exposure has not materially change since year end and we continue to feel very comfortable with what we have, but again we always have to say these transactions are individual single transactions as time moves on, situation different situations in the underlying assets can change and make or make us required to take additional charges on it. But we feel that our provisions in this business are in our coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>If covered though, let's not forget that in leverage finance business it represent businesses in the coverage ratio you don't normally don't track the assets of these businesses as being something that will support your coverage that's why a lower coverage in this business from our point of view is sufficient.</p>
          <p>Yeah as it deals with businesses. And on your OTC derivatives impact, yes there could be an impact we totally agree, but we feel certainly we can always react and adjust our business model and that's what in many of the capital extrapolations and the capital planning and the exposure planning that I have seen for Deutsche Bank, but not taking intercontinental something that Huw alluded to and in our Investor Day in December very strongly you always have management action we are not going to sit there and not do anything. We always will have management action which provides for us and I think we have shown it at the bank throughout the crisis twice for us a great level to deal then specifically with the situation. So in the combination of yes, new regulation coming that we expect to be deferred and delayed and less impact for then in some of the estimates.</p>
          <p>The second we continue to believe that we will have a good momentum in terms of our profit and certainly we always believe that you can take management actions it will have significant impact on it. We continue to feel comfortable with the capital succession of the bank. In terms of right capital, yes, it was adjusted down but interesting enough we see the gap widening between our true capital and our reg capital. Also our risk has not changed, yeah, in the bank our risk indicators are have moved down rather than up. So in that sense we continue to be not &#x2013; we don't share the concerns many have on that.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, I have two questions. On capital I'm afraid. Firstly, you talked about 1.4 billion, but I think on slide 45, there was a figure of 2.1 billion, so there is another 0.7 of deductions, could you just explain what was going on there?</p>
          <p>And the second question is a bit more philosophical picking up from the previous question, it seems right now, I can understand what you are saying in terms of your absolute capital level, but you also need to take into account the relative situation. And if you are saying that you expect regulation to be delayed somewhat then that would benefit your peers as well many of who have much higher core Tier 1 ratios and are still piling on capital. So I guess so &#x2013; what the philosophical argument for being at the lower end of your peer group in relative terms is at a time when investors seem to see capital strength as a relative advantage why wouldn't you want to be at the stronger end rather than the weaker end because when regulation comes in and if you are right other banks are going to benefit much more from that back regulation than you are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To answer your second question &#x2013; its also question how you define your competitive environment and we believe that we are in the mid to the higher end of the capital rather than to the lower end of the capital and that we always get compared on with one side of the chart, it's regretful. In fairness our internal view would be &#x2013; we are absolutely in line with the 11.2 &#x2013; we are inline with &#x2013; what describes our business model, our risk model and our competitive environment.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Or both in our view and therefore the next, the other issue, the deduction was the second element introduction which was related to also securitization asset that had to take a larger capital charge, which was would be normal ongoing business that's nothing changed. It is an asset whose risk profile changed and according to the record we had to take an additional reclassify and take an additional banking book type charge on it.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Couple more questions capital related, I'm also afraid.</p>
          <p>Firstly could you just comment whether there is any specific relief items come through from either sales as parts of Sal. Oppenheim in the second quarter or in the near term and if so can you quantify them?</p>
          <p>And then also just to be absolutely clear, I get that you don't want to give a specific update on the 5 billion regulatory impact guidance that you gave back at the Investor Day. But in terms of isolating the impact of this 1.4 billion methodology change that hit this quarter, should we be looking at a one for one relief versus whatever other regulatory burdens come in. So regardless of whether that original 5 billion projection would have changed, it would be 1.4 billion lighter than before you took this methodology change in the first quarter. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me again try to give an answer to your second question. Look, we have not done an update of the 50 billion to one-to-one mathematically be able to say what the impact is. So let's not forget we are still dealing with a moving target. We don't have final regulation, we don't have the final thing. The 50 billion was an estimate that included, obviously management action that included, our expectations of what realistic regulation will come in.</p>
          <p>Technically of course the step we did is the first step in that direction and technically to whatever supposedly increase would be versus and suppose the year end 2009 figure this will apply, of course it does apply because it is completely in line with what expected new regulations goes in the same direction doesn't increase the gap &#x2013; doesn't rather reduce the gap.</p>
          <p>But I don't have &#x2013; I don't have 50 billion &#x2013; now based on this 50 billion estimate we gave to you one-to-one calculation that can tell you exactly what amount you could deduct from it. Because let's &#x2013; understand that the 50 billion was an estimate trying to help you to give you a view after management action, after the reg changes that we expected at that point in time of what magnitude we are talking. And therefore just please understand that this is not mathematical one-to-one calculation that we track on an Excel spreadsheet that gives us pluses and minuses.</p>
          <p>There's been so much happened since the 50 billion in the positive sense some of our expectations and I also told you have come true which then obviously helps us to feel that we are more in that region that in some of the estimates that we are out in market I'll also disclose that. But no one-to-one view.</p>
          <p>On the core one, on the Tier-1 capital adequacy, on what capital relief. I think you made out a very good point. I think what you will see with Sal. Oppenheim that of course at the beginning we had a significant impact on our capital from Sal. Oppenheim and as the year progresses we have a plan in place to significantly reduce risk weighted assets from Sal. Oppenheim.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget Sal. Oppenheim at this point in time has &#x2013; as it's just came into group, we have become over the last couple of years pretty good at managing risk weighted assets. I think we have a good track record in them and we're applying this many assets in that group, the group doesn't need for its core business. When we talked about the clusters, we talked about the focus we want to bring to the business. Cluster 3 is comprised of assets we definitely are reducing, disposing, because we don't regard them to be core. Cluster 4 we said that we will look at our strategic options, certainly, some of the outcomes of what could happen with cluster four will reduce risk-weighted assets for the group substantially as well. So we do expect &#x2013; I can not tell you exactly the time because its contingent and when we would sell assets and when the disposals and closings will happen, but we do expect a significant reduction of risk-weighted assets coming from you now the whole cleanup and integration of the Sal. Oppenheim Group.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. It's, I've got two questions actually. The first relates to Basel III and just reading through the comments that you and your peer group submitted, it's seems pretty consistent the way that people feel there's an unfair treatment of counterparty risk associated with the OTC derivatives. I'm hoping you can just to help me understand this a little bit so if I look at your balance sheet you have 620 billion positive replacement value then you mentioned in your comments you have 559 billion of netting impact. So is the right way to think about that to take the 620 to subtract the 559, you have a 61 billion gap or so. And then is the Basel III proposal to put that 61 billion gap essentially into risk-weighted asset terms, i.e. something around 60 billion. And then you and your peers are saying hold on that's not fair that overstates the risk associated with that, do I have the crux of that argument right or is there some scaling factor of that 61 billion that I'm missing? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>And my second question on slide 29, you give the impact of Sal. Opp on your revenues, I am just wondering if you could give us that same segmental breakdown of the cost sort of exceptional in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so the Sal. Opp we would say to position some of the part of the Sal. Opp business on &#x2013; in sales processes et cetera is not to give further disclosure on the segmental distribution of other components. Please understand that as you have assets in the share position we want to be cautious with some disclosures around that. And on the first argument I can only say your math &#x2013; the way you look at it is not entirely correct in that sense that you cannot calculate it. It's a more based Basel III suggests no recognition of netting for the leverage ratio that's why we strongly oppose. But that's mainly the discussion was around the leverage element of it.</p>
          <p>On the counterparty risk, the rules are quite more complex that the one you &#x2013; the conclusion you come to because it's really more on a one-to-one basis and a one-to-one definition. How it's going to be looked at. So I think I would caution you &#x2013; extremely caution you to apply this math because that could guide you in the wrong direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to understand to what you are saying is what I have done which is just take your netting number that would actually over state your netting because their definition of netting is even stricter than the one you use. Is that correct? Just from your answer that's what I am interpreting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean, just in conceptually what they are saying is look there is this counterparty risk that you are not capturing and we want to capture it and so me as an analyst to try to work out roughly what the debate is over, how big a number. I've just taken your derivatives position and I have taken the netting number that you give in your slide ...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But clearly its not going to be &#x2013; its going to be a bigger number not a smaller number, i.e., the netting is going to be smaller therefore the counterparty exposure is going to be bigger than what I've done is what you are saying. Because the definition of netting is stricter under Basel III than the one you use in your disclosure is that correct?</p>

          <p>No. A large part already is based &#x2013; large part of the risk weighted asset is already calculated on the net and that's not expected to change and now to here on the phone estimate the magnitude of the difference is too difficult.</p>

          <p>The risk weighted asset netting is unchanged by the way. Its only the leverage discussion while this has such a big impact because on the leverage discussion and that's what it will &#x2013; why you here it so loud is the largest &#x2013; on the leverage discussion it will be completely misleading, yeah, in that sense especially as you compare different accounting standards if its not given and then the numbers would be quite low. On the leverage, if this effect that they are taking into account this way if the math gets done this way.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I also thought there was an impact on your risk adjusted capital ratios because I thought the counterparty risk is not currently captured in the way they want to capture it. So it sound like I am confused and I need to have this conversation offline.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen and I apologize, but in the interest of time I have to ask now for one last final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question is from Kian Abouhossein, JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I am the lucky one. Legal issues, normally you only have to disclose them when they're material, so could you tell us how you define the materiality of those six legal issues?</p>
          <p>Second question on compensation ratio, if I look at CIB, its quite low if I do some implied valuation CB&amp;S, you probably accrue the lowest comp to revenue of your peers so far. How should we think about compensation levels into the next few quarters in terms of accrual, is this just a structural change that we are seeing or as the revenues normally come off towards the first quarter, should we also assume a change in compensation ratio basically starting to increase?</p>
          <p>And lastly, if I look at the Anshu slide on revenue decline on a clean year-on-year basis, or the a guidance for 2010, it looks to me, it looks very aggressive now, i.e. it is too conservative. Is that fair to say? Should we forecast that material decline year-on-year basis, there was a guidance for 2010, it looks to me it looks very aggressive now &#x2013; its too conservative is that fair to say? Should we forget that material decline year-on-year on a clean basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all let me start with the comp level discussion. Again, we have had some structural changes as you know based on the G20 requirement. We've had increased in our base salaries. We have therefore obviously in step one decreased accordingly our bonus because this was the intention of the increase in base and compensation. We continue to be very committed and monitor the market developments. We want to pay competitively. I think it's essential for the success of our franchise to pay competitively. We are observing what is happening in the market we all know &#x2013; you all know that there is sometimes quite different developments in the markets in reality then you know what you &#x2013; what your- some expectations were of what the structural changes will really do.</p>
          <p>We have increased obviously our bonus accruals because based on the good performance if this continues we will continue to have to increase bonus accruals throughout the year that has not taken the increased performance in Q1 has not yet been taken into account for the rest of the year as we did our accruals on &#x2013; what the planned 2010 year results are. So we expect our compensation not to go further down. We expected to be at this level or slightly higher throughout the year, but that depends now on how competitive environment development &#x2013; develops and how we feel that we need to pay in order to stay competitive and to retain top talent. We have switched though from base to bonus and that obviously distorts some of the numbers.</p>
          <p>The &#x2013; on the first &#x2013; on the legal issues what this threshold of materiality needs to be in excess of 1% of our equity that's the threshold of materiality that we apply. And the last question what you should expect on the material decline in sales and trading measures Anshu's guidance is still valid. I would &#x2013; yes, there is no news from our point of view and no change.</p>
          <p>We have &#x2013; in our overall sales and trading development, we observe a couple of the things that &#x2013; Anshu had predicted. You see pricing became weaker as competition set in, but we see increased volumes. We see increased market shares that all contributed to the success. And obviously we also have seen a change in the mix and the businesses where the x-generate business is strong in the beginning 2009, based on the environment, and have come now to a normalization that's also what Anshu predicted a normalization of revenues that would occur in some of the areas that kind of benefited at the end of the crisis.</p>
          <p>Now you see our strength in the credit product coming back as customers come back and as we see the classical strength of the bank kicking in and the environment supporting that. So what you see is mix changes what you see is volume improvement, what you see is market improvement and on the other hand weaker pricing and that these components mix to the development that Anshu has done. As I told you Anshu will be speaking soon at a conference and there will be a good question that you can ask him then I am sure that he will present to it in detail, but I think there is no change to what we said.</p>
