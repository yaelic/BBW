          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your patience in holding. We now have Mr. Paul Alexander in conference. Please be aware each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of the presentation, the floor will be opened for your questions. At that time, instructions will be given as to the procedure to follow if you'd like to ask a question.</p>
          <p>I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Paul Alexander. Mr. Alexander, you may begin, sir.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, David and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Tom Falk, Chairman and CEO; Mark Buthman, Senior VP and CFO; and Mike Azbell, Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Here is the agenda for this morning's call. Mark will begin with a review of our third quarter results. Then Tom will provide his perspective on the results and discuss the 2009 outlook. And that will leave us plenty of time for Q&amp;A. For those wishing to follow along, we do have a presentation of today's materials in the Investors section of our website, which is www.kimberly-clark.com.</p>
          <p>Now before we begin, let me remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call today. There can be no assurance that future events will occur as anticipated or that the company's results will be as estimated. Please refer to the Risk Factors section of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to point out that when discussing 2009 results, we will be comparing to adjusted results in 2008, which exclude charges for the strategic cost reduction plan we completed last year, and an extraordinary loss. Management believes that reporting in this manner enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results of operations. For additional information on why we made these adjustments and reconciliations to comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, please see today's news release and additional information on our website.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Paul, and good morning. I hope you had a chance to review our news release with the details of our results. I'm going to briefly review the quarter and I'd like to start with a few headlines.</p>
          <p>First, organic sales growth was about 3%, including double-digit growth in the Developing and Emerging markets and very strong performance from our Health Care business.</p>
          <p>Second, gross and operating margins both improved more than 500 basis points. That led to record earnings per share of $1.40, up more than 35% compared to a year ago. Third, cash provided by operations was up 23% to more than $790 million.</p>
          <p>Now let's cover the details of the quarter starting with sales. Overall sales decreased about 2% to $4.9 billion. A currency drag of approximately 5% more than offset underlying organic growth of 3%. Our focus on net realized revenue led to an approximate three point gain in net selling prices while sales volumes were essentially even with the prior year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the top line for each of our segments, in Personal Care, sales were down approximately 1%, including a six-point currency headwind. Organic growth of about 5% was driven by higher net selling prices of 5%, and a one-point improvement in sales volumes. Meanwhile, product mix lowered sales by 1%.</p>
          <p>In North America, organic sales were even with the prior year, as higher net selling prices of 2% were offset by lower volumes. Sales volumes for HUGGIES diapers fell about 3%, and child care volumes were down about 7%, reflecting softness in the training pants category.</p>
          <p>Despite the lower volumes, our market shares in both categories were even with last year. Elsewhere, Adult Care volumes were up at a double-digit rate; including benefits from new gender-specific DEPEND underwear, which we launched earlier in the year.</p>
          <p>Moving to Europe, Personal Care organic sales increased approximately 4%. Sales volumes were up nearly 7%, with improved performance of HUGGIES diapers in Poland and our core markets in Western Europe. Meanwhile, net selling prices were down 2% and product mix lowered sales by more than one point.</p>
          <p>In Developing and Emerging markets, Personal Care organic sales rose about 13%. Net selling prices increased 10% and sales volumes were up 4%, while product mix was off slightly. Volume highlights included double-digit growth in the fast-growing BRICIT countries and also in South Africa.</p>
          <p>Turning to Consumer Tissue, sales were down 5%, which was equal to the negative impact from currency in the quarter. Higher net selling prices and improved product mix each delivered one point of growth, but were offset by lower volumes of approximately 2%. Our volumes continue to be impacted by the effects of weakness in the economy and our focus on revenue realization.</p>
          <p>In North America, sales were down about 2%. Higher net selling prices of 2% were more than offset by lower volumes of 4%, mostly in paper towels and facial tissue. Net selling prices reflect the increases we took last year partially offset by somewhat higher competitive promotional spending.</p>
          <p>Switching to Europe, Consumer Tissue organic sales fell nearly 4% in a continued competitive environment. Net selling prices declined 2%, while sales volumes were off more than 1%. In the Developing and Emerging markets, Consumer Tissue organic sales increased 4% driven by higher net selling prices.</p>
          <p>Now moving to K-C Professional and Other, sales decreased about 5%, including a four point drag from currency. Higher net selling prices generated nearly four points of growth. However, sales volumes were down about 4% and that's net of an approximate three point benefit from the acquisition of Jackson Safety earlier in the year. K-C Professional's volumes continue to reflect the challenging economic environment, particularly in North America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Lastly, Health Care segment sales were up approximately 16%, with strong organic growth driven by volumes, which jumped 18%. One point of improved product mix was offset by lower net selling prices. Health Care volumes were up in several product categories, including double-digit growth in exam gloves for the sixth consecutive quarter. Segment volumes, particularly in medical supplies, were also benefiting from increased industry concerns regarding infection prevention.</p>
          <p>In addition, approximately 40% of the total volume growth in the quarter came from increased global demand for face masks as a result of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
          <p>Now moving to profit, margin, and cost savings, gross margins improved significantly, up 570 basis points to 35.2%. That's the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year gross margin improvement. Key drivers were price realization, cost savings and lower input costs of about $270 million. Third quarter operating profit was up 39% with an operating margin of 17.7%. That's despite negative currency effects of about $75 million and increased pension expense of approximately 25 million. Meanwhile, we continue to invest in our brands with strategic marketing up $50 million in local currency terms during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Now turning to cost savings, we had another strong quarter with total savings of $61 million. That brings our year-to-date savings to about $190 million. In terms of the strategic cost reduction plan, we realized $14 million of benefit from activities completed in 2008. Our ongoing FORCE program generated savings of $47 million in the quarter, including strong benefits from sourcing and supply chain activities.</p>
          <p>Given our strong cost savings momentum, we've raised our full-year target for the second consecutive the quarter. We now expect to deliver about $250 million in total savings, up $50 million compared to our previous target. We also started to realize benefits from our organization optimization initiative, as severance and related costs of $12 million were more than offset by related savings of $24 million.</p>
          <p>Now looking briefly about third quarter segment operating margins, our margins were up strongly across all four business segments, both year-on-year and sequentially compared to the second quarter. I'm really pleased to see the broad-based improvement in our profitability and I'm proud of the entire organization's hard work and focus on reducing costs, improving the way we work and delivering increased cash flow.</p>
          <p>Speaking of cash flow, we had another excellent performance this quarter. Cash provided by operations increased 23% to $791 million. The growth was driven by higher cash earnings and further reductions in working capital, partially offset by increased contributions to our pension plans. In terms of working capital, we improved our cash conversion cycle by a further five days compared to the second quarter. That included benefits from extending payables terms and reducing inventory levels by two days.</p>
          <p>Third quarter defined benefit pension plan contributions totaled $223 million, including a $200 million contribution to the U.S. plan that was incremental to our previous forecast. During the quarter, we decided to take the additional contribution as a result of our strong cash flow.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up the financial review. To recap the quarter, we achieved 3% organic sales growth. We delivered record earnings fueled by strong gross and operating margin improvement, and cash flow performance was outstanding.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it over to Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll give you my perspective on our third quarter results and then I'll review the outlook for the balance of the year, and then, as usual, we'll move on to your questions.</p>
          <p>In short, we're executing very well and we're making excellent progress managing the factors that we can control. And that's lead to a significant increase in our outlook for the year, while we continue to do what's right to sustain our long-term growth.</p>
          <p>So let me start with our third quarter results. As you heard from Mark, our performance was very strong in a number of areas in the quarter, including significant margin improvement, all-time record earnings per share and outstanding cash generation.</p>
          <p>Our focus on revenue realization and cost reduction helped deliver gross margin and operating margin expansion of more than 500 basis points each. We continued to manage net realized revenue well and achieved third quarter selling price benefits of about 3%.</p>
          <p>In addition, cost savings performance and management overhead spending were excellent and they reflect our company-wide focus on driving efficiencies across the organization.</p>
          <p>On the bottom line earnings per share was a record $1.40. That's up 37% compared to adjusted earnings last year. And that's despite a 15% headwind from currency, and a still relatively weak economic environment.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash flow, I'm very pleased to see our continued momentum here. Strong cash flow allows us to fund our growth initiatives and gives us additional flexibility as we maintain our strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Speaking of growth, we made additional progress with our targeted growth initiatives this quarter. In Developing and Emerging markets, organic sales rose 10%, primarily due to higher selling prices. Volumes rose 3%, up somewhat from the first half of the year. We continue to execute our growth plans in high potential markets like China, Russia, and Latin America. I'm very optimistic about our prospects in the D&amp;E markets overall, and they currently represent about one third of Kimberly-Clark's total sales.</p>
          <p>In addition, our Health Care team delivered a terrific quarter with strong sales and profit growth. We also recently announced the acquisition of I-Flow Corporation and Baylis Medical's pain management business. These transactions are consistent with our strategy to invest in the higher growth, higher margin medical device market.</p>
          <p>And then finally, the integration of Jackson Safety into our K-C Professional business is progressing well, and we're introducing more innovation into our safety business.</p>
          <p>We also continued to strengthen our brands in the third quarter. Several recent innovations delivered solid performance in the quarter, including HUGGIES Pure and Natural diapers, gender-specific DEPEND products, and our LAVENDER Nitrile exam gloves. We also supported our brands with a significant increase in strategic marketing spending. So all in all, it was a terrific third quarter. And those results are spurring a significant improvement in our outlook for the year and I'll turn to that now.</p>
          <p>In terms of the economic environment, we're assuming that business conditions will remain stable for the balance of the year. As we have all year, we'll continue to focus on our four priorities of improving margins, maximizing cash flow, pursuing targeted growth initiatives, and then further building our brands.</p>
          <p>Now this morning's news release includes several updated planning assumptions for the year and I won't repeat all the details, but the key changes are as follows: first, our organic sales are now expected to grow about 3%, and that compares to our previous assumption for the growth in the one to 2% range. The increase is coming from continued strong price realization, some volume growth in Health Care, and the modest pick-up in volume across the Developing and Emerging markets that we began to see in the third quarter. Second, as Mark already mentioned, we've increased our cost savings target for the year by 50 million. And third, given the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar, currency effects should be less negative than we previously estimated.</p>
          <p>So in short, we're ahead of our plan for the year. We're raising our earnings guidance for the second consecutive quarter. We now expect earnings per share in 2009 will be in the range of 4.50 to 4.60 per share. We expect the fourth quarter to be a strong finish to the year, even though pulp and polymer costs are expected to increase sequentially from third quarter levels and promotional activity is anticipated to rise modestly. So based on our new outlook, we would now expect full-year earnings per share to grow from nine to 11% compared to our adjusted earnings per share last year. And that's at the high-end of or even slightly above our long-range Global Business Plan objective of mid to high single-digit growth. So longer term, it's our objective to consistently deliver results that are at least in line with our Global Business Plan, while we continue to invest for future growth.</p>
          <p>So to summarize, although the current environment continues to be difficult, our worldwide teams are delivering excelling near-term results. At the same time, we're investing for our long-term success. We're building a leaner, stronger and faster company and we're confident we have the right strategies to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value for many years to come.</p>
          <p>So that wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'd be happy to begin to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question comes from Ali Dibadj from Sanford Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. I wanted to see if you could give a little bit more granularity on the emerging markets. It looks like still a lot of pricing driving the growth there. You mentioned, Tom, volume coming back a little bit, it looks like, but they're still lower than I guess anticipated at 4% for Personal Care and slightly down, it sounds like, for Consumer Tissue. So a little bit more granularity, maybe breaking it up even by region might be helpful, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you look at the markets we've been driving like China, Russia, Turkey, you saw a consistent solid volume growth going on there. On the tissue front, generally, you saw us more pushing for revenue realization. We had a little bit of volume growth this quarter, but overall continue to drive revenue growth. Some of the bigger markets like Australia and Korea are still relatively slower growing and so didn't see a huge volume up-tick in either of those locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But you said you're seeing it's starting to look a little bit better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say sequentially. It's still off if you look year-over-year from the kind of rates we were seeing in emerging markets a little over a year ago, but sequentially it seemed like things were picking up. We had a terrific quarter in China, for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it looks like both in the Emerging markets as also I've seen in the developed world, a lot of the growth driven by pricing. I guess I'm a little surprised by that. I thought the competitor environment might step up a little bit, given all the rhetoric that's out there and certainly given what's happened to commodities. It doesn't seem like you're seeing that. Are you anticipating more of that, or am I just reading it wrong?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'd say in the emerging markets often you find pricing and currency are sort of mirror images of each other. So as the dollar was relatively strong, you saw a lot more price, particularly as many of the underlying commodities that go into these products are sold, are priced in dollars. So as the dollar has weakened over the last couple of months and certainly heading into the fourth quarter, I'd expect to see that, that pricing improvement wane certainly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then the developed world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Developed world, really, we've basically hung on to most of the price increases. And as you've seen, commodity costs move up pretty consistently this year, and now most of the price increases have annualized. The noise level has died down a little bit. You're seeing some retailer price movement, where they're taking price down on their own account to stimulate demand in some areas. You're seeing a little bit of price point skirmishing around promotion prices in tissue, which we'll be responsive to in the fourth quarter. But broadly in Personal Care, the pricing dynamic has died down quite a bit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you surprised by that at all, or not really?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what's happened is, as the branded prices got established and oil has hung in where it has and a lot of the commodities have stayed up there all year, now private label has actually moved up on price broadly, probably six months after the branded guys did. You're seeing relative stability at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I'm sorry, last question just on Consumer Tissue. It looks like that's still -- you mentioned it, pretty tough on volumes for sure. What's the plan of action going forward? Is it around pricing, more pricing and more promotion that we don't actually start seeing negative volumes going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the area we probably had the biggest volume hits this quarter in the U.S. in particular were in towels and in facial tissue. Bath tissue overall was broadly okay. We'd like to see a little bit better mix with Cottonelle, so we will be focusing primarily on Cottonelle, on our facial tissue business, to make sure we've got those on track. And then we've got some targeted programs on towels, so some innovation happening on Viva and some other things that we'll roll out late this year and into next year to get those moving in the right direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Chris Ferrara with the Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. So just I guess with things like production curtailment hitting you by I think $0.23 this year, restructuring $0.26, incremental pension $0.26, it obviously looks like you have somewhat of a head start in 2010, and I think that's kind of the debate around the stock. So I guess what's your philosophical perspective on I guess sort of balancing reinvestment, and delivering results that are just in line with the Global Business Plan versus letting some stuff drop to the bottom line? I guess how are you thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, for me, Chris, I'd like to be in a position to consistently deliver at the Global Business Plan kind of levels for a long period of time. And I think that that's the right way to create shareholder value. And so we were very aggressive on costs this year to really react to the economic environment. And hopefully that'll set itself up to deliver on the Global Business Plan and be able to invest in innovation and the future of the business to the levels that we'd like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I guess, but it sort of seems like, I mean given all of the drag that you have in 2009, right, as you get into 2010, it seems like either one of two things has to happen, either some of the stuff drops to the bottom line or you're going to have plenty of room to reinvest at a greater rate than you've seen even this year? I mean does that make sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you're also seeing some commodity costs acceleration that's happened in the fourth quarter, and we'll see how that plays out and we'll give you more color on our 2010 planning assumptions in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. Just I guess one quick one sort of a follow-up, I mean I guess you guys had been saying that private label had seemed to settle down, lose some momentum and I think you're still sort of saying that now in the scanner data, and again, given we know all the shortcomings of scanner data. It seems to show that private label has picked up pretty dramatically in most of the paper categories, at least in the track channel. Are you seeing a further separation in private label trends in track versus non-track channels in tissue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we haven't seen as big of a share pick-up in our overall data that we look at on a total market basis. You've seen a little bit in towels. That's probably been the biggest area. And then maybe secondly would be facial tissue. Bath tissue broadly, we're not seeing as big of a move.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Hi. Your commented that commodities inputs would be up sequentially from third to fourth quarter, but I'm just wondering, I mean, spot prices are up for things like plastic resin in the fourth quarter. But will your costs actually be up or down generally in the fourth quarter of '09 for commodities?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Versus prior year, year-over-year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, versus prior year, it's kind of a mixed bag. It's Northern softwood will actually be higher versus prior year. Eucalyptus and fluff pulp used in the Personal Care business will actually still be lower. A lot of the polymer costs, it's going to be pretty consistent with prior year, so it will be up sequentially, but it's going to be pretty consistent with where we were last year. And you may have some other -- some upsides in things like super absorbent will be lower than prior year, even though they may be up a little bit sequentially. And it will be kind of a mixed bag versus prior year, but it will all be up sequentially fourth quarter versus third quarter.</p>

          <p>Linda, this is Paul. Our full-year guidance is for deflation of six to $700 million and through nine months, we've got about 525 million. So overall, as Tom described, we'll still be getting some benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But certainly, I would think come first quarter 2010, you're going to be looking at an increase year-over-year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then can you just comment on the strategic spending, the spending increase of 50 million. That's a pretty big number, I mean, usually it's 20, 25 million increase. Is that kind of the right level or is that based on certain launch schedules. So what can we kind of think about going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it was actually -- it was 30 million in actual P&amp;L numbers. On constant currency, it was 50. And so in terms of what actually hit the P&amp;L, it's closer to the number that you had quoted. And so I'd say we're spending consistent with our marketing plan for the year pretty much across-the-board. And so our teams are executing the plan well and using the opportunity to be able to drive some innovation behind our brands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just can I ask about diaper pricing? We saw in our recent store check a decline in shelf prices for both Pampers and HUGGIES of about, oh, I don't know, 8% or so. Is that accurate or is that just Wal-Mart or is that promotion or what is that, that we're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you're seeing selected retailers take prices down in some categories that they're funding for the most part. And so you've seen announcements by a number of major mass and grocery retailers that they're going to spin back to try and stimulate traffic in the fourth quarter. And so, that is -- some of it's funded by other promotions that we had scheduled, but that would only fund a portion of the reduction that you're seeing.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Lauren.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. The first thing I wanted to ask about was why you're looking for such a significant sequential deterioration in margins, because margins this quarter as you said across the board were actually the highest you've seen in years. So what was unique about the third quarter? When you look by division sequentially you think margins should be down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'd say, if you look at -- our guidance sort of implies that our margins for the fourth quarter will be consistent with the average year-to-date for the year roughly. And so we're going to have some higher commodity costs, it's probably going to be roughly $0.10 a share of drag just from what we're seeing happening in pulp and polymer, and oil carrying us forward. We've gotten all the price probably that we're going to get, because most of those price increases went into effect in the third quarter, early fourth quarter of last year. So we're annualized most of that and so you'll have some additional cost drag sequentially and not have any significant revenue up-tick to help offset that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So is the pricing lag, are you expecting an up-tick in volume in the consumer businesses simply because of the absence of pricing or is it something else you're seeing? Because I'm just having trouble actually getting to the -- at least 3% if I assume there's not much pricing in the fourth quarter, organic sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, if you looked at our year-to-date price realization, it's probably at or slightly above what we expect to get for the full year in terms of the dollars that we've already realized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I'm just trying to understand the volume outlook for the consumer businesses in Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say, it would be pretty similar to Q3, maybe slightly better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And remember that the fourth quarter of last year has easier comparison to sale.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then, if I can just ask a bit about the long-term. I guess, what's the long-term plan when you think about the Consumer Tissue business, because margins are now fully recovered, so the revenue realization strategy has absolutely worked. But now we're on to seven quarters of negative volume growth and then it's eight, if you say flat or negative. So what do you want -- if you look into 2010 and beyond, what do you want this business to look like? Is it low single-digit volume growth holding these margins? Is it we don't care about revenue growth too much as long as we've got a healthy profit perspective?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what we're trying to do is really drive mix and innovation behind our strong brands in segments where we think we've got a right to win. So looking at driving innovation behind Kleenex facial tissue, Cottonelle, and Viva in the U.S. We've got a strong position in Scott Tissue with a very loyal consumer base, so we'll hold that and we'll drive more of our innovation and try and shift our mix more toward those value-added segments.</p>
          <p>We're doing that in markets like Brazil, where we had a lot of our business in the one-ply value tissue segment. We've been able to shift that to the two-ply premium tissue segment. And so you take sometimes a volume hit while you're going through that, but you get a huge revenue advantage and a gross margin advantage. And then you've got some room in the P&amp;L to drive innovation and start to sell moist tissue and start to sell other value-added things that would go with that. And so each of our tissue businesses around the world has a set of strategies around how do you do that.</p>
          <p>Where have you got the permission to grow a premium segment and bring innovation, and how do you shift your existing capacity to that over time as opposed to saying, no, we're going to keep the low-end value position, and we're going to go invest and add capacity to grow the premium segment. We're really trying to play more of a mix game in tissue to reposition our business to a place where we can make more money.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it structurally the margins of that business should be higher going forward than they were at the 2000 to 2003 period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you think, now we went through a huge spike in pulp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our channels there is the more premium you can make it, the better you can insulate yourself from that, because if you've got really low gross margins, you've got nowhere to go once pulp moves.</p>

          <p>Good morning, guys.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jason.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a question. I'm wondering if you could just talk about, I think right now you have ongoing conversations with some of your key retailers for the planograms for next year. So kind of hearing a little bit more about some of these retailers pushing private label, so it kind of adds on to a question asked earlier.</p>
          <p>I mean how do you feel going into -- I guess into early next year, maybe talking about the innovation, bringing out in terms of shelf resets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what we've seen up to this point in all of our conversations with key retailers is they want innovation on the shelf, and so they're driving to get that. But they also want a more efficient shelf, so they may not want you to have four different pack size variants of the exact same product. They're going to push you to say, can you do that with two, or can you do that with three? And can we -- so I can make room for more innovation to be on the marketplace and then they look at private label as a margin game. And so they're trying to balance velocity and growth and innovation with margin, like so many of the suppliers are.</p>
          <p>I'd say broadly what we've found is we've gotten the distribution we're looking for for our key innovations. As you look at the things we've done this year with Scott Naturals, with HUGGIES Pure and Natural, with our DEPEND for men, and DEPEND for women, the gender-specific launches, we've gotten all the distribution we've been seeking there. And so far those things are performing about like we would have hoped.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I guess on that same note, I mean clearly emerging markets is the strength right now in the portfolio, but that longer term, three to five, this year you should hit the low end of the range. As price does roll off, and I guess it goes back to an earlier question, can you just talk about maybe in the developed markets how the acceleration that you're anticipating. I mean is it really going to be more innovation-driven? Is it going to be a little bit more promotional-driven, getting back into that three to five swing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The goal is to drive more innovation. I mean that's where we're really going to build a sustainable long-term advantage. Promotion, usually, you're just kind of renting your consumer and so with real innovation, you can build your brand and keep his business a lot longer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Connie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I also have questions about the volume declines in the U.S. in Consumer Tissue and Personal Care. When would you expect to see volumes increase, because if my reading of it was right, everything declined with the exception of DEPEND? So when do you expect volumes to increase and what do you think is a good long-term growth rate across the categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have easier comparisons in the fourth quarter for most of our North American consumer businesses. So we should start to see, particularly in Personal Care, better volume performance sequentially pretty much across the board.</p>
          <p>I'd say in addition to DEPEND, our baby wipes business, I think is performing pretty well. You saw some better share performance there. We'll see what happens in tissue. We'd say within tissue, our bathroom tissue business performed okay in the quarter. The big weak spots were facial tissue and towels. So we'll have a better comparison sequentially as we start to head into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The decline in inventory days has been very consistent all year and pretty remarkable. Is this a new level of -- I mean, are these days at 55, 57, are these good numbers for going forward? Can you run your business with this sort of inventory level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we hope so. We're finding out as we speak. So we -- a little bit of the volume soft spot in the third quarter was we were very aggressive on bringing inventories down in the first half of the year as you noted. And we were a little tight on customer service in a couple of areas in the third quarter and we're pretty much through that as we speak.</p>
          <p>But one of the things our teams are focused on is how do we run the business with less inventory and you've got to have good planning and forecasting processes. You've got to have an efficient product lineup and then you've got to have the right capability to be able to make a good broad part of your product line at multiple facilities, be able to do that. And so we're working on all three of those things to ensure that we can sustain our working capital performance going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have specific targets for working capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, each business has a long-range target for working capital looking at where should the receivables be based on their credit terms? Looking at each element of inventory and how they can target to get to a certain days of inventory in their system, and then managing payables. Maybe Mark can elaborate and add a little bit more color on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Connie, the -- we've set both near and longer term targets for the -- all the businesses around the world. If you think about how we progressed this year, really the U.S. and Europe provided most of the working capital jump in the first half of the year. A lot of the third quarter benefit came from Developing and Emerging markets, and they've got some really aggressive plans.</p>
          <p>You can imagine that their supply chains are a little longer, a little more complex. So we've got actually room to continue to improve in the Developing and Emerging markets. And things like terms with suppliers in this environment, we're not just looking at inventories, but we're looking at customer collections in terms of suppliers. So each of the businesses in each of the geographies around the world have both near and long-term objectives that they're trying to drive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can ask one more question. How much of the third quarter upside would you attribute to things that are not likely to repeat next year, swine flu-related sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we gave you kind of the dimension that was about 40% of the Health Care volume improvement and -- but I'd say that there are so many big moving parts with what's going on with commodity costs and currency that it's a difficult question to answer. I think the -- if you look at the P&amp;L and say there wasn't anything that was really unusual that was in the numbers, it was a pretty clean quarter from that perspective. We hope the economic environment is a little better by this time next year, so you'll see a little bit better underlying volume growth. As to the costs and currency, it seems like it's tough to call that even one quarter out. So we'll see what environment we're in when we get there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Tom. Going back to the swine flu, the strength in Health Care, do you have visibility to how sustained that volume might be? I mean how much is sort of stocking up as opposed to using the products and reordering them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's hard to tell. One of the things we've been doing, though, is working for months now with our key hospital partners to help them plan for what they think they're going to need to be ready for the kind of crisis that we're seeing now, and many of the more progressive Health Care institutions have done just that. I think everyone is sort of finding their way through this. I would guess they'd all say the swine flu has spread faster and farther than maybe it was anticipated, and so we're having ongoing dialog as to how we can continue to be there and supply our key partners. So our guess is it'll carry into early 2010 at this point in time, but probably begin to wane as we get into the latter part of the first quarter. But we'll just have to watch and see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then separately, how much of the FORCE savings in your upward guidance to savings is kind of unsustainable, if we assume that there's an economic recovery and volumes improve. I'm just a sort of coming at it with the assumption that some of the savings are volume-related or depressed growth-related and therefore they may not be sustainable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I mean, usually when we're taking downtime, it actually hurts our FORCE productivity numbers. So we went very aggressive at our FORCE program this year and in this kind of a weak environment, we were very aggressive with our suppliers and got probably better than expected negotiated cost savings. I also think part of our FORCE benefit this year as comparing to last year where we weren't very good on productivity. We had a lot of unscheduled downtime and maintenance failures and things like that. So just the comparisons have helped us a little bit this year.</p>
          <p>But as we look at our long-range supply chain, we continue to believe we've got a very strong FORCE program going forward for years to come, probably not at the same level that we saw this year, more in the range of the 150 million a year that we've traditionally done, so we pushed it harder this year and we'll be at the very high end of our expectations, but we've got a good robust pool of cost savings ahead of us.</p>

          <p>Hey. Good morning. I wanted to say this for a long time, but you guys are on a roll.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's no extra charge for the comedy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Wal Mart's meeting yesterday talking about big price reinvestment, I mean what are the implications for you guys in the industry about some of this pretty aggressive commentary?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're seeing, not just with them, Safeway's run ads with the same kind of a program, so you're seeing multiple retailers really seeing probably their sales be a little stagnant and their spending price to go try to stimulate demand from a competitive standpoint. I mean, our focus is more on trying to drive innovation and differentiation and not compete on price. We're going to be competitive, obviously, where we need to be, but that's not a good way to differentiate yourself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then it seems like you're kind of taking more of a premium tact now, so like as an example Scott towels, I think Target pretty much delisted, out of Walgreens, dramatically taken back at CVS, I think the ACB is down to 25%. So is this a conscious decision by the company to kind of focus more on the premium tier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think what you're finding though is maybe more focus on distribution. So if you were in Sam's Club, you'd find a very good selection of Scott towels and we've still got good distribution in Wal Mart. And so what you're finding is that different outlets are deciding how they want to play in carrying fewer brand, so -- but then you're winning in some places and you're gaining what you lost at other places. And so we still think there's a role for Scott towels to play in the segment. It's a terrific towel and it's in the value segment, and it's one that we're going to continue to sustain, but we're probably going to focus more of our innovation resources on how do we drive Viva, where there's more revenue opportunity, more opportunity to differentiate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it is kind of a conscious decision, because you also talked about driving Cottonelle as well. So it seems like the whole portfolio is kind of migrating closer to the premium side. Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's not really a new phenomena I'd say. Where you can get better margin, that's where you want to drive more of your innovation and focus.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say around the world, too. We've got a multi-tier diaper strategy in many of our Developing and Emerging markets, and make good money across those tiers. I think partly it's market-driven as well as just our conscious portfolio choices.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I have one housekeeping question, which is your organic growth was 3%. Can we break that down by geographic region? In other words, I think organic growth in North America, adjusting out currency and the acquisition, was maybe flat. Is that true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul can give you some of the details on geographic area. I don't if we've got it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that sounds about right, Alice. We can talk in detail separately. We tend to look at it by segment, by geography.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I know. And was it sort of down 2% in Europe and then up 10% in Developing markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's about right. It was up 10% in Developing markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And then I only have one other question, and that's on diapers and training pants. You're saying that your volume was down 3% for HUGGIES and down 7% for child care and yet you held share.</p>
          <p>And can you explain to me how consumer -- is the consumer purchasing is really down that much for those categories? Or are your shipments worse than your sales at retail? In other words, are retailers still destocking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, in training pants, what you could also see is we got Little Swimmers in there, and so sequentially going from second to third quarter, you always see a dip from that standpoint. As you look at PULL-UPS overall, the category is declining some, and so that's part of the phenomenon, as moms are staying in diapers a little bit longer.</p>
          <p>On diapers, our share was pretty flat year-over-year, and that volume swing could track retailer inventory or a level of promotion. If you shipped in a lot prior to the end of a quarter for a promotion, you could see a swing like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I would also say dollar shares are flat year-on-year. We may have -- the value segment may have taken a few more -- a little bit more volume, it could be -- have gotten excess out too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you may have less share in volume terms but held it in dollar terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps, but if we did, it would have been a very small.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty minor, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to think that people are actually using less diapers in volume terms particularly because people are using less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say the overall category is pretty flat for the year. So within a quarter, though, you can see a couple of percent swing either way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, there have been quarters where we had better volume growth and our share was also flat and so just you're going to see a little bit of noise from retailer inventory change there in the data.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from John Faucher with JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Quick question for me. Obviously, trends came in better than you anticipated over the course of the quarter, so can you talk a little bit about that incremental 50 million in strategic marketing spending, where that came in relative to what you guys were thinking at the beginning of the quarter? And I guess that highlights just sort of why you maybe didn't take the opportunity to spend a little bit more back?</p>
          <p>And then the second question would be related to the gross margin. It's the first time I think in basically seven years you guys have had a 35% plus gross margin. I realize you're going to see inflation coming back a little bit here. But can you talk to us about sort of an absolute gross margin number and how we should think about that over the next -- not the next quarter or two, but really over the next two to three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say on the gross margin front, we certainly feel good about being back close to where we were four or five years ago after having seen margins drop for almost five years straight, seeing a nice bounce back felt good. So obviously, those sustaining gross margins at these kind of levels and even growing beyond that is our long-range goal. It's a question of how long it will take to get there and I think getting -- our GBP would call for a gross margin improvement in the 30 to 40 basis points a year and similar improvement in operating margin and we think that's probably a realistic goal for us long term to be thinking about. So that's what we focus on.</p>
          <p>In terms of the A&amp;P front, we basically spent to our plan for the year and so as the quarter unfolded obviously, we're turning out a little better than we thought. The challenge is if you reinvest, you want to reinvest with effect and get good ROI from the spend and not just dump money into the market place. And so we spent where we thought we had an impact, where we could drive innovation and where we had the ability to support the business if we were able to drive volume. So I'd say that the team is executing the plan pretty well as the year's unfolded.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which means it's your best year, too, in your current seat.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, one thing that struck me was the K-C Professional sequential improvement revenue, which was quite a jump when you consider the time of the year usually you think of it. I always think of the second being stronger than the third, but was there anything unusual there that you saw that might maybe be indicative of the economy? And why do you think that the revenues jumped so much sequentially there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had the Jackson Safety acquisition, which begun to be blended in there and so that was a little bit of it. We continued to see the year-over-year benefit of price, so we had some pretty big price in the fourth quarter of last year and so that's going to annualize coming up here. But we've been able to hang on to most of that. If you look at the U.S. and European businesses, you're still seeing volumes down pretty substantial.</p>
          <p>I just was in Europe a few weeks ago with our team over there and it's not that anybody's losing business to anybody. It's just that the customers don't need as much, because of the unemployment level. We don't have many people in the workplace. So I'd say that hasn't changed that much. Emerging markets picked up a bit in the quarter. So we saw a better performance in K-CP outside the U.S. and Europe this quarter from a volume standpoint, and that might be a bit of the up-tick that you saw.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, I got on a little bit late, but on the pension, you all have put, obviously put a lot of money in this year and I would guess you've timed the market pretty fortuitously. And so as you look, I know it's early days, and you measure it at year-end, and I know interest rates are up, and those all have impacts. But do you have an early guess...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Interest rates are down actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I meant down, excuse me, which makes the liability go up, excuse me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you take an early look at next year, can you give us a rough idea? I would imagine that the level of contribution would, if things stay where they are today, would be substantially lower. And any guess as to what the actual expensing change would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If we -- continuing at the kind of rate that we've earned this year and with the money that we put into the plan and where we think the discount rate will fall, we would have substantially lower contributions to the U.S. plan in 2010. Remember, we've also decided to close the U.S. plan at the end of this year and so that further helps the liability a bit and all that's been disclosed in the Q. And going forward, you can kind of do the math with what's in there. You expect to see a drop in pension expense and we'll give you more color on what that looks like in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally, could you talk a little bit about how you see next year if we froze things today? You gave us your sort of pulp outlook for the fourth quarter and what you expect your costs to be. If we assume the dollar stayed at these levels and didn't go up or down, do you think that the pulp fiber headwind is bigger than the currency tailwind? Is it too early to tell? How do you look at that for going into 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's some -- again, as it has been the case over the last number of quarters, big moving pieces and so it seems like everyday they are moving a bit more. So we'll give you more specific guidance in 2010. At this point in time, we think we've done the right things in 2009 to give us the momentum that we need to thrive in whatever environment we're going to face next year. So we think we've got the organization where we want it to be. We're stepping up our innovation in key areas and so we think we'll enter the year with a decent level of momentum.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. I was just wondering since we've touched on extensively on the Tissue and Personal Care businesses, I was wondering if you could touch a bit on the Health Care deals that you guys have done. And I guess we're starting to see you guys broaden beyond into kind of low-end medical devices. Is this a strategic shift? Is this a place where we expect to see you guys invest more capital going forward? I was wondering if you can just kind of frame up what the thinking is on some of the deals that you're doing there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, sure. The Baylis deal is one that -- interestingly we've been selling those products in the U.S. as their exclusive distributor since 2001. So we really acquired the U.S. distribution part of Baylis with the Ballard acquisition back in 2001. And so that license was going to expire at the end of this year. Baylis wanted to sell the rest of their business and so we looked at that as an opportunity to basically retain the value of what we had and even integrate it further into our business. So that one was a very easy logical extension and should be a pretty straightforward integration.</p>
          <p>On the I-Flow deal, because it's the subject of a tender offer at the moment, I can't say too much about the integration, but it is consistent with our view to continue to extend our business into medical devices. We think there is substantial capacity in the I-Flow sales force that we can continue to bring a broader bundle of innovation to and should help us increase our scale and our call point access at the key physician call points. So we're excited about both deals and we think they're on trend and consistent with our Health Care strategy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just kind of from a broader perspective, I mean, Health Care is only six or 7% of your revenues now. Is this a business that's going to be 10% plus of your revenues in five years if you pursue a more aggressive acquisition strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think this is the first time in a while that we've actually seen some deals that a strategic buyer can get near, because there aren't many private equity guys around. So in this environment, we may see some opportunities. Our Health Care team will be busy for a while integrating these two deals and then we'll see what else comes along. I think 10% might be a stretch, but we're certainly looking to grow that as a percent of our mix a bit over time.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, thanks. I didn't expect to quite get back in. Just quickly then on pricing dynamics in the away from home business. So was that also under the halo where you said earlier that the pricing sort of rolling off, you're lapping everything, but there was pulp going the wrong way. Are you still going to be taking more pricing then away from home business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have contracts that rollover every day in that business and so we're still getting some price, but it's at a much lower level and we'll see as -- got a lot of things rollover in December and we'll see what -- how that plays out. What I'd say at this point is that obviously the strength in secondary fiber helps us as we're going through this kind of a pricing discussion and we'll see if it will help us get a little bit more price as we push through the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Linda Bolton-Weiser with Caris &amp; Company.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just I was curious that your expected annualized savings from the organization optimization, is this a little bit lower than originally stated? Is that because the head count reduction is less? I can't remember what you said in terms of this, was it 1,600 positions before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I think some of it's fine-tuning estimates, and particularly in D&amp;E, who are getting down to actual salaries and so forth of who's leaving. So I'd say that's about all I'd read into it. Basically, we're executing the plan as we had laid out.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one follow-up. In the fourth quarter, you mentioned you were going to have the specific initiative on Consumer Tissue. Can you talk a little bit about what that is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean I don't think we said a specific initiative. We continue to spend money, promoting Cottonelle and driving that business forward. We've got some innovation coming probably be more like first quarter and some of our other tissue categories. We're rolling out our facial tissue improvement, as we speak, across the main line of facial tissue. But other than that, I'm not aware of anything specific that we've talked about.</p>

          <p>Well, once again we had a terrific quarter. Our team is executing well. We feel great about the earnings growth and cash flow and margin improvement. And we continue to appreciate your support of Kimberly-Clark. Thank you.</p>
