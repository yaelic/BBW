        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Debbie and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco first quarter results. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Debbie. Good morning to everyone.</p>
          <p>This morning's press release reviews our first quarter fiscal 2011 operating results for the 12 weeks that ended November 21st. As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>To begin with, our 12-week first quarter operating results. For the quarter, our earnings per share came in at $0.71, an 18% increase over last year's first quarter earnings per share of $0.60. Three items I'll quickly note here.</p>
          <p>First, last year in first quarter, we enjoyed very strong gasoline profits. As many of you know, when gasoline prices are flat or falling, Costco's gasoline operations can be quite profitable, and when prices are rising, they can be less profitable. This year's first quarter, gasoline operations were profitable, but less profitable than a year ago, to the tune of a little over $0.03 a share.</p>
          <p>Second, you'll note that our income tax rate is almost 2 percentage points lower year over year: 36.1% last year in the first quarter compared to 34.2% tax rate this year. In the first quarter this year, one of our foreign operations received a tax refund in connection with a tax loss in 2007. At that time, no tax benefit had been recorded due to the uncertainty of the refund claim. During the first quarter of '11 here, the issue was resolved and the refund issued. It reduced our first quarter 2011 provision for income taxes by approximately $9.6 million. The impact to our first quarter EPS, however, was a benefit of about $0.01, not $0.02. That's because half of it, or $4.8 million &#x2013; half of that benefit, half of the 9.6 &#x2013; is backed out on the non-controlling interest line down below. So again the two things I mentioned here, a little over $0.03 benefit from gas and a detriment of gas year over year, and a benefit of about a penny here due to this unusual tax item.</p>
          <p>And the third item, as I mentioned in our fiscal year-end conference call, effective the start of fiscal '11, our current fiscal year, we have begun consolidating the results of the operations of our Mexico joint venture. Historically these operations were treated as an equity method investment. Thus we already reported our 50% share of the joint venture's net income within the non-operating interest income and other line item on our income statement. As of the beginning of this fiscal year back in September, we are required to adopt a new accounting method, which makes it appropriate to fully consolidate the Costco Mexico joint venture into our statements. In effect, it adds approximately 2% to 3% to top line sales, assets, and liabilities. 100% of the venture's financial statements are now included in our P&amp;L and balance sheet and cash flow. And then the 50% portion held by our joint venture partner is backed out at the bottom of our income statement to offset it. That's in the line item called net income attributable to non-controlling interests, such that there's no effect to Costco's bottom line or earnings per share. It does impact our discussion of gross margin, SG&amp;A, and earnings basis points, and I'll discuss that as we go along here in the conference.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figures for first quarter showed a 7% increase, 5% in the U.S. and 14% internationally. Excluding gas price changes and the impact of FX, the 5% reported U.S. comp would actually be 4 for the fiscal first quarter, and the 14% international comp reported would be a 10 in local currencies. And overall, the 7% that we reported for a total company comp would be at 5%. The comp figures, by the way, do include Mexico in both years for calculation, so that it is an apples-to-apples comparison as it relates to that.</p>
          <p>Other topics of interest I'll review, our opening activities and plans. We opened a total of eight new locations during Q1, which ended November 21st. Seven of these eight openings were in the U.S., including one new business center, and the eighth new location was in Alberta, Canada. For all of fiscal 2011, our current plan is 27 units, net new locations &#x2013; 29, but two of those relocations &#x2013; 15 of which would be in the U.S. And as I mentioned, two relocations. Since Q1 end on November 21st, we've opened two new locations, one in Minnesota and one in the state of Washington. So we now operate 582 locations around the world.</p>
          <p>Also this morning I'll touch on our online results, our membership trends, some discussion about margins and SG&amp;A of course, stock repurchase activities, and as you know, from the last quarter or so we include in our press release our balance sheet, so we won't go through that.</p>
          <p>Okay, the discussion of our results. Very briefly, sales for the quarter were 18.8 billion, up 11% from last year's 16.9 billion. If you exclude Mexico &#x2013; this is not apples-to-apples, it's included in this year, not in last year &#x2013; without these sales the 11% increase would have been 8% on a total basis. On a reported comp basis, Q1 comps, as I mentioned, were 7%; excluding gas price changes and FX, were up 5%. Again, on a comparable basis, those numbers include Mexico both years.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, our 7% reported comp sales number was a combination of an average transaction increase of a little over 2% for the quarter and an average frequency increase of 5% for the quarter, so continuing very strong frequency, now going on a almost complete second year at relatively strong frequency, shopper frequency numbers. I might mention that the average transaction increase of 2%, that figure would be slightly positive if you excluded gas inflation and the FX issues. In terms of cannibalization, it continues not to be a big issue. About 35 basis points in the fiscal quarter, not that different from past months and quarters.</p>
          <p>In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, keep in mind both for the quarter and the month that we reported &#x2013; the month of November, which we reported last week, the combination of FX and gas is right around 200, about 2 percentage points, FX being 110 to 130 basis points and gas being 65 to 80 basis points. Geographically, Northwest has really been consistent for the past several fiscal quarters, continuing in the mid-single positive percentage range. California has trended upward overall over the last several quarters and months, particularly in November it showed its strongest recent month. The rest of the United States, Northeast in the low to mid-positive singles, Southeast in the mid to high singles positive, and Midwest in the high singles. In every U.S. region except the Northwest, where we had freezing snow and ice for two or three days leading up &#x2013; the Monday through Wednesday before Thanksgiving, November was the best comp-sales month during the three months of September and October and November. And even in the Northwest, even though November was impacted by that last week in November, November overall for the Midwest was in the mid-singles.</p>
          <p>Internationally in local currencies we're doing quite well. In local currencies, U.K. is the weakest foreign region, slightly positive. All other countries are fine in local currencies, in the plus 10% to plus 35% range in local currencies.</p>
          <p>In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter &#x2013; and again that's mostly September, October, and the first three weeks of November &#x2013; within food and sundries, comps were in the mid-single digit positive, with candy, deli, and refrigerated being relative standouts. We're starting to see the beginning of some inflationary pressures in some of the food-related areas, but not a lot of impact in our Q1 figures. More important to November, I think, and going forward, we'll see some inflationary pressures.</p>
          <p>Our hardlines sales showed slightly positive comps overall, with mid to high single-digit negative comps in electronics, offset by sales strength in tires and automotive and sporting goods, office supplies, and hardware. Within the positive softlines comps, which are actually in the low positive double digits, housewares, jewelry, and special events were particular standouts, with many of the other departments &#x2013; small appliances, domestics, home furnishings &#x2013; up nicely as well. Media continues to be the struggling department, no surprise, starting with relative industry weakness in CDs a few years back, and DVDs and books, with the pressure of other forms of distributing those items.</p>
          <p>Fresh foods, up in the very high singles overall. Standouts in fresh foods continue to be both meat, beef and produce, but also categories including bakery and deli were up as well. Again, we are seeing some inflationary pressures impacting fresh food prices. Our buyers in that area estimated that in Q1 that represented perhaps up to 3% of inflationary pressures. Anecdotally, steak prices are up year over year 15% per pound. The entire &#x2013; what they call the beef complex, which is everything, both imported, exported, and all parts of beef, was up about 4% on average. So steaks, which is what our strength is, has had the most inflationary pressure. Poultry, not up yet a lot, but coming. Overall, beef, chicken, pork, the estimates are that you'd expect over the next six months to see perhaps inflation in the 5% to 10% range. On the bakery side, soybeans and soy oil are up 50% to 60% year over year. Sugar up 20%, butter up 5%, and wheat up 30% year over year. So the raw materials in bakery are good. In bakery, we've been trying to hold prices as long as we can. So we've actually incurred lower margins in Q1 in the bakery. Notwithstanding that, the strength in margins in meat and produce more than offset that, so overall fresh foods margins in Q1 were up year over year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the line items on the income statement. Membership, 415.8 million or 2.21% in the first quarter. That's up 10.2% in dollars and down 2 basis points, up about $38 million overall. We consider that a good showing. Strong renewal rates. We've actually cracked the 88% number, and continue to see increasing penetration of the Executive membership. Our new membership signups in Q1 companywide were up 1% year over year. Actually stronger in the U.S. because if you recall in the fall of '09, Q4 of '09, we had incredible signups in some of these new Asia and Australia markets that we opened in, and very strong signups going into Q1 of '10. So we're comparing against that this year. But nonetheless companywide up about 1%.</p>
          <p>In terms of numbers of members at Q1-end &#x2013; and I'll give you two columns, at year-end and at Q1-end. Gold Star members 22.5 million at the year-end, back in August, and 23.5 million now. Primary Business, 5.8 and 6.2 &#x2013; at first quarter-end, 6.2. Business add-on, 3.3 and 3.6. So all told, 31.6 million member households as of Q4-end and 33.3 million as of Q1-end. Including spouse cards, 58 million cardholders at year-end and 61.2 at Q1-end. I'll make a note that the 58.0 at year-end would have been 60.8 with Mexico included. So still an increase overall. At November 21st, first quarter-end, paid Executive members, $10.76 million, an increase of just under 300,000 or 3% since 12 weeks earlier at fiscal year-end. So we're still either converting or signing up as new, 24,000 members per week as Executive members. Executive members represent about a third of our member base and a little over two-third of our sales, certainly an important member for Costco.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they've strengthened. For the quarter they ended up at 88.2% versus 87.7% at fiscal year-end. Remember, these renewal rates include just the U.S. and Canada, which totaled just under 90% of our total company. The newer regions, where we've opened newer locations, we start off with a lower renewal rate. But overall, those two have trended upward.</p>
          <p>Going down the gross margin line, year over year we were up 9 basis points, 10.97 versus a 10.88. And again, I'll just jot down three columns here. Core merchandising would be line item one; ancillary businesses, line item two; 2% reward, line item three; LIFO, line item four; total, with line item five; and I'll add two new line items, six and seven. That would be Mexico, would be the impact of Mexico, and then the company without Mexico. And I'm just doing that to share with you how much of the 9 related to Mexico. Mexico works on a little higher margin and works on a little lower SG&amp;A. So that impacts both of those figures for our company.</p>
          <p>All told &#x2013; and again, three columns: fiscal '10 overall, Q4 '10, and Q1 '11. Scrolling across, our core merchandising was up 6 basis points year over year for all of fiscal 10, up 5 basis points for the fourth quarter, and up 19 for Q1. Ancillary, plus 3, plus 8, and minus 9. 2% reward &#x2013; this just simply reflects the increasing penetration of the Executive sales and the associated reward with that. A minus 2 basis points in all of '10, minus 1 in Q4, and minus 1 in Q1 of '11. LIFO was minus 5 in all of fiscal '10, minus 8 basis points in Q4, and not an issue in Q1, 0. And totaling, plus 2 basis points &#x2013; so in all of fiscal '10, we had reported gross margin 2 basis points higher year over year &#x2013; Q4 plus 4 basis points, and Q1 plus 9. Now, the only thing in the last two line items would be in the rightmost column of Q1. Mexico represented plus 3 basis points. So without Mexico, it would be plus 6 for the company.</p>
          <p>Now, as you can see, our overall reported margin was higher by 9 &#x2013; or 6 excluding Mexico. Our core was up 19. Our lower-margin gas business represented 8% of sales in Q1 '10 and a little under 9% in Q1 '11. As well, our gross margin in gas was lower this year in Q1 than a year ago. So a combination of a little higher sales penetration and a little lower margin on the business at RA has quite a bit lower margin than the core business. This resulted in all of the ancillary businesses being hit by 9 basis points to the whole company. Within that number, gas was actually 15, and all the other ancillary businesses was 6, positive. So that was the impact from the ancillary businesses, and most particularly gas.</p>
          <p>So on gross margins in our core merchandising business &#x2013; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, fresh foods &#x2013; were higher year over year in Q1 by 22 basis points. Yet slightly lower aggregate sales penetration year over year caused it to be up 19 basis points in this matrix. As I mentioned, all four major departments &#x2013; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods &#x2013; were up year over year, ranging from as little as up 12 basis points to as much as up 44 basis points. In sum, margins in first quarter were fine. And again, Mexico represented 3 of the 9 basis points to the company overall.</p>
          <p>Moving on to SG&amp;A, our SG&amp;A percentage in the first quarter was better by 19 basis points, coming in at a 10.31% this year versus a 10.50% last year. Again, we'll do three columns and seven line items. The line items are operations; second one is central; third one is equity, RSUs or stock options; fourth is quarterly adjustments; fifth is total; and then six and seven are simply Mexico and without Mexico, so what is the impact of Mexico on these numbers. So again, going across Q4 '10 &#x2013; I switched these around. So let's do fiscal year '10 as the first column, Q4 '10, and then Q1 '11. So going across, operations, plus 2 basis points for the fiscal year, plus 9 for the quarter, and plus 17 for the first quarter &#x2013; plus means better or lower. Central, plus 1, minus 1, and plus 1. Equity, 0, 0, and plus 1. Again, pluses are better or lower. Quarterly adjustments, plus 7, plus 4, and 0. So total reported SG&amp;A year over year for all of fiscal '10 was plus 10, for Q4 it was plus 12, and for Q1 was plus 19. Now, down below in the rightmost column, Mexico's impact on these numbers were plus 7, meaning that it had a higher impact on SG&amp;A than &#x2013; because it's lower SG&amp;A than margins on the upside. And without Mexico, therefore, we were 12.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of a little editorial SG&amp;A, again, SG&amp;A was lower by 19. Seven basis points of that was Mexico. Mexico operates on a lower SG&amp;A percentage, mostly lower payroll and benefits &#x2013; frankly, most controllable expenses, as well as a lower occupancy cost, in those cases where we have a rent factor. In terms of our core operations, I might add our payroll percentage was better or lower year over year by 16 basis points, somewhat offset by higher benefits expenses. I might add that the rate of dollar increases in our healthcare costs, while still increasing at a rate higher than top-line sales, is subsiding a bit. Our central expense was better year over year by a basis point. Central payroll again was actually better or lower by a basis point &#x2013; again, not the case with healthcare costs. Overall SG&amp;A performance was quite good. We're benefiting, we believe, from both a little stronger sales levels and, I feel, an increased focus on expense control, which I've talked about in each of the last couple of fiscal quarters.</p>
          <p>Next on the income statement, pre-opening expense. Pre-opening expense last year was $10.8 million and this year $11.9 million, so both years 6 basis points, about a million higher, no big surprise. Last year we opened six openings in Q1, this year eight.</p>
          <p>In terms of provision for impaired assets and closing costs, in Q1 '10 last year we had a charge of 2 million there. This year we had a charge of 4 million. Again small, little things that go both ways and fluctuate, no big surprise there. All told, operating income in Q1 was up 23% year over year from $427 million to $525 million last year or an increase of 97 million. Now, on these items we are these percentage increase so we're talking about up 23%. We are benefiting from where Mexico &#x2013; we now have all of Mexico in the '11 number and half of it in the &#x2013; down below in the other number. So without that, the operating income increase would've still been in the high teens.</p>
          <p>Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same in both quarters, 25.9 million in Q1 '11, up a little from 24.1 million last year. I think the difference there has less to do with interest expense, but the reduction of interest expense associated with capitalized interest, which is an offset. These amounts mainly reflect the interest on our $2 billion debt offering, which we did in February '07. By the way, 900 million of that comes due in March of 2011, and at this point we would simply pay that off, which would be a nice interest rate arbitrage since it's fixed in the low 5% range.</p>
          <p>Interest income and other was lower year over year by almost $13 million, coming in at 5.5 million this year versus 18.2 last year, and the big variable there is other, rather than interest income. Actual interest income was up 300,000. Last year &#x2013; and sounds like a broken record here &#x2013; but last year, half of our Mexico earnings were included in the income statement line item, interest income and other. In the current year, the results are fully consolidated, and the joint venture partner's 50% share is reported down below as net income attributable to non-controlling interests. Overall pre-tax income was up 19.5%, mid to high teens if you exclude where Mexico appears on your balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On to our tax rate, our company tax rate this quarter came in at 34.2%, about 2 percentage points lower than 36.1 a year earlier. Again, our tax rate benefited or was lower due to a handful of discrete items, most notably, as I discussed earlier, a tax refund in one of our foreign operations.</p>
          <p>Now for a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in today's press release, so we won't talk about that. I will point out a couple things. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $189 million. We have a strong balance sheet &#x2013; and I know I don't have to tell you that &#x2013; plenty of financial strength. Accounts payable ratios continue to improve. In other words, payables funding more than all of our inventory levels. That always is at its peak as we approach Christmas, where we've got higher sales and extra dating on seasonal items that don't get paid until the early part of next year. But year over year we reported a year ago accounts payables as a percent of inventory of 102%. A year later, 105%. If you take out non-merchandise payables, like construction payables and all similar type of improvement, 88% a year ago, 91% at the end of the first quarter this year.</p>
          <p>Average inventory per warehouse was up only 1%, 11,815,000 this year, average inventory, versus 11,676,000 a year ago. So up $139,000. Again, our inventories tend to peak around now, too, with all the seasonal stuff, particularly bigger-ticket electronics items coming in for Christmas. Of that 139, 105 of it is the FX difference, because of the strong foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. So inventories are darn near flat on pretty good sales this past quarter. So we're seeing the benefits of that in improved payables and improved turns.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital expenditures, in Q1 we spent $306 million. Our fiscal '11 CapEx is budgeted at just under 1.6 billion. This compares to capital expenditures in fiscal '10 of roughly 1.50 billion. Not a surprise. We mentioned that, I think, in the year-end conference call. In terms of dividend, our current quarterly dividend is $0.205 per share or $0.82 per share annualized. Total cost of the company is right around $360 million.</p>
          <p>Costco Online, in fiscal '10, Costco Online, Costco.com sales were up 6%. In first quarter they were up 9%, so a little bit of an improvement there.</p>
          <p>In terms of expansion. As you know, in fiscal '10 we opened 14 locations, which included one relo, so a net of 13. This year we expect to open &#x2013; we opened eight net in Q1. We've opened two so far in Q2, which is it for Q2. In Q3 we plan two openings, which includes a relocation, so a net of one. In Q4, we have plans for 17, including one relo, so a net of 16. So all told for the year, our own budget assumes 29 new, or 27 net new excluding the two relos. Now, as you know, these are all actively being worked on and in different phases of construction or getting ready to start. The reality is that inevitably a few of those in Q4 may fall into Q1. My best guess is that the 27 net could easily be 23 to 25, but we're shooting for certainly 25, but we'll see where we go.</p>
          <p>So in fiscal '10, again, we added a net of 13, so about 2.5% square footage growth. In fiscal '11, assuming we added all 27, we'd be about 4.5% square footage growth. Probably if I were betting on this, it'd probably be 0.5% lower than that. Assuming we open 27 net, it would include 15 in the U.S., three in Canada, possibly one in the U.K. &#x2013; it's a matter of timing &#x2013; two each in Korea and Taiwan, three in Japan, and one, and possibly two, in Australia. So again, percentage-wise, you're certainly seeing plenty of openings in the U.S., but also a higher percentage of openings overseas, notably in the three Asian countries, a total of seven planned versus typically two or three on average planned in the last few years.</p>
          <p>As of Q1 end &#x2013; some of you keep square-footage figures, total square footage for our company &#x2013; this, by the way, includes Mexico now &#x2013; was 82 million and 98, and that would be on the base of 572 warehouses. I'm sorry, 500 and &#x2013; quarter end? I'll get you that number in a second. 582, sorry.</p>
          <p>In terms of stock repurchases, we currently have remaining repurchase authorization under previous board approvals of just under $1 billion. In fiscal '10 overall, as we started back up repurchasing just before Q2 began last year, we purchased 9.9 million shares for a total of $568 million. In first quarter, we purchased an additional 2.4 million shares for just over $150 million.</p>
          <p>Again, our supplemental information pack, which includes some useful stats and our cash flow statement as well, will be posted &#x2013; oh, I'm sorry, it does not include the cash flow &#x2013; will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning, and the 10-Q should be out in a few weeks.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll open it for questions and turn it back over to Debbie.</p>

          <p>Hi. Good morning. This is actually Tina Hwang on for Deb. Thanks so much for taking my question. I was just wondering, based on what you've seen so far in November, can you just provide us an update on your holiday outlook and also address specifically how you guys are positioned from an inventory perspective for holiday?

Well, I can't talk necessarily about how the last week or so was, but what I know I have mentioned and I know what Jim has mentioned when asked in the last &#x2013; going back a couple months ago, we approached the Christmas season as far back as September somewhat aggressively. Recognizing structurally we feel that a), we've had great shopper frequency, we have on average a little bit more upscale member that perhaps can weather the economic storm on average a little better. But if we've got them coming in, hopefully they'll pick up some of those discretionary items as well. And structurally, we can afford to be a little more aggressive because of the types of merchandise we sell and the turns that we have. We're in and out of seasons early. So we have continued to approach it with a plus sign in front of it, if you will, versus a caution, and that continues.</p>

          <p>Not really. For us, Black Friday, while we do do a &#x2013; in the last several years, we've done a handout with a few items in it. It's really more of an advertising traditional retail holiday. Certainly Black Friday is better for us than an average Friday, but it doesn't really portend anything, in our view, for us. And it was reflected in our November comps, by the way.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Richard. I know you don't want to give forward guidance, but just provided the Mexico consolidation, would you anticipate that minority interest line to be about $20 million per quarter this year? Or was there something in this quarter that made it pretty high? I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should model that line.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can't give you guidance on it other than, you note in that line there is that tax benefit I mentioned. So it won't be that high. I think a little under 5 million of that line is a tax benefit because of Mexico.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then in your 10-K that you filed last month, you reported a, I think, about 100 basis point increase in Canada. What was behind that increase, and do you feel like that 4.5% is sustainable?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, year over year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think first and foremost, Canada's economy overall, not just at Costco, has been strong. I mean, we've enjoyed local currency comps for two years now in the mid to high single digits in Canada. My guess is that a smaller benefit of that is related to the fact that Sam's exited the market, gosh, a year and a half ago. Where they had six or eight locations in the Toronto and Montreal markets. Certainly that helps a little bit. But as you might expect, the day that was announced, Jim was the first to remind the buyers, he doesn't want to see big improvement in margins there. So I think that's a little of it, but a bigger thing is continuing strong comps up there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then my last question is within SG&amp;A, you talked about the core being 17 basis points better, 16 from payroll. Is that just leverage, or is there something else that helped out this quarter? Because that was particularly strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, part of it &#x2013; I think it's both. I mean, as I mentioned a minute ago, clearly some of it's leverage, but I think also &#x2013; and again, I don't know what the leverage comp number is completely. I just believe, and we all agree here, that it is lower than it used to be. We have focused on it over the last year and a half &#x2013; everybody's focused on it. But a bad economy &#x2013; as many of you know for years, I've always said there aren't a lot of silver bullets in our SG&amp;A because we're pretty efficient to start with. Well, guess what? In the tough times over the last two years everybody's been focused on it a little more. And little things are being taken out of operations and payroll. Yeah, and keep in mind, as Bob was just mentioning to me, benefits are higher in that number, higher than sales growth. So actually, overall, there was a little bit more improvement, and it offset that. So, again, there are lots of little things, plus pretty good comps.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Richard, another impressive point in the quarter was the core merchandise margins up 19 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just walk us through and help us think about how sustainable that is? Clearly a nice inflection point, but as we head into the second quarter, we're up against a pretty tough compare where you had a nice increase a year ago as well. So just kind of help us think about how sustainable that improvement is going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Keep in mind, the big improvement last year in Q2 really related to the year before that, when we took about $30 to $35 million of commodity price markdowns. So the delta a year ago was because of the real underperformance a year earlier. So I don't see that as being a concern this year.</p>
          <p>Look, one of the things I pointed out a minute ago was that even our overall fresh foods gross margin was up in Q1 notwithstanding a much weaker for us bakery margin because we've been trying to hold prices despite the raw material prices going up. You can't do that forever, but we recognize that a lot of those muffins are sold to restaurants and delis, and the longer we can hold that price, the better. It won't be forever. But &#x2013; so we were able to do that and still have pretty strong margins here. As Jim has said before, and years ago I'm not sure I always agreed, but I agree more and more, margins aren't the issue. We feel pretty good that we have the ability to do a little of that, but we're not going to go crazy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And so we're seeing this margin improvement despite the fact that we're not necessarily flowing through some of the inflationary pressures that have started to materialize? Is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, where the inflationary pressures have started first would be fresh foods: bakery, sugar, the raw material ingredients for baked goods or the food court. And again, both of those margins in first quarter were down year over year because we're holding on. But we're able to do &#x2013; by the way, we probably would have done that even if there was margin pressure in the whole company. The good news is we're able to do that and still even within fresh foods have a good margin. So overall, I think we're running on all cylinders as it relates to our merchandising &#x2013; most cylinders, as Jim would say, not all. But in terms of our merchandising and our ability to achieve our margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. What are you seeing competitors do as it relates to inflation? How aggressive is it out there? And maybe sort of on the heels of Black Friday, how the holiday season has started off compared to &#x2013; how would you characterize the holiday season relative to your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean &#x2013; again, I get back to the comment I made a minute ago on the latter part of that question, is that we've re-entered the season positively, and we still feel that way. The first part of your question, Adrianne?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just saying as it relates to inflation, what you're seeing competitors do with prices given some of the inflationary pressures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, it tends to be all over the board. If you think about fresh foods, I think the supermarkets have their own set of pressures. Again, we're stronger in bigger ticket, higher-end beef items like prime rib and steaks and what have you, and that's where there's a little less pricing pressure. We're still the best value out there, but the ad items that you see for ground beef and things like that aren't as big of a competitive issue for us. And we're able to compete effectively and not be impacted a lot.</p>
          <p>You know, different regions are doing different things on that side with loss leaders. I mean, you get driven crazy in a region or two, whether it's milk or soda pop or things like that. But as it relates to pricing pressures, I think we would all agree here that we're going to be the last to take prices up. And so far I think that's happened, and that's good for us. And we're able to do that and still show decent margins. On the non-foods side, there's &#x2013; you hear about cotton going up a lot. Well, it does; it impacts those items, but it impacts a little higher-ticket items less than $8 items at the discount stores.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Makes sense. So, Richard, let me be the one to ask the question. Since we last spoke, the board in California raised the threshold, BJ's talked about raising their membership fee. In January, sales seemed to be improving. Understand that you're focused on the holiday season, but can you maybe just update us on your thoughts as we think about 2011 since it will be five years since we last saw a membership fee hike? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, there's not a whole lot of new news yet, other than what you just mentioned. As you know, we raised it from the base numbers, jumping from 45 to 50 in I think it was May, roughly May of '06. So five years would be May of '11, but we really haven't talked about it yet. I don't think what our competitors do impacts us a lot. Certainly our renewal rates, our frequency and the like give us confidence that if and when we wanted to, it would not be an issue, as it never has been. But we honestly haven't sat down and talked about it yet. And at some point I'm sure it'll happen, but whether it's sometime in the first half of '11 or the second half of '11 or the first half of '12, who knows? I'm not trying to be coy, here. We just really haven't talked about it yet. But it is not because of a lack of confidence in our loyalty and our ability.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Richard, we've seen a bigger push towards the Asian stores in this year's new store introductions. Is this something we could count on for the next several years? And do you have a longer-term target that you're shooting for there in terms of store count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. If you go back a few years ago, when we had the slide that said this is how many we have by country today, and this is what we think the potential is 10 years from now, I think in both Korea and Taiwan, we had at the time four or five in each of those countries. We felt long term it could be 15. While I haven't seen that slide lately, I think in the past year, I saw it and the 15's were 25's. In Japan, when we had three or four units, the potential for some reason was 49. I don't know why it wasn't 50. I don't think that's really changed, other than we have committed to a lot more.</p>
          <p>We have, what, nine, I believe, in Japan, and seven in Korea, and six in Taiwan. As I mentioned, between those three countries, we've got several opening this fiscal year. And, yes, you'll see a higher rate of openings this year and in the next few years than you have in the past. But &#x2013; so it moves the needle for the company a little bit. We've had great success in those countries. We've had great success in the one unit we have in Australia. We're anxious to get our second one open this coming spring and hopefully a third. My guess is that third slips into Q1 of '12, but we're working, trying to get it open. So we'll see. But I think it's like a lot of things around here, it's a big positive for those operations given that they are successful. It's a slight positive for the company overall, but trending in that direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And how do the operating margins look on those stores, versus like a U.S. core store?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The margin's higher, end of story. Keep in mind, in places like Korea and Taiwan, I mean, I think eight of our 10 highest-volume units are in the three Asian countries. And I wouldn't be surprised if all 10 were, if they were a little older. So, I mean, it helps when you have four or five locations in a 15 plus million population city like Seoul or Taipei or Tokyo. So we have met with good success in member sign-ups and sales over there, and &#x2013; but we had to just keep opening some units.</p>
          <p>Occupancy is higher, payroll as a percent &#x2013; because sales per location are quite high, payroll as a percent of sales is lower. But the net of everything, membership fees as a percent of sales tend to be higher. Some of those units have twice the average number of members as our company overall. But again, that has to do with the fact that there's so many &#x2013; it's so densely populated. And they like American stuff. What we feel that we've brought is not only the unique membership format, is American-sourced goods, bigger and great value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And getting back to the inflation question, you said steak prices up 15%. What kind of price elasticity response do you get there? Do you see volumes down a little bit in some of those areas where you're seeing double-digit increases?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I honestly don't know. My guess is there's got to be some elasticity. It probably was &#x2013; I know there was huge elasticity to the positive. When the economy first got hit in late '08, throughout the first half of '09, as what I'll call the high-end steak restaurants, which were hammered, and 2% of all prime &#x2013; 2% of all beef raised in the United States is prime. Virtually all of it went to high-end restaurants. There were weeks and months in the middle of '09 where we represented something like 35% of all the prime steaks being sold in America, including restaurants. So as they slowed down, and the price points on these items &#x2013; and again, this is anecdotal &#x2013; but I remember a prime steak that we might have had at &#x2013; were selling at $18 or $19 a pound for strip steak, but we didn't sell them because the disparity was so different, was down to 10.99 and 11.99, and we could sell a dramatic amount of them, even as the 10.99 or 11.99 choice steak went to 8.99. I'm guessing on these numbers, but directionally that was the issue. So my guess is there's some elasticity. But they're great. It's been a good business for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And did you say your fresh food margin was down a little bit because of inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, our overall fresh food margin, which is the sum of bakery, produce, meat, and what we call deli, packaged items like cheeses and what have you, our overall gross margin was up in the quarter notwithstanding the fact that our bakery margin was down because of holding prices on many of those items. We can't hold them forever, but so far we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And how about on the meats? Were you holding there or are you passing it through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly able to pass most of it through. Again, on ground beef, you might not be able to, but we're selling &#x2013; even though we sell a lot of ground beef, we're selling a lot of steaks and roasts and things like that as well, higher-end cuts. It's kind of like in the white-goods business with refrigerators; the one you see on sale is the base model, but when you go in to buy one, you want to buy the model with everything on it, like with the ice maker and the water dispenser, and so that's not the one that's on sale. So there's less price competition on that higher-end item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a little more color on California doing better. Is it back to reasonable levels, or is it still just really benefiting from the weak year-agos?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say &#x2013; well, in November it was, over the quarter, closing in on it. So yeah, it's getting better. But I don't want to suggest that life's great out there. We all know what the underlying unemployment statistics and economy concerns are, but it certainly seems &#x2013; I think probably the thing that has continued to surprise me is the improvement in shopper frequency. For 20 years, shopper frequency, year over year, each month, was on average up 1%, 1.5%. All of a sudden, starting really before the economy got bad in late '08, in the spring of '08, when gas prices approached $4, we started seeing frequency improve. And throughout '09, when the economy was really in the doldrums, we continued. And I was the first to remind people that hey, if we're running, if we typically run ones and twos and we're running threes and fours, a year from now if we're flat, that's not so bad because we got all that frequency in one year. Well, guess what? We're running threes and fours and fives for two years running now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It would seem to me that with threes and fours -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that to some extent people changed some of their habits with restaurant usage in '09. I think that competitively we are still taking market share from traditional supermarkets, and that's what drives frequency in our business, and that helps.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would think with the threes and fours and deflation shifting back to inflation, you should start to see a more sustainable comp above four. Is that fair?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Richard, on the average ticket, November strengthened ex currency, ex gas, and a lot of our discussion I think has been around price changes on like items. Could we spend just a minute on mix? And what I'm specifically interested in is are we beginning to see a shift from what had been trading down over the last couple of years to more trading up, so within categories and also on moving towards better and best items. I know with the Kirkland Signature, that actually depresses that change, but ex that factor, what are your buyers seeing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I think we did a good job, per Jim's instructions, the buyers, that when the economy originally got hammered, we tried very hard not to bring price points down. Now, did we try some lower price points on patio furniture to get below $1,000 instead of a little above $1,000 on a price point? Yes. Did it sell a little better? Yes. Did we do that again this year leading into February through April of '10, the second bad February through April in the economy? No. And we were actually scrambling because I think part of it was pent-up demand from the year before.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; now, are we getting &#x2013; I think the ticket's come down a little bit because people are coming in more, and it's gone up a little bit because there is finally a little bit more strength and penetration of what I'll call medium- to higher-priced nonfood items, discretionary items. I mean, our jewelry business has been up in the teens in the last couple of quarters, last several months. A lot of those categories I mentioned earlier, housewares and sporting goods, lawn and garden, are all up in the 10% to 25% range. Actually on a high watermark basis over two years, net positive. So again, the frequency brings it down a little bit. We're finally seeing some strength, brings it up a little bit, but we still are, as Jim would say, operating in a healthy state of paranoia because the economy is still a little scary. But clearly we're getting more than our share.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And if it's fair to make a connection between that second derivative or rate of change on average ticket and payroll leverage, where this has strengthened further, that would presumably help you get better payroll leverage all else being equal?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My other question is on international club expansion. Can you just help us look out a few years? I mean, the returns are absolutely terrific. And is there a speed limit we should think about with the infrastructure? I mean, can you get the international club openings up? When can that surpass the U.S., for example? Could you get it up to 20 per year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it'll be a few years. The way I looked at is over probably a four- or five-year period. If I think of just like the three countries in Asia where we are now, that we currently have 23 warehouses I think between the three countries, all right? And probably for five years running we've averaged between the three countries a total of two or three a year. This year we'll open five or six, and my guess is over the next five years, it could be five or six a year, maybe six or seven or eight, but let's say five or six a year. So that's a dramatic increase in the rate of increase. It's still not &#x2013; doesn't get you to your 20. As we open in a second or third European country over the next five years &#x2013; but again, as you've seen from every other new country we've operated in, over five years we might open three to five units in total in a given country. So we're still pretty hands-on. Infrastructure-wise as it relates to getting them opened, again I think the first signal is we have ramped up, but not to 20 a year, but we're ramped up. And let's see how the next two or three years go.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. Richard, I guess the question I have is on the membership fee, the potential for a membership fee increase, how should we think about I'd say attrition if you were to increase hypothetically the Executive membership by 5% or 10% &#x2013; $5 or $10 &#x2013; given historical attrition on just the Gold Star increases that you guys have done over the years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a), who knows? But in the five increases in 25 years, we've never &#x2013; I think we've budgeted it as as much as 1.5% or 2% attrition, and I don't think we've ever exceeded 1 even. So it's really never been an issue. As you know, nine years ago and five and a half years ago, or five years ago, we did &#x2013; when the original Executive started at 100, we were at 40. And then we went to 45 and kept the 100 at 100, and then went to 50 and kept the 100 at 100. The theory being, is to get more people to convert, and that happened. I don't know if and when we look at increasing the base fee, what do we do with the other fee. Really, I'm not trying to be coy or cute, and we'll let you know after we figure it out at some point. But as it relates to your question of attrition, we don't lose a lot of sleep over that, quite frankly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And I guess I'm just curious on &#x2013; another is just like inventory availability from some of your vendors. I guess the one that gets a lot of mention these days is the television category. I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit about television category, and then we'd also be interested in hearing more on the softlines inventory availability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a few different things. First of all, TVs are fine. Cameras have been a little &#x2013; certain high-end cameras, I understand, have been &#x2013; there's been some availability issues because of chips or whatever components in these &#x2013; these are $1,000-plus digital SLR cameras. The TVs, the availability is back, but recognizing TV sales overall have been down a little bit for us. I assume they have for everybody. In terms of apparel &#x2013; I think the second thing, first of all, is the issue with importing from Asia. There has been some challenges with shipping that affects all of us, not just Costco. So far we've done pretty well through that. In some cases, there's been a week or two additional lead time, which the buyers have been able to build in. And, by the way, it hasn't impacted our inventory results or our feel of control over inventory. So that's not been a big issue. Probably the single biggest thing right now that's a little bit of a pain is some of the electronic toys, the Xbox, the Kinect. We, like everybody, are being allocated, some of the Nintendo items. So we're all &#x2013; it's a high-quality problem to have, but we're all &#x2013; could sell more if we had it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then just one last question from me, Richard, is could you just give us an update on any of the healthcare cost trends that you're seeing in the business currently?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's big right now. Again, as I mentioned in Q1, the rate of increase was a shade higher than top line sales growth. Rather it was closer to 10, 12 than it was 15, 17 in terms of dollar increase. So that's encouraging a little bit. We're tweaking a few things that we're allowed to tweak without impacting, losing the grandfathering of all the new requirements over the next several years. Again, I think we're finally breathing a little sigh of relief after two years of really big growth in healthcare costs exacerbated by opening fewer units, having less turnover, and with fewer units having fewer new hires because it takes up to six months for an employee to be benefits-eligible.</p>
          <p>Part-time hourly is up to six months, full-time hourly up to &#x2013; or 61/2 months, up to 31/2 months for full-time hourly, so without having all those new openings, we had less freebies in the calculation for those first few months, and so again, as we ramp up expansion, that helps a little bit. I think that just does is that dampens that dollar rate of increase a little bit.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Rob Simone from Cowen and Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. It's Rob Simone in for Laura. I just wanted to touch on the membership fee increase again there one more time. I believe on the Q4 call you guys called out a weaker economy, and due to that, you're not feeling a lot of pressure to increase the rate in the near term. And I know you just said that you're not going to be increasing the rate or you haven't announced that yet, but could you comment at all on how your view of the macro backdrop has changed or evolved? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, I think the comment I made was that anecdotally, I remember sometime in mid '09, mid to say sometime in the summer of '09, I just rhetorically asked Jim, I says, "You know, right now things, being equal, if now was the time in our own mind that we should &#x2013; historically every five or so years we take that fee up if we feel it's appropriate &#x2013; given the backdrop of the economy, would we?" He says, "No, there's no pressure to do it now, and given the economy, even though we have no concern about its impact on attrition and impact on member loyalty, there's no need to rush into it." And Lord knows that whatever our underlying earnings numbers are expected over the next several quarters, whether we needed it or not to improve our earnings, we wouldn't do it for that reason. We're going do it when we're ready to do it and we feel comfortable, and certainly the backdrop of the economy tempers that enthusiasm, not from a standpoint of ability to accomplish it and accomplish it with very little attrition or disloyalty, but the ability to &#x2013; why be arrogant about it or aggressive about it? Let's wait and see.</p>
          <p>So again, as you know around here, whatever the issue is, whether it's this or any issue out there that we're thinking of doing, it doesn't take us a long time once we decide to do something to do it. We haven't talked about it yet, other than anecdotally like what I just said. So I'm trying to beat around the question here, beat the answer around the question, because at this point we haven't decided what we're doing, and when we find out we'll let you know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hey, guys. This is Mike Montani in for Greg. My question was actually on ticket first, which was just looking back historically to mid '09 we saw a 3% to 4% decline in ticket if you excluded FX and gas, and obviously now we've gone slightly positive. So number one, just trying to understand if you can help us with the drivers there. I mean, it seems like inflation is an obvious one, we're getting a little bit of mix, but is there also some improvement in units per basket as well that you could speak to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have the numbers right in front of me. The units per basket haven't really changed dramatically other than as frequency goes up, part of it is &#x2013; I used to always say that the typical family member at Costco was coming in every two and a half, three weeks, but each of those families were still going to the neighborhood supermarket three times a week. Well, I think what's happened is that three became two and a half weeks at our Costco in terms of more frequently. They're still going to the supermarket, but they're buying more of their food items at Costco, and if they're coming in more often they're buying a few less items or maybe a few &#x2013; equal number of items, but some of the foods items, so a little lower basket. So again, if &#x2013; the recent relative pickup in the average basket is, I think, less inflation because it's really just starting, and more the strength in some of the non-food categories, offset by more frequency.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then following up on that would be getting back to TVs for a moment. Obviously last quarter, I believe the outlook was for slightly positive TV dollars, and we haven't quite seen that as of yet. But I guess looking ahead, it would seem that that's one way certainly to get ticket a bit higher. As you see the units improving a bit with accelerated ASP declines, is there any reason to think that we still wouldn't be able to do positive dollars into 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Bob Nelson was just mentioning a couple of &#x2013; I was ruffling through my papers to find the answer; Bob gave it to me. In November, units were actually up a little bit. There was a little bit more than that amount in deflationary pricing, which is by the way, the last couple months, the first time. For most of '10 there was, or most of the first half of '10, there was inflationary pricing in TVs. So I think &#x2013; everybody's got a lot of TVs, and we're seeing some strength. The price points keep coming down a little bit; that helps. That's going to drive it a little bit, but not a lot. But I really &#x2013; I'm shooting from the hip with this answer, guys, because I don't have any detail in front of me, other than when talking to buyers in general, one of the things that has driven our TV business is the coupon mailers that we do, what we call the multi-vendor mailers. Throughout a lot of this current calendar year, there's been fewer of that, as there was inflation. There wasn't a lot of pressure on vendors to have to provide some of those. We're starting to see a little bit more of that, not as good as it used to be, but we would expect that improve. So that factor bodes well for electronic sales in calendar '11. But I don't know how that's offset by how many TVs does everybody already have. 3-D is not exactly changing the face of TV sales overnight, and so that's a much slower process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just lastly, I actually had a question that's somewhat of a macro question, but if you look at the accelerated depreciation provided for in the new tax package, so basically 100% expensing of business purchase of CapEx, is there a way to think about that as it relates to your business, just given obviously the Business member penetration that you have, especially I would think around office products, furniture, PCs, et cetera. Have you thought about that or done any work to quantify it at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have not. And I'm not sure if our buyers have either yet, since it's pretty new. Again, it can't hurt, and hopefully it'll help a little, but I'd be remiss if I tried to guess where that could be. Keep in mind, each of these departments are small percentage departments of the total company. So it helps us. It doesn't &#x2013; if furniture and cash registers and PCs and things like that would benefit from this, it'll help those departments a little bit, but office products for us as an example &#x2013; or majors for us, as an example, is about 6% of sales, and probably half of that is business-related and half is not. So if it impacts that a little bit, that's great, but it's still a small piece of the action.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We actually have one more question from the line of Neil Currie with UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to ask about Internet sales. Most of my questions have been answered. But when you look across some of the larger retail businesses and you look at their Internet sales, they seem to be significantly ahead of their store sales. I mean, your Internet sales aren't bad. They were 6% last year, 9% this year, but not significantly outpacing what you're seeing in your stores. And I just wondered what your approach is and whether you might see any changes to your online sales? Or whether you're not too worried about developing online? Or whether you think this is a good performance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we could do better. Keep in mind, the average ticket online is still in the high 300s for us, and it's virtually all discretionary stuff, and that's by choice in our case. We are doing a few things right now to work it a little bit. If Jim were sitting here, he would say, "Well, first and foremost, we have to have the right items in the right price," and so it's all about merchandising. But I think we could do a better job in several other things. I'm not promising anything, other than we agree that even though 9 is better than 6, and 6 was better than a slight negative the year before, arguably a lot of that's because of the nature of the discretionary big-ticket items we sold, we think there's opportunity there, and we are working on that. We really are working on that, but it's not going to happen overnight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just on &#x2013; you talked about Asia, but I was just going to ask about the U.K. In terms of those numbers you gave a few years ago in terms of potential store openings, are you still on track for those? Or is there anything in the U.K. economy that you see that causes you to revise your outlook and perhaps allocate the capital elsewhere?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, fortunately capital is not a big allocation issue for us. I think in the U.K. the fact that the economy has been in the doldrums for a couple of years &#x2013; and keep in mind, there's one other unique thing that the U.K. has in our operation. To make it work for us, from the beginning of time, many of our locations are located in, and I don't know the exact horrible term over there, but they are not retail zones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>LPPG6, I think it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And so because of that, there's a limit to how much of our sales can go to the &#x2013; the Gold Star member, if you will. That has to go to the trade. And those numbers are typically in the roughly two-thirds of the sales range, a little bit higher than our company average. So we don't market a lot to Gold Star members. So structurally it's been a little different business all along, but a good business. I think the fact that the economies got hit hard over the last couple of years there has &#x2013; I don't think that we have canceled anything. There's also a lot of limitations and process to go through. I think I used to say that we might be working on four or five sites hoping we get approved for one of them that'll finally get opened three or four years from now.</p>
          <p>And so it's still a harder real estate environment for us over there. And the fact the economy's been so &#x2013; my guess is if five years ago we had said, hey, five years hence, which is now, approximately we've got, whatever, 21 or 22 locations there, what will you open over the next five years? My guess is that number's down a little bit from what we would have guessed five years earlier, but we're still looking at openings and have some plans to open some new sites over there. I think we've got three or four of them that Jim and Jeff have approved, our two founders, and we're working on them.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
