          <p>Good day everyone and welcome to the EOG Resources 2008 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of EOG Resources, Mr. Mark Papa. Please go ahead sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thanks for joining us. We hope everyone has seen the press release announcing second quarter 2008 earnings and operational results. This conference call includes forward-looking statements. The risks associated with forward-looking statements have been outlined in the earnings release and EOG's SEC filings and we incorporate those by reference for this call.</p>
          <p>This conference call contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation schedules for these non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures can be found on our website at www.eogresources.com. The SEC permits producers to disclose only proved reserves in their securities filings. Some of the reserve estimates on this conference call and webcast including those for the Barnett Shale and North Dakota Bakken plays may include other categories of reserves. We incorporate by reference the cautionary note to US investors that appears at the bottom of our press release and Investor Relations page of our website. An updated investor relations presentation and statistics were posted to our website this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning are Loren Leiker, Senior EVP Exploration; Gary Thomas, Senior EVP Operations; Bob Garrison, EVP Exploration; Tim Driggers, Vice President and CFO; and Maire Baldwin, Vice President, Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>The theme for this quarterly call is consistency. As you can tell from our financial and operating results, we continue to deliver what we promised you at the beginning of the year. That's been a company hallmark and we're proud of it. We filed our 8-K with third quarter and full year 2008 guidance yesterday. These projections are consistent with the guidance we provided earlier in the year, and I'll discuss them in a minute when I review operations.</p>
          <p>I'll now review our second quarter net income available to common stockholders and discretionary cash flow and then I'll provide an operational overview. Tim Driggers will then discuss capital structure and I'll close with a hydrocarbon macro overview and a summary.</p>
          <p>As outlined in our press release for the second quarter, EOG reported net income available to common stockholders of $178 million, or $0.71 per share. For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP net income available to common stockholders to eliminate mark-to-market impacts as outlined in the press release, EOG's second quarter adjusted net income available to common stockholders was $632 million or $2.52 per share.</p>
          <p>For investors who follow the practice of industry analysts who focus on non-GAAP discretionary cash flow, EOG's DCF for the second quarter was $1.4 billion or $5.47 per share.</p>
          <p>I'll now address our strategy and operational highlights. We believe there are five components that constitute a premiere independent E&amp;P company and these attributes have been longstanding goals at EOG. Four of these components are measurable and the fifth is more subjective. The four measurable components are ROCE, debt adjusted production growth per share, overall unit costs and net debt to total cap ratio.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we believe, we will score either at or among the highest in the peer group in all four categories. We expect to generate peer-leading ROCE, unit cost control and lowest net debt to total cap ratio and we'll be either the highest or in the top quartile regarding debt adjusted production per share growth.</p>
          <p>The fifth and more subjective category involves being an early mover in new horizontal resource plays. We think we've got a demonstrable track record in this category, and even if we are not first mover in potential plays such as the Haynesville and Marcellus, we still have a significant low cost, low cost acreage position in them, if these plays develop.</p>
          <p>We value consistency at EOG and our 8-K indicates that our original 2008 goals remain the same today. We still expect to deliver 15% absolute production growth, all organic, even though we are currently experiencing natural gas and natural gas liquids curtailment in Johnson County due to the pipelines being at full capacity.</p>
          <p>I will now provide brief highlights regarding several of our key plays. I'll start with the North Dakota Bakken oil. We have approximately 320,000 net acres in the Bakken. We're currently drilling with eight rigs. Seven of these are drilling in the core area and one rig is testing areas on the periphery of the core. We continue to make great wells in the core. Three examples this quarter are the Austin 5-14H, 24-33H and 9-11H wells which had peak rates of 3,744, 1,880 and 3,225 barrels of oil per day gross, respectively.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2008, our average IP rate for all wells drilled was 1,732 barrels of oil per day and our direct after-tax re-investment rate of return exceeded 100%. I think a 1,732 barrel oil per day average initial rate allows us to deem these as oil monster wells. We've now drilled enough wells whereby we can make a reasonable reservoir definition.</p>
          <p>We believe this accumulation consists of a high quality core area which we call the Parshall Field. Per well reserves in this field are approximately 850,000 barrels of oil equivalent gross. EOG is by far the dominant acreage holder in this sweet spot and this constitutes our 80 million barrel of oil net reserve estimate.</p>
          <p>Also, as mentioned on the last quarterly call, we're monitoring results from our first 320 acre downspace well which was drilled in the core area and we're also evaluating the potential for secondary recovery of the field. Around parts of this core area, we believe there is an extension area where wells are still very economic with 250 to 450,000 barrels of oil gross reserves per well. Not as prolific as the core, but still very good wells.</p>
          <p>During the quarter we drilled in this extension area and based on preliminary test data, we're excited about extending the play beyond the core. We are waiting to quantify any reserve impact since further drilling will be required to confirm these results, and that will take place over the next few months. Overall we expect to drill 80 gross wells this year and at least 100 gross wells next year.</p>
          <p>In British Columbia we commenced sales from our first two shale gas plays two weeks ago. One is the full lateral, and one is the half lateral. We're pleased with the initial flow rates, but want to watch these wells for a while before we provide specific details regarding per well reserves. We're currently running two rigs in this area, and we will have a second full lateral well on sales next week. As previously noted, our immediate short term sales capacity will be limited to 25 to 50 million cubic feet a day, until we have full pipeline take away capacity in 2011.</p>
          <p>In the Barnett gas field our well results throughout the play continue to meet or exceed expectations. However we are currently experiencing gas curtailments in Johnson County due to high pipeline pressures. Additionally due to bottleneck NGL takeaway capacity at the processing plants we are not able to strip the optimum natural gas liquids out of the gas stream. We expect the gas takeaway problem to be ameliorated in October but the NGL bottleneck won't be fixed until next year. Accordingly we will be selling less Barnett gas than capacity during the third quarter and expect a volume pick up in the fourth quarter and the 8-K we filed last night reflects this fourth quarter volume increase.</p>
          <p>I am pleased with our per well results. Our press release outlined five of these Johnson County Martin wells that IP'd at gross production rates of 6.1 to 9.2 million cubic feet a day each, all gas monster wells by my definition.</p>
          <p>We are also running four rigs in Hill County which is immediately south of Johnson and our per well reserves there are as expected, 1.5 net Bcf per well. In the western counties we are currently focusing on three development areas. In Palo Pinto County we drilled eight wells to date averaging 1.1 net Bcfe per well. Our most recent well is currently testing at a 4.9 MMcfe per day rate. We anticipate drilling 16 wells here by year end.</p>
          <p>In Erath County, we recently drilled the Hawks number 1H which tested at 3 million cubic feet a day and anticipate drilling 12 offset wells by year end. We have already drilled 49 wells in this Erath County development area.</p>
          <p>In Hood County we've drilled 25 wells to date that have averaged 1 Bcf per well net and we are drilling additional wells. We recently completed the Black Ranch number 9H at a rate of 2 million cubic feet a day gross. We have 61% working interest in this well. To summarize, our Barnett western county activity is generating the results we anticipated.</p>
          <p>Regarding the North Barnett oil play, from day one we have noted this is a 2009 event. We are currently waiting to get our gas processing plant installed at year-end before we can give you further definition regarding production data or recovery factors. In the meantime, we are testing various techniques for optimum development. I have had some feedback from Wall Street noting that people would like to see data from peer companies confirming this oil play. The reason for the lack of peer company, peer public company data is that EOG controls the vast majority of acreage in this play and simply put, there is not enough remaining acreage for anybody else to gain a significant foothold. I'll note, there are at least two small private companies that are currently obtaining good economics with both vertical and horizontal oil wells in the area. I'll stress that we continue to be very excited about this play.</p>
          <p>During the past six months we've mentioned three other successful resource plays, the Mississippi Chalk, the Mid Continent Atoka, and the Colorado North Park oil. During the quarter we further confirmed two of these plays. In the Mississippi Chalk, we completed the Gwinville 24.8 and the 23-15 number four wells for 4.1 and 2.7 million cubic feet a day net respectively. These are 70% after-tax rate of return wells.</p>
          <p>In the Mid Continent Atoka, we're running a three rig drilling program and during the second quarter we completed five horizontal wells. The Apple 438 number 3H and Landers 522 number 3H wells tested at rates of 4.7 and 6.2 million cubic feet a day net, respectively, confirming that this also is a high return play. We have identified over 150 drilling locations on our acreage and plan to increase drilling activity in this Mid Continent area in 2009. In the Colorado North Park Basin area, due to seasonal drilling restrictions, we don't have additional results from the oil play at this time, but our operations in this area continue.</p>
          <p>Our other big resource play is the Vernal vertical Wasatch / Mesaverde development area in the Uinta Basin where we are running 8 rigs and continue to get excellent results. Like all Rockies producers, we are trying to assess the impact of the September REX pipeline curtailment. At this time, we believe we can get our volumes moved but the basin's basis differential will widen temporarily.</p>
          <p>The two other potential resource plays that have recently attracted interest are of course the Haynesville and Marcellus. We have approximately 100,000 net acres in the Haynesville and are currently drilling our first horizontal. Until we have our own well results, we can't opine regarding the efficacy of this play.</p>
          <p>In the Marcellus, we have 220,000 net acres, are operating one rig and will have some results by year end. If the Marcellus works, this will be a very slow developing play in the macro sense, because of major infrastructure issues. I'd estimate the Marcellus, if it works, would not contribute meaningfully to the macro domestic gas supply picture until 2012 plus.</p>
          <p>Switching to outside North America, our Trinidad asset continues to perform as expected and our next volume ramp up will be 60 million cubic feet a day net in early 2010. In the North Sea, we continue to like both the oil and gas prices and will rebound from an inactive drilling year in 2008 and drill three to five exploration wells in 2009. On July 1, we finalized our China acquisition of 130,000 acres from ConocoPhillips. This is a tight gas asset in the Sichuan Basin onshore China that's currently producing approximately 8 million cubic feet a day net.</p>
          <p>The rock formation is a low permeability natural gas sand, similar to our South Texas Wilcox play. The prior operators, Burlington and ConocoPhillips, attempted to develop this asset with vertical wells, and that was not very successful. We plan to use our South Texas analogy where we've unlocked half the net Tcf with horizontal drilling and we believe similar technology will unlock this sandstone play. If this works, we may develop up to one net Tcf on our acreage. We view this as a horizontal technology play in an energy-short country and hope that success could lead to broader opportunities in China.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss CapEx and capital structure.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. For the second quarter 2008, total exploration and development expenditures including asset retirement obligations were $1.150 billion with $6 million of acquisitions. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $108 million. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $10.1 million.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date, exploration and development expenditures including asset retirement obligations were $2.270 billion with $35 million of acquisitions. Total gathering, pipeline and other expenditures were $196 million.</p>
          <p>At quarter end 2008, total debt outstanding was $1.147 billion and the debt-to-total capitalization ratio was 13%. At June 30, non-GAAP net debt was $1.039 billion for a net debt-to-total cap ratio of 12%. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28%, and the deferred tax ratio was 58%.</p>
          <p>The press release also highlighted a dividend increase of 12.5%. This is the second dividend increase this year and the ninth time the Board of Directors has increased the dividend in nine years. Yesterday, we filed a Form 8-K with third quarter and full year 2008 guidance.</p>
          <p>We also filed the second quarter 10-Q which has our updated hedge position. With our current hedge position as outlined in yesterday's 8-K filing, for every $0.10 change in the average 2008 Henry Hub strip, EOG's 2008 net income and cash flow is impacted by approximately $20 million. Similarly for every $1 move in the average 2008 WTI strip, EOG's 2008 net income and cash flow is impacted by approximately $10 million.</p>
          <p>For the full year 2008, the 8-K has an effective tax range of 32 to 36% and a deferral percentage of 55 to 75%. Using the midpoint of the updated 8-K guidance, our full year 2008 unit cost for leasing well, DD&amp;A, G&amp;A, total exploration, net interest expense and excluding transportation and taxes other than income, our forecast increased 4.4% over 2007.</p>
          <p>Estimated capital expenditures for 2008 excluding acquisitions are now $4.75 billion, reflecting a $370 million increase. Approximately $100 million of the increase is related to increased gathering and processing activity in the Bakken and Barnett. The increase in exploration and development expenditures is due to drilling activities and significantly increased leasing costs in new areas.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn it back to Mark to discuss the gas macro hedging and his concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim. Regarding the worldwide oil supply-demand picture, we believe oil prices will be highly volatile but will move directionally higher over the next five years, because we see oil demand, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, outstripping worldwide supply growth.</p>
          <p>In our mind, predicting the North American gas market is more difficult because of the big influence of winter weather. Although there are current fears about domestic supply growth, we see the market as currently balanced based on the last nine weeks of storage injections, with only one week out of range and that week was likely effected by the July 4 holiday.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned last quarter, we still expect November 1 storage to reach 3.3 to 3.4 Tcf which will be a bullish harbinger for 2009. I'm a big believer that winter weather has a very large effect on the ensuing years' gas prices. So if someone could tell me how hot or cold next winter will be, then I will tell you the 2009 gas price.</p>
          <p>I'll also comment regarding North American supply growth in macro sense. We see the overall total Barnett Field gas production peaking in 2009 at about 5 Bcf a day and then plateauing in 2010 and 2011. Therefore new resource plays will have to be the growth driver after 2009 but we don't see the British Columbia Horn River Basin filling that gap until 2011 plus.</p>
          <p>When you view supply growth in this context, the possible emergence of new domestic resource plays is more digestible. Our 2008 oil and gas hedge position is unchanged from the last earnings call. We have added to our 2009 gas hedge position, and as a percentage of North American total, North American natural gas production, we're currently 36% hedged at an average price of $9.71.</p>
          <p>We also have a small amount of 2010 gas hedge with swaps at an average of $9.87 and we also have some gas collared at $10 floor by $12 cap. At this time we don't anticipate hedging any 2009 or 2010 oil.</p>
          <p>Now let me summarize. In my opinion there are four important points to take away from this call. First, we believe we've carved out a strong consistent niche relative to the peer group in the four most important E&amp;P metrics of ROCE, debt adjusted production per share growth, low unit costs and low net debt. If the NYMEX is a good indicator of hydrocarbon prices through year end, we expect to further pay down debt and end the year with a net debt to total cap ratio of around 8%.</p>
          <p>Today's dividend increase, the second this year, is further evidence of our conservative capital structure and our consistent game plan.</p>
          <p>Second, we are well set up to generate 13 to 15% organic production growth in 2009 and '10 with a continued mix shift toward liquids.</p>
          <p>Third, there is room for all of our captured big core resource plays to expand, and we are already seeing evidence of that occurring in our Bakken accumulation similar to the reserve expansion we have noted in Johnson County.</p>
          <p>And fourth, in addition to the Bakken our other key plays are developing as expected and we continue to work on identifying new resource plays.</p>
          <p>I'll close by noting that that I continue to be very confident regarding our consistent company strategy. With our Bakken, Barnett gas, Barnett oil, British Columbia gas, and Uinta Basin assets plus any other plays, we don't have to capture any more assets to be assured of low cost, strong organic production growth well past 2010. Since we have so many home grown assets, it's unlikely we will participate in the acquisition market.</p>
          <p>Of course, we continue to work to add new horizontal plays, targeting both oil and gas which will further strengthen our asset base. Thanks for listening and now we will go to Q&amp;A.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We will have our first question from Ben Dell, Bernstein.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Mark</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I had two questions; one was on your China assets. If I am right the gas price domestically in China is set around $3.25. Is that what you are receiving and do you believe you are going to see upside in there as the government tries to raise the domestic gas price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, the gas price that you mentioned is not the gas price we are receiving but it's not totally out of the range either. Gas prices in the Sichuan Basin are controlled by the government but it is a negotiated formula and that formula is confidential but it is tied somewhat to exports and somewhat to local consumption. I would say that the price is kind of at the high end of what we would see as long term prices in Trinidad right now. And gas demand as we see it is definitely increasing in China with time gas prices are on the upswing there. So we're happy with the gas price that we currently have negotiated and feel like we can make a very good rate of return on the asset there as long as we can make the horizontal program work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Do you mind telling me whether it was above or below the 3.25?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not really going to tell you the exact number but it is certainly right now in Trinidad I think our 8-K number is like 3.17, 3.20 something like that, and we are in the range above that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, and my second question was just on some of your oil shale plays. I was trying to get a feel for what sort of oil price would make you moderate activity in those plays? I think Mark you commented before that you believe the economics are still pretty good at $70 a barrel, is that the sort of number that you'd be looking for before you'd change your activities there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We, $60 a barrel, something like that Ben, would  be a number where we start to think, think twice about it I mean. At the current $120 a barrel, we are making extremely high reinvestment rates of return on all of our oil shale plays. So there is a lot of fat in there, I guess the way I'd describe it. Atomic fat.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>We will go next to Tom Gardner, Simmons &amp; Company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hey Mark you mentioned in light &#x2013; you mentioned that you have increased your natural gas hedges in 2009. So when you look beyond 2008, are you still bullish on North American natural gas or do you see the possibility of strong supply growth leading to gas on gas competition and what do you see the governors to North American natural gas supply growth being?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes for 2009 Tom, my sense is we'll start the heating season with between 33 and 34 in storage which will be a little bit lower than last year. But not at a crisis point lower. And then I believe it's really kind of a weather call. I think if have a normal winter or a cold winter, we're going to be, we as an E&amp;P company, we'll be very happy with the 2009 gas prices. But there is the risk that if we have an extraordinary hot winter, I think the whole sector will probably be a bit disappointed in the gas prices.</p>
          <p>Really, the point I would make is that I think in a lot of analysts' minds, the Barnett Shale which has been by far and away the biggest single growth driver of domestic production growth the last three or four years, I think a lot of people believe the Barnett Shale is just going to continue to grow indefinitely year after year after year. And our view is that the Barnett Shale as an aggregate probably has one more year of decent growth and that's 2009. And by year end 2009 we believe Johnson County is going to be pretty well drilled up by all operators on about 35 acres spacing. And that's going to remove a lot of the thrust. There will be continued drilling in Tarrant County but that's in an urban area and the rate of drilling there is not going to be anything to write home about. So when people view the gas macro 2009 and later you ought to assume in our opinion that the Barnett is just not going to be the big driving force except the one more year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you for that. Jumping over to the Bakken you mentioned that your 80 million barrels booked ties to your core area, but there is the potential for 320 acre downspacing and you have got the periphery that may be also incremental. Can you paint a picture of just how big that could be net to EOG? And assuming that works out, what sort of &#x2013; how long does that perpetuate a growth trajectory in your production in the play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the first point there, as you mentioned 80 million barrels booked, we haven't booked anywhere near that. We have booked just a small amount in relative terms so that 80 million barrels net is what we think the reserve size will be. I think we have booked about 20 million barrels to date in there.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Bakken and the possible expansion, I think we need to view that as kind of two different things in the core where the primary production is 80 million barrels. And we are getting these really, really high per well initial rates. We've defined that thoroughly enough, we believe, to now it just boils down to two questions. One, can it be downspaced from 640's to 320's. And two, whether or not one is applicable, can we figure a way to get more than about 10% of the oil in place recovery. And a 10% is what we &#x2013; is that 80 million barrel count number. So that's really boiling down to a pure reservoir engineering analysis there.  And we said that it's probably going to be early next year before we can get some definition on those two items.</p>
          <p>On the second the way that the Barnett can grow is by drilling outside this core and as this earnings conference call kind of notes, we have drilled some wells outside the core. We are very optimistic with the results. But until we watch the wells a little bit more closely for a little more period of time, we are not going to give a number on the potential size.</p>
          <p>But I think the directional trend on at least the resource play that EOG has captured would infer to me that just kind of like Johnson County where we started out sand well we had, X Tcf we are going to capture in Johnson County, and then we upped that number. The Bakken is looking like it's going to fit a similar trend. And we hope some of these other big resource plays such as British Columbia, such as the Barnett oil play, we hope those will also follow that trend, but it's just too early to tell.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great thank you for that. And just one last question on the Horn River Muskwa and then I'll hop off here. Can you just make a comparison, if you will, of the Muskwa versus the Barnett just in that key shale property? And I'll hop off.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we provided a IR presentation kind of a slide that has logs from the Barnett, that you can check the power logs from the Barnett that we normally show and now typical pipe log for the Muskwa, in which we point out that the thickness is actually greater in the Muskwa. Average thickness is about 530 feet in the Barnett. In the thickest part of the Barnett, in fact, in central Johnson County at least the thickest part that we control acreage on is about 350 feet.</p>
          <p>So, it's quite a bit thicker. Permeability is about the same in the 200, 300 nanodarcy range, which is quite good for a shale. Gas-fill porosity is roughly equivalent. Maturities are roughly equivalent. Silica content which is quite important, we think in determining fracability of the shale, is actually slightly better in the Muskwa than it is in the Barnett. So the bottom line, when you add all those together and then also the fact that the Muskwa is over-pressured to a greater extent than the Barnett is, you can pack more gas molecules per square mile into the Muskwa than you can in the Barnett to the tune of about a 2X multiplier from our best Barnett to the Muskwa average over our 840,000 acreage position. So, bottom line is it's a really good quality rock and there's more of it at higher pressure than in Johnson County.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Mark, what do you think about the prospectivity of the Three Forks/Sanish under your acreage and do you have any plan to test the Three Forks/Sanish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have tested the Three Forks/Sanish in a couple of wells in our Parshall area and a couple of our step-out wells around Parshall. We recognize that it is an additional reservoir potential in the area on our 320,000 net acre position. But I would say in the Parshall area itself, we have not found it to be a quality reservoir and are not targeting it. It's kind of spotty in its distribution around the basin we believe. It is probably part of the same cell, basin-centered oil cell as the Bakken and so we will be exploring toward it as we go forward on the remainder of our acreage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But do you I think, in your Parshall Field wells and Austin wells, do you think you are going to get some contribution from the Three Forks/Sanish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I really don't think we are. I mean we have penetrated in a couple of places. And as I said, the porosity development, particularly the permeability development in that particular zone is pretty spotty and I don't believe that it extends to any great extent under our main Parshall Field, at least from the data we have so far. Now, as I said that covers maybe 100,000 of our 320,000 acres and there is a lot more to explore for you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you, and I might have missed what you said, the tests you've done outside of Parshall, have they been more promising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not going to comment on the Sanish potential in the wells that we drilled outside of Parshall at this point. I think it's still too new to draw any conclusions and we would probably muddy the waters more than we clear it up if we tried.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. The strong wells that you reported recently, the Austin area. Are you using the same techniques that you've always used, just a single &#x2013; I think you have done a single long lateral on the 640s and using small packers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we &#x2013; that's directionally correct, Joe. But we haven't &#x2013; in the last six months we haven't further refined our completion techniques there. I think we are obviously, if you look at though &#x2013; in fact I think you put out something on the test wells completed in the Bakken. I think whatever we are doing it seems to be much better than most other companies up there in terms of initial rate and we think also in reserves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the wells you are drilling outside of the core area, are those on the border of Mountrail and Burke County?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not going to divulge anything, other than they're outside the core area right now, because there is still additional acreage we may attempt to pick up, so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. I appreciate it. And then, so that was my next question, so you are buying some more acreage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And then just on your comment on the Barnett Shale peaking in late '09. For EOG, so you need to make up for that growth wedge. Do you think the Bakken and the Barnett oil make up for that in the near term and then following that would be the Horn River Basin growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's &#x2013; actually we had a chart in our February analyst conference that kind of showed that what happens is our Barnett gas begins to flatten out in 2009, but that's when the Barnett oil kicks in. So we expect to have many years of continued aggregate Barnett growth, but the mix is going to be more toward liquids going forward.</p>
          <p>And just another comment, when I brought this item up about the Barnett peaking in '09, people say well can't you go in and re-frac or couldn't you drill on let's say, 15 acres spacing. We believe particularly in Johnson County, the re-fracs are not likely to work and so you are not going to get any big surge from that. And we also believe that drilling the wells on even more concentrated spacing is probably also not going to work. So our view of the Barnett, clearly in Johnson County is it's kind of a one-time shot and until we get some new technology that we are not aware of, there's not necessarily going to be a second round there. We think that also applies to other parts of the core area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's helpful. Then lastly could you just comment on the recent trend for drilling and completion costs and also comment on the availability of steel to develop your various programs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sir. Joe, our costs have been fairly flat through first half of '08 and we're starting to see a little bit of increase, yes it's through tubulars and fuel costs. That's principally, that's in East Texas. Rocky Mountains, we are starting to see a little bit of an increase in stimulation costs, because we're seeing shortage there. Fort Worth area, the costs are pretty flat. Rigs are starting to tighten up a little bit there. So overall, our costs have been lower, first half '08, compared to '07, but we may see costs increase slightly here in the second half, giving up some of those gains.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the tubular question, the tubular situation is about as tight as we've seen it in the last 20 or 30 years. We're literally in a mode on many of our wells of kind of just in time delivery to get the pipe there to the well site, literary hours before we have to run it in the well. Whether this tightens further which could actually reduce drilling activity, we don't know. We generally expect it to remain tight, but not to be a pinch point where in a macro sense people are laying down rigs because they can't get pipe. But we are not an expert on the tubular market.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Wanted to see if you could provide any additional color on the Barnett oil play that you highlighted briefly in your remarks. But I guess what incrementally is driving your level of confidence that this can be a major wedge I guess looking out to 2009 and probably more importantly 2010 and '11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in terms of and I know people would love to hear a lot more details on the oil play or at least have some other kind of peer company confirming the oil play. As we mentioned the, this is the one play where we pretty well locked up the vast majority of the acreage before we went public with it. And we are aware that at least one other peer company went in after our analyst call and attempted to gain an acreage position and then pulled out after several months when they realized it would be very difficult for them to get any sizable acreage position. So we pretty much control this play at least among the public companies, and what we're currently doing is we are experimenting with the completion techniques on both horizontal and we're also looking at vertical wells.</p>
          <p>As I mention, there are some private companies that have completed some vertical wells, and they're 100% reinvestment rate of return wells. So we are open minded enough to say well, we'll look at horizontal, we'll also look at vertical here since there is a track record of successful vertical wells. But the problem we have is we can't get any sustained tests on much of anything there because there is pretty much, pretty close to zero capacity for anybody to take the gas up there in Montague County. And so we just &#x2013; we have to wait until we get our plant built before we can really do much with these things.</p>
          <p>So I would just say the reason we are so excited about the play is that we continue to confirm that the oil in place per square mile there is huge, over 30 million barrels per square mile in some of that area. If you just get a small percentage of that, 2% or so you can get upwards of pretty big numbers. But everybody is just going to have to be patient until year end or the first quarter before we can provide any more specific details on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And could you just refresh us from your analysts meeting whether, and I apologize for not recalling this, whether it is really just for now, a oil in place call or are there any &#x2013; is there any even initial production rate data or any initial decline data to speak of that gives you the confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At our analyst call in February we talked about our initial I think it was eight wells if I am not mistaken Maire, that we had drilled eight horizontal wells. And we showed in our first quarter we talked about the IPs of those wells ranging from 150 to 350 barrels of oil per day and 0.5 million to 1 million cubic feet of gas per day, which yielded a direct A-tax rate of return of around 65%. And that's really all we put it out Brian at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Have those wells been producing or are they constrained because of the gas issue and I guess if they have been producing can you talk about what you have seen since then?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah most of them have been constrained, most &#x2013; all of them basically have been constrained with just intermittent production at best. But the very limited production data we have still confirms those kind of estimates. But we are really suffering from a paucity of data until we get some more infrastructure up there. And I'll note that when we presented this to everybody in February we said this is a 2009 event, it's not a 2008 event. So that's kind of our information that we can provide to you at this time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great, and then separately on the higher CapEx which seems to, a lot beyond increased leasing. Can you just talk, provide any more color on whether that represents acres acquisitions and plays you discussed versus bulking up on new resource plays? I think you mentioned, you've seen some sharp increases in leasing costs, so maybe we should interpret that that represents Bakken into a Marcellus. I don't know if there's any color you can provide there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah we are &#x2013; in the Marcellus specifically, we are not chasing any additional acreage up there at this time. What we are seeing though is that &#x2013; as you guys on the sell side are well aware is that every E&amp;P company wants to have a stable full of resource plays. and so the acreage costs even for first movers on potential recourse plays,  the acreage cost have gone up dramatically. And so what we are doing is that we are trying to be &#x2013; to not chase the hot plays per se but even the front end costs in some plays that we thought would be kind of undercover plays, it's costing us more to get acreage there than we would have thought. So, a big majority of that money that we are talking about is, is in plays that we really haven't currently disclosed, that we will be evaluating over the next year or two.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Couple of questions, if you look at, and you've kind of alluded to this Mark but if you look at your 2009 growth target that you guys laid out kind of 13 to 15% number, how confident are you today in that number? Is that a P-70 number or a P-50 number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am pretty darn confident in the number. I don't know I want to put a P specifically on it. But it's a pretty reasonable number and that number was 13 to 15% production growth for 2009. The components of that growth really are we have got a sustained drilling program in the Vernal area there, you incubation that you just need one more year kind of a standard program. The Bakken is currently outperforming the estimates that we provided in the February analyst call, and we expect the Bakken will continue to outperform throughout all of 2009 based on what we stated already on this call.</p>
          <p>And then the Barnett oil should be coming on during that timeframe as well as the rest of our plays. So the only, absent some extraordinary events, such as inavailability of rigs, inavailability of steel, some unusual collapse in hydrocarbon prices, I think we are pretty well set up for the production growth for 2009. And really we have watched a lot of companies' strategy here over the course of this year and there seems to be a lot of companies that are paying really premium prices for either acreage in hot areas or producing properties in hot areas.</p>
          <p>We sit back and say if we just look at the inventory we have in hand today even if we never added another resource play, we are pretty well set up well past 2010, just developing the assets we already have and have disclosed. So we just don't see any need to go out there and literally spend billions and billions of dollars on chasing some of these assets. And so it's extremely unlikely that we will do that either this year or 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And then along those lines, so you do have obviously net debt to cap, targeted sub 10%. Any more commentary on what your thoughts are with the cash balance that you are going to be building or you're kind of projecting run at a breakeven cash CapEx over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I mean a preliminary thought for 2009 would be, if you just took today's NYMEX prices for 2009 that we'd probably end up with a roughly cash neutral &#x2013; cash flow neutral program in 2009. So the game plan will be to continue to have very, very low levels of debt, net debt in 2009, and later. Probably we'll continue to have the best ROCE to the peer group and lowest unit costs as well as the lowest debt. And then 2009, '10 debt adjusted production growth per share, we may not be in first place in that. But I believe we will be in the top quartile every single year. And frankly we just don't see the need to &#x2013; if we're growing the company at 14, 15%, per year, we're just not that anxious to lever up the company in a monstrous way, so that we can say we've got production growth in the low 20s per year. We'd much rather have an extremely low debt and high ROCEs and be growing the company at nominally 14, 15% per year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Refreshing view. And the last comment, a lot of talk on sell-side and buy-side as prices trend down on natural gas, have collapsed over the last month. What do you believe the marginal cost of supply is right now in the US kind of from a natural gas standpoint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, it's probably currently 8 to $9, I would guess, with the way marine equipment costs have gone up and in the onshore areas you're probably looking at $7.50, something like that, maybe $8. So the issue I think on, just comment on gas prices, a month or so ago they were $13, $13.50. And personally I was wondering why they were going up so much, because I couldn't see any fundamental supply-demand situation that would drive them up toward 13, $14.</p>
          <p>So my sense is they were just overpriced a month ago and now they are back in, in my mind a price of $10, maybe $9 is probably a more rational price assuming kind of a normal winter for this coming winter. So I view the collapse as a collapse from a price that was more an emotional price there at 13.50.</p>

And like I say, we just have no first hand results ourselves about the Haynesville. And so we &#x2013; and I  know there's kind of big argument going on in the industry but is the Haynesville a really big play or is it a localized play or is it a play at all.

          <p>The majority, the vast majority of the 100,000 acres is just legacy acreage.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But you know maybe about half our acreage is kind of in that area that you just described there east of Nacogdoches.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes I've driven that road a few times. The other question I had just thinking about the Bakken and defining the extension area, talk about 100,000 acres that are in this primarily core Parshall. How should we think about &#x2013; you may not even want to get into the direction of the extension areas you are still leasing, but we've thought of a crescent sort of as the Bakken has developed. How do you think about what &#x2013; where we should think about that extension area heading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we would like leave that as murky as possible regarding the geometry of that extension. And frankly the geometry of the core area, we think we understand now pretty well what the boundaries are on the really high quality core area. As we have said before, there is a rind of somewhat lesser quality but still economic acreage around that core area. And the geometry as we understand it is better defined now. But it will expand we believe in the rind area, particularly will expand and we'd rather not comment on what direction that might go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And everybody is keeping their eye on Barnett oil and it looks like the majority of your permits are more in Montague County as opposed to Clay and Archer. Is that just an indication of where infrastructure is located now more so than quality of wells, or can we read anything into the concentration of EOG permits further to the east?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that there is a similarity between Montague County which is the farthest east and then you go to Clay and then you go to west, you go to Archer as you move west. There is a similarity to the Barnett gas in that, as you move out of Montague County going west, the zone gets thinner and you lose the Viola which insulates you from the Ellenburger waters.</p>
          <p>So out of the reserve estimates that we've kind of put out so far, the biggest single contributor to that by far is Montague County. And so we have done some drilling out to the west but like I say more wells in Montague than in the west and that's where if, as this oil play develops, I think Montague will be the name you're hearing a lot more frequently than Archer and Clay.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful, and then on the balance sheet side, do you guys think at all about, or how would you think about share repurchase programs or where that would fit into your capital allocation process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean with the stock price declines, we have kind of put that back on the table as something that we have in our arsenal. I'd say that at this point it's still more likely that we'll run the company with low debt as opposed to attempting to kind of lead anyone to believe that we are going to be jumping into a big share repurchase program in the future. The preference would be to just run the company at very low debt in 2009, '10, '11 and have kind of balanced program, cash flow versus CapEx post 2008. But depending on how the stock reacts and whether it corrects further in the negative direction, we certainly have the firepower to do something about it in terms of repurchases. We'll just be watching it every day.</p>

          <p>Just one additional thing, on the Barnett gas peaking in 2009, make sure we are all measuring from the same point. What is current Barnett gas production as you guys are measuring it to compare versus the 5 Bcf a day?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning. First thanks for a very measured and sort of sane view of gas markets and growth. In terms of questions, can you give us an idea of the volumes out of the Bakken currently and how many wells you have producing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we don't want to get into specifics on there, because of &#x2013; and the main reason we don't is, if we give a specific volume now, then somebody will ask for it next quarter and if it happened to be 500 barrels a day lower than what somebody has projected it at then someone will write a sell-side write-up to say Bakken less than expected for third quarter or so. So we just don't want to, kind of like with the Barnett, we'll give an annual goal and we've provided an annual goal in the February analyst conference for this year for the Bakken and what we can tell you is we're going to beat that number. But we're not going to give you specifics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great and thanks. The other question I have is on the Marcellus. Besides infrastructure issues and permitting and what not, is there anything in terms of the geology or consistency of results that makes you more negative or more measured on the play?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I'd say that we are a little more measured on the play than perhaps some others that you are reading out there in that the thickness is quite a bit less than we see and obviously than we see in the Barnett. And it's a good quality rock, and it's well distributed over broad areas. As I said the thickness is an issue. In some cases, pressure is an issue. But probably the most unknown risk factor that we and others are dealing with right now is frac efficacy, frac barrier containment in the Marcellus itself. So the kind of results that we're hearing about in parts of Pennsylvania that are showing 3 to 4 Bcf a well, that really does not comport well with the kind of IPs that we are seeing in the rest of the play. And really the way we model the place more of a 1.5 to 2 Bcf a well kind of play, particularly if you are looking at big program averages. It's really, really difficult to average 3 to 4 Bcf a well over a whole play.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of the frac efficacies, is it the lack of a frac barrier in certain areas that you can't contain the fracs or is there some sort of embedded shale that's interfering with fracs? Any more color you can provide on that possibly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really that is specific as I'd care to get. I think there are differences in the frac barriers throughout the play from geographic area to geographic area and that's I think the biggest unknown in the play right now amongst the operators.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well great. Thanks for that color.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thanks. The question on the Bakken here. You guys talked about some peak rates in your press release from three new wells at 3.7. 1.9, and 3.2 million barrels per day here. Just trying to get a sense of what the term is on those rates. Are those one day peak rates? How are we measuring that here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah those rates &#x2013; I mean for the Bakken, are you asking about the Bakken there, Leo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah I mean you quoted some numbers there. I'm not sure where those numbers came from, 3.7. I guess that's thousand barrels a day. Okay. Yes those are just initial rates. They're probably the first three or four days rates. And these wells will decline at pretty sharp rates and to some degree that's &#x2013; you can't use that number and say that's going to be a yearly average or anything like that. But what they do &#x2013; if you kind of compare those initial rates with what we have seen from some of the other peer companies up there, you will find that they are considerably higher, in many cases, double, triple, five times initial rates from some of these other companies. And it just shows that there is a correlation between the initial rates and the ultimate reserves on the wells. The higher the initial rate, the more reserves you are going to get out of the well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you guys have enough data in that play to talk about what you expect for first year annual decline rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we do and I am not sure we can quote it and give it to you here. We could probably, if you wanted to call Maire later on we will dig it out. But the answer is yes, we have got a pretty accurate type curve on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jumping over to the Uinta play, you guys mentioned two recent wells that came on production here. Any indication of what those flow rates are and I guess are those producing at this point without restriction?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Yes, they are producing without restriction. Like I say they've only been on about two weeks. We really don't want give any flow rates or anything on them other than to say we are pleased.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just to clarify on your comments about the Barnett gas here. You talked about industry peaking at some point in 2009. Do you also expect that EOG's volumes in the Barnett are going to peak in 2009, or are you guys going to have a little bit more legs than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in terms of the Barnett gas volumes, yes we expect they will probably peak and then plateau in 2010 and '11 and then we expect to have the oil volumes layered in. But generally we think we will be similar to the industry in the Barnett gas portion.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. In China did the earthquake have any effect on either the operations there and/or the plans to move forward with that in the future with concerns about infrastructure and susceptibility to earthquakes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the answer to that is no. It was in an area far enough away from the stuff &#x2013; the field we're dealing with that there was no effect either on the down-hole equipment or any on the surface, no pipeline related issues or anything like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Loren you commented that the Muskwa has, is over-pressured. Did I hear you right that you said it's two times pressured or was that overall between all the things that's twice as good?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No that's an overall, twice as good &#x2013; twice as much gas in place per square mile.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what is the pore pressure grade in Muskwa?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It ranges from the East to the West side of the basin, but all of that basin is more over-pressured by gradient than is the Barnett. And the Barnett may be in the 4.8 to 5.2 range and the Muskwa is substantially higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, 0.7 range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Really not give an actual number for that as it does vary across the basin and that's kind of one of the controlling parameters for gas in place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that potentially mean the decline rates are going to be higher too, though, if it's more over-pressured?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. I think it's just going to pack more molecules into the pore structure that you have. The decline rates &#x2013; we don't have long term production, some others have a little bit longer term production we do. And they don't look out of the ordinary to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our guess Gil is the decline rates will be similar to a Barnett gas type curve decline rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Last question I have, sort of a macro question for you Mark, is you're saying that maybe the gas ending inventory is 3.3, 3.4. And I think you've been saying before, it'd be more like 3.2, 3.3. If that's right, what's changed that? It's a little bit obviously a little than last year but still a little higher than your previous estimate. What's changed in that interim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the previous earnings call, I did not use 3.2. I said I expected it to be 3.3. So now I'm saying, on average 3.35.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's within a realm of accuracy but I don't recall ever saying 3.2.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay, so you are seeing no major change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we really don't think there's a major change. I think as everybody knows the comps there in August are going to be really tough to beat relative to last year's August. But I guess if I just stand back and look, and say okay, over the last 9 or 10 storage injection reports, in my mind, we have had one disappointingly various report which was the one or two weeks ago. And that may or may not have been affected by the July 4 holiday. But other than that the rest of them have been pretty much in line. Some over, some under, but it doesn't indicate to me that we have got this massive oversupply situation.</p>
          <p>I think it's just more psychology right now that oil prices are falling a bit. People know that last August was so hot that this August it will be really doubtful that  it's as hot. So push the sell button for gas futures is what some people appear to be saying. But I don't think the fundamentals are particularly weak at all really.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Given your generally bullish outlook, can you just maybe &#x2013; you said this earlier and I missed it. But could you just give some rationalization of why you've actually taken your hedges for '09 above your hedges in percentage terms, at least over '08?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we on the last earnings call, I believe, we were 30% hedged for '09 and we said that we would likely add to those hedges. And now we are currently 36% hedged at a 9.71 price. Kind of we view that as kind of a reasonable price where we are not at a camp that says gas next year is going be $12. We think $10, $9, 9.50 is probably a more reasonable gas price unless you have a really, really cold winter. So that's why we have locked in some of that is, we've locked it in at what we think is a rational gas price for next year</p>

          <p>I mean, comment in just a general sense there that if you look at the rock, it's considerably thinner than the Barnett. And basically in Johnson County, the average in Johnson County is not 3 to 4 Bcf a well, it's less than that. And so when you're dealing with the Marcellus which is less geo-pressured and much thinner, it just doesn't make good reservoir engineering sense that you are going to get recoveries of 4 Bcf a well when that hadn't been averaged in Johnson County. So, we just think that, that number is probably a number that we believe is unrealistic. And then you clearly do have a problem with containing the fracs within that relatively thin zone. You have more of a problem in the Marcellus than you do in the Barnett. So that's another reason for caution.</p>
