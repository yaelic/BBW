          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Ashley, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corp's Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you.</p>
          <p>I would now turn the conference call over to Daniel Briggs, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ashley. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today are Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Leven, our President and Chief Operating Officer; Rob Goldstein, President of The Venetian Las Vegas and The Palazzo and Ken Kay, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I need to remind you that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of Federal Securities Laws. I would also like to caution you that the company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>Please see today's press release under the caption Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results. In addition, we may discuss adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and adjusted property EBITDAR, which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Adelson.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan, and thank all of you for joining us today. I want to make a couple of opening remarks before I turn the call over to Mike Leven. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our first quarter results. In Las Vegas we have The Venetian and Palazzo benefit from having a greater emphasis on convention and group meeting business during mid week periods. We outpaced the market according to our comparative analysis in RevPAR.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have witnessed recent positive trends in gaming volumes and an improving environment for future group business bookings, especially into later 2009 and early 2010, which together with the full implementation of our cost savings program should benefit our Las Vegas performance going forward.</p>
          <p>In Macao, the Venetian Macao continues to enjoy marketing leading visitation, healthy mass play, retail and hotel revenues and has become less reliant on rolling play for its cash flow generation than is the market overall.</p>
          <p>So clearly, our properties in both Las Vegas and Macao each presents a broad diversification of sources for both revenue and cash flow. The diversification relative stability of our revenues and cash flow streams are serving us quite well in the current environment and will serve us equally well as the environment improves in the future.</p>
          <p>Finally, I want to acknowledge that as we sit here today, we do so as a disciplined united management team, and I'm confident in our ability to manage through the current operating environment. Mike has really hit the ground running and it's clear to me that the company will benefit greatly from his decades of experience running large multinational enterprises and driving efficiencies across global operations. I am also pleased with the financial leadership Ken Kay has brought to the company as we work to implement our 470 million cost saving program and to increase our cash flow and maximize our financial flexibility.</p>
          <p>Now for those of you who have not had an opportunity to meet him yet, I would like to turn the call over to our new President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Leven.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon, and thank you all for joining us. It's a pleasure for me to be with you today and to provide a quarterly update on the company for the first time. I look forward to working with you all in the future. While I have only been serving as President of the company for approximately two months and thus it's still very early days for me, I think a few things are very clear.</p>
          <p>First, the level of talent, commitment, dedication, and enthusiasm of Las Vegas Sands team members is excellent. It's an honor for me to join this management team to lead such an accomplished group of employees.</p>
          <p>Second, the business plan that the company implemented in November of 2008 is working very effectively. I'm pleased to report that we have made very notable progress. That plan has three basic components.</p>
          <p>First, to maximize cash flow from our current operating properties in Las Vegas and Macao, predominantly by the implementation of cost control and efficiency measures. Those cost savings initiatives will deliver approximately $470 million of annual savings once they are fully implemented later this year. Additionally, we will continue working to exceed that number.</p>
          <p>Second, to deliver our two ongoing developments Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and Sands Bethlehem in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on time and on budget.</p>
          <p>And third to reduce our leverage and generate additional liquidity through the sale of non-core assets or the monetization of certain of our existing operational activities. We have made progress on each of these three components of our plan during this first quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to the first component, maximizing cash flow from current operations, we have identified and are targeting approximately $470 million of annual cost savings across our company, the majority of which will be permanent in nature. Our ability to control our costs across the entire organization is a critical component in our plan, and we will continue to seek opportunities to run our business more efficiently in today's environment.</p>
          <p>We expect to achieve greater operating leverage companywide and as the company continues its growth into new markets, there will naturally be opportunities for additional synergies in operations and management.</p>
          <p>Stepping back, the change in the operating environment has provided us with the unique opportunity to right-size our business for the long term. We expect to operate our business more efficiently both in today's environment and in tomorrow's. These permanent efforts will require the complete commitment and dedication of our executives and employees and I'm pleased to say we're getting that commitment in spades.</p>
          <p>Turning to the second element of our plan, the delivery of our Singapore and Bethlehem developments on time and on budget, we are making steady progress and both developments are tracking according to schedule. At Sands Bethlehem, we are progressing steadily towards a planned opening on May 22, less than three weeks from today, with a grand opening celebration planned for June 9.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, we continue to target a December -- December '09, January '10 opening for the Marina Bay Sands while working with the Singapore Tourism Board to finalize a progressive opening schedule. I'll provide some additional detail on our Singapore and Bethlehem developments in a few moments.</p>
          <p>Finally, with respect to the third component of our plan, deleveraging through the sale of non-core assets or the monetization of certain of our operational activities, we are continuing our efforts to sell both units at the Four Season Apart Hotel in Macao and our retail malls. While we realize the market conditions for the sale of these assets are less than ideal, the monetization of these assets remains one of the alternatives potentially available to us as we evaluate the full set of deleveraging strategies available. We will continue to pursue these sales and Ken will provide an update on these processes and other opportunities later in the call.</p>
          <p>Moving now to our first quarter operating results, I will give a brief overview and then turn it over to Rob to provide some color and perspective on our Las Vegas operations. Overall, and as Sheldon mentioned in his opening comments, our properties continue to generate significant cash flow. People are continuing to visit in great numbers, although they are spending less particularly in room rate.</p>
          <p>The implementation of our cost savings programs in all our properties is a critical lever we are using to protect cash flow in this environment and to create operating leverage for the future. We believe that the quality of our assets together with the differentiation of our operating strategies, particularly our focus on group business in Las Vegas and the mass gaming and non-gaming market segments in Macao are important factors as we manage our business in the current environment.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob to discuss our Las Vegas operations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. Despite the environment in Las Vegas, our operations delivered adjusted property EBITDAR of approximately $90 million in the first quarter. Last year the first quarter, we generated $122 million in adjusted property EBITDAR. Last year's results reflect the higher table games hold percentage, approximately 25.3%, versus this year's 20.6% in the first quarter '09. EBITDAR margin was down from first quarter 2008, but improved over 90 basis points on a sequential basis.</p>
          <p>As we implement additional cost savings at the two properties, we expect to further improve our operating leverage in Las Vegas. Room revenue declined by $13 million driven principally by ADR decline. Year-on-year table games hold percentage resulted in $21 million less revenue when comparing Q1 '09 to Q1 '08.</p>
          <p>Visitation at both properties remains healthy, our occupancy for both properties is greater than 90%. The Palazzo achieved occupancy of 92.7 and a first quarter ADR of 221. The Palazzo which just completed its first year anniversary has continued to blossom and has been very well received by our guests. Its ADR and occupancy as well as its growing &#x2013; its growing healthy gaming volumes reflects its growing appeal to the consumer.</p>
          <p>While we've enjoyed solid visitation and healthy hotel occupancy, the economic environment has resulted in decreases in both ADR and revenue per visitor. Our strategy to maximize cash in this  environment is to maintain high levels of occupancy at both hotels, expand our room block for gaming customers, pursue additional group business and segments for meetings, decisions and be less impacted by the softer economy and to aggressively manage our cost structure.</p>
          <p>The properties will benefit from these efforts on an ongoing basis and it appears that April was the best month of the year for adjusted property EBITDA. From the hotel perspective, we have traditionally benefited from a strong foundation of convention and group business which has allowed us to enjoy higher mid-week ADRs than the market and benefit from strong and profitable ancillary group related revenues. While we are naturally not expecting group business to be strong this year, as it has been in the past, we do believe our group business base has insulated us somewhat from the softer conditions in the other segments.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, our group room ADR carried a healthy 24% premium over our FIT ADR and our group business in '10 and '11 is now starting to improve as future bookings come in and groups that had previously cancelled for 2009 are booking future years. So the group segment while facing challenges certainly in this environment is very much alive and well and remains a cornerstone of our business strategy here in Las Vegas.</p>
          <p>First quarter gaming volumes across our Las Vegas properties were down when compared to last year's first quarter. Combined Venetian Palazzo table drop was $444 million, spot handle was $706 million. Our table games business held up well compared to the Las Vegas market overall with volumes down less than 3% compared to last year's first quarter. While gaming volumes were down in the first two months of the quarter compared to the first two months of '08, we gained some momentum in March and those positive trends continued into April. Our combined slot <mark type="inaudible" /> was higher in Q1 '09 as opposed to Q1 '08. Our volume, however, was down. We have revised our game mix and marketing strategy to increase hold percentage from our slot product.</p>
          <p>Despite the relative stability in our business overall, we are cognizant of the current challenging operating environment. We have thus expanded our plans to reduce our cost structure. We're now targeting approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings across our Vegas operations. We expect to fully implement those cost savings this year and will continue to seek additional opportunities to remove costs.</p>
          <p>Some of the initiatives implemented thus far include labor efficiencies, which includes the 17% overall payroll savings from our peak payroll period in 2008, reductions in marketing and advertising and the implementation of a more streamlined procurement process. Our objective remains to pursue these initiatives while not sacrificing the guest experience.</p>
          <p>So in summary, people are certainly still visiting our Las Vegas properties in large numbers for both business and leisure purpose. We believe our asset base with its luxury and approachable offers a diversified product mix both from a content and price perspective, as it relates to retail, restaurant and entertainment products.</p>
          <p>With that I will hand it back to Mike and look forward to addressing your questions at the completion of the prepared remarks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob. Let's turn for a moment to Macao and start with The Venetian Macao, which generated more than 120 million of adjusted property EBITDAR for the first quarter of 2009 versus 110 million in the first quarter of 2008. This favorable result was accomplished in an environment where gaming revenues and visitation are both down in the Macao market overall. Visitation has remained strong with The Venetian Macao enjoying more than six million visits to the property during the first quarter. That visitation drove healthy mass play and hotel occupancy for the quarter. Our CotaiJet ferry service also carried 1.4 million passengers in the first quarter and maintained its 30% market share of customers traveling from Hong Kong to Macao.</p>
          <p>Our convention and group business accounted for over 150,000 visitors and approximately 13% of our room nights sold. The three-pronged operating strategy for The Venetian Macao that we implemented in 2008 has been effective and will continue through 2009, albeit with a heightened focused on rightsizing. The first initiative is to manage our VIP business. We expect the Macao's markets, overall VIP rolling volumes will decline somewhat in 2009 after the unsustainable growth driven by excess liquidity in the market in 2008. However, we have bucked that trend so far.</p>
          <p>The Macao market's increasingly competitive commission structure significantly reduced the profitability of this business for gaming concessionaires through 2008. While the VIP business remains a contributor to our adjusted EBITDAR, it is important to recognize that it contributed only about 18% of our adjusted property EBITDAR at The Venetian Macao in the first quarter. That is down from approximately 22% during the first quarter of 2008 when we made $110 million on EBITDAR versus the 121 this year.</p>
          <p>So, our ability to generate more EBITDAR on roughly consistent rolling volume illustrates the diversified nature of our cash flows with about 30% coming from non-gaming sources, principally hotel rooms, entertainment and retail, and over 50% coming from mass gaming play and slots in the first quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Given that backdrop, our principal objectives for the VIP rolling business remain careful management of the business and the control of credit risk, while we focus on the development of more profitable direct play, particularly for markets outside of mainland China, including Japan, Korea, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, our non-junket VIP play at The Venetian Macao grew to 17.3% of our total rolling volume compared to only 13% in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>The second strategy is to grow our mass table and slot business. Our Cotai ferry service remains a key tool in support of visitation to the Cotai Strip and The Venetian Macao. And the direct correlation between increasing visitation and increasing slot play is an important development in the Macao market's maturation as an integrated resort destination. We expect the addition of City of Dreams to add important critical mass to the Cotai Strip, increase our ferry occupancy and further solidify Macao's growing presence as the destination resort of Asia.</p>
          <p>The promotional offerings of the CotaiJet are being targeted to casino customers and the service continues to drive traffic to the property. After increasing the frequency of its sailings in July of last year, CotaiJet has now established itself with a market share of about 30% on the Hong Kong Macao route. That direct service of the Cotai Strip is one important contributor to strong slot play for the quarter, which was up nearly 50% compared to the first quarter of 2008 and to healthy non-rolling chip table games play.</p>
          <p>Our third initiative is to control our cost structure. Our cost reduction program targets approximately 270 million in annualized cost savings across our Macao operations. This program is designed to reduce our operating cost while preserving <mark type="inaudible" /> jobs as possible and maintaining a world-class customer experience for our guests.</p>
          <p>The effects on EBITDAR margin at the property have already been felt with both year-over-year and sequential improvements in margin. We will continue to align our head count with the current rather than future needs of our business. In January, we reduced the normal hours worked per week for dealers in Macao from 48 hours to 40. This change allowed us to both save approximately 1,000 jobs of Macao residents while reducing our dealer payroll by approximately 13%. In addition, we reduced our overall labor force of non-resident employees by over 1,000 through a combination of layoffs and attrition.</p>
          <p>Our important areas of the cost reduction program include transportation, utilities and general hotel operating costs. Although we have done a lot of work, our work here continues and we will update you on our progress as the year continues. Although we made some significant progress, there is much work to be done. We will update you on our additional efforts in the future quarters.</p>
          <p>So, we think those three strategies have contributed to a sold performance for The Venetian Macao during the quarter. The full implementation of our cost savings program will contribute additional EBITDA in the coming quarters and in the years to come.</p>
          <p>Let me spend a moment on The Sands Macao. The Sands delivered over $50 and adjusted property EBITDAR for the quarter. Rolling volume of 5.1 billion was down 8% compared to the quarter one year ago and while mass drop was down, The Sands remains a leader in mass play on the Macao peninsula, recording 613 million of mass drop in the quarter. Our additional cost savings initiatives will further improve The Sands cost structure and we believe can increase the property's cash flow generation and capability.</p>
          <p>Now a moment on the Four Seasons Hotel. This new property generated approximately $4 million in adjusted property EBITDAR during the first quarter. We have clearly experienced a slower ramp at the property that we would have liked. The property has however experienced a steady increase in both visitation and mass play in each month since its opening, as awareness of the property has grown, particularly in the Hong Kong market. The Four Seasons Hotel has maintained a very healthy ADR of $295 during the first quarter, and Four Seasons' management has now begun to promote the property to increase occupancy with a various bundled packages that include spa treatments and special events.</p>
          <p>Importantly, later this quarter we will open two floors of VIP gaming space and premiere our 19 Paiza mansions. These exclusive suites, among the most luxurious in our portfolio, will each have their own private gaming salon and will be marketed directly to VIP customer residing throughout the region. So that covers our Macao operations.</p>
          <p>Let's now move to our development activities and address our two ongoing development projects Sands Bethlehem in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. As I mentioned previously, bringing both of these projects to market on time and on budget is fundamental to our growth and deleveraging strategies. We are firmly dedicated to these objectives.</p>
          <p>Sands Bethlehem will open on May 22, less than three weeks from today, with a grand opening planned for June 9. We have completed the installation of 3000 slot machines on the gaming floor, initiated our marketing activities and are finalizing our preparations for the related events commemorating the opening of the property. We will also be adding an additional 2000 machines in November.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, The Marina Bay Sands construction process continues at pace. To-date we have completed more than 55% of the construction, and the hotel towers are currently at floor 42 of the 55-floor structure. We remain on track to top out the three towers at floor 55 in July. Greater than 95% of the construction costs have been contacted and are subject to firm pricing.</p>
          <p>Naturally a project with this scope and scale will retain a level of uncertainty until it nears completion, but at this time we remain comfortable with both the construction budget and timeline. We are cooperating, working with the Singapore Tourism Board towards a targeted opening in December or January of '09 and '10.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the call over to Ken to provide an update on our ongoing asset sales processes in Macao, some more data on our cost reductions as well as our liquidity and capital resources overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike. As Mike mentioned previously, the deleveraging of our balance sheet is the third aspect of our plan and the successful monetization of non-core assets is an important element of that deleveraging strategy.</p>
          <p>As you know, we are currently marketing shares in a cooperative structure that will provide the holders of the shares the exclusive use of a unit in the Four Seasons Apartment Hotel in Macao. In addition, we have been marketing our two retail malls in Macao to prospective buyers. With respect to the Four Seasons Apart Hotel tower, while it is clear that residential property prices in the region have been negatively impacted by the weakness in the global economy and progress has been slower than we might have hoped, our marketing and sales efforts are continuing.</p>
          <p>With respect to the modernization of our retail assets, both The Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian Macao and the shops at Four Seasons Macao, we received bids in the last two weeks and are continuing to negotiate with several parties that have submitted the most attractive of the bids. Until that process is concluded, there is not much more that we can add at the present time.</p>
          <p>Lastly, we are also pursuing alternatives to monetize a minority interest in certain of our assets in Macao. As Sheldon mentioned earlier this year, several parties have expressed interest in engaging in such a transaction with us and we are continuing discussions with those interested parties as well as considering other attractive alternatives that may be available.</p>
          <p>Cost savings is obviously a critical component of our operating strategy. In February 2009, we discussed that we hit a target of approximately $250 million of annualized cost savings and that we had realized about $100 million of savings in the year ended December 31, 2008. During the first quarter of 2009 we identified additional savings opportunities throughout the organization and we are now targeting approximately $470 million of annualized savings in the program. We expect to realize approximately $340 million of that amount in calendar 2009, including $80 million that we realized in the quarter ended March 31, 2009, and another approximately $30 million in 2010 calendar year.</p>
          <p>Of the $80 million in savings realized in the first quarter of 2009, approximately $30 million was realized in Las Vegas while approximately $50 million was realized throughout our Macao operations. In evaluating our cost savings progress in Las Vegas, it is important to recognize that the first quarter of 2008 had steadily increasing costs as we brought the amenities of The Palazzo online throughout the first quarter.</p>
          <p>So the $30 million of savings in the first quarter of 2009 were partially offset by increases in operating costs in The Palazzo that peaked in the second quarter of 2008. The impact of our realized savings will be more transparent in our year-over-year operating results as we move through 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to our cost-savings progress in Macao. The $50 million in savings realized this quarter is partially offset by the ramp up COGS related to the opening of the Four Seasons Hotel Macao and The Palazzo Casino. Our operating leverage should become more pronounce as we move through the remainder of the year. An important point with all these cost-savings measures, as Mike pointed out previously, is that we view them as a permanent rightsizing program that will allow us to realize strong cash flow generation and significantly improved EBITDAR margins when room rates eventually improve.</p>
          <p>As of March 31, we have approximately $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. In addition, we have approximately $1.6 billion of availability under our undrawn credit facilities at current exchange rates principally through our Singapore credit facility. So together, we have approximately $4.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and sources of liquidity. The uses for the $4.5 billion include approximately $1.9 billion of capital expenditures pre-opening, FF&amp;E, and construction period interest to get to the opening of our Marina Bay Sands, Sands Bethlehem and Four Seasons Apartment Hotel projects and approximately $475 million for the suspension of sites five and six in the St. Regis condo tower.</p>
          <p>Total debt is $10.4 billion of which no significant maturities occur until May 2011 when approximately $570 million related to our Macao revolver comes due and then in May 2012 when our U.S. revolver is due.</p>
          <p>Scheduled principal payments required for the remainder of 2009 and in 2010 total of $95.3 million and $198.4 million respectively. In addition to not having near-term maturities on our outstanding debt, the cost of borrowing is quite low with a current weighted average rate of approximately 3.25% which reflects a healthy reduction from the weighted average first quarter rate of 7.19% in 2008.</p>
          <p>So, it's important not to lose site of the advantages of our debt. It's long-dated, has very narrow spreads and provides us flexibility to allocate cash to our various developments. With respect to our debt covenants, for a domestic credit facility our trailing 12 months EBITDAR at March 31, 2009, for compliance purposes was $479 million. At March 31, 2009, our total gross domestic debt for compliance purposes was $5.2 billion. Our cash balances within the U.S. restricted group were $2.2 billion and our calculated net debt for covenant compliance calculation purposes was $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio for covenant compliance calculation purposes was 6.42 times compared to a maximum leverage covenant in our U.S. credit facility of seven times.</p>
          <p>For the Venetian Macao restricted group, our trailing 12 month EBITDAR at March 31, 2009, for compliance purposes was $823 million. At March 31, 2009, The Venetian Macao restricted group total gross debt for compliance purposes was $3.18 million, and our cash balances within The Venetian Macao restricted group were $485 million. Our leverage ratio for covenant compliance calculation purposes was 3.87 times compared to a maximum leverage covenant in The Venetian Macao restricted group of 4.0 times. We did pay down $125 million on the revolver portion of the credit facility in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Finally, we recently completed an amendment to our U.S. credit facility that allows us to buy back and retire up to $800 million in face value of our bank debt through a tender process. While we have no present intention to tender for our bank debt, the amendment does provide us with additional flexibility should we choose to do so in the future.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Sheldon.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Ken. Before we go to Q&amp;A, let me make a couple of final points. First, we have an excellent delighted management team here today. Mike and Ken and Al Gonzales, our new General Counsel have really hit the ground running particularly on the expansion and implementation of our cost savings initiatives, and are excellent additions to Rob Goldstein and me in the executive suite.</p>
          <p>I'm convinced that this management team is the right group to guide our company through to it's next period of growth. Second, we are singularly focused on the successful execution of our business plan with no disagreements. That plan is fairly straightforward, maximizing cash flow from current operations, delivering Bethlehem and Singapore on time and on budget, and deleveraging our balance sheet by generating additional liquidity through the monetization of either non-core assets or minority portions of our operating properties in Macao.</p>
          <p>So to sum it up, we're clearly enjoying an advantaged competitive position today, that presents both very high quality assets and differentiated operating strategies in each of our markets. Our assets have broad appeal across varied customer segments, and our focus on group business in Las Vegas and the mass business in Macao leaves us less vulnerable to the weakest segments of these markets than are our competitors. We remain dedicated to managing our way through the current economic conditions, successfully delevering our balance sheet and preserving the long-term value inherent in the successful execution of our plan. That having been said, we'll move on to the questions.</p>

          <p>Ken, Sheldon, your comments about asset sales, just a clarification there in terms of those entities looking to pursue minority interest investments in Macao. Are you talking about, maybe you can give us some color on this, are you talking about existing cash flowing assets, or you're looking at -- are you talking about sites five and six?</p>

          <p>We're talking about existing cash flow assets and five and six and some formula to include seven, eight and three as we get those done.

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I wonder if you could give us a little more idea of how Singapore is going to transpire from a spending perspective? We have 5.4 billion in total project cost and some of that's going to open in December or January, and then the rest needs to be phased out. Could you just tell us how that flows throughout '09 and '10?</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So for instance, for the balance of this year for Singapore, we've got about 1.4 billion to spend for the remaining portion of this year. And then in 2010 it's about a billion, and then into 2011, it's about a little bit less than 400,000. So it's phased out over that period of time.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's too early. There hasn't been any STB confirmations about that. I would say for the first couple of months of the first quarter that things appeared to be slowing down continuously. I haven't seen any notice of any significant upturn in Singapore but it's -- in that part of the world things happen kind of fast and -- faster than they do it here in the United States. So we're hoping that by the time we open that Marina Bay Sands will be a massive contributor to the attractiveness and the appeal for people to come to Singapore.</p>

          <p>I love it, Larry, but you didn't get on first, Joe Greff got on first.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you know, he deserves it. Couple of questions, one, you're going to spend a bunch of money sealing five and six but then you're saying you're hoping to restart construction this year. Any chance you don't have to spend that $400 million on five and six sealing it up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A substantial part of that five and six is for preordered and delivered materials. So that will cut down on the amount of money. If we start it within the next six months that will cut down on that 472 million that's indicated that we have left to spend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that number would go down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, a lot of that number is same venue, you now, it's for heavy equipment like centrifuges and cooling equipment etcetera, etcetera, for elevators, for vertical lift, elevators, escalators, curtain wall for the buildings etcetera. Ken, do you have anything to say about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I could add something if you want -- yeah, Larry, this is Mike. With the &#x2013; the only way the number of about 650 some odd million dollars now in five and six of which the greater part of that, let me go to a lesser part first -- about somewhat over 100, 120 million something like that is now in what's considered the close down money. The rest is money that would go in and will not be -- will be used when we start up the building, so it's not a waste of that capital. And even that $120 million number that we're now dealing with is -- a considerable amount of that we don't expect to spend before we start. So those -- that cash number is coming down rather significantly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. The -- as far as the covenant for the September quarter, Ken, how is that looking for meeting that and where is the covenant drop down to by the end of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one thing &#x2013; I want to clarify one of the things that Mike said is that I think his number didn't incorporate the money that was already spent throughout the first quarter. So just to clarify that in terms of the amount should be closer to about $450 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we have left to spend on five and six to fully shut it down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. As far as the covenants go, how do they drop throughout the rest of this year and the beginning in next year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The covenant steps down to 6.5 in U.S. restricted group and then from seven in the September quarter and then down to 3.5 from 4 in the September quarter in Macao. With regard to, talking about the future, we typically don't give guidance on the numbers, but we think we've got sufficient levers with regard to being able to achieve covenant compliance going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. All right, good. Sheldon, the new chief administrator is going to chosen and come in and we're talking about trying to get the visa restrictions in three province triumvirate all working to try to get that released. What are you seeing as far as the politics in Macao and what effect it should have?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that I understand your question. Is your question about the new chief executive?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The new chief executive and also the prospects of getting the -- some of the visa restrictions lifted with Hong Kong and yourself and the local province trying to work together?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can only tell you that the new chief executive, there is still several multiple names that have been thrown around as to good possibilities and -- or the leading possibility. So, we have no definitive interpretation of who is most likely to get it now. Clearly, the central government in Beijing, although they don't need to clear with anything in Macao. I think they have, they endorsed shall we say, one, somebody. But that hasn't been done yet, and I would be out of line to suggest that we know whether or not the government is going to loosen up the restrictions. All we could say is that there is a lot of rumors about that and there is nothing definitive, we're very hopeful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thanks guys and the last thing just the chip commission limit, is that &#x2013; do you see that, Sheldon, happening in the next couple of week?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. Mike and I are going over again in a couple of weeks. It's difficult to say. The government has been rather closed mouth on what they intend to do here. But I think as a new -- as the current chief executive is starting to turn over responsibilities to others, I don't know how fast that will -- it will be done, but I attended the last Gaming Association meeting myself with Mike and with Stephen Weaver, and it was very interesting. But we all signed a letter recommending to the chief executive in the government that we all agreed upon a limitation of 1.25 relative to including comps relating to the <mark type="inaudible" /> commission. Now in the event that the government did do it, I proposed the honor system. I don't know if it will be accepted, I think others indicated they would do that but they didn't want to propose it as an alternative to the government embedding it in the law.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. A couple of questions. First of all, on the cost saves -- the $470 million, Rob mentioned that some of it would include marketing and also dropping down some of the employment. In particular on marketing, if you could just explain to us how you plan on facing  off against 12% more supply over the next 12 months from some of your competitors and at the same time reduce your marketing and potentially your service levels, and just walk us through what the real initiatives are that we wouldn't see that impact. Second, can you just talk about the Macao retail roll? When some of those leases roll off in 2010 and 2011, what percentage will roll off, and then what's your expectations are for renewals and at what rates? And then finally, just looking out where are you taking pricing for conference convention booking levels into 2010? Obviously people, I'm sure are negotiating very hard right now but I wanted to see how hard you're holding on and what's your expectations are as you move further out. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> again, Steve, you're talking about 12% more capacity here in Las Vegas, is that what you're commenting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not really an influence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well that and Cosmopolitan and potentially a couple of room towers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, near term we obviously &#x2013; Fontainebleau's challenges which we're all aware of, and we're obviously -- I don't see Cosmopolitan happening for quite some time, but obviously City stands on the horizon. Our cost containment is not related to marketing to the hotel but it's more about marketing the casino. But I will tell you that I think our inherent advantage in the group segment enables us be very favored as that segment returns. We're seeing booking for '10, '11 beyond picking up nicely. A lot of folks who cancelled in '09 are coming back to the table. The first quarter returns very strong, the end of '09 looks good.</p>
          <p>I think the inherent advantage of earnings 40 plus percent of our business in that group segment gives us just huge advantages over any anybody else in town, I mean that has always been the cornerstone of our business strategy and honestly as in fact that coupled with our cost savings that gives a great platform to make money here. I think our cost savings they're across-the-board I think from reduction in head count, I mentioned 17% reduction in head count, we're reducing our, some of our benefits to our employees -- very diversified, procurement. The one place that is not focused on is on the hotel marketing side. Not whatsoever. As far as, Sheldon, you want to address the pricing in '10, groups et cetera as we go forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly, the current conditions are that the groups, I'd say for the next couple of months have come back and we've had to reprice some of the groups. We rate them to bring it down and people have asked for waivers of attrition guarantees. However that only goes for the next couple of months. I see that starting in September, maybe October, more appropriately we're going to have an accelerated booking pace. And going into 2010, I hesitate to use the words getting back to normal, but I think we're getting close to getting back to normal in 2010. The only effect that we've had with the President's comments about Las Vegas and the TARP recipients have been in the financial and auto industries.</p>
          <p>The financial industry doesn't really respect that. Although there are lot of small, I mean a lot of groups they're relatively small, they're under 500 or 1000. So we have a lot of conferences of two or 300 people, it doesn't create a big impact. The hi-tech market is still going very strong. The pharmaceuticals are going very strong. Insurance, fast food, hi-tech are going very well. And I have a call scheduled for tomorrow with a former acquaintance, a former friend in the hi-tech industry. They're negotiating now because the rates are down low. I think what's happening is MGM's comment about they think the bottom is leveling out. The bottom is -- they think we've already hit the bottom.</p>
          <p>Frankly, I think that we've -- we've had a sequential increase and the trend upwards has been established already to a smaller degree, but we hope it accelerates starting after the summertime. The summertime is still a little, still an unknown. However, the summertime is usually low quality visitor and they're usually a lower paying visitor, heavy summer anyway. But I think that looking at the fall, it looks -- the rates look pretty good. I don't see people asking for a lot of rate reduction, substantial rate reduction or re-rating starting in the fall.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There was one other question on the retail in Macao. Steve, I think I don't have all the information in terms of releasing it in front here, but I will tell you that the retail business strangely enough in Macao over the last couple of months has been good. And so I think that you could understand that if the business continues to improve there on the retail level, we shouldn't have any problem with the releasing of those facilities, particularly if five and six and these other facilities get constructed or are about to open. There is a new property that are going to opening there shortly on the strip, which will bring more visitors, which will essentially help the retail as well. So I think we could look optimistically at our retail business in those locations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But Mike, I think the original plan I think when you opened was that you would have two or three-year leases. So in part because you expected retail to really pick up dramatically and capture that on a go forward basis. That seems to be now not as secure. So does the whole mall turnover in 2010, 2011 or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It's not happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, this is Sheldon. I think what you're looking at is the interruption of the economic tsunami that occurred. It has nothing to do specifically with our retail, it has to do with the global macroeconomic picture. We have no indication that the retailers are going to turnover in any substantive numbers when the leases start to expire. But there is a mixture of leases, there is three-year, five-year, 10-year with a three-year adjustment so rent adjustments. There're a lot of stores that are doing very well and there are stores that are not doing as well. But I think one thing is going to make a difference, if we get five and six open, the pedestrian connector to that property is going to allow City of Dreams to connect to us, we think we will significantly increase the traffic flow into the malls because the pedestrian bridge goes directly into the top floor of the mall at the Four Seasons, the shops at Four Seasons that'll connect directly with The Venetian mall.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a couple of questions on Macao. First, can you just remind us or the plan now, if you restarted construction by the end of the year on sites five and six when that could open? And then also in Macao, can you talk about any adjustments in your credit practices in Macao, given everything that's gone on in the credit levels there? And then lastly, the potential minority stake in Macao operations that you refer to, is the Macao government involved in the discussions as well? I assume it would have to be with their approval, any kind of change in the ownership makeup?</p>

          <p>Rob, why don't you talk about credit now?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robin, you're referencing casino credits in Macao, correct?</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, we just came back and we reviewed all of our outstanding and we feel comfortable with our direct credit that we -- if anything we feel very comfortable, we've given the right people credit and of course there's reserves we were concerned about. But there doesn't appear to be any issues over there. I was there two weeks ago, that we at least were concerned about direct credit. Junket credit, as you know, rolls over every 30 days and again, we don't, at this point, have any issues that we're concerned about with junket credit. There's always outstanding liability until the end of the month but historically it's covered very well and we have never had any of the reps really causing a problem. So we don't feel any real vulnerability at this point either in direct or junket credit in Macao.</p>

          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the question on opening, it's hard to say, I would say 12 to 16 months, 15 months from the time we actually get going again. So much of that building has been done that we could very well do that within a 12 to 18 month period at the most, I would say. And -- but we can give you a better number than that as we get closer, but I think that would take that amount of time. Certainly wouldn't be any longer than that, I would say.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the minority interest -- I can comment on that, we've had these discussion to with the government of Macao with our contacts there and there is no problem whatsoever. In fact, they are encouraging any of the activities that we're working on in that marketplace that we have discussed with them and that -- it's a very open discussion and they've been very support on every one of them.</p>

          <p>Well, I think that's all the questions. I want to say that we &#x2013; this is the first time we started &#x2013; first time in a long time we started exactly on time and we're finishing before we expected. I want to thank all of you for coming in. Thank you for your questions and for your continued support. This concludes the earnings call. Thank you.</p>
