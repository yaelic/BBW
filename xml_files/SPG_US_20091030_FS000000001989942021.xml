      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning, everybody. We reported diluted FFO per share of $1.38 for the quarter, which was $0.05 higher than First Call. And once again, we are pleased with our financial and operational performance. Occupancy in all of our domestic platforms is up sequentially from 6/30/09. Mills was up 150 basis points. Regional mall and premium outlet centers increased 50 basis points and the community center lifestyle platform increased 40 basis points.</p>
          <p>We saw a decline in the regional mall retail sales in the third quarter as compared to the third quarter of '08 where comparable sales as of September 30 were $438. The decline in sales for September-over-September was much lower than any month year-to-date. Preliminary reports from retailers regarding October have been encouraging. We believe our retailers will have a decent holiday season.</p>
          <p>Premium outlet comparable sales were relatively stable in the third quarter at $492 per square foot down only a dollar from 6/30/09. And we actually were up in September on a comparable sales per square foot.</p>
          <p>Mall leasing spreads were $4.04 for the first nine months for '09. Average base rent at 9/30/09 was $40.05, up 2% for the year earlier period. Premium outlet re-leasing spread continues to be strong at $9.25 per square foot for the first nine months of '09. Average base rent for the outlets at 9/30/09 was 32.95 per square foot up from the year earlier period.</p>
          <p>Comp property NOI growth for the first nine months of 2009 was up 0.006% for the malls. NOI growth has been impacted by higher bad debt expense resulting from tenant bankruptcies, as well as lower overage rent due to lower tenant sales in 2009 as compared to 2008, yet we are still up for the year. In our premium outlet portfolio, comp property NOI was 6.5% for the first nine months.</p>
          <p>Let me just turn to capital markets and reflect a touch. SPG returned to capital markets in August with 500 million principal amount of five-year senior unsecured notes. They were priced to yield 5.46% to maturity. Our third quarter capital activities also include a $400 million mortgage financing for three malls. Additionally, we redeemed 40 million of preferred units, a weighted average rate of just under 8%. Beginning of '09, there was an incredible amount of uncertainty over the ability of capital in either the secured or unsecured markets. During our call in late January, we discussed environment, which was unlikely that we would be an issuer in the bond market, we might need to repay maturing bonds with our credit facility and the secured debt financing would be difficult.</p>
          <p>Markets have significantly improved for this from the first quarter. We have worked very diligently in the execution of capital markets activity in 2009. The volume of completed and in-process transactions is considerable. Put the equity we've raised aside, we have thus far issued three unsecured bond offerings totaling $1.75 billion. We have completed or expect to complete before year-end approximately $3.3 billion of secured financing comprised of new loans, as well as refinancings. Our share of those financings -- secured financings is approximately $2 billion.</p>
          <p>First a few details on these new loans. We have completed 18 loans, totaling $1.5 billion and 1.25 billion of that was from life companies. Our share of the completed new loans was $1.1 billion. Weighted average interest rate on the loans was 7.2% and the weighted average life was seven years.</p>
          <p>By year-end we expect to close an additional seven new re-financings totaling $450 million of which our share is 150 million. Eight new lenders on these new financings were new secured capital providers to SPG. In addition, we have the contractual right or renegotiated loan extensions of 1.3 billion in 2009 and our share of that was $750 million. Our spreads have continued to rally. Our CDS spreads are quoted currently at 150 bps, which has rallied from 550 basis points from the highs in early March. In fact, it was the highest of which was in December of '08 of at least 750 basis points.</p>
          <p>As of September 30, 2009, we had $4 billion of cash on hand including our share of joint venture cash, which is approximately $11.50 per share. Availability on our corporate credit facility is $3 billion generating a liquidity of position of $7 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, let me talk generally about retail. Retailers have started to gain their footing. And certain retailers are growing store counts including Aeropostale, Gucci , Apple, the Buckle, California Pizza Kitchen, Express, Forever 21, H&amp;M, Michael Kors, PANDORA, Red Robin, Sperry Top-Sider to name a few. And a number of predominantly outlet tenants are also increasing their store counts. We have a significant amount of leasing volume in our pipeline with over 500 deals and 8 million square feet of leases in process across all of our domestic platforms.</p>
          <p>In particular, it's good to note that the volume of big box activity has significantly increased in the second half of the year. Since mid-July, we have completed 20 big box deals across the four platforms. And discussions are under way on 20 to 30 more, retailers that include again, Forever 21, hhGregg, Dave &amp; Buster's, Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and T.J. Maxx to name a few. We are seeing a flight to quality by the big box retailers. They want to be in malls, outlets, Mills, or strip centers where they benefit from shopper quality and traffic.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to guidance. We increased the low end and maintained the high end of our 2009 FFO guidance taking into account the $0.03 dilutive impact of our $500 million note issuance, which was not included in our previous guidance that we issued at the end of the second quarter. The current FFO guidance therefore is $5.40 to $5.50 and of course, you'll recall that includes a 42% impairment from our holdings in Liberty, non-cash. We have a solid and financial and operational performance in the third quarter. I'm proud of that and our year-to-date activity has produced good results in a very, very challenging and difficult market. We remain focused on operations and we continue to believe that we are very well positioned for growth given our balance sheet and access to capital.</p>
          <p>With that said, we're ready for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>[Operating Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Samir Khanal with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Could you provide color on where you are currently with respect to your 2010 lease expirations? And on that basis how you feel about rent spreads next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Rick. So far through September 30, 2009 for 2010 we're about 44% through our renewals and either executed or in process, we're making very good progress there. Compare that to September 30, 2008, we were about 53% through our '09 renewals. And so we're a little behind, but part of that is the deliberate strategy on our part to delay renewals that are coming up in the second half of 2010, because we believe we will have a more advantageous environment to negotiate those renewals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also, although there haven't been many transactions, it appears as if cap rates for B malls have moved higher relative to A malls. Have you reconsidered the possibility of stepping into the market to acquire B quality malls either on your own or possibility in an institutional JV?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, I don't, I guess the answer is we look at everything that's available. And if we like the property and we like the price, and we like the growth characteristics, we'll take a hard look at it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also do you have any outlook for lease termination fees in Q4, whether they will be materially higher or lower versus the current run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Year-to-date '09, compared to year-to-date '08 is generally a very, I mean, they're almost right on top of each other. There may be a little bit more activity at the fourth quarter, but nothing that's going to move the needle in any significant way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of <mark type="inaudible" /> from UBS.  You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey good morning. Just looking at your mall re-leasing spreads which flowed from 17% in the first half to about 11% year-to-date, which could imply that spreads were flat to negative in Q3. From what I understand, your spreads are calculated based on store openings rather than leases signed, so what I'm looking at is effectively a lagging spread number that's reflective of leases signed three to six months ago, if I understand right. So what I'm wondering is given that you know where leases are being signed today was that flat-to-down number sort of an anomaly based on the mix of leases you were signing at the time or is this is a new run rate such that you're no longer signing leases at a positive spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, hang on a second. I mean it is positive, it's $4. And it's outperforming just about so far everyone that I've seen. We've always said it's five to $6. We're going to be impacted -- we're not immune to the economy. But we're proud of our $4 spread. We still think we have leases that are under market and I mean, obviously negotiating rent in a tough economic environment is more challenging, but the fact is, it's a positive spread and I haven't seen that anywhere else and we're proud of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. But I mean if you are backing into sort of a Q3 number should we just not read into anything and just look at the nine months numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think there's always a reaction to quarterly performance and real estate is better viewed over a longer period of time. But that's your job, so I'll let you do that. But the fundamentals of our business have not changed. We are dealing with a tough economic environment. It's realistic to assume that when you are in the process of negotiating leases in a tough economic environment, you're going to have to be sensitive to that. But the fact of the matter is over a longer period of time, we think our leases are under market and we'll continue to prove that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we saw that you took the management contract at the Galleria in Dallas from General Growth. Are there any other opportunities there and can you speak generally about your strategy as it relates to third-party management?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I guess, I wouldn't say that we took it. We were asked if we were interested and we, given it's a good market and a very good center, we decided to do. We also have a relationship with the owner and that was our primary focus. I don't think our strategy has changed. I mean, we'll occasionally do it for people that we know, and we have a relationship with. But beyond that I don't think it's going to change. We're not and we are not out soliciting third-party management contracts. I mean, occasionally, they'll come to us and given the relationship we have with certain institutional investors, we'll consider it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then just lastly on the recovery ratio. I noticed it was a little bit above average in the quarter. In your efforts to reduce overall CAM, what percentage of your tenants are on fixed CAM? And is that helping your recovery ratio? So expenses are down, but you're still getting the recoveries from a portion of your tenants?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Christy, this is Steve. We're about 80% converted to fixed CAM right now, so you're exactly right. As we have done a good job in managing the cost, 80% of that benefit is flowing through our bottom line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. I mean to what extent are your reducing CAM expenditures that you typically capitalized? And could that potentially reduce your recovery ratio? Is the recoveries that you're getting from tenants that -- not that it's a huge percentage with 20%, but the tenants that are not on fixed CAM that recovery declines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not meaningful. I mean, we're managing the capital expenditures at the mall the same way we've always managed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Mark Biffert with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. David or Steve, I was wondering if could comment on the credit provisions that you took. We saw that they declined substantially. Is there anything behind that or are you just assuming that you are not going to see as much increase in bad debt or if you can maybe provide color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, this is Steve. It's formulates, if you look at the different categories of receivables and put a reserve on them depending on what category that they fall in. Interestingly enough, our receivables were actually down third quarter of '09 compared to third quarter of '08 until you see that in the small bad debt expense that we took in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just say we collected more cash than we reserved than we had already expensed probably in the first couple of quarters. And that's because we've been aggressive in collecting rent. And that's the business and I think that's partly because there were a handful of tenants that were really uncertain about the world, they feel a little bit better and they're starting to pay their bills in a more timely manner, which really excites me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's your expectation that that line will stay at a fairly low number for the next few quarters at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean all it takes is one unknown bankruptcy or it's part of our guidance. We're still anticipating kind of the difficult environment that exists and it can move up and down a little bit. But it's really a function of the first couple of quarters. We reserved a lot of expenses because they were slow in paying bills, and I made sure they paid as much as what we were entitled to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I was going through your top 10 list and I noticed that you lost about 23 stores quarter-over-quarter. And from your remarks earlier in the call you obviously mentioned that there were some tenants replacing that. I'm just wondering what part of your portfolio, is it the bottom third that you're seeing in a lot of these, top tenants pull out of and just maybe give some color around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, leasing is a challenge, but we're up from the second quarter, we're down from last year. And it could be a function of the sales performance of a certain retailer in a certain part of the market. It could be a function that they're in an A property and they can't afford the freight. So, again, I think you got to drill down to the specific retail asset to do that, but it's been a combination of regional issues and/or not being able to afford the rent or the fact is that we'd rather have the space back empty than keep the rent that we could have probably kept the tenant for. So it's a handful of -- there's a handful of reasons why that happens. We can't rely on just one tenant to drive our occupancy. We're hitting the streets. We're scouring the country and we're looking for the growth tenants and we're doing okay, given the environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, lastly just trying to get an update on the acquisition front in terms of what opportunities are you seeing. Is pricing adjustment at all in the opportunities that you're looking at both domestically and internationally? And, do you think that you would potentially be able to close anything before the year-end or is it more likely a 2010 story?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, it's -- the years, I'm thinking about '10 right now, frankly. We were evaluating a number of opportunities. We'll see what happens. We can be very patient. In addition, I will say that I don't think on our plate, on the acquisition side, is any international activity at this point. So we're focused domestically. We're looking at a few opportunities. But I think, it's safe to say that '10 or I'm sorry '09, to do anything in '09 would, is probably not going to occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Quentin Velleley with Citigroup. You may proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Michael Bilerman here with Quentin. David, I don't know if I want to be at the door when you come demand your rent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want you to come with me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, perfect, I'll be back-up. Just a question on the average base rent. And I think this effectively may bring the full circle on the lease spreads. The average base rent sequentially went down by about 60 basis points, I know it's up 2% year-over-year. Does that reflect sort of at least potentially negative lease spreads that were at least in the quarter or rent concessions or what else may be impacting that average base rent number, which -- and I know it's small, but went from 40.29 sequentially down to 40.05.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, it's Steve. I mean, there is a lot of things that are going to impact that. As David talked about in his prepared remarks, our occupancy is off year-over-year a little bit and to the mix of stores that closed as an example. And what those tenants were paying coming out of the mix would be another factor. So you can't look at it only in the context of what -- and try to impute what it might have meant from a leasing spread perspective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just point out, I mean, a quarter analysis can -- it can be impacted by mix more than what a year amount would be. So I know it's a year-to-date number, but you just can't overreact in terms of that at this point like I said. I think the longer picture is, yes, it's getting tougher and it has been tougher to maintain our historical lease spreads. There is no denying that and yet we're still able to eke out a positive spread.</p>

          <p>And positive NOI growth, but is it a challenge? Yes. Do I see it turning negative? The answer is no. But it's a volatile market and sales and the mood of the tenant is important. I mean, we've been in a very tough retail environment. The good news on all of that is that &#x2013; and this is no guarantee -- but the mood from our clients is better. And they're thinking more about '10 and hopefully they'll have a positive holiday season and the store count will grow in 2010. But there is a level of uncertainty out there.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. But you're not doing, and I think you mentioned that you witnessed what your peers have done this quarter and  what's all have been giving, what's effective was 4% rent relief off of the total NOI. You don't have that going on.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael. I mean, at the margin, there could be a little bit of an impact there. We -- our 2009 rent relief in total will be under 10 million bucks as in the 7 to $8 million range. So -- but as I think we said on the call last quarter, we hadn't seen much of it year-to-date, so it's a little back-end weighted and as you look at have the impact on the average base rent, it could have a nominal impact, but it's a small number in the context of the size of our income statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I will tell you, look, the rent -- let's talk about the rent relief for just philosophically for a second if we could. Our view on rent relief is that, if you're a national tenant and you have a lease, you have to abide by it. And occasionally we might modify that statement if we think that the tenant is on the verge of a bankruptcy or something along those lines. And we think our help, obviously this is not just us, it takes essentially the landlord community as well as their suppliers. We work together to try and keep the retailer out of bankruptcy. We have done that with one national tenant of any size this year.</p>
          <p>Now, look when the lease expires all bets are off, right they're going to try and get the lowest rent they can and we're going to try and get the highest rent. In some cases, we win, in some cases, they win. But most of the time we try to figure it out, so it works to both parties advantage and-- but now let's talk about local retailers. The local retailers frankly if they're screaming and we don't have an immediate use, we may grant rent relief a little bit more generously on the local tenant. But again that would be driving the number more than any national or regional tenants.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, it's Quentin Just in terms of the 4 billion of cash, and I know that you're obviously looking for opportunities. But, if nothing came up that was suitable to you, what's the sort of the timeframe where you'd start to pay down debt or maybe buy back debt. And the reason I asked is obviously the FFO impact can be quite significant on what assumption you will make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we would earmark, we've already earmarked in our own mind next year, lot of that capital will pay back debt. But right now absent going in the market and paying a premium for our debt, which we're not overly excited about doing. We'll do a couple things, obviously we have some unsecured bonds coming due, which we'll pay off with cash. And then we will unencumber assets next year as either those mature and/or come up to their window where we wouldn't incur a prepayment penalty. Now most of that if you look at the schedule is a little more back end weighted, but -- so, we are suffering through- I read somewhere that someone's getting 50 basis points on their cash. We are getting less than that, so I'm going to call that person and find out why they are getting 50 versus our 30 to 40. They may be buying auction rate preferreds for all I know, but I hope to God we are not.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. And just one last one. I think you made a comment before that, with the international acquisition opportunities didn't really have anything on the agenda at the moment? Is that a function of the weak U.S. dollar or are there other things going on there? Is it the lack of opportunities that you're seeing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it's a function of number of things. I do think that the weakness in the dollar makes a -- obviously a much challenging proposition. It also is a function of we think there are going to be or there are better opportunities in the U.S. Also we a have created value in our, absent unfortunately Liberty, but we've created value in our international activities. But we're assessing our competitive advantages there. And until we have that assessment done, I think we're better off focusing here on the domestic opportunities, which are a little more plentiful at better values. And if you bet long on the dollar right now, you could get destroyed and we don't want to see that. And I just think ultimately there is going to be more, I would -- I feel more comfortable with the pricing here versus elsewhere that the opportunities are better in the U.S.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Steve Sakwa from ISI Group. Couple of questions. David, could you just go back to your early comments about the sales trend. You mentioned that September was much lower, but I don't think you quantified that. Could you give us a monthly progression of just how your sales performed...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Actually at the outlet business it was up 4.5, right? And in the mall business it was down 5. Now, I think the next question is why are we down a little bit more than some of our peer groups. We do have more exposure to Florida and California than probably a lot of people understand. I mean, I think that's a great long-term position to be in, because those are clearly great economies and great long-term economies, great population migration and all sorts of those demographic items. But they have been hit the hardest and Florida has suffered more than people realize. And I believe we've also obviously have some exposure in Las Vegas, which has been hit reasonably hard. So, I think when you look at those areas that's probably why we're just a little bit higher sales decline then another top mall company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you mentioned that October was encouraging. I guess, it is your expectation or do you believe that you could actually be in the positive camp in Q4 here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, listen, it's very interesting. I'll let Rick comment on this, but we've had a well-known retail analyst come to our -- I don't know if she wants a plug or not but we should probably should've asked her. She came and presented to our Board yesterday -- we also had a major CEO come see us of a major retailer come see us, Rick and I -- Monday, I guess. They're feeling better, now, a lot of it depends on how they plan their inventory and the fact of the matter is the comps compared to last year still could be down, just because they have a lot less inventory. But they could with that result be very, very pleased, because their margins are going to stay intact. And I will tell you just what I know and what we've asked, there are some that are planning up, there are some that are planning down, but they all feel good about the business. Rick, I don't if you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I just a little more spectrum. The people that we've been talking to their inventories are down anywhere from 15 to 22% from last year. So, while that is not going to drive topline sales, they are all much more optimistic that because they have less inventory, they have to push out the door, they're going to be able to be much more disciplined on their pricing and drive a lot more margin improvement and most importantly cash flow. And one of the areas this is really in every size, they're just carrying less of the same size and everyone feels very well positioned. And if in fact there is a slight uptick in consumer demand, you're going to see substantially better price performance, margin performance, and cash flow performance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I guess what I would say to you is, it's a little bit what's happened in sales year-to-date. I mean, I wouldn't -- it may come in with less comps, but they may be tickled pink by it and, look, if comps are 20% that's not going to be good, but if they're down and again, it depends on the retailer, if they're down 5, 6%, they may be really happy with that. And that's why we got to be just be careful on how we look at that number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, to that point, Rick, you said that your renewals I guess were kind of 44% done for the business for kind of your '010 and that's a little bit behind kind of where you were last year. I guess, what level of sales would get you kind of excited or maybe even disappointed about kind of the continued leasing velocity? I mean, is there a sort of a break point that you think about that you kind of...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The retailers that we're dealing with are certainly focused on sales, but they are far more focused today on profitability and cash flow, which leads to capital allocation for new stores or remodeled stores upon renewal. What we faced in 2009 was most retailers saying we're preserving our cash, because we're unsure about our line and we're unsecured about our ability to finance. Now that they have better cash margins and better cash, on the positive, we're now hearing that they are allocating money for new open to buys. And I think, David gave you a list in his comments of those stores that are looking at that. So I think it is going to be less correlated with sales and more correlated with profitability and cash flow generation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm here with Johan as well. David, you mentioned using cash to pay down the unsecureds and pay down additional debt. Just two parts to the question. I guess, one is, do you have a de-leveraging goal? I mean, you are already at six times I guess net debt to EBITDA, but do you see that trending lower? And obviously you mentioned the positive impact it's had on your cost of capital thus far this year. And the second question, I guess, can you speak to the dividend? Would you think about reinstating at some point the cash dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Look, I think obviously we have always felt for even with kind of the market correction that we were in good strong financial shape, but you can never be too conservative in today's volatile world. So the answer to that is that I do think we will continue to deleverage. Other than, Jay, I think that if we see an opportunity that could add value to our shareholders, we could see a temporary spike up, and then obviously a view toward trying to get down to where we are. So we feel really good where we are. I don't think we would need to go lower. But we want to have a lot of -- we want to be as stable as we can.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to the dividend, I'll tell you bright, clear and unequivocally where we're headed. Obviously, I say this subject to Board, we've discussed it with the Board and it's obviously subject to market conditions. But we will -- and we plan on paying cash next year. And that's our goal. We don't see anything right now that would deter us from that goal. And it'll be around our taxable income, which is kind of around where we are this year. If you add it all up, it may be -- it depends on transactions and if we can accelerate a certain tax depreciation and then it gets a little complicated but our goal would be going forward next year to pay, we declared a dividend $0.60, I think we would look to pay -- start paying cash at that level or near that level next year with no common equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then just a second question. Can you give us some sense of just the dollar volume of what you're considering for acquisitions at this point? Is it a billion-dollar range, are we talking about $5 billion? And also can you give us some sense of the returns? I know returns, clearly you were looking at higher returns six months ago, but how your thinking is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've got to have higher returns. There is no question about that to deal with. We are in a riskier world. And we would expect to achieve those if we deployed capital. Look, Jay, it's -- I really can't do that because it's -- if I gave you a -- it's just tough for us to really go. We just have to see, obviously if we do anything we'll lay it out. We'll have a chance to discuss it. But at this point, I can't shed much light on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to take a look at the temporary tenants for this holiday season. Is it pretty much on par with the amount of tenants that you had last year? And what percent of NOI comes from the temporary tenants that's set up for the holidays?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will just comment on the velocity of that business and we've been able to maintain that business pretty constant with last year. We are &#x2013; we have been aggressively canvassing all of the properties in our markets as David mentioned, because we think this is about market share and we believe there are many compromised properties operating in the same markets as our malls. And we want to bring in the tenants into our properties, so they can see if they can do business and just increase our market share, which will in turn increase our pricing power.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would -- I just would add that the cart business, we look at that business in two areas. We have the cart business then we have kind of temporary income when we lose an inline store and we put a temporary tenant in that inline store. You've walked a thousand malls, you know exactly what I'm talking about. I will say this, the cart business, we're making the deals but rent is a little under pressure there and we're having to do a little bit more volume to make up for the lost rent. Because obviously, Christmas last year was disappointing for that tenant.</p>
          <p>And so we're churning and burning a little bit more than we've had to do in past. We think we can bring it in in totality kind of where we were last year. It's not -- this is a business -- a lot of it is a cash business in the sense that you can't really place a lot of them. Although there are a number of national tenants that play in that business as well and we've made up some of it by bringing in uses like -- I'm sure, you've read about the toys and how many deals have me made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have done about 25 Toys"R"Us seasonal stores that seem to be initially performing very well for them and we hope to be able to grow that into permanent stores and to have them come back into the malls on a long-term basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as long as Bernardo doesn't negotiate the rent with it that we'll be fine. But -- so that business is challenging, we're doing a lot more volume to make up for the softness in rent, but there is an unknown. Again, this is all on the margin for us, but there is a little bit of an unknown in terms of how we deliver it at for year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in terms of which part is more challenging, filling vacant inline or filling the carts, and then also just what kind of NOI comes from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry. It's really the cart rental &#x2013; per cart rental number. It's not even so much getting the carts leased. It's getting the push back on the rents there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then what about success in filling the inline, is that pretty much on par with last year?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the final question is probably more for Steve. You talked about unsecured, you talked about secured. What are your thoughts on converts and is that an area that you'd look at or you guys would stick more with traditional sort of 10 year, 5, 7, 10 year unsecured debt?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good question. We have had and actually still do have converts in the capital structure. We've never done a public deal, they've typically been issued as a bridge security as part of an acquisition. The market is very attractive right now, but as we've talked about with a couple of the earlier calls, we've got $4 billion of cash that were sitting on today. So it's not like we have a ready use for the proceeds, but it is a market that's very open, very attractive right now and it's something that we are clearly paying attention to.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Looking over the last four quarters, your same-store NOI has been more resilient than your mall peers. I am just wondering if there was a one fact that you might attribute that to?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it looks like you picked up about 250,000 in occupancy in the Mills. I'm wondered if that's related to your big box comments and if you could name some of the boxes that came in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In fact, we have and there has been a lot of activity in the Mills in the big boxes and as you know, in that platform, the box square footage and the small shop is included in their occupancy and we have brought in, in the last nine months two Neiman Marcus Last Calls, VF Outlet, Christmas Tree Shops, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, H&amp;M, Best Buy, I mean these properties are very well located.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Forever 21s and I think that the point that David made in his comments about the flight to quality, what we're seeing is that these big box users now understand that they are going to be advantaged by getting the incremental traffic that they get in a Mills environment, while still having their own entrance and their own parking field and visibility, as opposed to being in a smaller map strip center . And so we're finding a lot more of interest in the boxes that become available. We also are in the process of making deals with SEA LIFE and LEGOLAND that are part of Merlin.

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. I guess, David, going back to acquisitions for a second. Your comments from a couple of minutes ago about, if you do something you could see leverage tick up a little bit, but you would sit there and lay it out. It doesn't necessarily sound like a pipeline of smaller one-off deals and it sounds like something bigger in scale. Am I'm reading a little too much into that or is that...?-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think, we give -- the answer is we have identified, it's interesting, we've identified roughly 30-ish recent new lifestyle centers that are in distress. And it's interesting, because we thought may be that'd be a great opportunity. Rick and I've gone over it and there's maybe one or two that we would pursue. And I think, historically, we've done when we've done our stuff, over the last three years, it's been on the bigger scale. And so I guess, if there are those opportunities, it's logical to conclude that it'll probably be more of that than the individual ones.</p>
          <p>There's not a lot of individual stuff out there and the distressed retail, I mean, is frankly distressed for a reason. Some of it will be good long-term. We are evaluating that, but we were one, very surprised to know there at least 30 something in trouble. That's a lot because these are -- a lot of these were high land values, high construction cost. But even more surprising is that, at the end of the day that 30 plus there's only two or three that would wet our whistle.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And going back to the core for a second, and I think you answered this in some prior questions. But when you were talking about the leasing spreads and I guess the comments were coming up about Q3. Is it fair if we're thinking about the 44% or 43% of leases that have already been addressed for 2010? That if we look on a year-to-date basis for '09, the spreads on that, the crop of what's coming up are in the vicinity of that year-to-date number even if it's a little bit lower, but somewhere in the ballpark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's very hard to generalize. As David said, every lease is its own story, every property has its own story and while it's a significant amount of square footage that we are dealing with, there is no trend. If we have rollovers coming over in a weaker property that's going to impact the spread. When the rollovers are coming over in a better property, that's going to move it up. I think we have a large enough base and a large enough sample that as David said, we're still going to generate positive spreads. And we're just very focused on running the business, making the best deal we can for each of these renewals.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think part of it-- again, any moment point in time you got to be careful with. It's a good question and I would -- I guess, any point in time you got to be careful to draw too much from. Partly the reason we're below '09 versus '08 is that, we want to wait -- we're hopeful that a better Christmas season, holiday season will give more confidence to the retailer, and we can negotiate a better deal.</p>
          <p>That's part of it. Some of it is, the retailers saying, listen, I want to see how they are and I'd be -- we wouldn't be accurate saying that it's all part of that strategy. Part of it is, they want to wait and see how they shakeout. And the trend may be working in our favor.</p>
          <p>And remember '08 was different than '09 in terms of the mood for the retailer even though there are certain &#x2013; it certainly wasn't robust, but the retail world didn't end till kind of mid-September. So we had done -- we had those commitments they were pretty much done by the time we reported September 30 numbers. So, look, it is tougher right now, we're confident that we still got the spread.</p>
          <p>The spread will come under pressure because we're dealing in a tough economic environment. We think there will be pressure on the occupancy like we've seen in '09 and we think, we'll -- even with that said, because of where we're in the industry, we'll continue to outperform our peer group. But we're not immune to the bigger picture right now. And our results indicated, I mean we're 60 basis points up, which some would feel good about. We want to be 300 basis points up. So we're feeling it, we're feeling that we're doing -- we're doing the best we can in the tough environment. But certainly these numbers will feel pressure and you're seeing it.</p>

          <p>When you look at the GGP same store leasing numbers that are running negative 20%. They have commented that they don't believe your numbers. And, just I don't want to beat this horse to death on the leasing spread this quarter. And I understand your hesitancy on a single quarter number. But the third quarter, denominator is the biggest quarter in terms of how you report leasing spread. And, given that you were up 17% year-to-date at the end of June and now up 10%. It would appear that you kind of mathematically have to have a negative number in the third quarter. So, you're saying you have a high confidence level in the $4 spread, you'll see how that works going forward. And all we have at this point is a one quarter trend line. What are we to make if GGP overlaid against you? Is it simply that they are not a good counterparty to the tenants anymore or they're having to give up rent compared to you?</p>

We're still got a spread and we've told you that the spread has always been kind of five to six bucks. We've outperformed in a better economy. We're not quite getting the $5 dollar spread in a tougher economy. It's still positive. We're not done with '10. We'll see how '10 shakes out. The good news is the environment's getting better, so the pressure may subside to some extent. But I have no comment on somebody's accusing us of that. I won't give that the-</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning guys. Rick, just want to follow-up on your point about the strategy to delay renewals for late 2010. Is that premised on your expectation for a strong holiday and I guess, a particular economic outlook for 2010? Just curious what your assumptions are and what might lead you to rethink that decision one way or the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that it is lesser a function of a strong holiday with respect to sales. But there is a assumption that -- and it's not really an assumption, it's based on talking to the retailers, which David and I are doing a whole lot of every day that they're feeling better. And we have absolutely seen several instances of retailers that were in here in the second quarter asking for rent relief and modifications, and then came back in the third quarter and said, well, it looks like we're okay. We don't need anything. We're going to make it.</p>
          <p>And obviously, we believe that with their inventory policies with the cash flow generation, with where we believe they will be on profitability in the fourth quarter, we will have a more welcoming environment to have those discussions with the retailers for the renewals in the back half of '10. I mean, we're very focused on our 1/31/10 renewals. We're getting those done. That's tomorrow where we're putting that in place. But we're hopeful that these retailers will be in a better position and frankly, as I read all the retail analysts and all their ratings and their movements, they -- virtually all the retailers are getting upgrades and more positive outlooks based on the expectation that there is going to be a more profitable Christmas, which may or may not be related to more sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, then set our expectations for early 2010, do you think we'll see fewer store closures this time around post-holiday season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly had a significant number of bankruptcies in year-to-date in 2009, and I would certainly hope that we would be below that level in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then switching gears, I guess, David, there are a handful of outlet property portfolios in the market. Are those of interest to you guys and does your experience tell you that Chelsea can be successful in proving sales and profitability at outlets in I guess I'll call them, secondary markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm trying to negotiate the pay with the team there now, so I don't want to give them any confidence. Now listen, the outlet business has been a good business for us. And I mean, the Chelsea team, the outlet team has performed exceptionally well. And so look, our view -- If we grow our business, we're going to look for quality retail real estate and it could be in outlets, it could be in malls. And as I mentioned to you before, it could be in some of these lifestyle centers. And we'll look at anything and everything, we don't have any one desire to do malls, ahead of outlets or outlets ahead of malls. So it's really a function of where we think the best return is and what we can do to that cash flow if we bought a center. So, we haven't done a lot of acquisitions in the outlet business. We've done a little bit here and there, but it's really been mostly organic growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And let me just ask one last question. Admittedly, it's probably a soft ball for you on the outlet business, but I've covered you guys and Chelsea independently for a long-time. And I really can't recall a time when sales in that area were weak or even down. What do you think is driving that secular growth, I guess I'll call it, in outlets because it seems deeper than just consumer finding value in a recession right now? It is a mix to higher price point? Or do you see it in foot traffic? Or do you think it's just taking share from full-price retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, good. It's a good question. And the fact is, I think that it all boils down to the consumer, they just find it. They find the value there and the value is more than just price. It's how the center looks, how the center feels, what tenants you have, what merchandise they have. And I think we've also changed the paradigm a little bit with the outlet business by bringing it closer in. And it's as an example, I was just in Cincinnati over the weekend and I visited our outlet center that we just opened, and it was an old mall site, right.</p>
          <p>I don't know which guy &#x2013; look, now I remember, but I won't say which developer was trying to build a fashion center there. But that may -- anyway. And it's well done. It's got, it's on the highway, it looked beautiful. We still got some lease up to do there, but the merchandise was, I mean the stores had great merchandise, had great prices, and I think the consumers just recognize that. And what's interesting that I've seen year-to-date, I mean, in the Chelsea portfolio, we've always had over the last three, four, five years, wonderful growth in sales from the tourist centers and in fact what we've seen year-to-date is the tourist centers have taken a hit and if there is any reason why Chelsea, even though September was up, reported down sales -- we reported down sales was because the tourist centers were taken a little more of hit, the Florida's of the world, Vegas, and even something like Woodbury.</p>
          <p>But what was interesting is the sales that kind of the Cincinnati's, even though that's not in the comp number. But we have Northern Indiana, even between Indianapolis and -- I mean, those kind of- the Chicago's of the world were actually very, very strong for the outlet business. So I think it's long winded by saying, I think the consumer just they like the brands, they like the value, they like the selection, they like the price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I could just. One other thing, if you look historically, the other thing that I'd like to think that we brought to the outlet industry is building bigger impact centers in a racetrack configuration. So the square footage is larger. The absolute number of outlets in the United States is probably, substantially reduced from where it was 10 years ago. So you have more concentrated powerful properties, which is driving the results of those properties. And frankly, when you look at the capital situation today or the construction in the retail sectors is at like a 20-year low and we certainly anticipate that it will remain there and the lack of new supply can only hopefully help the demand side for the existing product.</p>

          <p>Staying with the thoughts you just expressed guys on the development front. The Tanger guys are out there saying that they found one development to do and may be some other ones. And Rick, you were saying that the tenants are getting a little more excited about the existing assets. I mean, David, do you think the 10-year moratorium that you sort of put on new development maybe is a bit too much, and are you guys looking to break ground on anything?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when I said that, I said, you didn't hear me say, except for outlets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Somebody asked me what I was going to dress up this weekend for Halloween and I said, well, I have kind of a ghoulish sense of humor I said a lifestyle developer. But I do think there's going to be some outlet development. I mean, a good example is besides free development, we have, as you know, Rich, we have our land in Merrimack, New Hampshire and we're going to have a decision to make in the spring whether to build it, but I think right now -- start building, and we're going to eventually build it, but whether we want to do it in -- start in the spring of '10 or wait another year. Right now, I think the mood is to start next year, which frankly I would not have included any time up until the last month or two.</p>
          <p>So the good news is we'll have time, we don't have to rush it. But I still think the amount of outlet development is still going to be very few and far between. And that's okay, because I mean, it'll drive the demand in our existing centers. But there'll be some, and I think certainly that'll come ahead of full price retail. Now a lot of people suddenly want to turn every center they -- any land they had into an outlet center and we'll have to deal with that. If the world continues to improve, we'll have to deal with that oncoming rush to- desire to build, but the stuff that we'll do will make economic sense.</p>

And they are already laid out, already master planned into the project. So if demand comes back, and we can get an acceptable return, maybe a couple of those opportunities get moved, which further consolidates the square footage in our property and prevents incremental competition in those markets.</p>

          <p>Okay. All right, Rick. Thanks. And then, same kind of thing on The Domain. Where are you guys with The Domain and the future phases that you've envisioned? Are those getting pushed further down or are they coming back to life or --?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there is -- let me just clarify because it can be a little bit confusing. We've opened our Domain Phase I, which is Neiman, Macy's anchored and it was opened in what, about two years ago. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are -- our Phase II is opening in the early spring and that's anchored by Dillard's, Dick's, Village Roadshow, Maggiano's and a number of small shop tenants. That's opening, Dick's is opening actually earlier but that's opening in February of '10. And then there's another project that uses The Domain name that another developer's looking to develop. We have no financial interest in that and I'm not sure of the status on that. So, we're going to be pretty much done with Domain and when we open I mean, we'll have lease up, continual lease up and management opportunities. But, we're done in the spring in terms of the new development there.</p>

          <p>Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. And last thing Rick, year-end occupancy, what do you think that's going to be?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are today 91.4 we'd hope that it would pick up a little more into the fourth quarter, it depends if anything loses, but we're hoping that it's going to be closer to 91.56. It's just a function of where we end up with the year end getting stores open.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. David, there's been a lot of discussion on the call with respect to '09 holiday and '10. But I would like to ask you to maybe look out a little bit further into '11, '12 and '13, particularly as it relates to tenant sales growth? When we look at the company's history, tenant sales growth following economic downturns has recovered pretty quickly to the sort of mid positive single digit range. And it just seems like, as we sit here today, that the consumer this time around is in a different spot, a more negative spot as it relates to their balance sheet and the level of debt that they're carrying, which would make that kind of recovery much harder to achieve this time around again out in '11, '12 and '13. Do you agree with that or do you have a different point of view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the consumers clearly going to be challenged in terms of spending. And certainly to the extent that we have -- we continue to have such a weak <mark type="inaudible" /> picture. Now I will tell you that, I think corporate America is on the verge of starting to hire again and deploy capital, which will lead to job growth. I think in the environment we're in today, I agree with you. I think there is a reasonable chance though we will be in a much better job picture in '10. And I think that's going to be corporate led, and obviously retail lags. And so, I think you're right that '10 will continue to have a lag impact, but the CapEx in corporate America will be up significantly in '10. Right now, I mean, think about it, Tanger announced they're going to build.</p>
          <p>We might build in New Hampshire. There are lots of companies in various sectors that I think are thinking about growth. And in order to achieve growth, I think they need to hire people, which will give a certain stability in the job growth, which may make '11 and '12 a little bit better than what we are feeling today. And, that's -- so I am not as pessimistic on '11, '12, I think '10 will continue to have a, it'll be a tough environment, because we've got the lag impact, but if corporate America seems to be positioning to hire a little bit more, put more capital to work, we could have a better '11, '12 than what we might feel like today.</p>
