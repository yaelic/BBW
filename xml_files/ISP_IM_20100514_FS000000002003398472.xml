          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Intesa Sanpaolo 2010 First Quarter Results Conference Call, hosted today by Mr. Corrado Passera. My name is Phil , and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> However, at the end of the call, you will have the opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I am now handing you over to Corrado Passera to begin today's conference call.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, and good afternoon to everybody for &#x2013; and thank you for joining us to discuss, during a very interesting day, our results for the first quarter of 2010. Let me just start by making a couple of comments, then we will go through the presentation.</p>
          <p>As you know, over the past two years, we have prepared the bank for the crisis, probably this crisis. And in order to prepare the bank, we have, as you know, concentrated our avenues on core activities. We have accelerated a number of cost reductions. We kept strengthening our liquidity and solidity and we succeeded in keeping our risk profile as low as possible. I will say that thanks to these decisions, we are now today in the position to deliver what we promised. I would say even a little bit more than what we expected and this despite the crisis, is certainly proving to be longer and deeper than expected.</p>
          <p>Profitability. In any respect, we are ahead of expectations if you compared this quarter with the previous one. Our results are, in our opinion, sustainable and the sustainability of our results are based on the high quality of our earnings and on the fact that we have been able to keep, not only profitability in itself, but also all the other elements of sustainable profitability, that is; liquidity, solidity, and risk profile, on the right track.</p>
          <p>Revenues. Revenues are high quality, in our opinion, resilient and reliable. Certainly we have not inflated revenues by leverage and all of them are based on solid, let's say, commercial banking activity, an activity that is more and more rooted in the communities where we live and work.</p>
          <p>We believe that the growth potential for our revenues is significant and that Italy and Europe in general, but certainly Italy, will benefit from the recent strong and sudden devaluation of the euro. That will certainly give a further boost to the economy.</p>
          <p>Costs. While defending our core revenues, we keep delivering good structural reductions in operating cost and we have identified a number of new areas for efficiency savings, also for the months and the years ahead of us.</p>
          <p>Capital requirements and capital ratios. We have delivered an improvement of 10 basis points. In absolute volumes, we're talking about an improvement of tangible assets of more than 706 million. Our tangible assets, in a very difficult quarter like the one, the first in 2010, has increased by almost &#x20AC;800 million. Cost of credit is down to 82 basis points, a bit better than what we expected and what we start seeing is a decline in the flow of new non-performing loans.</p>
          <p>Last remark before we go to the presentation about liquidity. Liquidity is, was, and will remain, a priority. We thought &#x2013; we believed that liquidity was becoming a key factor for success and these proved to be right. We will keep stronger emphasis on liquidity and we will remain one of the most liquid banks in Europe.</p>
          <p>So let's now go rapidly through the most important pages of the presentation. Let's start with Page # 4. We compare in this page some figures of the last quarter, with the previous one. Operating margin more, higher than the last quarter 2009, by 14.4%. Income before tax, 24% improvement. Net income at almost &#x20AC;700 million, a bit more if we just this figure for main non-recurring items. That means quite an improvement, both versus the last quarter of 2009. Cost of credit, as I said before, is down to 82 basis points on an annual basis, and our Core Tier 1 pro forma, that means taking into account the deals that have already been signed, at 7.7, from an accounting point of view, 7.2.</p>
          <p>Page 5 is the page we use every time to introduce our presentation. Sustainable profitability is, and will remain our focus. Sustainable profitability means managing the bank through the crisis, both from an industrial point of view, from an operational point of view, that means income and the management of income and costs, but also at the same time, managing in a very prudent way the risk profile, the liquidity profile, the solidity and the leverage of the bank.</p>
          <p>Page # 6 gives an impression on the way our results are moving. The growth we are experiencing, both in terms of operating margins and in terms of income before tax from continuing operation. If we compare the first quarter 2010, both with the first quarter 2009, and the last quarter of 2009, you see that in any respect the growth trend is very clear.</p>
          <p>Page # 7, the same kind of comparisons on the size and the growth of some key variable in our activities. Customer financial assets on the left, clear growth, despite the crisis around us. And Assets under Management, that will be one of the main sources for new fees in our accounts, clearly moving upward.</p>
          <p>Page 8, just one page about costs. Intesa Sanpaolo has clearly accelerated on this side when we realized in the last two years that cost &#x2013; that the revenues could not meet our expectations. We accelerated a number of projects and a number of interventions and we keep decreasing our structural cost year-after-year and quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>The synergies we had in mind after the merger between Intesa and Sanpaolo have been reached, and we see further areas of reduction. As you can read in the notes in the bottom of the page, the cost of integration charges in 2010, will be significantly lower than those accounted for in 2009, and that will contribute our cost income ratio down to 53%.</p>
          <p>Page 9, a very important page, summary of our liquidity position. Top of the page on the left, the usual balance between direct customer deposits and loans to customers. Always on the left bottom of the page, the amount of eligible assets that we're not using, but that are ready to be used in case of need, with central banks, are 65 billion after the possible haircuts.</p>
          <p>In the notes, on the right, the arrow says that we have a positive net interbank position, 3.2 billion. That's another policy we are following, because we strongly believe that the interbank market is most vulnerable to the kind of shocks we are experiencing in these weeks and months. And we want to stay on the safe side on this market.</p>
          <p>Bottom of the page right-hand side, our long-term funding needs and capabilities. As it is clearly shown in the picture, we are in line, a bit in advance, in funding our long-term needs. We have anticipated some of the actions in 2009 of placements. We have anticipated some of them during the first four months of the year. And the 27 billion, that worth of maturities we have in the second part of the year, have been partially already pre-funded in 2009. And 19 billion or 18, 19 billion that are still in the process can be funded totally through our captive retail network capabilities, even if we don't believe that the market will stop. And in fact, we have in mind a number of deals during the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Page 10 is the summary of the capital ratios. First column is the &#x2013; are the capital ratios at the end of March, on our accounts. The 0.5% are those disposals or positions that are already underway that are being completed, but not yet on the accounts. So the pro forma capital ratios, say, 7.7 Core Tier 1 and 9% Tier 1, 12.4% Total Tier. These figures are already totally consistent with our risk profile and business model. But as you know, we are working to make these capital ratios even stronger. And there are at least 0.5%, 50 basis points, of further improvement available through the deals we are working on. And there is a number of other deals we could trigger if necessary, but we certainly do not believe that a bank like ours should grow at the levels that are listed in the last column of the page.</p>
          <p>In the notes, on the bottom of the page, you see that the dividends, at least in the amounts of 2009, have already been taken into account in figuring out the capital ratios I mentioned before. While those figures do not take into account the sale of branches, we have already agreed upon with the Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole, because of the antitrust settlement we made a few weeks ago.</p>
          <p>Page 11. Leverage. We are and we will remain a very low leverage kind of bank. And the tangible net equity of our bank, on the total tangible assets of our bank, puts us at the very top of the ranking in Europe. As I said before, during the first quarter of this year, our tangible equity has increased by almost &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>Page 12, will not elaborate on these figures, you know them very well. The portfolio of activities are on the left-hand side. Commercial banking is the word that represents obviously, our activity. On the right-hand side, the strong position we have on the main market where we operate, and that is Italy. Italy and the Italian activities represent a two-thirds more or less, of our activities. And as you see on the very right-hand side of the page, there is room, there will be room when the situation gets more normal, for significant increases, also in terms of market shares.</p>
          <p>Page 13. It's about risk profile. And if we go rapidly through the main lines at the top of the pages, you see that our &#x2013; the total coverage of our doubtful loans, that is a very important ratio in a period like this one, are stable at more than 120%. And the strength of this coverage is proved also by the repayments that we are experiencing from doubtful loans that are structurally higher than their net book value.</p>
          <p>Our reserve on performing loans, the so-called generic reserve, gets stronger quarter-after-quarter and the coverage of the performing loans is consequently increasing quarter-after-quarter. One point that is very important, it's a change in the trend that we expected since a few quarters, is the last line of the notes. The gross flow of new non-performing loans originating from performing loans are getting lower, and this trend probably proves that the worst, as we expected, is behind us. As we see in the picture on the left-hand side and on the two small ones on the right-hand side were both new substandard loans and doubtful loans are decreasing quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>Page 14 is the usually, is one of the typical tables we give on our presence in Central Eastern Europe. The rate of this presence is within the limits we gave ourself and the only country that could represent a structural risk, that is Ukraine, represent about 0.1% of our customer loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Let's move to Page 16. It's something I could have said at the end of the old presentation after the other pages we will see together. It is a summary on our outlook for 2010. We expect the net income for 2010 to exceed 2009, because of stronger operating performance and the contribution coming from the capital management actions and the capital gain we will create through them.</p>
          <p>Page 18. The summary of our balance sheet. Loan-to-customers are obviously down. Customer financial assets are up 3.5%, indirect customer deposits were going up, especially in the important line that is Asset under Management at plus 11.9%. It's a trend on which we are working very hard since a number of quarters.</p>
          <p>Page 19. Our income statement first quarter 2010, versus first quarter 2009. The net interest income trend we expected. Good net fee and commission income increased, obviously, profit on trading and income from Insurance business are small figures, but the improvement is in line with what we expected. Overall, we have operating income growing by 4%.</p>
          <p>Cost as usual under control with a nice decrease of 2.2%. The combination of higher structural revenues and lower structural cost, made the operating margin up 12%. Net provision on the different risks are a bit higher than last year, but that was more than expected and the overall effect on the income before tax makes an increase of almost 20%.</p>
          <p>The very last line is down, but not on a comparable basis, because as you might remember, we enjoyed a fiscal deal on tax-deferred taxes in the first quarter of 2009 that brought in the round of &#x20AC;500 million, that made our taxes in 2009 a positive figure. So if we compare the two quarters on a comparable basis, the increase also in terms of net income, is two digits.</p>
          <p>Page 20. The same comparison, but with last quarter 2009, a slight decrease in revenues and we will analyze all the elements of them in the following pages. It's mainly a matter of, not only but mainly a matter of fewer days in the quarter and the lack of performance fees that are accounted for in the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Costs down, but that's normal given the seasonal growth we have at the end of the year, every year. The combination of the two effects on revenue, the two trends in revenues and cost, make operating margins up 14.4%. The lower level of adjustments make the income before tax higher in the first quarter 2010 by almost 25% and more or less the same kind of increase at the net income level.</p>
          <p>Page 21, the trend in Euribor is obviously penalizing significantly, deposit-based banks like ourself, but if that is not finished then we will get back to usual market yields sooner or later. The combination of lower market yields and by definition lower lending volumes, as you'll see on the right-hand side of the page, at the bottom of the page, make the comparison between the first quarter this year and the first quarter last year, a minus 9.5%. But, as I said before, we are not pushing against reasonability. We are not inflating our results through that and we are not trying to lend money to non-creditworthy customers because we, first of all, believe in the strength of our loan portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 22 is the analysis to understand what happened more in detail. Left-side of the page, the decrease in, the slight decrease in interest income between the last quarter of last year and the first quarter this year, comes from operating impacts by for, 82 million, 61 is volumes. But as I said before, the large majority of this difference comes from the lower number of days in the quarter, while the spread effect is in the round of 21 million. Hedging is a small fraction, but a positive one.</p>
          <p>If we look at the year-on-year results, figures are larger and they come obviously for the largest majority of them because of the spread effect, partially compensated by the hedging facility that we established right-on-time.</p>
          <p>One important point I can say today, is that our hedging facility will cover both 2011 and 2012, because we believe that there is the risk at least, that market yields will remain a bit lower than what we expected, also for the next two years.</p>
          <p>Page 23, net fees and commission, moving in the right direction. They will grow certainly at a faster pace as soon as people will have more trust in the markets and most of the improvement we expect on this line of revenues will come from the switch from Asset under Administration to Asset under Management. And if you look at Page 24, you see that the trends are all in the right direction, but still not at the speed we will achieve when the market will be less volatile and it will be more reasonable also on our side, to convince our customers to change their mix of funds towards more stock-related funds.</p>
          <p>Page 25. Trading. Trading is in the round of the figure we expected as an average kind of amount for the year. If you want to understand better the components, we have to look at Page 26. You'll see that the largest majority of these trading profits come from customer-related activities. The first two line of the analysis on Page 26, while prop trading is and will remain a minor negligible component of our revenues. It's a policy we are following very strictly since a long time and we will stick to these rules.</p>
          <p>Page 27. Insurance business. We have worked in this business and we still have to work to consolidate the four companies of ours. Performance is becoming much less erratic than it used to be in the past and we are moving in the right direction, also in terms of profitability.</p>
          <p>Page 28. Cost. Costs are under control. The efficiency we are building in a number of areas of the bank enable us to have a further structural reduction in our cost, in our total cost. As you know, we expect to have a minus sign for the whole year and this quarter results has been even a little bit better than what we expected.</p>
          <p>Page 29, some analysis on cost of credit. The quarterly figure is a bit better than what we expected. The comparison with the same quarter last year is only plus 22.9%, and that confirms what we expect for whole year, that is, a reduction in the overall cost of credit on our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Page 30, on left-side, top of the page. The weight of net doubtful and substandard loans on total loans is stable. While we see what we expected and we hoped to see during 2010, that is a reduction in net substandard loans and net past-dues, as you'll see in the picture. The pipeline from the sale of the non-performing loans start improving in the first phases. Obviously, we have to manage the substandard-to-doubtful loan switch that is to a certain extent unavoidable, but the total effect will be consistent with our forecast of lower cost of credit for the whole year.</p>
          <p>Page 31. We confirm what we said at the beginning and that is, a total coverage of our doubtful loans are quite comfortable. And that will probably enable us to continue getting repayments higher than the net value of the Doubtful Loan portfolio. On the right-hand side, you'll see what I mentioned at the beginning of the presentation. The coverage of the performing loans through the generic reserve is increasing and the total amount of this reserve is even becoming stronger despite the situation.</p>
          <p>Page 32 is the breakdown of the same figures for the different divisions. And I will not elaborate now while we can do if some of you is interested.</p>
          <p>Page 33. Flow of new substandard loan and new doubtful loan, you'll see that at the top of the page for the Group, as a whole, that the new flows are lower than last quarter once, and that is very consistent with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Page 34. The well-diversified portfolio of loans on the right-hand side in terms of segments, customer segments and kind of lending facilities, the residential mortgage analysis is more or less the one that we saw in the previous quarters together. Very good loan-to-value figure, 48%, and a very rational installment available income ratio at 37%. The breakdown by sectors and industries remain very balanced on the right-hand side.</p>
          <p>Page 35. We decided as usual to give as much information as possible on the issues interesting for the market. In this case was and is, our Government Bond portfolio. On page 35, you have the breakdown by country, 83% are with the G7 countries and the rest are listed in this page.</p>
          <p>Page 36. Is the further breakdown of our Bond portfolio of Italian government bonds. You'll see them analyzed in the three different categories of trading, available for sale, and loan and receivables, while on the bottom side of the page, you have the analysis by kind of rates and duration. A portfolio that does not represent, in any respect, an area of concern for us.</p>
          <p>Page 37. The analysis of our exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain. Again, also in this case, these are figures, even a bit better than the one we announced to the market a few days ago, that in our opinion do not represent areas of concern.</p>
          <p>Page 38. The breakdown of our results by division. I will not go through the details, but I'm obviously more than ready to comment and analyze all the figures. Each division is providing the Group a positive EVA, and that's already quite a performance in certain cases.</p>
          <p>Very last &#x2013; no, we can stop here, because the last page of the presentation before the appendices is Page 45, is a summary of what I have already said. Our business model is and will remain focused on commercial banking, and the balance we want to keep between short-term profitability, liquidity, leverage, solidity, and risk profile, will remain our point of reference.</p>
          <p>Conclusion &#x2013; after this presentation &#x2013; the quarter results are in line with our expectations, a bit better than we expected. Our outlook for 2010 remain positive. Our operating income is improving, and 2010 is expected to be better than 2009. And the business model issues, I have already repeated this point too many times, so I will not say that once again.</p>
          <p>So thank you very much for listening to me, and now, I will be happy to take any question you might have. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes through from the line of Alessandro Roccati of Macquarie. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just two very quick questions.</p>
          <p>The first one is on asset quality. We've seen a very good performance in that Retail. In the Public Finance division there's been a move of 500 million from incurring for sofferenze. Just wondering whether you can tell us what it is?</p>
          <p>And the second question is on the cost of risk, where we've seen a drop in the cost of risk in CIB to 38 basis points, which is a very low level. I'm just wondering how recurrent you consider this level of cost of risk?</p>
          <p>And then a more strategic question. Given an environment of very low-interest rates in Italy and in Europe, and we believe this is going to be perhaps a situation for a number of quarters. Would it make sense for you to expand outside Italy and look at see, given that the capital position with the options in place, or to be put in place, will bring the capital level to a safe position? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the first question is concerned, we believe that the quality of the corporate investment banking division is very high, and so the kind of figure we have in the first quarter, is the representative of the situation. So very a reliable one.</p>
          <p>We had to pass a couple of position &#x2013; historical ones &#x2013; to Doubtful Loans into Public Finance, but this change of category do not jeopardize our possibility, our capability to fight for getting this money back. It's mainly the case of one city in the south of Italy, and we are confident that we will defend our interest in the future.</p>
          <p>As far as interest income. Interest income will return &#x2013; will come back to the levels we had in the past. We have to wait for market deals to be at normal levels. They are at very unusual and unnormal levels.</p>
          <p>We don't have to push lending in segments of the market that are not creditworthy. We are a bank that makes 700 million, real money, also in period &#x2013; in a quarter &#x2013; also in a period like this one. We will certainly keep looking outside of Italy, but without any anxiety. If good opportunities arise, we are ready to jump on them. But without pushing any strategy in this direction.</p>
          <p>The kind of work we have been doing in the last few years on our Banca dei Territori, will make our capability to recover in terms of growth much stronger than in the past, as soon as the situation gets back to normality. Today, we have to stay calm and work with our long-term customers without, as I said, pushing in areas of activities where the risk profile is not consistent with the risk profile we're giving our bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a very quick follow-up. Given that net interest income is constrained by the current environment of interest rates, and on cost, you've done very well, but you have achieved most of the major synergies with Sanpaolo. Where do you see significant upside in terms of profit and loss lines? Is it on the commission line or is it still on the cost side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly, the hedging facilities, we have guaranteed the banks also for the next years will compensate for some lack of interest income.</p>
          <p>Certainly, the devaluation of the euro will boost some &#x2013; will trigger some growth and boost some growth for a number of companies and customers of ours. So we expect some volumes increase in the next month because, being mainly export-oriented, many customers of ours will enjoy the new exchange-rate situation.</p>
          <p>The reserve we have in terms of fee income increase on the Asset under Management products is significant and will happen in the next quarters. Again, it's a matter of deciding the right moment to suggest to our customers to switch to those kind of products. So that's about what I can tell you about the total revenues that we are expecting for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes through from the line of Fabrizio Bernardi of Evolution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon to everybody, Fabrizio from Evolution. I have a two, three questions if I can.</p>
          <p>The first one is on Banca Fideuram. We see, even today, markets are very volatile. So probably pricing for an IPO might be pretty difficult. So if you can share with us your feeling about this?</p>
          <p>Secondly, regarding net interest income. You said before that probably rates will remain very low for one, two years, which is probably terrible for banks with this funding.  What I'm asking is, we see two banks borrowing cheap money, going along the state Treasury in order to gain the difference in terms of yield, which is not a zero-sum gain. It can be very, very risky.</p>
          <p>Is this, let's say, something that Intesa might be considering? Because I've seen that total assets in the last quarter were up 3%, which is strange in the last, let's say, five quarters. While loans were down 1%, and let's say, all the other assets implying plus 10% in one quarter. So I was asking if we might see some benefit from this kind of balance sheet movement?</p>
          <p>And third question is very general, about customer loans. They are going down 1% in the first quarter of '10, and down, if I'm right, 3, 4% year-on-year. Is this due to the fact that Intesa is very selective in its lending policy? Or is more a macro factor, which would have a different implication in terms of the Italian business? Thank you.</p>

          <p>As far as the first question, we have not taken in any decision and we cannot make any comment, given the process we started to list Fideuram.</p>
          <p>Fideuram is performing, as you'll see, in a very satisfactory way. We will decide the best timing of &#x2013; for the listing of the company.</p>
          <p>Net interest income is low, but not lower than what we expected. The increase you're mentioning in total assets is coming from the excess liquidity we are having, that to a certain extent is what we wanted to be very comfortable in terms of liquidity. Obviously, we will not push it too much because we are aware of the kind of risks you mentioned in your question.</p>
          <p>As far as the Loan portfolio, there are a number of elements that have brought to the results I described before. One major effect is, especially on large corporates, that in the last few months, have been able to issue a significant amount of bonds, and through those issues, they have been able to repay important amount of loans.</p>
          <p>And while on the other side, we have certainly an enormous demand of credit, even if we expect this demand to grow, because of the growth in the real economy, we are starting perceiving that will be further fostered by the euro devaluation.</p>
          <p>So more or less what we expected. And again, given this trend and given the kind of cost income that we have achieved, we are at the cruise speed, more or less, that we believe a bank like this one should have &#x2013; also in very difficult and very difficult periods of time like this one &#x2013; that is in the round of &#x20AC;700 million per quarter. That was, I think, a satisfactory result for the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening. Also a couple of questions from my side.</p>
          <p>My first question is on the interest rate hedges and how we should be looking at things going forward? Your comment was very interesting that you now have extended your hedges until 2012, because I remember in the last call, you were signaling that half will be going down or maturing in 2010, half in 2011.</p>
          <p>So what kind of transactions have you put in place? And so can we actually assume &#x2013; I look at your slide of that interest income &#x2013; you have in Q1 the support of about &#x20AC;430 million of interest hedges. Will that remain flat then and sustainable, even if interest rates don't move for the foreseeable future? I think that's quite an important point here.</p>
          <p>The second point, just a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the asset quality. You mentioned one large transaction in restructured loans. Can you tell us &#x2013; I know it's difficult. We can't certainly mention names. But a little bit of more, what it is about? Is it something that you knew before? What is the situation, just to have a feel, because it is a one large lump?</p>
          <p>And the last question, what is the volume of loans that you have under moratoria, according to the law right now? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, about the hedging facilities. I think I can confirm what you said. The support we'll get from these hedging facilities in the next two years will be more or less flat, if compared to the first quarter 2010. And the amount we had in this quarter is sustainable with this level of market yield.</p>
          <p>The asset quality, we cannot mention the names, but the positions that have been moved to restructured positions are positions that on which we are sure we will not lose any money. And given the figures and given the announcements some of these companies have made in the very last few days, are very consistent with our very positive expectation. So you can consider them &#x2013; we have to consider them restructured, but we see them moving back rapidly toward performing loans.</p>
          <p>Moratoria is something in the round of 35,000 people &#x2013; companies, small companies. 2 billion worth of lines. No loss &#x2013; no economic loss coming from the moratoria, and simply a way that we decided to give some of our customers to go through the crisis, a bit more comfortably than without them.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I may, just one more follow-up regarding your interest rates, new hedges, new transactions. Should I be reading the increase &#x2013; that quarter-on-quarter in financial assets held for trading from 91 billion to 106, and the financial assets available for sale and increasing, in terms of increasing the replicating portfolio that you might have purchased underlying your interest rate hedges? Or this is not related?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, totally unrelated. The hedging facilities are interest-rate swaps without any assets in front of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. A couple of quick questions.</p>
          <p>The first one, of the deals that you have already agreed, which is the depository bank and the ones we include in the policy domestic, can you tell us when you think it would naturally reflect the impact of those deals in the stated core capital, if it's possible, by quarter?</p>
          <p>The other one is in terms of your insurance result, I felt it was pretty strong at 166 million. Is this the recurring for the rest of the year? And more in general, what do you think the potential opportunity you have there?</p>
          <p>And then, my last question, which is a bit of a broader question. You started the presentation by saying it's an interesting day, and there's no doubt that the results are solid. That said, the stock I feel is down 6, 7% &#x2013; not just yours, but it's a little bit across the market. From the beginning of the year, the stock is down 27%. I think only the Greek banks have performed worse. And if I look at these numbers, it's just very hard for me to understand what's going on.</p>
          <p>What is your take on it? Probably the market at the moments are relating more to Italy than to the bank. What is the chance of a double dip? The need for fiscal consolidation? It's sort of a little bit of your broader take, because from your point of view, probably, you have a better viewpoint on the economy than some of us. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The accounting effect of the Security Service disposal is expected in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>As far as the Insurance sector performance, we believe that the first quarter results are sustainable ones.</p>
          <p>And as far as the last question, that is obviously the most difficult question to answer, I believe there is a lot of emotions in what is happening. I agree with you, it's hard to justify, from a rational point of view, some stock performances, but luckily enough, we are working for the long term and not &#x2013; we can't afford not to look at the short-term performance.</p>
          <p>Certainly, Italy is a country that is very, very different from those weaker countries that have created the crisis. From whichever point of view you look at our country, you see a solid position. Primary surplus, for example, or the level of indebtedness of both households and companies. If you look at the pension reforms that have already been done in our country and certainly not in others, and the kind of, the amount of household's financial assets that have been accumulated during the years.</p>
          <p>So for &#x2013; in any respect, the Italian figures do not justify certain doubts that have been showed by someone. So probably we have been involved in this kind of emotional evaluations that will be proven not rational with the time, and with the results, and with the economic scenario of the next quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Pascale Decque from Natixis. I just have one question regarding the methodology of capital allocation for your Insurance business.</p>
          <p>It's &#x2013; we just said a word about that. It's a huge part of your Banca dei Territori results. Then when I look at the capital allocated for this division, it's around, as you said, 6.5% of the risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>What about the capital allocation for Insurance? Not even mentioning that your competitors have moved to a 7% risk-weighted assets for most of their businesses recently. And not even mentioning the Basel 3 potential impact for Insurance business. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We will give you the exact figure on the capital allocation on the Insurance business.</p>
          <p>As far as Basel 3, we will see what Basel 3 will provide for. If we can afford to keep the Insurance business we will keep it. If we cannot afford, we will do accordingly.</p>
          <p>The economic capital &#x2013; I have the answer to your first question &#x2013; economic capital that is allocated to the Insurance business is 1.3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you. And our next question comes through from the line of Alberto Cordara of Bank of America &#x2013; Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Good afternoon. Just wanted to touch base again on the net interest income. I mean, first of all, you provided a good amount of clarity on this hedging facility, which is very helpful. But I'm thinking if I look at your maturity for the year, you have about 20 billion to place with your retail cash. It would be interesting to know what is the amount that is coming from fixed rate bonds, because, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think it would be fair to assume that repricing of this facility should provide some benefit to you. Because, I mean, fixed rate bonds were priced maybe 2, 3 years ago when these were very different than today. So I think we talk about low interest rate environment, but I'm thinking whether we are a bit negative and whether effectively Q1 should be considered as the trough quarter for the net interest margins. So I just wanted to have your opinion on this.</p>
          <p>The other question is, I think you provided guidelines that you expect this year to beat the earnings of 2009, which is positive, but I think you need to put this a bit more in context, because we know that there are some very strong capital gains coming from the depositary bank. So my simple question is whether you expect to beat the earnings for '09, net of one-offs. And the other question is, I think you mentioned during the call that you expect some 700 million per quarter. I just wanted to clarify this is the level of earnings that we should more or less assume over the next few quarters, in which case I think you might view as a positive. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, the 20 billion will not necessarily be placed all of them on the retail network because we assume the market &#x2013; the institutional market will remain open during the year. But you're right, there might be advantage in terms of cost. The improvement in our results is, I think, well described on Page 16. And what we can say as of today is what is written on that page that not only we expect net income for the year to exceed 2009, but we expect also some improvement in operating income. And then we give a number of guidance that we confirm. So that's what we can say about 2009. And that's about it. Or you had another question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's very clear. Just maybe to elaborate a bit more on my first question. My impression, I mean, looking also at the fact that now that the Euribor is slightly trending up, you have a very strong net interbank position, which seems to indicate that you expect some tension in the interbank market. So I just wanted to have your feeling about it. I think my idea is probably net interest margin for Q1 2010 is really going to be at this trough, but maybe I'm wrong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. You're right. For sure we expect the Euribor to move upward, probably not at the level we expected a few months ago, but for sure we are at the very bottom. And even if you look at the forward rate, you have exactly the same kind of impression. So we can only have advantages in that respect. We also expect some tensions on the interbank market and that's why we have decided to keep very consistently the position we have kept in the last few quarters. And in that respect, we would be &#x2013; we will have an advantage from that position. But for sure, even if interest market yields will remain low, they will certainly not remain at the level they are today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, Mr. Passera, and good afternoon, everyone. I just have a couple of question on some of which you have already elaborated, but it would be a welcome to have some more comments. I look at your line at Page 12 about market share. And it looks like you are actually losing market share in terms of loans and deposits in Italy, which is a bit counterintuitive for a bank solid and actually liquid as Intesa. You mentioned before something on the large corporate and also that you are extremely conservative in the SMEs segment in Italy. I was just wondering whether there are competitors in Italy, which are probably willing to compete on price and are more aggressive than you, even embarking on more risk. So &#x2013; because we have seen very different numbers from other banks so far, Italian banks of course, and more comment on this would be welcome.</p>
          <p>Second is on NII again, because you reiterated before your guidance of defense of interest income. I was just wondering whether you expect NII to be stable vis-&#xE0;-vis '09, even if rates remained flat until the end of the year. And whether maybe you have in action from repricing of loans in order to help a little bit NII. The third is evolution mark-up and mark-down. I know that you don't &#x2013; never give us numbers about it, but I was wondering whether you could comment a little bit on the evolution quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>And then as a final question, sorry, just one, on Page 52, when you show &#x2013; where you show the breakdown of net fees, because I'm looking at the current account. The run rate in the third and the fourth quarter was quite stable while there is a drop in Q1, which might not be only seasonality. So I was just wondering whether there is here any regulation effect or margin compression that can explain this drop. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Markets in loans and deposits. As far as deposits, we are already in excess liquidity position so we're certainly not pushing in that respect. As far as loans, the main reasons while that figure is slightly lower than in the past is because of the large companies effect, I mentioned before, and a number of financial holdings also reducing their borrowing position. SMEs in general are not decreasing more than the market. Actually some segments are increasing. But as you rightly said, we are not ready to change our risk profile just for growth &#x2013; volume growth objectives. So we're ready to increase also significantly the effort on the market but only in areas, segments that we consider safe.</p>
          <p>Other companies are more aggressive? Probably yes. That has been the case also in the past but if we now enjoy the kind of cost of risk we are enjoying it's because of the policies that we have always tried to respect. Net interest income, hard to say but probably a flattish trend versus 2009 is a reasonable expectation. And as far as Page 52, if you compare first Q1 2010 and Q1 2009 you see that despite the very strong competition that on the commodity kind of products we are having on the market the figure is almost 15% upward, so not too bad.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, just a follow-up. Is there anyway any regulation effect that explain that drop?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the loan book, sorry, do you have in mind any action to reprice the loan book going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The repricing exercise is a never-ending exercise, both on deposits and loans. Obviously if you give more emphasis to the quality of the portfolio, you have &#x2013; you decide to have a lower amount of flexibility on rates, because you cannot maximize both quality and margins. And today we believe it's safer for us and for our shareholders to maximize the quality of the portfolio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are working very actively on this chapter of the new business plan. And we have identified several, several hundreds of million of further reductions. So the main chapters, just to mention some of them, are rationalization of spaces and rationalizations of the branch network, renegotiation of conditions with suppliers. There is room, especially with payment terms, to get economic savings. Certainly we have several areas of structural reduction, both in terms of legal expenses, communication expenses, consultancy expenses. The main areas in absolute terms obviously is the IT savings we are reaching, thanks to the unification of all the IT systems we have done in the last &#x2013; we completed last years. The back offices, both local and central, are a very significant areas of further cost reduction. But as I mentioned, only a few of the 19 subchapters of cost reduction we already have in the plan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I can say is that we are sticking to the rules we have given ourselves in the last 2 years. Obviously it's a period of time when you have to get &#x2013; to prepare the bank for managing through a very difficult crisis. And what we consider sustainable profitability is, I think, clear to all of us. We are sticking to it. We're looking at the medium-term result. We are sure we will get out of this crisis stronger than what we were at the beginning.</p>
          <p>The room for improvement of results and growth for a bank like ours in countries like the ones where we operate is very significant. And let me say that also Italy, and Europe in general, if we are good enough in taking advantage of this crisis to complete the restructuring on the one side and to complete the building of the European Union might be at the end quite an opportunity for all of us. In any case, thanks to all of us from Intesa Sanpaolo.</p>
