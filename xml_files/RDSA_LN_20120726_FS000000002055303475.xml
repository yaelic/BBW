          <p>Thank you very much. Great. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell's Second Quarter 2012 Results Presentation. So Simon and I will take you through the results and update you on where we are with our strategy. And then there will be plenty of time for questions at the end. We'll take questions here from the room and also from the web.</p>
          <p>Obviously you know the drill on this one. Let me start with the overview, the global economy and the energy markets are likely to see continued high volatility. This is really an interplay between structural growth in energy demand and on the other side some unprecedented geopolitical events, such as we see playing out in the Eurozone at the moment, Arab spring comes to mind and others.</p>
          <p>So this is a very complex landscape for us in the energy industry and in highly interconnected world. Therefore we see a lot of opportunities for a global integrated company like Shell. We're on track for our cash flow targets of up to $200 billion for 2012 to 2015, which as you know is some 50% higher than the previous four years. And we're also on track for oil and gas production of 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017 and 2018, the outcome of our investment decisions and financial targets.</p>
          <p>Now this is an ambitious program and we have got lots to do. So let me, over the next few minutes update on where we are with our progress in all of this. Our Q2 2012 CCS earnings, excluding identified items, were $5.7 billion or $13 billion for the first half. Now in the second quarter, we had a lot of planned maintenance actually as some of it we have indicated and we also had some timing issues on dividend payments. That really was roughly $500 million, which you need to take into account when you look at our clean earnings.</p>
          <p>Now we are seeing the impact of the weaker economy in our results. We sold $4 billion of assets in the first six months of the year, as we improve Shell's capital efficiency from strategic &#x2013; and we form strategic partnerships and upgrade the portfolio.</p>
          <p>The underlying upstream volumes were good. They were up 4%. We have new projects under construction for medium-term growth, making deliberate top down choices with our investments, where we can add value with technology, with integration and to scale of Shell.</p>
          <p>We're also working hard to get choice in to our portfolio, with new exploration acreage and new integrated gas opportunities crystallizing in 2012. And I'll come back to that with a slide later on.</p>
          <p>So it has been a busy time and still is a busy time in 2012 and I will give you now some more details on the issues, which we're working on. First let me start with continuous improvement. We're working on these programs across the company and the opportunities; they run actually into the billions of the dollars from a potential point of view. In Downstream, for example, where industry returns are likely to remain under pressure for some time, we've put a lot of work into reducing our unplanned downtime in our refineries and chemical plants.</p>
          <p>There's clearly more to come here, but we've seen so far a very positive trend, with actually the first half unplanned downtime at historically low levels and a top quartile industry performance. The Port Arthur refinery expansion project on the Gulf Coast, which had crude distillation unit damage shortly after start-up, is not yet in the figures on this chart. The Motiva joint-venture, which runs this plant, expects the crude unit restarts to be delayed into 2013. Now let me just be clear, we're not happy with this and we're investigating and we're working hard to turn this around and actually learn out of the incident.</p>
          <p>On the Upstream side, we're coming to the end of the ramp up of the three large projects; we have been working for the last six years or so. Qatar LNG and GTL and Canada oil sands and I think many of you have had a chance to visit these assets. Large-scale, taking low upstream volumes into end-user products and markets, major investments in infrastructure and technology. These are all the themes where Shell adds a lot of value.</p>
          <p>Now Qatargas 4 LNG achieved full production in 2011 and it has already delivered 9.8 million tonnes of LNG in 11 countries. AOSP expansion one in Oil Sands Canada has been operating at ore-quality adjusted design rates in the second quarter. Pearl gas-to-liquids has already produced 4.5 million tonnes of NGLs and GTL products and both trains have run at 90% to 100% of design rates. This is a great achievement and Pearl is one of a kind of an asset and some of you are, or most of you have seen it as well.</p>
          <p>Now we have already learned a lot about this facility, which gives us new opportunities for continuous improvements. Maintenance started in the second quarter will continue during the third quarter, impacting production, with minor modifications, as we get both GTL trains and the utilities running as a single integrated asset. This is all building to the final slate and marketing the higher value products on what I call the Downstream side of the project, essentially a gas based refinery.</p>
          <p>Now I want to change the emphasis here. The last six years have been all about the construction and ramp up phase of these exciting projects. Going forward, on these three, it's all about safe and reliable production operations, getting more out of the assets from things like debottlenecking of oil sands for example, catalyst improvements, more product placed in high value specialty markets, and petrochemicals opportunities in Qatar and maximizing commercial returns in the integrated value chains on all of these projects. So you might hear less about them in our presentations but they are going to be important drivers of the results.</p>
          <p>First half 2012 production from these three was 360,000 BOE per day compared to 184 per day in the first half of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (8:28). They generated $2.7 billion or 12% in the first half of our CFFO, cash flow from operations, $1.8 billion or 14% of first-half earnings. I think if you look at Shell's growth profile in the last few years, the investment profile was really dominated by Qatar and by Canada. Now there is an important shift in our project flow here because these three are now on-stream, with a large number of projects driving the next wave of growth. This of course diversifies shareholder risk compared to the position in the last few years. Some 60% of our Upstream spending, this year for example, is in North America and in Australia. We have around 8 billion barrels of resources under construction, over 20 projects underway and more than 30 more on the drawing board to sustain our growth profile. Now all of this builds into the cash flow and production targets that we have set for the company which I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>Now asset sales are part of our business model. We have sold $31 billion of assets in the last five years, which is a rollover of nearly 15% of our capital employed. At the same time, we're recycling some of that capital into new growth positions, for example exploration and LNG options.</p>
          <p>Asset sales in the last 18 months were twice more than the positions we have bought. Now there is no precise target to match these figures, but they do tend to balance out over time. Acquisitions need to compete with organic projects on a profitability basis. This is a tough hurdle, I can tell you, to get the best returns for really our shareholders. Cove is a recent example of this capital discipline. Now let me turn to exploration.</p>
          <p>We're driving our resources growth with exploration and bolt-on deals. We have been reloading our exploration portfolio in the last few years, with a buildup of frontier exploration acreage, tight gas and shale plays, as well as maintaining an active drilling portfolio in our more matured heartlands.</p>
          <p>We've had three successful offshore wells so far in 2012, all in the Gulf of Mexico. Two oil appraisal conforming the 500 million BOE resources at Appo and at the recent Vito appraisal, now confirmed as 300 million BOE resources. Now these should &#x2013; both should actually be adding to our bottom line in the second half of the decade. We have drilled some 50 exploration in the appraisal wells worldwide in liquids rich shales and tight gas in the first half of the year. And you can see actually some of the names on the chart. So well results in China Gas and the North America liquids-rich shale are encouraging but more work is needed to demonstrate commerciality.</p>
          <p>Now I'm also looking forward to some interesting well results in the next six months or so. For example, we have French Guiana and Alaska being drilled over the next six months.</p>
          <p>Now let's just look at Alaska for an update here. We're getting ready to spot new wells offshore in Alaska this summer. A great deal of planning has gone into this program with over 20 vessels to cover the drilling and contingencies. Ice conditions will dictate how long the drilling seasonal will last, with a slower start due to the heavy ice conditions. We're planning for two exploration well completions this year, with potential for drilling top-hole section on further locations, which we expect to drill next year. Now this is an important step for us in Alaska in what could actually become a substantial, although long-term, province for Shell.</p>
          <p>Now before I pass you over to, Simon, let me make some comments on North American gas. On the gas drilling side, we're continuing to spend at the low end of our potential range with around 160 exploration and development wells in the first half of this year. This is similar to last year, focusing on acreage retention and the lowest cost plays across the continent. We're working on a series of integrated gas options, where I think Shell has a very strong credential. We have 0.3 million tonnes per annum of LNG for transport under development in Canada and we're working on two similar projects in the United States, which we expect to launch shortly. You may have seen, we recently signed the memorandum of understanding with TravelCenters of America to sell liquefied natural gas to heavy duty road transport customer in the U.S. This is at about 100 sites nationwide.</p>
          <p>On the LNG export side, we're working with strategic partners on a 12 million tonne per annum LNG project in Canada. The gas supply for this project could include resources from Shell's Western Canadian gas position. This includes Groundbirch, where resources have increased from 6 Tcfe in 2008 to potentially more than 12 today through drilling programs in recent years. We have doubled the resources potential here since we actually Duvernay. Now we have further natural gas value chain options on the drawing board. This is LNG. This is gas to chemicals but also gas to liquids. We will say more about those in the future but I think there is a very strong opportunity set emerging here for Shell.</p>
          <p>So overall good progress on the strategy, the development project flow and broadening out of our pre-FID option set.</p>
          <p>Now over to Simon to talk about Q2 results in some more detail and update you on the financial side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter and good afternoon. As I've said before, quarterly results are very relevant but good or bad, they're really only a snapshot of performance in what is a volatile industry, where we're actually implementing a long-term strategy with a rather longer wavelength than three months.</p>
          <p>So I'll just start with the macro-environment. If you look at the macro compared with a year ago, second quarter 2011, oil prices and the global natural gas realizations declined from a year ago, and this change reflects some easing of the geopolitical pressures that were actually boosting the oil prices a year ago. In North America, the Henry Hub natural gas price has essentially halved due to the supply bubble from shale gas. Outside of North America, the natural gas realizations they were broadly unchanged Q2 to Q2, some regional differences, but supported by of course time lagged oil price linkages where gas prices don't yet reflect the fall in the oil price.</p>
          <p>Industry refining margins were higher in Europe and they fell in the U.S. and in Singapore, particularly in Asia Pacific. Industry chemical margins rose in the U.S. on the back of tight supply. In Europe, they're underpinned by the falling naphtha price. But in Asia-Pacific again, they remained low due to weak demand. The overall trading environment for oil and gas has been softer than a year ago with overall weak demand but also lower daily price volatility than we saw last year. So the basic message is: we continue to see a very mixed picture on overall energy demand and the consequences for results.</p>
          <p>So oil demand in total did increase year-on-year, and LNG demand remains strong. But European gas demand remains weak due to the weak economic conditions, price competition with coal. In fact, we're seeing coal substituting gas at the moment for power production, particularly in the UK. And in the Downstream, we do see evidence of a slowdown at the end of the second quarter, and that's as we effectively enter the third quarter with softer industry refining margins in the U.S. and in Asia-Pacific. So still very mixed.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the earnings in the quarter itself. CCS earnings, current cost of supplies were for the quarter, including the identified items were $6 billion. Excluding the identified items, the CCS earnings were $5.7 billion, and the earnings per share decreased by 13% as compared with the second quarter 2011.</p>
          <p>On a Q2 to Q2 basis, we saw slightly higher earnings in the Downstream, lower figures in the Upstream. Cash flow from operations was over $13 billion. Dividends declared in the quarter $2.8 billion. We're offering the scrip dividend again for the second quarter 2012, and the buybacks, which are aimed at offsetting the dilution from scrip over time should surpass $1 billion year-to-date this week.</p>
          <p>So let me talk just a bit more about business performance firstly on the Upstream. The Upstream earnings excluding identified items were $4.5 billion in the second quarter, and that's a decrease of 17% versus the same quarter 2011. Weaker oil and gas prices, weaker gas trading conditions, they were the main drivers of the decline, and that's about $700 million of the quarter two to quarter two impact. We did see positive earnings momentum from growth projects.</p>
          <p>The deferral of the second quarter dividend payments into Q3 by one of our LNG joint ventures combined with planned maintenance that we did highlight back in April of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day greater than we were seeing a year ago. They took around $500 million off the earnings on the Q2 to Q2 comparison. A lot of that 50,000 was oil rather than gas.</p>
          <p>For the first half oil and gas production in total was 3.3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, and that's an underlying production increase for the half of 4%, same as the quarter compared to last year. And the growth comes as a result of a multi-year investment in new oil and gas fields and the programs to increase the production uptime, both of which Peter referred to.</p>
          <p>So comment on Upstream for the third quarter. During the third quarter, looking ahead there will continue to be planned maintenance mostly now in Asia-Pacific and Europe, and relative to Q3 last year, that's about 25,000 barrel a day oil equivalent impact.</p>
          <p>Three recent large start-ups that Peter showed, Qatar and Canada, they produced 360,000 barrels a day oil equivalent in the second quarter 2012, and we expect similar production from these assets in the third quarter, same as the first quarter as well.</p>
          <p>Now as you also may remember, the UK Government announced a tax increase for the Upstream business back in the first quarter 2011. That legislation has now just been enacted. So we're expecting to see a net charge of somewhere between $300 million, $350 million in the third quarter of 2012 that will be related to the change in the tax basis for abandonment costs in the North Sea. That's a charge and it will be treated as an identified item.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Downstream. Excluding identified items, the Downstream CCS earnings were $1.3 billion and that is slightly higher than year-ago. Oil Products numbers were slightly higher; slightly lower numbers from chemicals. So Oil Products earnings reflect an improvement in the overall refining margin environment, slightly lower marketing and trading results although overall market and trading was basically in the expected band.</p>
          <p>Chemicals earnings declined and that was driven by essentially weaker margins across all of the main product lines, weaker demand in Asia-Pacific than projected. Now we are expecting worldwide refinery and chemicals availability for the third quarter in 2012 to be slightly lower than it was in third quarter last year due to higher planned maintenance in refinery and chemicals manufacturing units. So those are the earnings; now turning to the cash flow.</p>
          <p>Cash generation on a 12-month rolling basis excluding working capital was some $47 billion, and that included $7.3 billion of disposal proceeds, and over that 12 month period the average Brent price has been $112 per barrel. The cash flow generation has been underpinned by strong oil prices clearly, and by the ramp up of new projects, some support from the timing of dividends declared across the 12 month period, and by our equity affiliates. The Upstream generated surplus cash flow after investment. The Downstream was broadly cash neutral before any payment to the dividend. It's good to see the cash flow that we've been generating, but we are looking for more from the company here. As you know, this is a core part of our strategy and medium term target set.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the balance sheet. Firstly, gearing sits at 8.1% at the end of the quarter. That compares with 10% at the end of the first quarter, continuing to move lower in the zero to 30% range. Now you would expect this in the oil price; even though it came down, still above $100. We continue and intend to continue paying competitive and affordable dividends. We've got a great track record on dividends, and they are our main route to return cash to yourselves, the shareholders.</p>
          <p>You can see the spending levels for the first half of 2012 on the slide here: $11 billion on a net basis deducting the divestments, but including $1 billion so far this year approximately for acreage acquisitions, some of which were on the slide that Peter used earlier. Now we are on track to spend around $32 billion this year of organic spending. You can see investment picking up on the projects that we have under construction, 24 major Upstream projects, Peter had on the map. We invested $8 billion in the quarter. We're on a burn rate for $32 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>We will see some further buildup in the spending run rate in the second half given the project flow. And as Peter noted, we're moving from a period of bringing acreage in, from an exploration perspective, to drilling it, particularly areas, of course, French Guiana and Alaska. And we expect to invest about $1 billion this year on Alaska. And we've now effectively absorbed that amount into the $32 billion capital investment outlook.</p>
          <p>We're doing well on divestments. We've reached our $4 billion target for the full year in the first half of the year. I do expect more to come on the divestment side, but we'll update you on that as we go forward.</p>
          <p>So that's where we're on the finances overall. We're improving the cash flow both from the macro, but also, more importantly, from the project flow. We have a competitive payout picture, and we are showing good progress on the current investment program.</p>
          <p>Peter, back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. So let me just summarize before we go into the questions. Our performance in the quarter underlines that we're delivering on our strategy. We are making good progress with our strategic themes: that's performance focus, growth delivery and maturing new growth options. Canada and Qatar are in the delivery phase and we have diversified our development portfolio for the next tranche of work. We're working hard to generate more choice in our pre-FID option set, to get the best balance of risk and reward for shareholders. And this is all coming through in our results, improving financial performance and new projects for the future. Shell adds value through innovative technology, sustainable growth, integration across the value chain and by creating long life returns for shareholders. And this is competitive and an innovative strategy.</p>
          <p>With that let's take your questions. I think we would start of here in the room. I would say, ask two max at the beginning. If we have time, we go around a little bit more and then we also go on to the web from time-to-time. Getting it organized. Okay, Irene?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Irene Himona, Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale. I had two questions, please. So Peter you referred to a multibillion dollar opportunity from improving the operational reliability of the assets. Indeed, you had an incident this quarter at Port Arthur. You had an incident in Singapore last quarter I think, the U.S. refining has been in some trouble for a number of years. There seems to be a systemic issue and I guess, the question is do we know what the key cause is and when you referred to the multibillion dollar opportunity. How can we quantify or think about that?</p>
          <p>My second question was on exploration. You highlighted a large number of prospects that you're drilling in the second half. Could we perhaps focus on the Chinese shale gas opportunity? You have made some discoveries. You sound quite excited about that. How can we think about the timeframe of commercializing that? And also longer term, the potential impact of that on your LNG business. I'm thinking here about the threat to the oil price linking your Asian LNG contracts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks for your questions. I think, I take the LNG and I'll take the first one. And Simon is working with me on China, he can take the shale gas one. On your first question, I have to &#x2013; in a very strong way pushback on your word systematic because we're running a big refinery system and you can have incidents. The important thing is actually that, you, A) learn out to it, you know what it is and you make absolutely clear that, over the years you're actually improving your operational, your asset, your safety and your integrity performance. We've worked very hard on that the last six years to eight years. And we have clearly improved and all of our stats which we also make available in our sustainability report, they're all trending in the right directions, which is a strong improvement over the last 10 years.</p>
          <p>Safety and asset integrity are key components of our culture in Shell and I'm very proud that with all the optimization which we've done on the continuous improvement, the piece which we have excluded is safety environment and this asset integrity. We have spent more than $6 billion over the last few years to improve our asset integrity. So whilst we don't like incidents like that they were happening in normal operations, so not as part of the start-up and obviously, we're learning out of them and we'll deal with the issues.</p>
          <p>The continuous improvement is a sum of a lot of different project and initiatives and they're not only here to actually lower the cost. That will be the wrong description for that. What they actually generate is more value for the longer term. Some of them bring you an optimized cost basis and that goes into the billion. If you look at our base costs, apart from the increased production and the increased fees which we have, we are still seeing continuous cost take out across the organization. We also see a lot of initiatives coming into improve actually in the longer term the way we can deliver values.</p>
          <p>So this is a program which will, in my opinion never stop, that's why it's called continuous improvement, because we always work on it. And it's always driven &#x2013; at the beginning at least it's driven from top down, but is over time it's driven by the organization itself, because it becomes part of your culture.</p>
          <p>On the second one, I start with the macro-picture on the LNG and then actually, Simon, can give the details. On the LNG forecast, which we see across the world and specifically in Asia, we see a kind of a doubling of the LNG consumption between now and 2013. This is driven, a lot is driven by China but also by other countries who are now starting to import LNG. Most of these countries, we still have a very low percentage of actually gas in their energy mix, so there is quite a huge potential there still. And in China itself, there's only 4% in the energy mix is gas at the moment. And I think the more domestic gas we actually find, the more we will see a switch from other energy sources into gas and into LNG. So we don't see actually the demand slowing down.</p>
          <p>Now let me also just be clear on this discussion about oil price linked or not linked. I think the market at the end will determine the price. And if you take a three year or let's take $4 Henry Hub that gives you $11, $12 landed in Tokyo. If you're not in the spot market dealing at the movement which is $14, $15 in a normal price environment there is actually not much of a difference between an oil price linked, what they call and a Henry Hub delivered into Asia. I think the customers in Asia, they're very keen on long-term reliable supply. And if they actually get the LNG from big infrastructure projects like an LNG plant that's actually what they want and what they look for. And therefore I think you will have a return for those who build these things and that's expressed at the moment in an oil price linked type of formula because what we are replacing is mainly oil exposure in industrial oil and hence actually to have the same formula for them is quite interesting. I think we should change our talk and really start to talk about gas prices landed in Asia and then even a cheaper Henry Hub is actually no longer that far away. And I think that's the way you approach it. And then the other thing is how we're actually optimizing the gas in North America and we can talk about that later. There is plenty to be done there. Some results from China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. This is strategic play, so I'll talk about maybe the overall picture and then specific results. Few years ago, the first development, Changbei, we got up and running with PetroChina. As a result of that good relationship, good operational performance, safety environment we have developed a series of further opportunities within China, initially with PetroChina but you will have seen, hopefully yesterday's press release, we announced a great deal with CNOOC, which are obviously offshore deals, one in China and one in Gabon. So Changbei was our first, yesterday we announced an extension of the, the nature of the license in Changbei and not just in time but in scope. So additional barrels, different development horizons that will build out potentially additional resources and additional production from our existing main operated activity. Couple of years ago, we started to look at the onshore tight gas and shale gas activities. As Peter says, the two of us spend quite a bit of time on aeroplanes to Beijing.</p>
          <p>There are now several plays in our portfolio with PetroChina. We have two in Sichuan province in the south, south-west and we have mainly CBM opportunities in the north in inner Mongolia and Shaanxi province. We are drilling. We spent last year around $450 million, this year we're over $500 million. We're drilling about &#x2013; could get close to 20 wells this year. It's still very much exploration appraisal. So we're not doing pad drilling, it's single well from a pad, looking at what is the scale, what is the nature of the reservoir, what will be the cost to develop, what would an appropriate development plan. It's looking like it will be into next year, probably towards the middle of next year before we really have a good feel, particularly on the two Sichuan developments as to what is the appropriate commercial development program.</p>
          <p>So far, we've had a range of outcomes on wells good, bad, some interesting not quite what was expected but usually in that sense better than expected. We don't know yet the full answer to your question. In a year's time we will. We'll share it as we go forward. There is definitely great potential there. It's a question of how to make it economic. We've not stopped looking for further acreage even. There are several other opportunities in the country and including potentially wet or more liquids oriented opportunities. And if we're able to achieve mature those, we'll tell you about it.</p>

          <p>Afternoon. Theepan Jothilingam, Nomura. Two questions please. Firstly, just focusing on the Gulf of Mexico. I was wondering whether you could just give us a view on the short-term profile there. And then clearly you're making a lot of progress on exploration with Vito and Appo. What's the aspiration in terms of sort of production level, sort of towards 2017, 2018?</p>
          <p>And then I guess there still remains a perception that sort of your short to medium term growth options are biased to Australia. I was wondering is there a case to reduce that exposure or how do you go about mitigating the risk on the cost inflation or project execution risk? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Thanks, Theepan. I will start with Australia. In the meantime you can think about the Gulf. On Australia, indeed, there is no doubt about cost pressure in the country. Now we are active in Gorgon as you may know. We're still active in the sense we are shareholder there. And we're driving Prelude at the moment, Pluto through Woodside just came on stream. I think we are quite immune in that sense on the cost pressure on the Prelude side, because that's being constructed in Korea and therefore we are not exposed to the labor costs actually in Australia. It will be anchored offshore et cetera. On the other two, they're operated by Chevron, so I guess you need to ask them in terms of the cost pressure et cetera. I would just say from our side, what we have in our plans and what we present to you that should actually cover that.</p>
          <p>Then comes the next wave. Now the next wave on the one side we had is Arrow, where we took a very deliberate decision to actually not rush Arrow through. We saw the other three projects coming in. The prices were going up, labor costs were going up and hence we took a decision to, A) it's also new to us. We want to learn it properly to actually and we have our Chinese partner. So we're actually taking efforts, so we're preparing FID. We're looking at how to procure how much we &#x2013; how we can actually optimize the use of our wells management joint-venture which we have with the Chinese, how much we can do in module design later on. So what we're trying to do is really to work. How we have done it in Canada a few years ago when the cost exploded there, how we can actually work in a smarter way to keep the costs better under control.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (40:10) we have Sunrise coming as well. I think that's early. We're in the phase looking at the cost, so we'll see where they go and what solutions we have there. So one of the strategic reasons why I'm quite keen to have options in the portfolio is also I don't want to get pushed into the wrong development at the wrong time. Now Australia has obviously some advantages, because you may actually delay it which you may not do in other countries because you have permits expiring et cetera, et cetera. So really having a rich funnel early on in your maturation pipeline is something which you're aiming at will be then pulled through that funnel and develop the molecules and the plant. That's obviously, that's where you can't stop and that's where you have to be sure, you have the right profitability with the right costs et cetera, et cetera.</p>
          <p>In Arrow, when we heard that, for example, one of the suppliers is the EPC contractor for all the three and is promising us the fourth A team, then we get very suspicious because you normally don't get four A teams; you may get one and then you pay the price for the rest. So we're trying to read all of this and slow down where we have to slow down. So Australia is a key component for our growth, but we will not overdo it <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:32) we are actually not getting the right profitability out of it. The Gulf?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Gulf of Mexico is in the context of deepwater overall, the constraining factor is basically rigs, how many rigs can you operate safely and cost effectively. A year ago we were operating 12 rigs, we're heading towards by the end of this year's 16 rigs. This is a global number. And we're bringing on stream some new rigs part owned or tenure leased by Shell, that are so far performing extremely well early on in their lifecycle. At the moment six of those rigs are in the Gulf, one's in French Guiana, one's in Brazil and the rest are elsewhere. By the end of the year, we'd 8 eight floating rigs, 4 platform rigs potentially operating in the Gulf, so 11 or 12 drilling operations in the Gulf. So significant setup obviously compared to where we were at the moratorium, but even compared to before the moratorium. We've just had Caesar Tonga come on stream. We have Mars B going very well. That was one of pictures that Peter showed in terms of construction. Our production in the second quarter is about 180,000 barrel a day. Now that's a low point, is a low point for two reasons, one, we are in project as we turned the corner post moratorium effects but we've had a lot of down time in term of the quarter itself.</p>
          <p>Going forward, we'll have less downtime and we will continue to turn the corner because Ceaser Tonga is on. We're drilling the infill wells around Ursa, around Mars. And Perdido is still in a ramp up phase. So it will flow forward with growth. Mars B is the next big boost coming on in couple of years time. That will then be supplemented by Vito, Appomattox and Stones. Vito and Appo get bigger every time, we look at them. So to be honest the FID has got a little bit further out but for good reasons. We're trying to work the most appropriate development concept, how big a facility do we need to work. And the same is true at Stones, so which one gets to FID first, not sure could be Stones even. But over time, from that 180 sort of minimum, we should do considerable growth just in the Gulf of Mexico, but those projects will have to compete, we hope, with French Guiana. We're doing appraisal in Brazil, and one or two of the other deepwater activities around the world. So our limit is going to be number of rigs and how we choose to use them.</p>
          <p>But so far some good progress this year and hopefully some exciting news to come later in the year. It's one of those rigs that's on its way to Alaska of course.</p>

          <p>Iain Reid from Jefferies. Couple of questions about your North American gas assets. We started to see some companies write down the value of dry gas assets in the U.S. And I'm just wondering how comfortable you feel about your carrying values, given the acquisitions you've made in the past that future gas prices you see on the screen?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on LNG export, there's quite a big queue of proposed facilities in advance of anything you might put in there. And if you add up the numbers, you get quite a big number in terms of what could be exported from the U.S. I wonder how much comfort you'd have from the U.S. government about if you go in there, the tail end of this, whether you'll get approval for an LNG export scheme of whatever magnitude you're thinking of, to deliver few years down the line. What's the U.S. government thinking about this because obviously you don't want to go ahead if you don't really going to have the capacity approved?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I take second, you take the carrying value one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The question's really about the carrying value of the North American gas assets that we've acquired over the past few years and we talked about $17 billion. It's a bit more than that now. We've been investing further in them on the 40 TCF asset base. We do an impairment review, value erosion review every third quarter. So we're about to enter this year's program. We've been using $4 to $6 for that the same way that we talk about investment decisions that we make. Last year everything was fine. What will change this year is not so much the pricing outlook I suspect, it's what's the drilling program outlook. Because we shifted the drilling now 20 rigs onshore in North America now on liquid rich activity, it was I think five or six a year ago and that's halved the gas drilling activity. We're doing very little for example in Wyoming or in Louisiana at the moment. Only gas drilling is in Canada and Marcellus. I don't know what the outcome will be. We'll just do the normal work, looking forward long-term gas prices for the Q3 results and we'll let you know at the time. But I can tell you that in the second quarter, despite the current gas prices all our basins are actually operating on a cash positive basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the export opportunities, first of all as you now, we're working on Canada so that we are optimistic there, so that's clearly moving in the right direction for the 12 million tones. And we signed up a pipeline builder et cetera, et cetera. So with our partners we are progressing there. It still has to go through permitting processes and that takes some time. So FID is not going to be tomorrow it will take its time.</p>
          <p>If we then move southwards I think the base assumption here is there will be LNG in export. The question then is how much. If I take it from a very strategic point of view, I think you will see in North America, specifically in the U.S. that they have got an energy situation now which could bring them pretty close to energy independence over the next 20 years, if the Gulf, if Alaska, if liquids rich shale, if the gas actually takes off and is kept in the country, replacement of coal driven power generation through gas et cetera, et cetera. But on top of it, it could also actually bring a lot of manufacturing industries back into the county, petrochemical industries back into the country because you have a cheap source of feedstock, and that all equals jobs and revenues in the U.S. So I think, whoever is in charge of the energy policy, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:19) you will get in the U.S., <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:20) get also one in Europe at one stage, will look at this as on the one side as a pure energy policy but on the other side also about jobs and revenues and actually having, let's say, industries back home.</p>
          <p>So therefore, I think, you could think of a very high number of LNG exports. I think the market will actually drive the right number at the end from a export point of view on the gas side, but also from a demand point of few inside the country. Governments will give you most probably incentive schemes, tax incentive schemes to invest in the United States. So therefore I think there will be a natural kind of cap most probably not enforced by the government, but because of measures they take, it will get to one.</p>
          <p>Therefore I think, I would agree with you, if you have got 10 or 20 in the pipeline, you most probably need to be in the earlier half rather than in the second half in order to have some certainty of that. Now we are working on LNG projects also in the United States. We will inform about that going forward. But we are looking at that, and I'll make it to you very clear, we are looking at that not just somewhere in the country but also at the Gulf Coast. And we're looking at whatever opportunities we have there, and we'll see how we can actually link that into our very well developed gas chain strategy, which we are pursuing with LNG in transport to liquids, to chemicals, LNG export, and we'll then determine how we move actually molecules around.

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Two questions, one on the Upstream, one on the Downstream. On the Downstream, I know, you've done an awful lot of work in the restructuring of the business, buying, selling and improving refineries, in particular. But you just don't seem to be getting a huge amount of leverage in terms of your earnings or your unit earnings. Is that a fair observation? And if it is, what are the moving parts going forward that you think will restore both earnings and cash flow to something more acceptable?</p>
          <p>And the second is just on your U.S. Upstream earnings. Can you give a bit more insight into the moving parts that drove what looks like a very low earning figure this time around? I take the point about low levels of Gulf of Mexico production, but can you just go into bit more detail about what's happening there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon for the questions. I give the Upstream to Simon, and I will handle then the Downstream. Upstream first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jon for the question. The Upstream earnings were impacted by a series of relatively small things, some of which are one-off, some of which are short to medium term, and some of which potentially long term issues, all working in the wrong direction in the given quarter, some of which were already flagged into the markets. I'll start with some of the short term one-offs. The production maintenance that we talk about was primarily in the U.S. It was on oil projects, and it was in a period where obviously margins would have been good.</p>
          <p>Some shorter term impacts, we see in Canada oil being produced, but they realized bitumen and synthetic crude post upgrading prices. The bitumen was about $65 and the synthetic crude about $80. So an additional discount to WTI of around $15, and that's widened from more like $5 a year ago. Some of that is a short term issue, some logistics constraints in the Chicago area, getting that crude out of Canada and into a refining network. And some of it is a medium-term issue because its WTI linked, but long term, it's less of an issue because those distribution systems will even themselves out.</p>
          <p>We did see increased depreciation in the quarter. A significant amount of this is to be expected. It's new production coming on stream, for example in the Gulf. And early on in a project, particularly deepwater project, you do see higher unit cost depreciation. That unit depreciation goes down as you prove up more reserves as data on the reservoir comes through. The same happens onshore. It's not too dissimilar; it's just a lot more wells. Smaller numbers, but they add up to material impact. We are moving those rigs from gas to liquids rich shale. We're therefore not proving up as much reserve in the gas activities as we might have hoped to at pace. And that has led to high unit depreciation, not only on the gas, but also on the early liquids production. So you're seeing probably for the next year or two high unit depreciation until that settles out, as we recognize more reserves through more drilling in the basins we focus on.</p>
          <p>We've then got more exploration and more feasibility expense, more seismic expense and more feasibility expense on the project. Peter just talked about LNG, GTL, gas to chemicals; you can't do the study and the design work without spending some money. That's all coming through in the same quarter. It's not one off. It won't go away, but it is good leading to future opportunity. So a combination of all of those things, and if each only take $50 million, $100 million out relative to expectations, that's what leads to the results you see. So fundamentally, it's a cash positive business. You can see the cash flow coming through &#x2013; and it is a business in a strategic transition. It was a quarter in which most of the wind blew in the wrong direction. Hopefully that helps, Jon. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Simon. On the Downstream, we have worked on the Downstream over the last few years in order to get to a portfolio which we see as a portfolio to go forward. That included significant downscaling of refineries, so we sold significant barrels there or we closed them and changed them into depots. Some are still in the making, and we have talked about them. Some will change over the next 12 months to 24 months or 30 months. We have also significantly actually purified our marketing portfolio, sold out of smaller countries where we have no economy of scale in order to actually take costs out and capital out.</p>
          <p>So I think we have the portfolio now that is still the real driver on continuous improvement because we need to bring now some of the assets back up to top quartile performance. That's where the focus is at this stage. And that in itself, also then takes costs out. And we have seen for example, when you look at some benchmarking from the market, which we see in the refining business is pretty much benchmarked, that we are actually now, our operating costs, we are now getting closer and closer to the first quartile. So that is all there. If I take the marketing and the trading business, quite clearly the trading is really linked to the refining business. I personally don't look at the refining business in isolation. I look at the chain, including trading, including our fuels B2B business and our retail business, that's where the molecules are going and therefore we look at that strand.</p>
          <p>Now if you take that integrated value chain, quite clearly in the second quarter, we saw that, compared to last year's second quarter, where there was a lot of volatility in the oil market, in the product market because of Libya for example, this was different this year. Therefore we added less value by using our refinery molecules into the system. We had, obviously, a decreasing pricing environment. Whilst we kept prices, the volume at the same time was coming down. So Q2 was a quarter which where we adjusted from a high to a lower oil price with not a lot of volatility around it from a trading point of view.</p>
          <p>So going forward, this is not about reshaping the portfolio more. It is actually operating at a top quartile performance in order actually to get our performance in line with where we want to be, where we actually can generate the necessary returns and the cash flow. Now on the cash flow side, that's the piece which I don't agree entirely with you that we need to further improve that. If you look back over the last four years or five years, I think the Downstream cash flow is actually the key piece which is underestimated.</p>
          <p>We had most of the time, we had in the billions cash surplus. Downstream was one of the strong contributors actually to the dividends over the last five years, six years, seven years. So this is not about generating even more cash out. Obviously, if we improve our earnings that will have an impact quite clearly, but it's about the operational performance where I'm not entirely satisfied, and the base costs are still being worked and we had good progress in Q2.</p>
          <p>Now the one piece, which you always have to exclude, but I don't take that as an excuse, but just as a number that you know, in the whole refining business, we had some $200 million of foreign exchange, as well, which obviously impacted our refinery results in Q2. But to be very transparent, you benefited on the cost side and the marketing side, because you had a weaker euro, and therefore, we have a lot of euro costs that helps us actually in that sense. So this is not a construction site which we need to change. This is about having the right portfolio and working the operational excellence into the portfolio.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good day, gentleman. I just wanted to ask you a bit about the CapEx. If I understand correctly the $32 billion previously did not include the extra billion of potential for Alaska. Now I think you said, it does include the Alaska. So my question is, is it accurate and what has moved out to make room for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question. I think it's correct, your understanding, it's now $32 billion with the $1 billion. I would just say, we were doing more or less the same activities. There is maybe some rephasing in it, not the bulk of it. But we're clearly also seeing some impacts through our exercises and through our initiatives, which we're doing in actually getting some of our procured cost down. We have a very strong drive there and in all of our enterprise framework agreements where we actually procuring costs from our suppliers. We sign hundreds of them and actually we got between 10% and 25%, 30% lower prices or discounts on it. That's in a way also flowing back in. And then as I said, some deformities also happening and you may remember last year, we had a very strong rephasing from 2011 into 2012. And there also most probably we assume something similar to happen this year and that's, not entirely the case. Lucas?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Simon, can I just come back to the Americas and two questions. The first goes back to the statement you made, when you &#x2013; when we went to Canada in 2010, you talked about production in the region could reach 1 million barrels a day and you talked about the intent to invest potentially $40 billion over the 2011 through 2014 period. Now I can see the $40 billion going in, $15 billion has gone over the last year and a half. So you're in line there, but I just wondered how you felt about the million or the approaching million barrel a day status?</p>
          <p>And secondly, going back to Jon's question, if I look at the capital that you've now got wrapped up in the Americas in total, it looks like it's about $85 billion, $90 billion capital employed on which even if I start adding back, the numbers you're talking around this quarter, I'm looking at something like maybe $2 billion to 2 and a bit billion or so of net income. How do you give me confidence that the returns in that business are actually going to move to anything near respectable, because it's not the way things appear today? And I hear what you say on cash and cash flow, the problem is I can't see the cash flow numbers on the Americas Upstream, I just get the two lumped together. So I guess the question's twofold, firstly CapEx is going in but the production barrels actually and effectively cash coming out and two, is just the volume of capital in and the absence of profit that's coming out and when does that actually turnaround?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was going to pass it back to on this one. Thank you, Lucas. Thank you for reminding us of the previous statement. I can't confirm all your numbers but you're not far out in terms of the &#x2013; certainly what we had said in the past that the capital employed is very significant part of the total 210. Therefore the current return on capital is somewhat lower than we might seek. We knew this was going to be the case because of the nature of the investment program. And I'll start at the end, CFFO transparency in the quarter just over $1 billion came out of Upstream Americas, excluding working capital, bit less than in the first quarter. And that's &#x2013; that's a quarterly number, so second quarter number and will presumably increase given that all the one-off factors I previously referred to.</p>
          <p>Upstream Americas you have to think of it as not one business, each of the different activities has different profile. The heavy oil is now solidly profitable, solidly cash generative. And the return on capital is okay, it can improve some of the programs Peter talked about. But it is improving. Unit cost of $10 a barrel lower today than they were a year ago. So we're down below $40. We're at benchmark top quartile levels in that mining activity. We've got debottlenecking opportunities. We have opportunities to the steam assisted Carmon Creek to grow. But we won't be putting a lot of capital into that business relative to the rest.</p>
          <p>The deepwater business just talked about will hit low hopefully at 180. That has significant growth potential from the things I talked about. Again it's solidly profitable, good returns, high oil price up side. So the issue is not everything across the Americas, it's primarily the onshore activity. That was also the main driver of the production target. So in the two areas I talked about heavy oil in Gulf of Mexico deepwater and Brazil as well, which also fits the Gulf of Mexico profile, we're pretty much on target for what we said in 2010. The big difference is onshore, gas, and liquids rich shales. And in fact, liquids rich shales didn't really feature in the discussion back in 2010.</p>
          <p>So we've cut back, I would say, we were planning by now 50 to 60 rigs on gas drilling alone on rapid development of gas. We've now dropped below 20 and then &#x2013; and even in that, there's less of it going into development than still on to appraisal, which is preparation for a recovery in gas prices, no point in producing now, if you can prepare, sit on and produce in the future. So our actual level of activity is about a quarter of what we expected in the gas. But the molecules are still there. Most of them are in Marcellus and Western Canada and the breakeven there is at or heading towards $3 economic breakeven, cash breakeven is more like $1.50 once you're up and running.</p>
          <p>To switch to liquids rich shales, now we're in immature basins relatively other than Eagle Ford. So we're up about 10,000 barrel a day production there now, but it will take some time to come through. We'll only see momentum there in 2013. How much momentum will depend on how successful the exploration appraisal work that we're doing. And most of the basins were named on the earlier exploration sheet but basically it's in Western Canada, in or around Duvernay and the Canadian piece of the Bakken, it's in Mississippi Lime, in Kansas, in the Utica and in Eagle Ford in the United States. We will have drilling later this year in the Neuqu&#xE9;n in Argentina and the Vaca Muerta play. And in general on gas and drilling activity, we've also shifted some emphasis outside the U.S. So Ukraine, China, South Africa, the big gas players is where we may well and we've only got so many drilling engineers as well so it will be less in the U.S. it will be more developing.</p>
          <p>So, whether the 1 million barrels a day will get delivered at the same time is a moot question. Whether we deliver very significant growth around the world from a combination of that which is in the Americas and unconventional activity globally, I think very much on track. In fact the portfolio is a lot stronger than it was two years ago. We would expect to see returns in the Americas overall continue to carry the weight of that capital employed for some time there. Little we can do other than write off huge amounts and that's not in the plan. But it is between now and the end of the decade, it's the primary engine of growth for this company and I haven't even mentioned French Guiana and Alaska, both of which could potentially absorb capital, but be looking at production by the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>It's Alastair Syme from Citigroup. Can I &#x2013; I'm probably just asking actually quite a similar question. If you look at the $50 billion of cash flow. I know I'm sort of giving you round numbers 2012 through 2015 at $100 oil and you try and sensitize that for sort of $3 gas and $15 Canadian discounts. Is there a big delta that we need to be building into our assumptions because we're kind of at $39 billion today? So I'm trying to reconcile those numbers in my head.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The $39 billion, yeah, thanks Alastair. The $39 billion is a 12 month period, in which we're still ramping up. Gas, there is a sensitivity, but it's not many, many billions. And deepwater Gulf of Mexico is probably much more significant in terms of will we or won't we deliver the projects we spoke about earlier. The Canadian one it depends how sustainable those discounts prove to be. We expect logistical constraints to progressively be removed and we're taking part in some of those whether it's reversal of pipelines in the U.S. or the construction of new pipelines from Canada further south. So by the middle of the decade we'd expect that all the discounts to have compressed. Question is how quickly will they compress. And it's not hugely material factor, but it's one we need to manage carefully. Peter, I don't know if there's anything else you would?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think more in a general way, we have the $200 billion or if you divide by four then you have a rough number at $50. We have clearly said that from a gas point of view, we would expect to be in the range of 4 to 6 somewhere in 2015. That may not happen that's what Simon just said. And where the refinery margins will be, we will see by then. But I don't think &#x2013; I would still say we're on track to deliver that. There are some challenges in there, but that's fine but we are on the way to deliver this. And as you know cash flow is the key target, which we have across the company and that's where the focus is. So we are on these targets, some challenges that we are exactly two quarters in at the moment. So there is another few years to come.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thanks for taking my question. Two if I may? Can you confirm that you are pursuing the position in Shtokman? And if so what it is that you find attractive about that asset or the potential role in its development?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on East Africa, I appreciate your comments on the capital discipline showed by withdrawing from Cove, but do you still see a material position for Shell in the current discoveries offshore Mozambique or otherwise in that region via M&amp;A or maybe even organic pursuit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much Jason. I take both of them. Russia, we delivered so far the only subarctic LNG play. We are very happy with Sakhalin. It's going very well, producing more and generating more cash. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (71:32) with Gazprom and our Japanese partners. We also have Salym producing, that's also with Gazprom Neft now. And we have been very open that we would not be against further investments in some projects where Shell can add value. There are various ways of doing that, and therefore we always look at options. But I guess as you would expect, I will not confirm the questions regarding Shtokman. I will confirm that we are interested in further investing in Russia and recent changes in the tax systems or in the tax schemes either Arctic or tight oil or tight gas. And that's obviously gives some more leverage, some more opportunities. And the clear drive from the President Putin to more investments in Russia may also open up some avenues.</p>
          <p>So interested, but &#x2013; and this is more or less the same answer as for East Africa -- we have a very rich portfolio. We have plenty of projects in the pipeline either under construction or in the pre-FID state. They all &#x2013; whatever we do in the future has to compete against those. And then we will either bring them in and kick something else out, or we may actually develop some of it later on, as I have said. And the same would apply for Russian projects like in East Africa. Let me first say in East Africa, we have, not in Mozambique, but in Tanzania we have some organic plays, which we are obviously that's on the exploration side, is also on the map which we have shown. So that's one avenue.</p>
          <p>In totality, the LNG projects which we have across the world, if I start to list them, you will see that we have plenty of them. So we already talked about those in Australia number, Canada we talked, we also have obviously in Indonesia we have Abadi. So there is plenty of things already, and plenty of things, which we are still evaluating. Now East Africa is an interesting province. It's a big resource, needs obviously skills, which can do Upstream, Midstream and Downstream; therefore is an interesting environment but the valuation has to be right, and that's what where we took a view on Cove. We took a view on the valuation but we also took a view on the process itself, and therefore we will look at other opportunities if they come along. And if not, I think we have a rich portfolio already so we'll see what we do. Any questions inside now. I said back there first and then there is one, I think more on the right.</p>

          <p>Hi. It's Hootan Yazhari from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just coming back to your U.S. business. There's much talk of shifting the focus. as many people have. away from dry gas to liquids rich acreage. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of talk about how NGL liquids are really suffering on the pricing side. and realizations there continue to come down. I mean is there any chance of this derailing your plans or indeed pushing you towards more capital intensive moves down there, to actually really realize value from that portfolio as in moving more into petrochemicals, more into GTL, more into sort of LNG distribution onshore, anything like that. I mean, love to hear your thoughts on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for the question. Quite clearly, the way I would describe our strategy at the moment is: we have got some liquids rich shale but we have a lot of gas and we have got the stuff which is in between. What we're looking is actually to change the exposure we have to some cheap prices into exposure higher up the value chain. And there you have got various ways of doing that. And we are firmly already in the business of pushing LNG into transport. And in Canada, we are doing that in the U.S. and by the way we do the same starting in China, we are starting in Europe on the same. So that's a business model which is coming, which really brings Upstream and Downstream together, because you need the customers on the one side, because we know them from the retail business and from the B2B business and you bring them together with Upstream. So that's really taking advantage of the differential between Henry Hub and diesel at the end of the day. That's one, so we're driving that.</p>
          <p>And the same in that similar area is actually for shipping. So we're running bigger projects already in other parts not in North America, but we are also looking into that at the moment, where the shipping industry will replace diesel engines with LNG &#x2013; with gas engines, so that's another area.</p>
          <p>Then the next one which we're looking into in Pennsylvania is to take that gas into chemicals. So this is clearly a cracking route which gives us higher exposure from a value point of view. We are looking into that, and we are &#x2013; have identified a site, now it is the scoping exercise, et cetera.</p>
          <p>The next one, we talked already which will be LNG export and LNG consumption in other areas inside the U.S. And then the last one will be gas-to-liquids. That's what we just built in Qatar; can we do the same in the U.S., where would we do it, how big it will be, how are the economics, how expensive will be building something like this, because one of the issues you have always in the U.S. now, it could lead to a cost explosion, let's say, for example, around the coast, because everything has been built there. And therefore we take a view on that and we will also take a view on how we time this.</p>
          <p>But clearly a strategy to get the cheap feedstock into something more value adding is something which plays to our strength, because we are an integrated company, we can develop these things. So that's were a lot of effort is being spent at the moment to figure out in how we want to use the molecules which we have or the resources in the ground, how we want to use them, how much we want, for example, to buy from the market rather than use our equities. These are all the things which we are thinking about at the moment.</p>
          <p>And we will let you all know the way we develop this, but we have got, as Simon said, already quite a sizable team now in the U.S. looking at that. There was one hand somewhere here, and I'll come back to you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Neill Morton of Berenberg. Two Upstream questions; the first on East Africa, the second on the big three projects. Almost forgotten that, how could I? You recently introduced the concept of net CapEx, selling assets to buy assets. When you were bidding for Cove, I think you actually linked it to the decision to sort of farm down at Prelude to balance the cash in, cash out. Given the fact that, I think, the cost of entry into East Africa is likely to be in the several billions of dollars, do you envisage offsetting that in your disposals? Do you &#x2013; would you envisage using the balance sheet to build the position there or are you agnostic?</p>
          <p>And the second question on the big three, is that, you said, you mentioned it was 360 in Q1, Q2 and Q3, when do you envisage the combined projects reaching plateau? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think on, the first one really goes into portfolio management and you're using Prelude as an example, and we brought INPEX for example in to Prelude, and INPEX brought us in to Abadi in Indonesia. Both are floating LNG developments, most probably you can add one-on-one to get why this has happened. And so clearly, we are looking at these type of things.</p>
          <p>I said before we sold some $12 billion of assets, where we made six as acquisitions, but I said, we cannot always think that we will match this all the time one to one. But it is clearly a strategic thinking here, and this is &#x2013; when Simon and I discuss these type of proposals with the businesses, they always &#x2013; when they come up with more CapEx, they know, especially on acquisitions, they already know we better bring something which we also can sell because there is a dimension here that you just don't want to increase and let's say your human capital you're spending in all these projects, there is a limit how much you can do. There is a limit from a financial framework point of view. There is a capital discipline which you want to maintain, you don't want to spread yourself too much around. So that all comes together. But I don't want you to walk out of here and say they will always match the two. They are &#x2013; over time, you may have seen, we make go a little bit long for two years and then we go long on the other side for two years, but there is certainly a portfolio optimization game here happening.</p>
          <p>On your other question, quite clearly, we gave you an outlook into Q3, which the maintenance, which we are doing in Pearl to adjust completely the two trains and actually take full advantage of the slate of products which we can run, now as we've proven all the technologies we have ramped up. And my expectation is that that is pretty much done during the third quarter, so we should hopefully by then kind of go into the fourth quarter and get after the run rates we are aiming at.</p>
          <p>Now, you have to be careful on the oil sands, because in oil sands there is always a capacity issue depending on which ore grades you're actually digging through in your oil sands and that's why we normally say that's the capacity you can reach depending on what oil percentage you have there. But there we are talking about a few thousand barrels rather than 100,000 barrels. So I think in second half of this year we'll see all of these three projects then becoming really and fully operational and we will optimize the products later on an ongoing basis.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Hello. It's Martijn Rats of Morgan Stanley. The last time we were in this room, we all had a lot of questions, why the dividends didn't go up more then, now, it went. And I think it's fair to say you expressed some caution and conservatism. Now we're having a quarter where Simon runs us through a list of a few things that sort of well sort of seem to going against the result. And it sort of makes you wonder whether sort of back six months ago, you were already thinking about perhaps some specific things that you might need to face during the year, where you might already think, there's always something that we need to anticipate. I was just wondering if sort of in retrospect you can sort of comment on how that discussion went and how you seen sort of that specific aspect going forward?</p>
          <p>And out of that I have one more smaller question. There seems to be a few headlines on discussions with InterOil in Papua New Guinea, I was wondering if you sort of elaborate on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. I think as it is dividend, they both go to Simon, but let me also to say something from &#x2013; we're both in the board, the discussions with the board are very simple, there on dividends. They are long-term and we have a policy and we take a long term view. So short term macroeconomic assumptions do normally not play a big role, because we really take long-term views. But it is true when we had the first quarter, I was not very optimistic on the economy and I was very clear that I see the world going into a slow down and that has happened.</p>
          <p>Now on your second point, which is do you foresee some changes all the time? No, we don't, but we also emphasize in a very strong way quarterly results and Simon said in his part, there is snapshot and we have this interesting situations with this dividend from this LNG joint venture. If that comes in two days earlier or later does it really matter to us? No, but and we &#x2013; you can have a big miss in the market and that could be a problem then. So, I think where I sit, I take a through the quarter view, a long term view that's from an operational performance point of view clearly, every month the results need to be delivered. But I can tell you, If you have got more security issues in Nigeria, our production can go more up and down and that can wipe out growth and that's actually not what I want to talk with shareholders, I want to talk how we actually delivered the value in the long term. Now, over to you on Papua New Guinea and the rest of the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably only one thing to add to the dividend. While we don't let the macro drive it entirely, we did have some concerns about where the macro might go six months ago. Peter was on record saying exactly that some time in June I think. Three days later the price dropped $20 to $19. So we thought, if it stays there, dividend will be off the discussion. And so I think the market is more concerned about that linkage than we might be.</p>
          <p>PNG, there is gas. There is an intent for LNG projects from the government. The government we have been talking to for a couple of years now. They announced last year that we're a preferred partner because of the capability they want to bring into the country, large project developers, people who can develop markets and local capability. So yes, we've had discussions with PNG government. We had discussions with InterOil from time to time and I can't say too much about where those discussions are at the moment. Yes, we're interested in project. Yes, it must meet exactly the criteria that Peter laid out to compete with other LNG options. We don't actually know yet whether that would be the case. There is new government election process in progress at the moment in the country. As they commence with that, confirmation of fiscal opportunity and where InterOil fits in the government thinking will enable potentially a project to go ahead there. It is very difficult for us to say more because it's still quite uncertain at the moment. It's an attractive play in the same effective geological trend that we're in Australia and now in Indonesia. So, it's one we think we can add a lot of value to, provided the other conditions are right.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And &#x2013; it's quite a quick update. I think, I've indicated earlier. This is really an issue in the first instance between ourselves and the Dutch Government. It's fiscal constraints as a result of how the company came together in the first place. Unfortunately, I think, since we last stood here, the Dutch Government is no more there. In that period it's taking six months to arrange an election and last time it took six months to arrange a government after the election. So, we are not actually expecting productive discussions on this and the rest of the year. As slightly flippant answer, I think, to be honest the Dutch Government has more serious issues to consider at the current time, whichever of the parties happens to be in power. So it's difficult to see us getting the priority and they are doing a pretty good job in the circumstances.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, good afternoon. Richard Griffith, Oriel Securities. Just coming back to 4 million barrels a day target, you talked about by 2017, 2018. Throughout the course of the afternoon in the Q&amp;A, you've mentioned quite often issues of costs whether it's Australia, reconsidering the FID of some of those big projects. You've mentioned, costs around the Gulf of Mexico, you mentioned rig availability. So at what point does these issues accumulate to a point where your project FIDs then effectively push your target our or it becomes eroded? And the second one is just coming back to the Downstream issue and the improvements of the operational side of it. I mean, how much of this is related to say, a structural issue or an age-related issue and how much are you going to have to spend to get those 1% improvements and availability?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the second one is a very good question and it's really where you, where the machines are, where they are, in which zone and these are obviously historical decisions you have to do. We're very much looking at your point, so the target is not to get every refinery into the first quartile across all the benchmarks. You get them actually there where the current configuration does actually make sense to get to because you cannot just drive everybody out there because in between there might be $1 billion of investment and you will never do that. So you expect some under performance in that sense. But because you want to have it from an integrated way, you want to have it for your marketing assets, you want to have coverage of volume, you accept actually that machine. So I think there is a very sophisticated way, the way we look into it and how we actually approve gross, we call it gross CapEx in the refining system and that has a very high and much higher profitability requirements than most of the other areas, which we have actually in the system compared for some to Upstream et cetera. So that's the way we are trying to steer that.</p>
          <p>Now on the 4 million, I think it goes a little bit back, I always said 4 million is a long-term target that I can mobilize and drive the organization for growth. But we are not chasing just the actual number of barrels. We are chasing the best returns and the cash flow growth. Having said that, we are very keen to having enough options in the pipeline that we can achieve our targets which we have and that we have flexibility if costs go up in Australia and in let's assume for a moment in Canada again that you have got other areas where you actually can push things in. If you go back to the chart, which we have in here, where we are actually during exploration work at the moment, you'll see a vast variety of different countries and different regions which should help us to offset some of that. But you can't really be sure that we are chasing the cash flow growth. But in order to get your engineers out of bed, you also need to little bit have a volume growth but you need to steer in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. It's Rahim Karim from Barclays. Just a quick question on the game changer that is Alaska, a few headlines suggesting that obviously with the ice that drilling might be delayed there and then also a few more inspections required before drilling is allowed to start. I was hoping if you could just give us a sense of when the ultimate deadline if things don't start to go, actually we don't see any activity going ahead in Alaska, whether that's actually an opportunity or not? And just perhaps how long it will take to the first couple of wells to be drilled, when we could expect some results? And if worse comes to worse, you aren't able to drill this year, what your action plan would be and how you might take that forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with the ice, that's the one thing which we don't control too much and normal really season which start mid July in Alaska, this year it's late, so we expect the ice to gone most probably within the next two weeks. And on the permitting sides, on the &#x2013; there's some certification of the containment system, which we are working at the moment, so that's together with the Coast Guard. These has more to do that this is a containment system, which is barrier number four or five and it's the first of its kind which has been build in the world, which stretches is also the Coast Guard a little bit from a permitting certification point of view and we are working together there. So I think we are working our ways through there. So as that is delayed, we have got that time, then I think typically to wind would be &#x2013; it's a little bit shorter on the Chukchi because the ice comes earlier back in that since compared to the Beaufort. That's one thing to consider and then there is also on the Beaufort we have to stop drilling somewhere for when the whale hunting is ongoing, but that's a concession which we made with the local communities.</p>
          <p>So having said all of this, we are aiming for the two wells to be drilled and maybe some others to be prepared for next year. We have already applied for more so that we can actually continue next year to drill. So, we should not go through the same permitting process because we already have applied them. Some of the permits you need to renew yearly. I think we are on the right track. We have done everything, great cooperation resulted regulatory bodies and we are now just getting to the end of the certification and all the rest of the vehicles and I always say to Marvin he is now also the captain of an armada out there because he has more than 30 ships up there and in order to actually drill the two wells which are as you know there's shallow water low-pressure that's actually not the most difficult thing to do but we have all that prepared. And so I think that's how it is working at the moment, drill this year and should drill next year in that sense. It's the thickest ice which we have had for the last 10 years. And that has delayed it somewhat now but otherwise it's going okay.</p>
