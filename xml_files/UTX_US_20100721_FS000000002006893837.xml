        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Christie and good morning everyone. As you saw in the press release this morning, solid results in an improving end market environment. Some key takeaways for the quarter, first, organic revenues grew for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. Secondly, order rates continued to show broad improvement across the business. Third, our relentless focus on cost reduction continues to drive year-over-year margin expansion. And finally, we once again saw strong cash generation this quarter driven by tight control over working capital and CapEx.</p>
          <p>We certainly have seen volatility in the markets over the last three months and there is uncertainty as to the shape of the recovery and the health of the overall global economy. However UTC's strong first half performance along with improving order rates and exceptional cost traction give us confidence to raise our EPS guidance to a range of 4.60 to 4.70 a share. That's up from our previous guidance range of 4.50 to 4.65, even as we expect to face headwind from foreign currency in the second half of the year. EPS is now expected to grow 12 to 14% on revenues of around $54 billion, that's up 2% from 2009.</p>
          <p>Turning to second quarter results, organic revenue growth resumed this quarter at 4%. On the commercial side, Carrier had a very strong quarter with 7% organic growth driven by strength in Transicold and the U.S. residential business. On the aerospace side Sikorsky led the way with growth of 22%. That was driven by the delivery of 66 large helicopters versus 50 in 2009.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.20, and that's up 14%. Net restructuring and one-time items were a charge of $0.12. The most significant actions were at Carrier, related to ongoing portfolio transformation initiatives and overhead cost reduction projects and at Hamilton Sundstrand which continued to advance the low cost sourcing strategy that Alaine articulated back in March.</p>
          <p>Excluding restructuring and one-time items in the second quarter of both 2009 and 2010, EPS increased 9% on 5% higher revenue. Foreign currency was a net benefit of $0.03. That's from the positive impact of currency hedges at Pratt Canada, more than offsetting adverse translation.</p>
          <p>Cost execution was solid across our business resulting in segment margin expansion of 80 basis points to a record 15.7% adjusted for restructuring and one-time items. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion at UTC. Excluding net restructuring charges and one-time items total segment operating profit grew 10% on revenue growth of 5%. Five of the six business units improved margin on an adjusted basis with Carrier, Otis, and Hamilton Sundstrand increasing by over 100 basis points.</p>
          <p>Carrier's portfolio transformation, restructuring, and cost reduction initiatives continue to pay off as they delivered solid conversion on the incremental volume we saw and drove margin expansion of 260 basis points to 12.7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>On slide two on orders, we saw a broad improvement in order rates in the quarter. And we continue to see good growth in the short cycle Carrier and Hamilton Sundstrand industrial businesses. Commercial aerospace aftermarket orders also improved sequentially which is consistent with our expectations for second half growth in those businesses. More importantly orders at our long cycle businesses such as Otis new equipment, Carrier commercial HVAC and Fire &amp; Security also grew year-over-year in the quarter, signs that the worst is behind us.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets continued to do well with particular strength in India and Brazil where combined orders for the commercial business units grew by over 25%. As expected, order growth rates in China have begun to slow from the first quarter levels as compares get more difficult. But overall, orders in China still grew at an 11% rate year-over-year. This is a trend we expect will continue. Difficult compares making year-over-year growth more modest but we still see solid double-digit growth in China in the back half of the year.</p>
          <p>Slide three, in the quarter free cash flow 112% of net income, evidence that we remain focused on constraining working capital even as revenue growth returns. Working capital turns improved to 8.6. That's both a sequential and a year-over-year improvement. And capital expenditures to depreciation was below 70% in the quarter. For the year we continue to expect free cash flow to equal or exceed net income.</p>
          <p>We contributed $200 million in cash and 250 million in UTC stock to our domestic pension plans in the quarter. A prudent action in light of the historically low discount rates we're seeing and the anemic asset returns in the first half of the year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we increased the pace of share repurchase to 650 million in the quarter, taking advantage of an attractive buying opportunity with the shares in the 60s. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $1.15 billion of stock. And for the full year we now expect to spend around $2 billion on share repurchases. That's up from our prior guidance of 1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Acquisition spend in the quarter was 260 million and that was primarily at Otis. Acquisition spend is 2.4 million (sic) [billion] year-to-date and we still expect it to be around 3 billion for the year. So a strong quarter with organic revenue growth and continued focus on cost reduction all of which drove solid earnings growth, margin expansion, and good cash flow.</p>
          <p>I'll come back and talk a little bit more about the back half of 2010 but for now let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the business unit details.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Greg. Turning to page four let me remind you that I will talk to the segment results adjusted for restructuring and nonrecurring items as we usually do. Otis delivered another strong quarter with profits up 3% on a 2% decline in revenues. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points to a record 23.2%.</p>
          <p>Excluding currency, profits grew 4% on 3% lower revenues as a result of ongoing cost reduction programs, as well as strong conversion on manufacturing volume in China and higher service volume globally.</p>
          <p>New equipment revenue was down 10% in the quarter, excluding currency, as plenty new growth in China was offset by declines in most other major markets. Service revenue was up low single-digit with continued growth in the contractual maintenance business and resumption of growth in repair sales.</p>
          <p>New equipment orders in the quarter were up 11% at constant currency with increases in all geographic regions. Orders in China were up low teens, and following a two-year decline, orders in North America rebounded nicely, up around 30%, including a major order for the Los Angeles International Airport.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange benefit in the first half of the year is expected to be more than offset in the second half, with approximately $75 million of FX headwind for the full year at Otis. Based on solid cost traction and recovering volumes, at current exchange rates we expect Otis' full year profit growth to be around $50 million on a low single-digit revenue decline.</p>
          <p>On slide five, Carrier continued its transformation to a high returns business and posted another quarter of very strong margin expansion. Profit grew 25% on flat revenues, resulting in 260 basis points of margin expansion to an operating margin of 12.7%. Organic revenue growth was 7%, the strongest since fourth quarter of 2007. Profit growth was driven by conversion on the strong revenue growth combined with the carryover benefits of aggressive cost reduction and organizational restructuring.</p>
          <p>Q2 shipments of U.S. residential systems were up mid teens year-over-year, and Transicold organic revenues were up over 30%. On a global basis commercial HVAC equipment revenues were down high single-digits.</p>
          <p>Order rates for the quarter continued to improve at constant currency, global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up mid single-digits, Transicold's organic orders were up nearly 40% driven by container and truck trailers orders that were up over 50%. Given Carrier's strong first half performance we are increasing Carrier's profit growth guidance for the year to $250 million plus on mid single-digit organic revenue growth, up from $175 million plus previously.</p>
          <p>UTC Fire &amp; Security delivered operating margin expansion of 100 basis points on 22% higher revenue. Organically, revenues contracted 4% with the product businesses declining slightly and the service and install businesses declining mid single-digits.</p>
          <p>Net acquisitions, primarily GE Security, contributed 25 points of revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Second quarter orders grew at mid single-digit rates, representing the first quarter of organic orders growth since Q2 2008. Backlog increased at a low teens organic rate from the beginning of the year. Orders in the global product businesses and the service and installation business in Asia increased at double-digit rates year-over-year in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 33%, driven by net acquisitions. The profit impact of lower organic revenue was largely offset by the benefits of integration of field operations, restructuring, and cost controls. As a result of the adverse translation impact from a stronger U.S. dollar we now expect F&amp;S revenues to grow high teens and operating profit to be up 200 to $225 million for the full year.</p>
          <p>Turning to aerospace businesses on slide seven, Pratt &amp; Whitney had revenues up 6% in the quarter, including four points from favorable currency conversion at Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada. Large commercial engine and military OEM shipments were significantly higher than prior year while Pratt Canada shipments were down 13%.</p>
          <p>Large commercial engine spares revenues were about flat with the second quarter of 2009 but sequentially better than the first quarter of 2010. Book-to-bill in the quarter was about one. Operating profit was up 2% as the benefits of favorable foreign currency at Pratt Canada and higher military OEM shipments more than offset higher E&amp;D and the impact of lower Pratt Canada shipments. Operating margin at 16.1% was down 70 basis points, largely due to higher E&amp;D on next generation product platforms.</p>
          <p>Recent improvements in air traffic trends and order rates are in line with our expectation of higher commercial aftermarket revenues in the back half of 2010, supporting Pratt's operating profit increase of 75 to $100 million for the full year on low single-digit growth in revenues.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, Hamilton Sundstrand operating profit grew 7% on 1% lower revenues. Aero OEM revenues were down high single-digits while aero aftermarket was up low single-digits. Industrial revenues were up high single-digits. Commercial spares revenues were flat, while orders were up 7% versus second quarter of 2009. Book-to-bill was about one.</p>
          <p>Industrial orders increased approximately 30% on a constant currency basis. Orders improved across all industrial businesses with particular strength in the Sullair compressor business. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points, reflecting the benefits from cost control, restructuring and growth of high margin industrial and aero aftermarket businesses. These benefits more than offset the impact of higher E&amp;D. For the full year we continue to expect Hamilton Sundstrand's operating profit to be up 25 to $50 million and revenue up slightly.</p>
          <p>Turning to Sikorsky on slide nine. Operating profits grew by 26% on 22% higher revenues. During the quarter, as Greg said, Sikorsky shipped a total of 66 large helicopters, 57 based on military platforms, and nine commercial. Military shipments were 17 more than second quarter last year, while commercial shipments were down by one. Commercial market remains weak with only four net aircraft orders in the quarter. However, total backlog is robust at $10.5 billion due to the strength of the military business. Operating profit growth of 26% reflects benefits of higher volume and lower manufacturing costs, which more than offset increased E&amp;D.</p>
          <p>Operating margin expanded 30 basis points in the quarter to 10.4%. We remain confident in Sikorsky's 2010 guidance with revenues projected to grow in the high single-digits and operating profit expected to increase 100 to $125 million.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Greg for wrap-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So it's nice to see a return to revenue growth and continue to see strong cost performance and as a result record margins and strong cash generation. It was also good to see broad improvement in the order rates across the business. UTC's results this quarter once again demonstrate the strength and resilience of our global franchises.</p>
          <p>Some other takeaways from the quarter, the GE Security integration is on track and the business continues to exceed our expectations. Carrier is also on track with its aggressive transformation agenda towards a simpler and higher returns business and has now announced divestitures or joint ventures representing about $2.1 billion in annualized revenue.</p>
          <p>We also continue to invest in game changing technology across the business and our aerospace companies continue to make process on their key development programs. As examples, the Pratt GTF core has accumulated more than 260 hours, validating the performance expectations. And Sikorsky's Canadian maritime helicopter continues its successful flight testing with first delivery scheduled for the end of the year.</p>
          <p>One question that's come up repeatedly over the last couple of months is whether we're faced with a repeat of</p>
          <p>2008. What we all saw in 2008, of course, was a dramatic reduction in order rates across our end markets as a result of the unprecedented deleveraging of the financial institutions. And while we remain cautious, there are a number of factors that make 2010 very different from 2008.</p>
          <p>First, the availability of credit to finance demand is tight, but not frozen. Secondly, the negative impact from destocking of inventory that we saw in 2008 has already occurred. And third, many end markets in 2008 were already at peak levels, while today's levels are significantly lower and still below underlying demand in some cases.</p>
          <p>As an example, new housing starts are substantially below new household formations. That's a trend that will eventually result in the growth of new housing construction. Also in Carrier's transport refrigeration business, even though the markets are expected to be significantly higher in 2010 from 2009, they will still be at only two-thirds of the peak levels we saw in 2008.</p>
          <p>Similarly, as air traffic recovers from the lows of 2009 and airline profitability improves, aircraft engine maintenance will shift from light to heavy overhauls, driving stronger aftermarket demand. So we're in a different place than we were two years which gives us confidence that our year-to-date results and our improving order rates are sustainable.</p>
          <p>And based on that improved business unit outlook, our full year expectation for organic growth is now about 2%. That's at the high end of our prior guidance range. However we expect overall revenues to be closer to 54 billion due to the weaker euro.</p>
          <p>On earnings, we will see solid conversion from the organic revenue growth in the second half based on the cost traction we've seen. However, we expect some headwinds, particularly from FX and E&amp;D. You recall that last year the euro averaged 1.45 in the second half of 2009. Our previous guidance for the second half of the year assumed a 1.35 euro and today our current guidance assumes 1.25 euro. That translates to about $0.08 of headwind year-over-year in the second half of which $0.04 is incremental to our April guidance.</p>
          <p>E&amp;D will also be higher in the second half of the year. First half of the year E&amp;D was up 63 million and we expect the second half to increase by approximately 100 million as development programs ramp up such as the first engines to test for CSeries and MRJ.</p>
          <p>Overall while we remain cautious, we are confident in our 2010 earnings per share outlook of 4.60 to 4.70 up 12 to 14%. The management team is seasoned and prepared to lead in a challenging and ever changing environment and we remain committed to delivering double-digit earnings growth as the markets stabilize. As our track record demonstrates, strong execution and cost traction are hallmarks of UTC and as always we remain focused on what we can control.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me stop there and let's take some questions. Christie?</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And we'll go to our first question. It comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Terry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, I think the Carrier margins were probably the most positive feature of the variances versus what we were expecting, very positive to see that. I'm wondering if you could kind of deconstruct the year-over-year improvement in margins there. You had mentioned volume drop through, I think Akhil had, maybe you can break out volume drop through, divestiture impact, product cost reductions, restructuring, price cost, some of those pieces, just talk about sustainability of that going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is Akhil. I think the key point is of the 260 basis points, just about 70 basis points was a function of the portfolio transformation that has been going on. Pricing and commodities were a slight headwind, but nothing significant. Bulk of the margin expansion came from the cost reduction actions that Carrier has taken and the solid conversion on the incremental volume.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really &#x2013; you boil it down it's going to be the conversion you're going to see 7% organic revenue growth. We saw very, very good incremental margins, and we expect that that's going to continue in the second half of the year. It's just as Akhil says, it's because of all the costs we took over the last two years at Carrier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Greg, in terms of reaching margin &#x2013; longer-term margin targets kind of forgetting exactly what the timing of hitting some of those targets is but it sounds like we're getting closer sooner. Any other thoughts on that part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, the goal out there has always been full year 12% by 2012, and I think we're clearly on the path to get there. And, in fact, we saw good margins this quarter. We'll see good margins for the back half of the year. And I think with the portfolio transformation and the cost traction that Geraud and team have seen out there that 12% seems very, very achievable in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would agree with that. And then maybe shifting over one of the big topics here in the aviation world is the higher E&amp;D spend kind of across the engine makers. Can you talk to us a little bit about how we should think about '11 and '12 at this point based on how the programs are shaping up as you see them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think for &#x2013; as we say, E&amp;D is going to go up in the back half of the year by about $100 million. The bulk of that will be at Pratt &amp; Whitney as they take the engines to test on MRJ and CSeries. We've also got headwinds then next year probably of an incremental $100 million or so on those programs as we ramp up to kind of full test and get a lot of hardware in. So we know we've got at least $100 million of E&amp;D headwind.</p>
          <p>There's other E&amp;D headwind associated with the A320 should that program get launched later this year. I'm not prepared to give you a number on that but I will say that there is incremental headwind.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that 100 million in '12, Greg, is that just Pratt or is that across the portfolio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's just &#x2013; that's the Pratt number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you think about the engines, though, keep in mind that the core of the GTF we're scaling up from the MRJ to the CSeries and then we would scale up again as we work on the Russian &#x2013; the Irkut program and the A320. So again there is incremental E&amp;D but probably not as much as you might think from an individual engine program.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Hamilton, does that come down in '11 as we get into the 787 production and presumably Sikorsky, probably flattish? Is that the way to think about those pieces?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, in fact, we'll see a little bit of pressure on E&amp;D at Hamilton next year as we ramp up on CSeries and the A350. We're seeing a little bit of good news this year in the back half of the year on 787 as that winds down and we spent about 150 million last year on that, probably around 100 this year, and then that should come down even more next year, but again, all replaced by CSeries and other new platforms.</p>
          <p>Sikorsky I think you'll continue to see E&amp;D ramp a little bit next year. We've got the X2 technology which we're trying to capitalize. You've also got S-76D and some of the other programs that are continuing in the development process.</p>

          <p>So, Greg, the order numbers look great, obviously, kind of across the board. I'm wondering if you can give any &#x2013; just more color on Europe specifically, and particularly towards the end of the quarter as the financial markets reacted. Did you see any changes? You noted also that Otis North America looked good, China looked good. I guess Europe probably wasn't as good?</p>

          <p>In fact the order rates in Europe actually surprised us I think, in the second quarter, they're much better than our expectations. We saw order growth at Otis in the new equipment side. The orders in Carrier were slightly down, but again, ahead of our expectations. We'd expected Europe to be flat pretty much for the year, and it's actually doing a little bit better. I wouldn't say there's much change, month-to-month within the quarter.</p>
          <p>We haven't really seen a big impact from all of this sovereign debt crisis in Europe. Again the aftermarket business remains very strong over there for us. Really market-by-market Germany remains very strong, Eastern Europe is strong, the UK has been weak, and of course, the countries around the Mediterranean have been weak but overall I would say it's surprised us to the upside, not a lot, but a little bit.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Joe, keep in mind that 60% of our revenues in Europe come from commercial business units aftermarket which is relatively stable and the aerospace businesses so I think that's a data point to keep in mind as you think about exposure to Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the second question is, Akhil, you might have mentioned this during your run through the segments but the Sikorsky top line, was this mostly timing, as you think about sort of the year profile and not really changing the guidance, or what's going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This doesn't really change &#x2013; the full year remains like 255 to 260 large aircraft. First quarter was a little bit light. This is just a little bit of catch-up and so for the full year we still expect revenues kind of high single-digit growth at Sikorsky.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning, gents. Just a couple things. First on North America commercial Otis, can be could you give us a sense of how &#x2013; I don't know how significant that LA order was, certainly it was big. Were you up in North America ex that LA order?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we were. In fact the month of June was very strong and we started out the quarter very slow in North America and then June kind of turned things around. LAX is a big deal but there was broad order strength across really North America so we did see growth ex the LAX order. Hard to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to find a pulse on starts or anything. Is it retrofit activity or are you in fact seeing some real construction activity return in some places?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is real construction activity. Otis remember this is just new equipment for &#x2013; it's not modernization, which would be what you would typically see in the retrofit business. Modernization has not been very good so far this year, but new equipment is actually for new construction starts. Again we're coming off of low levels here, Jeff, so we shouldn't get too excited about it. It's a pretty easy compare but I still think we probably touched bottom here in the second quarter and still expect by the back half of next year we ought to see kind of a return to growth in new equipment in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is commercial Carrier in North America turning up yet? I would think that would lag Otis a little bit, but?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact commercial HVAC in North America has been better than Otis. That's really because of the retrofit market as the building owners are looking for more energy efficiency. We've continued to see pretty good strength in the commercial HVAC side, even though commercial construction starts remain down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a number on commercial Carrier, how much it's up, orders or sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Orders went up high single-digit in North America, Jeff, for commercial HVAC.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the resi side, Greg or Akhil, obviously it's been hot in some places. Just what do you see the state of play in terms of where inventory is and how we're following through into the third quarter on the resi side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The res business started out very strong in the second quarter. We saw really, really good shipments in April. It cooled down in May and then came back a little bit in June. We would expect we'll see some restocking. Inventories are very low out in the channel right now because of all the heat that we've seen so we would expect, third quarter we should see some restocking activity. Haven't seen much yet, but again, I think as people work down these channel inventories there's got to be some restocking coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally the modest guide down in Otis on profits, is that all currency or is there some other dynamic going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. It's all currency. In fact operationally they're actually going to be up a little bit, the underlying business but currency is more than offsetting that so it's all currency.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. First I just wanted to touch base again on your management of sort of costs and capital, Greg. I mean it looked like SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales was down 120 basis points and CapEx clearly looks like it's not going to reach $1 billion for the year. Could you sort of first address what you're doing in SG&amp;A and how much you think you're going to hold onto? It sure looks like it's a little bit better than I would have thought and then also what are you thinking CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The SG&amp;A is really not a surprise given all the costs that we take out and we've continued to constrain spending as you would expect, Howard, with the markets where we are. We're not seeing a lot of top line growth here. The earnings growth has got to come from cost reduction, cost take out. And so that SG&amp;A number you're going to continue to see that probably improve because the idea here is we're going to hold SG&amp;A -as the revenues come back we're going to get more traction or even better conversion with those incremental revenues. Again, lots of restructuring and we're going to get $400 million of benefit this year from the restructuring programs and you're seeing a big piece of that show up in the SG&amp;A line.</p>
          <p>On CapEx, again it's the same story. It's all about doing more with less, and just constraining the spending. We're still going to hold on to the billion dollar number for the year. I think, again, we'll have to see how 2011 shapes up before we have a final look at CapEx, but clearly back half will be more than front half, but the billion dollars is still probably a good number for now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then tax rate was a little higher at 30, and then could you help us a little bit understand what is going on in Washington with respect attempts to repeal or hurt sort of the tax benefits or the tax structure that exists for foreign earnings and how we might think about that <mark type="inaudible" />...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First, on the quarter, the effective tax rate was about 30% and that's because some of the charges that we took, some of the restructuring and impairment charges we took we didn't tax benefit those because we aren't done with the divestitures yet, so a little bit higher tax rate, and that really is what drove it from -up a couple of points.</p>
          <p>As far as tax policy in Washington, we &#x2013; I think, we dodged a bullet with this tax extenders package, and we have been &#x2013; we've been working closely with the folks in Washington. We've been down, and I've been down there myself talking to folks on The Hill talking to people in the administration, and we have a corporate tax system that is just not competitive worldwide. And one of the things that we need to focus for this country to drive jobs here is to make us more competitive globally. We've got the highest tax rate amongst all the developed countries. We're one of the only countries that tries to tax overseas profits as opposed to a territorial system which almost every other developed country has, and, what we hope to have is a full and open debate on tax reform next year. And we'll see how that whole thing shapes up. But obviously as they attack some of these planning initiatives that we have and to try and close what they perceive as loopholes and try and tax some of this foreign earnings it's going to put pressure on the rate going forward. So we're on top of it, we follow it very closely, we spend a lot of time, my tax team &#x2013; the Washington office is all over this, but right now I would say we're just monitoring the situation and trying to influence where this thing comes out.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, Greg and Akhil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question relates to the aerospace guidance which didn't change either in revenues or in profit. It's the same as it was when we last spoke but it does seem that the traffic is up, Boeing and Airbus have both raised production rates, the 787 seems like it's going to make it out of development into production. I might have thought that there were some positives. I guess you also saw some pickup in the order rates although the spares deliveries were flat. Is there some offset that's keeping you from upping the aerospace expectations at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if you think about Pratt and Hamilton specifically here, we did see decent order growth rate in the quarter. I think was 8% and 7% respectively. The key for us, though, is the second half we've always anticipated having much stronger growth than that in the commercial aftermarket. I think Pratt's got to grow about 15% in the commercial aftermarket, Hamilton a little less than that. So we're still expecting to see a return of spares at Hamilton and Pratt. Certainly air traffic would support that. Airline profitability would support that. It's unfortunately a little bit lumpy.</p>
          <p>I think, we feel good about the back half of the year at Pratt but it's not without risk in terms of the timing of the spares recovery, does it happen in third quarter, fourth quarter, or first quarter of next year. But having said that we feel good about the guidance for all the aerospace businesses. A little bit of E&amp;D pressure in the back half of the year at Pratt, which is also I think kind of constraining our &#x2013; the guidance there, but overall, we feel pretty good about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it &#x2013; I mean the E&amp;D spend is the same as you previously expected. I would have thought the traffic and the orders are higher than you might have expected, but that's not true?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we had been talking about 4 to 5% traffic growth, and I think as the airlines have reported, we've seen traffic about in line with that. We just haven't seen all the inductions into the shop that we had been expecting so I think that still is on the come in the back half of the year, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, and if I may just add one other thing on Pratt, if you recall our guidance was growth of 6 to 7% in commercial spares for large engines, and for the first half we've been down 7%. Right? So in face of that first half we're still relying a lot on aftermarket improving in the second half. And I think until we see that come through in the third quarter it's a little too early to say the benefits of all the traffic and airline profitability improvement is starting to show up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is the E&amp;D number coming in on budget?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, pretty much on budget. I think, again, we see an opportunity to maybe spend a little bit more in the back half of the year and, again, that will just depend on how well the spares hold up but I think, clearly there's pressure on E&amp;D and to the extent that we can get ahead of some of the '11 spend and pull it into 2010 we'll try and do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to kick off with Carrier, I mean just counting the numbers from your fresh guidance, it looks like the margins might break 10%. Is that in line with your model for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a possibility, Nigel. I mean clearly very strong beginning to the first half and we would think like around 10% should be possible for Carrier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's quite a landmark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you talked about &#x2013; Greg, I think you talked about some FX and E&amp;D headwinds in the second half of the year. Do you have any other tough headwinds coming through and I'm thinking here about some of the Carrier businesses like Transicold, where we've got big volume ramps, have you got any additional head count to come through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only other headwind I would point out really goes back to commodities. We're going to see about, I don't know, about $70 million of commodity headwind in the back half here and a little more than half after that is at Carrier. You recall last year, copper was about 2.60 a pound for the full year. This year it's averaging around, I think 3.10 is what we've locked in for the year so that's the only other big cost headwind.</p>
          <p>In terms of the other, bringing some folks back to deal with the additional volume, that's all contemplated in the guidance that we've got out there now and that's not a big number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as you get the pinch from FX in the second half of the year, I'm thinking that's probably a net benefit to your margin, given that your European margins are probably a little bit lower, would that be fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, say that one more time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just trying to think how the FX impacts the margins, I'm just trying to gauge the sustainability of your 15.7% margin in the second quarter, and I'm thinking that a weaker &#x2013; a stronger euro helps you relative to 2Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Because again you think about where the Otis, for instance, earns most of its margin in Europe because again it's 70% aftermarket there, so as you translate that back with a stronger euro that actually is helpful to us in terms of overall margins. That's really the story, I think, Europe is generally more profitable than the rest of the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just the chart on orders, I mean the &#x2013; it's hard to try and judge the underlying trend given the weak comps you've gotten year-over-year. If we look at that chart on a Q-over-Q basis, 2Q versus 1Q would we see growth across the board?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that would be true. I think it's true for the aero aftermarket companies, certainly both Pratt and Hamilton spares were up in Q2 versus Q1. Industrial, Hamilton is also up. So I think it's broadly true across the businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think Greg you threw out a chart in June showing Hamilton spares up 20% in April-May, and I think they're up 7% this quarter. Just trying to reconcile those two numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In fact we had a very strong April and May at Hamilton, especially on the provisioning side. And what we saw in June was the provisioning orders really just dried up, and keeping in mind provisioning is a lumpy business, and it's a capital item for the airline, so as the summer season started back in April, getting ready for that we saw good provisioning orders and then it dried up. The underlying piece part demand is still up strongly in the month of June. And so again it is very lumpy but I think broadly we like the trend line here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just finally you called out the maintenance growth in China in the second half of the year. North American orders, growth in North America was not expected by myself. Would you expect North America to maintain growth in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we expect it to continue to grow but certainly not at the levels that we saw here in the second quarter. We expect very modest growth in new equipment orders. Again, commercial construction has not recovered. I think again we saw some signs of it but I wouldn't hang my hat on a big second half for orders in the commercial construction business.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Following up, as I recall, your orders in April and May at Pratt for large commercial engine spares also were over 10% or over and now, they're in the 7, 8% range. What did June look like? And maybe give us some color, what are you seeing in June, impact from the European volcano, weaker stock market, euro prices, I mean are airlines being slower in terms of ordering here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>On the spares, Cai, I think April-May was up 10% for Pratt and now it's 8 so I wouldn't call that a dramatic difference. I think Hamilton was more pronounced. So the trend rates have been pretty consistent. You do get some lumpiness in monthly orders. That's the risk of looking at these &#x2013; the data on a monthly basis.</p>
          <p>With regard to volcano, I -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again as you look at obviously RPM suffered back in April and May with the volcano activity and I think the profitability, obviously, suffered for the European airlines as well, but as we see the airlines start to report results here I think you're going to see very, very strong results. They continue to constrain capacity, they continue to make money. Business class, first class traffic, premium traffic is up, so I think again the European airlines although they had a tough couple of months with the volcano, we still expect them to have a very good year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, I joined a little late, but pension, can you give us some update on your pension investment performance year-to-date, and maybe some color on what we should think about next year if we close out the year about where discount rates are and given where the markets are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going into this year we knew we had about $100 million of pension headwind in 2011 just as you continue to amortize the losses that we saw in 2008. If you snapped the line at June 30 the discount rate had gone from 6% at the end of 2009 to 5.3%. That is a record low discount rate.</p>
          <p>Now, just to kind of give you a rule of thumb, for every 25 basis points change in the discount rate, that impacts our expense line by about $50 million. So, again, you're down from 6 to 5.3, obviously there's over $100 million of headwind we would see next year. Although, again, snapping the line at June 30, it's really premature as we think about 2011. We would expect interest rates would move back up. I mean, we've seen treasuries below 3% now but as economic activity picks up, I think interest rates will pick back up and the discount rate ought to north towards 6%.</p>
          <p>Asset returns year-to-date have been zero. Asset returns don't have nearly the impact that discount rate has. I think it's for every one point difference between our expected ROA which is 8.4% and actual performance, every one point difference costs us about $5 million the following year so that's &#x2013; right now that would be $40 million, but again, we're seeing &#x2013; that started to come back here in July as the markets have recovered I think right now we're probably through yesterday up about 3%, so too early to call on pension but clearly there's headwind out there and we'll just have to see as we get towards December what that number actually is when we see where discount rates are moving.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And you had a slightly higher than expected tax rate in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>What should we use in modeling the full year for your tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>29% I think is still the right number, Cai. As we mentioned earlier, that really was impacted by some &#x2013; the lack of tax deductibility associated with a couple of these impairment charges that we took so again that's just kind of a timing issue for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>29 for the balance of the year, Cai. Whatever has happened on discrete basis in the past is past.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. And then last one, as Farnborough closes out what's your assessment in terms of the likelihood of the CSeries getting some firm orders here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still see a solid pipeline of orders for the CSeries aircraft. I think, again, people may have been a little disappointed not to see any of these orders actually get announced this week, but clearly we're working with the folks at Bombardier and their customers and we see it's a pretty robust pipeline out there and we're going to get the orders. It's a great aircraft. It's got 20% operating cost efficiencies versus the competition. It's going to sell, and we've got great technology there. So again I wouldn't &#x2013; there's no panic here, I think it's just all timing and by the end of the year I think we'll all be smiling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But I mean &#x2013; I recall they made some comment that Bombardier had said they were kind of very close and the issue really wasn't with Bombardier. Is there &#x2013; is kind of the issue in terms of getting things over the goal line really dotting the i's and contractual issues with you or Bombardier, or is the issue that Boeing and Airbus are kind of talking other plans and so people are just stepping back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. There's a little bit of negotiating in the press going on here, and I think we don't want to get into that here, but suffice it to say we're working very closely with Bombardier and their customers to give very competitive SMPS and again it will all sort itself out here in the coming months.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. I had a couple of questions. And the first one was on the overall organic order growth, across all the businesses what was that growth rate in Q2, and how do you think that will change in the second half? Obviously you've commented a bit on you expect spares orders to accelerate, possibly some tailing off in parts of Otis. So overall company, what do you think organic order growth will be in the second half versus what you saw in Q2?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the pricing environment, if you've seen any changes in any parts of the commercial businesses. I mean there are some stories of price competition in lifts in Europe, but both you and your European peers are reporting very good margins so if you can just give an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Julian, this is Akhil. I think we &#x2013; if you look at first half, our organic growth has been about flat. First quarter was down 4 and second quarter is up 4, and our full year guidance is 2%, so that would say our second half organic growth is going to be more like 3 to 4% is what our expectation is for the back half. And the order rate -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the order intake -?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the order rate supports that because a lot of our business does not necessarily get orders in advance. There is some short cycle businesses, a lot of aftermarket business is just sort of on a daily basis but it's a lot more stable as well so I think that's probably the rough order that we can talk about. And on pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just say on pricing, Julian, we have seen kind of the normal levels of pricing pressure both in the Carrier business as well as the Otis business, really nothing out of the ordinary though. We had expected a tough pricing environment this year. It's not as bad perhaps as we had expected it to be and still a lot of capacity out there in the system in the U.S. res side. We know Otis pricing is very, very tough in China. That is not a new story, and again nothing really new or dramatic on the pricing front. I think it's just the normal day-to-day pricing pressure we see. Obviously last year we lost a little share at Otis. We got some of that back. And that came with some adjustments to pricing. But again there's nothing unusual going on there.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Pratt Canada, the OE deliveries were up sequentially. I mean is that just seasonal or what did you actually see there that caused the OE deliveries to be up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, again you're coming off the lowest quarter of the year, which was first quarter, and for the full year we still expect to deliver about 2800 engines. Engine deliveries were still down 13% year-over-year at Pratt Canada in the quarter. So it's not that there's anything &#x2013; a dramatic turnaround occurring here. It's simply we expect to see a little bit of a recovery in the back half, again about 2800 engines for the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Greg, if you can walk through Carrier in terms of where we stand in the planned divestitures and how much of the revenues will reflect &#x2013; well, I guess you can back out how much the revenues will reflect it because you gave the organic growth, but, in terms of what we should look for, for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's still &#x2013; as I said earlier we've done about $2.1 billion of divestitures since 2008 across the Carrier product lines. There's another 500 (sic) [million] to a billion dollars to go. And that will happen over the next 18 months or so. We're in negotiations for joint ventures on some of our distribution assets both here in the U.S. as well as in South America. We've divested or joint ventured some of the &#x2013; our business in Israel and in Egypt this past quarter. Again this stuff is all evolving. But I think again, when we're all said and done, Carrier will be almost $3 billion smaller but a lot more profitable and a lot better growth prospects long-term with this new portfolio.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about those Pratt spares or just talk about how it changed from Q1 to Q2 and at the current dollar levels I know the comparisons are still relatively easy in the second half, but how much in dollars do we have to start to see growth in the second half to get that up 15% in that time period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think if you look at the second quarter was better than the first quarter, Sam, and I think if you take what our guidance is based on off of our second quarter run rate, you need to see about 10 to 12% increase in the second half spares compared with our second quarter run rate. So that's the expectation that we have. And the traffic data and the airline profitability improvement and the expectation of heavier overhauls would support that. That's basically what the expectations for Pratt are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, Greg, the comment you just made about pension and what the impact of the discount rate, does that factor in the contributions you made in the second quarter, and then can you just talk about what your expectations for contributions in the remainder of the year, and can you perhaps make more contributions to offset some of that headwind for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, obviously the contribution as I say we've down 450 million in the first half of the year, 250 in stock and 200 in cash. And for the back half of the year, I think we've got at least another $200 million that's going to go into the domestic plans and probably a similar amount into the international plans. Obviously that helps because you get the asset or the ROA on that money in terms of your expected pension expense. I think again if cash continues to look solid as it does, you might see us take that number up. Again, just to try and get ahead of some of the headwinds that we're probably going to see in 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to take you back to Otis for a moment and just ask you a sort of longer term question. When you look at the aftermarket volume there relative to the size of your current installed base can you compare that at this stage to what it would be in a more developed market like North America or Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're talking about comparison in emerging markets versus say China versus a developed market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, yes, in China or in emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think as you think about obviously in the more developed markets, Europe, for instance, 70% of the business there is aftermarket. Across Otis it's about a 60/40 split today, aftermarket to OE. Most of the OE activity obviously is coming in the developing &#x2013; or the emerging markets, and the biggest piece obviously is in China.</p>
          <p>In China, service revenue is still only around 6 or 7% of our total revenue there. So in the quarter I think the great news is service in China grew 25%. Bad news is it's off of a very low base, and so that's a trend that will continue. We expect to see very rapid growth but it will take a long time before China gets to the level of what we see in the developed countries.</p>
          <p>India may be a little bit different. We actually saw a good conversion in India, almost 80% conversion rate for the new equipment there. So it's different market-by-market but clearly the most challenging aftermarket area is going to be China for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And then Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada you just commented that you're expecting to see a recovery in the back half of the year. Can you tell us a little more about what would drive that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We talked about a run rate of 2800 engine shipments overall, and so therefore it's driven by the customer requirements of the timing of those engine shipments. It's not a dramatic recovery that we are talking about at this stage.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, just to keep in mind, that's not driven by biz jets. That's really driven by the turboprops, it's the A4 &#x2013; I'm sorry, A400M, that's another one &#x2013; it's the regional turboprops that are actually driving that demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And just one final one then looking at Sikorsky. You've got a number of current or potential development programs going on there, you've got the S-76B, the CH53K, eX2, you are partnered up to look at the reiteration of the Presidential Helicopter and doing some upgraded combat search-and-rescue. As you look at how the defense budget is shaping up and the weakness in commercial demand, how do you think about which of these programs might get pushed to the right, by how much, and what that might mean for your development spending?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, the CH53K has already been pushed to the right. Again, taking into account some of the challenges that they're having at the DoD. Right now we're starting to negotiate on Lot 8 of the BLACKHAWKs or SEAHAWKs and all of that. We still see very strong demand from the Armed Services for vertical lift, both in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we're also seeing strong interest from the foreign military customers for vertical lift. So growth will moderate at Sikorsky in the next couple of years, but I don't see a big downturn coming from the military. Again Multi-Year 7 will be finished, I think, next year, 2012, and then we go into Multi-Year 8. Again, there's lots of requirements still out there that will keep volumes relatively robust for the next several years.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Maybe if you can provide some color on what you're seeing in Otis China in the construction market there with the tightening of credit and also maybe update on the lower priced product for the China market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we continue to see good order growth in China in the second quarter. I think orders there were up kind of low teens, 13%, is that right? Low teens. Of course and that's &#x2013; you compare that to the first quarter where we saw order rates up 49%. Obviously we have seen a slowdown from that. Part of it again is the year-over-year compares where last year we started to see a recovery in the second quarter in China, and that continued throughout the year, and we have seen some impact from the tightening. Obviously we don't expect 20%-plus kind of growth in China in the back half of the year, but from what our people on the ground are telling us, they say very solid double-digit growth, kind of like what we saw in second quarter ought to be repeatable through the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then you provided color on pricing for Otis, but with steel prices coming off, maybe you can talk about the pricing material spread and your expectation for the balance of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of our pricing, Ajay, doesn't necessarily relate with the commodity prices in a direct manner. A lot of pricing depends on the volume in the market, the projects being bid, and the competitive nature of those bids. So I think it's difficult to correlate precisely with what is happening with steel or copper prices to what the end market prices are going to be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then lastly from me, with all the puts and takes on end markets and FX, maybe if you can update us on the contingency, where it stands now versus where you were at the start of the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Back in April we had talked about $100 million contingency at the high end of the guidance range, which was 4.65 at the time. Since then obviously FX has gone against us. That's cost us about $100 million. That's again primarily at Otis and the other commercial businesses. Offsetting that, though, has been very good performance operationally at Carrier and stronger performance out of Otis. You add all that up and we're back to about $100 million of contingency. Now, the midpoint of our guidance range, which is still 4.65, so feel very good about the year, six months to go with 100 million of contingency, it feels pretty good.</p>

          <p>All right. Well, I'll tell you the only disappointment this quarter is that nobody said, great quarter, guys. But I just want to thank everyone for participating today. A very good quarter, obviously, strong results, encouraging order trends and we're confident in the improved outlook, and we continue to position UTC to outperform in any environment. Thanks for listening and we looking forward to seeing you all throughout the remainder of the year. Take care.</p>
