          <p>Welcome to Schneider Electric 2012 Half-Year Results Presentation. I now hand over to Mr. Jean-Pascal Tricoire, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good day. Good morning to all the people following this half-year review of the results of Schneider Electric. I'm here with Carina Ho and Emmanuel Babeau, and we're going to go through a quick presentation of our results and then we're going to be happy to take the possible questions about this first mid-year 2012. So going straight into the program of this presentation, I'm going to go through a very quick overview of Schneider, then come back on our strategy and business update. And then Emmanuel will go into the financial presentation, and then I'm going to go back to the outlook for the year.</p>
          <p>So a very quick overview about Schneider; &#x20AC;23 billion of sales over the last 12 months; 40% of our sales in new economies; close to 40% of our sales in Solutions; and we are at a very interesting point in time where the business of the group is completely balanced between the Americas which represent roughly 30% of our sales, Western Europe roughly 30% of our sales, Asia Pac around 30% of our sales, so a very, very balanced presence on business around the world. Remind you that we have a very strong commitment and sustainable development will be by our mission, which is to help our customers to make the most of their energy and particularly to reduce energy consumption and also complete commitment to corporate social responsibility, a multi-faceted commitment that we measure every quarter in terms of progress on results.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to go through the review of this first half and first go to the headlines of the main achievements of the first half. And as we said at the beginning of the year, we've been totally focused on execution &#x2013; operational execution. In the first half, the main achievements have been, first, pricing power; price increases by &#x20AC;141 million in H1 and I'm going to come back to that. But with that, we have covered 80% of the raw material impact that affected us last year. Then operational efficiency, our adjusted operating result, adjusted EBITA increased by 9%; the earnings per share plus 10%. Our cash generation is back to a normal profile after a disturbed 2011 year. And the free cash flow over the last 12 months is equivalent to 108% of our net income.</p>
          <p>Then this first half has been also characterized by a strong activity of integration of the acquisitions we realized last year and the year before. A lot of things happening in the domain of smart infrastructure with the integration of Telvent, a lot of acquisition in the field of services, and the rest of acquisitions were so devoted to the development of our presence into new economies. And finally, we kept working on the improvement of our business model in Solutions and services, and particularly we started generating higher margins on the efficiency of our operational assets in the cities. So, with that we &#x2013; and I'll come back to that. We are confirming the full-year outlook that we gave at the beginning of the year.</p>
          <p>Now, let's have a review in more details business by business. Our Power business has very strong dynamics. As it's well known, it represents 38% of our business, plus 3% on the full first half of organic growth and plus 8.7% of current growth. Well, we have &#x2013; this business is very resilient in &#x2013; and is very diversified in terms of market exposure, geographical exposure. And we fully benefit of our strong leadership worldwide. Infrastructure, flattish over the first half, minus 0.7%, the current growth of 17%. Well, we had said very clearly that the priority in this business was to realize &#x2013; finalize the integration of Schneider, Areva and Telvent. So a lot of work devoted to this integration, to making sure that the organizations are well merged together, that the synergies are put into place, on clear priority in measuring our margin and our profit and Solutions model. This has been well done. We are developing very satisfactory oil services. We are developing our Solutions for infrastructure, for oil and gas. This semester has been also characterized by the lower demand from utilities.</p>
          <p>Industry business, minus 6.3% in terms of organic growth, minus 0.4% in terms of current growth. Well, we've been impacted by a tough market in Western Europe and also tough market in Asia, impacted also by our lower exposure to North America in this sector. We are now launching equal structure for manufacturing for plant, which we call plant structure. And this is doing a good success so we expect growth on that side on the future. Outstanding performance of our IT business plus 5% of organic growth, plus 23% of current growth. Good performance across all board especially in services, and we are benefiting on the revamping, retrofit adaptation of data centers to the new trend around co-location, virtualization on cloud computing on our very energy-efficient solution are very popular with high-tech actors in these sectors.</p>
          <p>And finally, Buildings which is negative in this first half by 2%, plus 9% in terms of current growth. We're clearly impacted by the reduced public spending in Western Europe, and we had weakness in advanced services, particularly performance contracting, due mainly to a basis of comparison which was quite high last year. This activity is suffering of lower exposures, as we have said many times, to new economies, exposure that we are developing but it takes time and we are not yet there.</p>
          <p>Going to next slide and going to one of the major characteristics of our growth profile, we are a very balanced company. We are present in all geographies. Well, firstly in this first half there's a sharp or striking contrast between Western Europe and North America; North America plus 4% of organic growth; Western Europe minus 4%, with clearly different dynamics between Southern Europe which is negative and Northern Europe which remains dynamic. So, that's the first thing to underline.</p>
          <p>The second point that Asia Pac is slightly negative, minus 1%, due to negative sales in China. But China has stabilized, roughly at the level of Q1. India is doing good but this is &#x2013; this has variations according to business. Actually, the newly acquired Luminous is having very strong dynamics. And it's likely that power outages, as the one happening at the moment in India, will catalyze more sells on this side. Very, very good results in Southeast Asia, which is extremely dynamic for us. So, China which is in fact suffering from a very high basis of comparison last year and which has stabilized at a very decent level is being compensated by good dynamics in Southeast Asia.</p>
          <p>And finally, Latin America, Africa, Middle East and Eastern Europe is the strongest growth of this first half, plus 6%. And we have particularly good growth in Africa, Middle East and Russia particularly. Once again, new economies are the growth engine of Schneider. As you know, they are a strong engine of our strategy, a strong focus of our strategy. And they deliver an organic growth which is 5% above the one of mature countries.</p>
          <p>Going to the next worksite of Schneider, this is our Solutions business model which, on the last 12 months, represents 39% of our business. As you know, we've been working a lot on the improvement of the margin and of the asset efficiency devoted to this activity, and we will contract this into the Solutions model with enough simplification, with the specialization of our project on the equipment footprint across the world, with making sure that we develop more reference designs across eco structure and making sure also that we grow the capability of our Solutions centers.</p>
          <p>We are working also on the improvement of the financial performance, the cost effectiveness of our equipments. We inherited, with the acquisition of Areva, a diversity of equipment with Schneider. We are rationalizing all of this. We have been more selective on our project pipeline, and I'll come back to the effect of that. And we are working on the development and the acceleration of our services, which is showing good results. So, a consequence of that is the first signs of profitability improvement on our Solutions business model, but at the same time, also due to basis of comparison, higher comps, the growth rate on our Solutions business is decreasing but it's a strict application of our operational orientation to make sure that we master well this model before accelerating it in a more &#x2013; in a stronger way. Anyway, second growth engine of the company, Solutions, in the first half delivered an organic growth which is 6% above the one of the Products; so new economies plus 5%, Solutions plus 6%.</p>
          <p>Going now on the operational efficiency, the first half was also characterized by a continued improvement or effort on pricing to compensate the raw material impact and also values of branding, the innovation and the commercial effort put on the sale, we brought on-board &#x20AC;141 million of prices. I remind you that we measure pricing only on the Products part of the business. And at the end of this first half, after 18 months of continued price increases, we have covered 80% of the raw material inflation &#x2013; of the inflation, sorry, that we have known particularly in 2011. We intend to keep going with price increases in H2 but it won't be at the same level of H1. Will it be &#x2013; simply due to the effects of higher basis of comparison last year.</p>
          <p>Now going into cost initiatives, we worked on our manufacturing productivity obviously, but clearly, there was a very significant difference of volume increase in H1 this year. Actually, our volumes were in decrease of 1.2%. We nevertheless kept generating productivity at the level of &#x20AC;120 million. And we kept working also on our base cost efficiency and gained 40 basis points of efficiency on our support function cost. I want to mention that we did this productivity on base costs while increasing our R&amp;D spending, which on the first half is representing 4.6% of our sales. And speaking in cash terms, a part of this is capitalized. So we drove SG&amp;A reduction, but in this mix we kept increasing, as we said at the beginning of Connect, our R&amp;D expenses.</p>
          <p>Going into next slide, slide 14, and speaking about the cash, I would say this is back to the normal profile of cash generation at Schneider. We've generated roughly &#x20AC;400 million of cash in H1 2012. And if we look back to the past 12 months, we've generated more than &#x20AC;2 billion of cash, which is I think historical for us and generated a cash conversion of 108% of the net income. Remind also our commitment to shareholders, we have decided a payment of a dividend per share of &#x20AC;1.7. We have a long-term dividend policy of 50% payout, which we had been implementing for the past eight years. And the yield at the current share price is 3.6%, which is in the economy of today and the environment today a very attractive return.</p>
          <p>We shall continue to focus on cash. We've done a good job in all aspects of cash generation. We also know and you also know that the profile of cash generation at Schneider is very unbalanced between H1 and H2. And the highest spot of the cash generation will obviously happen in H2, and we have all reasons to believe that this year will be a very positive year in terms of cash generation.</p>
          <p>Moving on to slide 15, and I wanted to put some emphasis on some other growth and development engines that appeared very clearly in H1. Beyond new economies, beyond Solutions, Schneider is generating growth, thanks to innovation. So as I said, 4.6% of our sales in R&amp;D, that represents 11,000-plus engineers throughout the world close to the most advanced customers, close to the best universities. I should put here the 15,000-plus application on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:44) engineers who do integration close to the customers of Solutions. They participate to our innovation capabilities. But here you have a few examples of the innovation that came online this year.</p>
          <p>Premset which is a very innovative, medium-voltage breaker that was born from the engineers <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:04) on Schneider Electric, very compact, very small size in an environment that needs compacity because it has to be installed in building or small technical rooms in the Industry on a product which for the first time has been designed for integration by partners, panel builders, all over the world, therefore deployment which is very optimized for new economies.</p>
          <p>Acti9, which is a full replacement of our miniature circuit breaker line of Products where we are absolute world leaders, but actually the replacement of Acti9 is having in the first year negative impact on our P&amp;L because of the time we ramp up this new line of products which is very &#x2013; which is a big production volume. We have not yet reached the target cost of design of product, and we are substituting a line of products which was more than five years old and which was very, very efficient in terms of cost. So good thing is that substitution is working very well, but it is impacting slightly negatively our cost line. And finally StruxureWare, our software integration platform for the main applications that we are now deploying in all our key segments, and particularly the major launch of this &#x2013; at the end of this first half is regarding Buildings and is regarding manufacturing.</p>
          <p>Going to my last slide, I'm going to last year of growth beyond new economies, Solutions and innovation are the acquisitions. Here, you'll find a few names of companies that we'd acquired last year or the beginning of this year, which reinforce our presence in services and particularly energy services, smart infrastructure, efficient infrastructure with the core addition of Telvent to Schneider Electric. And finally, our development in new economies with companies like Steck or Luminous will bring both offers adapted to those countries and at the same time a very popular retail network. So, a very dense H1.</p>
          <p>And now to go more into the details, which I'm sure is of utmost interest for you, I'll leave the mike to Emmanuel.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jean-Pascal. Good morning, everyone. Let's go now indeed into some detail in our P&amp;L. And let's look at some analysis. Starting with our sales, our sales amounted to &#x20AC;11.4 billion during the first half of 2012. It's an increase by 10.4%. Biggest contributor to the growth was first the scope impact. Jean-Pascal has just been explaining about the interest and the good integration of all the acquisitions that we have made through 2011. They've indeed contributed by a little bit more than &#x20AC;600 million to the growth of our sales in H1. And we can say that integration is well on track, doing well, and that we are pleased with what this new acquisitions are delivering and that therefore this focus that we clearly had during the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 on integration is now largely behind us.</p>
          <p>Second positive impact, the ForEx impact, plus 4.3%, no surprise. Depreciation of the euro versus most of the main currency and notably the U.S. dollar, the Chinese yuan, I could quote as well the Australian dollar or the British pound. I mean all that has been helping our sales by around &#x20AC;430 million over the first half of the year. Last impact, the organic growth, plus 0.2%, I don't come back on that because, Jean-Pascal, you've been going into some detail on that.</p>
          <p>Looking at our margin, our gross profit reached &#x20AC;4.3 billion. It's up plus 9% compared to last year. And when we look at our margin rate, it's 37.7%, it's down 0.7 points. In fact, really the negative driver behind that are, first of all, the scope impact, the acquisition that we have made are coming and are joining the group with a lower level of gross margins. So, this is having a mechanical negative impact.</p>
          <p>Second impact, of course the mix impact, which has been negative and negative in several dimensions, negative in the Solutions versus further growth, we've seen the more than 6 points of difference. The evolution of the geographies as well has not been playing positively.</p>
          <p>If I look at the launch of new Products, they have been quite numerous in the first half of the year and quite important, and themselves they are having some impact on the gross margin, because at the beginning when we launch a new product, we need some time to get to full targeted cost to produce this new product and until we get there we have some negative impact on our margin. So, these are really the key impacts explaining the negative mix. In addition, as a negative impact, I should also mention of course some inflation on wages and on production cost globally. And all that have been partially but only partially offset by what we have done, notably in terms of positivity, Jean-Pascal has been detailing that.</p>
          <p>We've been very well disciplined, I would say, but also very efficient in managing our support function costs over the first half of the year. Of course, it has been cost control, but it has been also a number of implementation of rationalization, neutralization, simplification of the way we operate and all that has been generating a number of savings. These savings made possible to compensate for inflation, they made possible for investments; Jean-Pascal mentioned the growth of spending and investment in terms of R&amp;D. And despite that, we manage organically to decrease the support function cost in the first half of 2012 compared to the first half of 2011.</p>
          <p>And the ratio, SFC on net sale, is down from 24.5% for the first half of 2011 to 24.1% in the first half of 2012. All taken into account, we reached an adjusted EBITA of &#x20AC;1.556 billion; it's up 9% compared to the first half of 2011. And the margin rate reaches 13.6%, 0.3 point down compared to the first half of 2011. But if I exclude the impact of the acquisition, we are at the same level. And therefore, we managed to maintain excluding this scope impact the level of margin between last year and this year.</p>
          <p>You have here as always a more detailed analysis of the various impacts. I've been really mentioning most of them. Just a few comments on the price impact; we have delivered &#x20AC;141 million for the first half. As Jean-Pascal said, we are expecting some positive elements on the second half but at a lower level that we have achieved through the first half. We believe that we should be for the full year around &#x20AC;200 million of price positive impact.</p>
          <p>In terms of productivity, we started the year with an objective ranging between &#x20AC;250 million and &#x20AC;300 million of productivity. And we think that we should be within this range for the full year. One element here on the other line, which is due to a number of non-recurring element in term of increase of some warranty costs and in term of provision on some inventory, which account for this other line of minus &#x20AC;44 million.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the evolution of our margin, and we see of course quite diverse evolutions of margin. Best performer IT, very strong growth of the margin, plus 3.8 points reaching 17.5%. Several reasons behind this improvement, first of all, the performance on the H1 2011 had been negatively impacted by a number of elements. So we start with relatively easy comps, but most of the explanation is beyond very strong achievement of IT during this first half in term of price increase, in term of developing the services, in term of management of Solutions and margin solution. All that contributed to this strong increase of the margin on the IT business.</p>
          <p>Infrastructure is also positive at plus 0.2 points despite slightly negative organic growth. This is the work that the team is doing on making sure that all the integration of all the business acquired is doing well and priority put on the margin and on profit and improving the profitability on Solutions, and that explains why despite the negative environment, despite a number of negative headwind, they managed to increase by 0.2 their margin</p>
          <p>Moving now to Power, minus 1.2 points, while this is a decrease we are still low at a very high level, 20% adjusted EBITDA margin. And really, in the Power division we have felt the pressure of the mix impact. We have felt the pressure of notably the launch of new products. We have seen Solutions growing significantly quicker than Products. We have seen an impact on the geographies as well. That is really explaining why Power is having this decrease in margin against staying at a high level.</p>
          <p>Industry, quite a remarkable resilience of the margin, minus 1.1 points despite the significant decrease of the topline on an organic basis. And Industry really managed to increase prices, managed to drive profitability on Solutions, all that to compensate precisely the values that were coming at the level of the topline and of course the negative element that it generates. Last, Buildings, minus 1.6 points, impacted by the negative evolution of the sales and the fact that part of the business has been down as well generating a negative mix.</p>
          <p>Going down to the rest of the P&amp;L now; other income and expenses and restructuring, minus &#x20AC;51 million. The amount of restructuring is exactly the same as the one last year at minus &#x20AC;43 million.  Then you have other impairment and expenses of minus &#x20AC;8 million, a pretty marginal number; amortization and impairment of intangible, minus &#x20AC;180 million. This is an increase compared to last year which is only driven by the acquisition that we have made in 2011 and which are generating a number of increased amortization. EBIT reached &#x20AC;1.387 billion. It's up as well 9% compared to last year. Net financial expense, pretty stable. We have seen the cost of our debt decreasing by around 30 bps. But as debt was increasing following the acquisition of last year, we have seen an increase of, roughly speaking, &#x20AC;40 million of the interest paid on the debt. This was compensated by a very negative ForEx impact last year, which was not that negative this year.</p>
          <p>Income tax, negative &#x20AC;281 million, and income tax rate of minus 23.5%. Here we stay very much stable, I would say, six months after six months. The first half of 2011 was at 24% of tax rate. The whole year of 2011 was at 23%. We're still winning the same kind of magnitude and we believe that it's realistic to be around 24% for the full year. And we have a positive contribution from equity investments, which are &#x2013; which is largely coming from the joint venture that we have in Russia, Electroshield-Samara. And then, of course, we are doing profit in a number of companies where we are some minority partner and we give back this positive partner that represents minus &#x20AC;45 million. In total, our net income group shares reached &#x20AC;890 million. It's up plus 11%. And if I look at the earnings per share, it reached &#x20AC;1.65 and it's up plus 10%.</p>
          <p>Looking at the cash flow now, operating cash flow is at &#x20AC;1.2 billion, slightly impacted by payment that we have made on the restructuring cost that had been provisioned for at the end of 2011. CapEx is growing compared to 2011. We keep investing. The big impact here, of course, is coming from a much improved impact coming from the trade working capital. Last year, remember that we have had this very negative stock Buildings coming from the situation in Japan. This year that did not reproduce. And therefore, we have the traditional pattern where we built some inventory over the first half of the year and that we will deplete this inventory in the second half of the year. And really, here, the impact of &#x20AC;149 million is largely the reflection of this impact on inventory.</p>
          <p>Change in non-trade working capital, one element to note here, on a kind of normative basis we have a negative impact on the first half of the year, which is around &#x20AC;150 million, notably because we are paying a number of bonuses to the employees during the first half. This year we have in addition a number of one-off impacts which account for about half of the &#x20AC;300 million here and largely coming from deferred tax payments that are impacting the first half of the year. Altogether free cash flow is reaching &#x20AC;400 million. It would have been even higher without this one-off on the non-trade working capital. We are back to what we generated during the first half of 2010, therefore very much back on a normal pattern.</p>
          <p>Dividend is reaching &#x20AC;900 million. Acquisition &#x2013; reduced amount of acquisition, most of the amount here is coming from the M&amp;C Energy Group acquisition that we have made. And in addition to that we made a small acquisition in wiring devices in China during the first half. Capital increased very small number coming from the stock option and restricted share movement, &#x20AC;22 million. And then on the Other line, minus &#x20AC;225 million; a big part of this element is the ForEx impact on the debt. We have more than 50% of our debt which is dollar or dollar-related. So obviously, when the dollar rises versus euro we have an impact on the debt. The rest of the element, around &#x20AC;70 million, is payment that we have made to the pension plan of the company. In total, the debt reached &#x20AC;6.155 billion, and I'll just come back for a second on the performance of the global free cash flow generation over the last 12 months' period, &#x20AC;2.62 billion. It's a record high for the group.</p>
          <p>We keep very strong balance sheet and very strong cash conversion. The cash conversion was described by Jean-Pascal. We have a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio at the end of June 2012 of 1.5 time, very much in line with what we had at the end of 2011. One important element here is to look back at our cash generation, whether in the bad period or in the good period. And you see that over the last five years, the cyclicality of the cash generation has been extremely limited. In fact, we've been quite stable in the cash generation. And why is that? It's because when the time are good, of course we have strong cash generation, but part of that is consumed by working capital growth. But on the contrary, as soon as times are tougher, we are extremely good at managing to reduce the working capital and therefore compensate for a lower growth. And you see that, that gives a very strong cash flow over the last five years.</p>
          <p>One word about the return on capital employed. That's remained clearly in the record that we have been giving, 12.2 points for the last 12 months. You have compared to 2011 the impact of the acquisition that we have made in 2011. That will take some time and some quarters to put them in term of contribution to where we expect them to be, and therefore to compensate for the negative impact. And you have also some mechanical impact coming from the depreciation of the euro versus the dollar, which is having a negative impact on the way we calculate this return on capital employed.</p>
          <p>Jean-Pascal, I hand over to you for the outlook.</p>

          <p>Well, that's going to be brief. Well, first point is that we certainly acknowledge that the world of today is full uncertainty in many parts of the world, but without further deterioration of the economic situation. The end of H1 results make us confirm our guidance at the beginning of the year, which is flat to slightly positive organic sales growth and an adjusted EBITA between 14% and 15%.</p>
          <p>So, thank you for your attention for this quick presentation. And now, we are ready to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning to all of you. So, I've got three questions, actually. The first one relates to the Products versus Solutions mix. The Solutions business grew about 8% in Q1 and was apparently kind of flat in Q2. So, the growth in Solutions seems to be better aligned with that of Products in Q2 now. So, could you comment on how the mix impact on margins has changed between Q1 and Q2 and what should be expected for the second half of the year? Maybe given the backlog you have in the Solutions business, I guess, you have some kind of visibility there.</p>
          <p>The second question is on the Buildings business; this division recorded what is probably the weakest margin ever this time in the first half. So, could you elaborate on the various action plans? Maybe you're taking today to turn around the business and also come back on the long-term strategy for that business. Also, I think you said that your focus on M&amp;A integration was now largely behind you. So, does that mean there are now more acquisitions in the pipeline and that you feel more confident about doing acquisitions in the coming months? And maybe last &#x2013; there would be a fourth question, yeah. Related to the reduction in support function costs, that was quite impressive in the first half; so maybe could you elaborate on the various measures that drove the SG&amp;A cost reduction and maybe the sustainability of these actions going into the second half?</p>

          <p>Ga&#xEB;l, I think fortunately you stop because <mark type="ph" /> Michel (36:03) is telling me many other people are complaining.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, first question Ga&#xEB;l on the Solutions mix, you're right, Q2 was better in terms of mix because the Solutions we're still growing 3% &#x2013; around 3% higher than Products but reduced. Of course compared to the first quarter where the gap was more significant, it's a better mix. Our sense is that for the rest of the year we should see Solutions continuing to grow significantly quicker than Product. Now, I'm not able of course to be more specific, but we would certainly expect this Solutions drive to continue versus the Products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would &#x2013; just to answer terms better, or it's not better, it's &#x2013; these are two business methods, right, higher margin, higher CapEx on Products and lower margin, better asset term on Solutions. And this is what we work upon in parallel, but it's clear that &#x2013; I confirm that we have a selling background in Solutions but the priority, as we said, is to master the Solutions model which we are doing, therefore decelerating the growth rate from differential between Products and Solutions. By the way, the mix swings are also affecting this proportion because some of the countries tend to be more Solutions driven and some of the countries tend to be more Products driven. So, it's also affected by the kind of business we have from one geography to the other one.</p>
          <p>Now, switching on to Buildings, yeah, well, Buildings, as you know, has two character &#x2013; first you have to put Buildings at Schneider in perspective. It's 40% of our business because in Buildings we sell all the active part, which is Power with energy monitoring, very often for partners. So therefore, there is a part of the business which is clearly in our Power business which is having very, very solid dynamics in the first half.</p>
          <p>What we call Buildings in the reporting of our result is the building console part of our business. And there, you have two characteristics. We are more major-country exposed and at the same time, we are driving investment to deploy this business in other geographies. So to answer your question, some of the major countries, they are not at the best of the economic performance. So therefore, the margin on the planning was under pressure and at the same time, we are investing in integration teams, in specialized teams in new geographies and that weighs on the margin. But if you look at the total margin we do with our customers in the Buildings area, we are one of the largest players in the building environment &#x2013; in the active part of the building environment in the world.</p>
          <p>Acquisition, that's a very good question; I wanted to go back on that. We've been not doing major acquisitions in the past 12 months because we had been active one year ago and we wanted to make sure that the acquisition we had made would be well integrated in our company and that all the plans of synergies will be put into place. While this has been done and it has been done very properly, we feel very satisfied about the level of integration of last year's acquisition plus the level of cash generation has been very satisfactory also, and the action plans are well in place to make it sustainable. So, we shall now be more active on the front of acquisition but in a soft manner and with a clear preference for the model of mid to small-sized acquisitions. But we are &#x2013; yes, we're going to be back to acquisitions from now on. Prediction of SFC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On SFC, as always you have two types of measures. You have the very short-term cost control measures which are delaying or suppressing a number of contracts which are necessary sustainable, and then you have the long-term measure that we described in terms of working better and more efficiently. You'll remember that we have an objective over three years to reduce the SFC on the sales ratio. On the first half, we are going to &#x2013; we have achieved 0.4% and nothing that we're going to do has caused the global objective in one year.</p>
          <p>So for the second part of the year, I think that we are going to continue to work on the long-term measure and that should continue to contribute. I am not saying that we would necessarily be as restrictive in the cost evolution. And notably, there are a number of areas we want to continue to invest in terms of R&amp;D, but in terms of new area of growth, new economies, and that could have some impact on the second half.</p>

          <p>Yes. Could you comment on your business evolution and outlook in China, more precisely what you see by end markets currently, what is stabilizing really, what is possibly rebounding?

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Quick word about China; the &#x2013; what we found is that China has stabilized. So, it's in the negatives but single-digit negatives at the level of what we had in Q1. And clearly, we are also comparing to very high figures in 2011. I mean that people have to realize &#x2013; we all have to realize that there was an injection of a stimulus package three years ago in China that was constructed in 2010 and electrified in 2011. So, I believe that for the people with whom we have had a continuous dialogue in the past two years, we always consider that there would be a kind of boom. And then you have oscillations after to come back to a normal trajectory of growth.</p>
          <p>What are we doing in China today? We are moving very actively to the west and putting into place the right lineups of products, the right offers, to address the specific needs of the developing regions of China. I'm not personally concerned about the mid-term perspective of China. We've got striking differences of dynamics between regions. What we see today is that there is probably a renewed investment into the infrastructure under the impulse of the government, which has not yet translated into ourselves. There is also a conversion of the economy from an export-driven model to a consumption-driven model, which means that, for instance, Industry is low at the moment because export &#x2013; machine manufacturers are exporting less at the moment, but we see more dynamics into, for instance, residential power sales, especially in the new regions.</p>
          <p>So at the moment, stabilization, no sign of clear rebound at this stage. I don't expect big rebound before the end of the year or beginning of next year. But we see good dynamics in parts of the economy, the difference of dynamics being more driven by geography than by end segments at this stage. And Industry has been low at &#x2013; during the past &#x2013; during the first half in China because we work a lot with machine manufacturers. We're exporting and we're suffering from the crisis, particularly in Europe.</p>
          <p>Now, one thing that is &#x2013; that I want to underline is that China is obviously very important for Schneider but we also lots of &#x2013; we've spent a lot of our energy in the past three years to diversify the rest of our presence in other new economies and particularly, we've tripled our size in India in two years. We've significantly increased our size in Brazil, doubled our size. We've increased a lot in Russia and in many other places. So, it's a very diverse presence in new economies that we have. We generate a 5% differential with major countries including the negative of China.</p>

          <p>On raw materials, your second question, <mark type="ph" /> Alfred (44:52), It's almost neutral in the first half, very slightly negative. We do expect the second half to be more positive, and therefore the impact excluding the ForEx impact being overall positive for the full year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you very much. Jean-Pascal, two questions please. Firstly, could you put a bit more color on what's going on in industrialization? I know you mentioned China in the previous question, but which segments are doing well and not so well there? Are there segments which are still declining or have they all stabilized? And second question, you mentioned that construction over &#x2013; residential construction the U.S., I think in your Power division in your segment, is doing quite well. So, what do you expect for the commercial construction sector over the next 6 to 12 months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. On industry automation, what &#x2013; don't forget we are &#x2013; in respect to other players, we're probably an earlier-cycle player. We do a lot, for instance, with machine manufacturers on when we rebounded in 2010, we are probably early in nuclear. We've got a component of Solutions and particularly end-user Solutions in this division, which is lesser than in other divisions. Therefore, the backlog is shorter. So, we've certainly &#x2013; in this first half, we've been impacted by the business of machine manufacturers and we are very exposed in Asia with machine manufacturers and particularly in China, as I was explaining, has been weak. And also, some parts of South Europe like Italy which has been left dynamic obviously then due to the present crisis. So, that's one.</p>
          <p>The second point is that we have respect to other players also probably less exposed to the U.S. The U.S. has been dynamic in Industry in the first half. So, what are we doing? We are working to launch to the planned structure, which is our platform of integration for end-user automation, for manufacturing automation, including the very big component of energy management. So, it's a fully integrated platform. It's going to take some time before it is deployed. I'm sure in ourselves. And we are investing also in North America to make sure that we grow our market share in that part of the world.</p>
          <p>Now, when I look at Industry &#x2013; and the last point is that much electrical distribution, motor control centers, panels which are doing automation are not accounted for in our Industry division, same thing as for Buildings that I was mentioning. Some of our competitors mixed together into the same P&amp;L but part of control but also as a part of Power distribution. We are putting the Power part into the Power business. We report it in the Power business. Therefore, our Power business has been very positive and it includes a good deal of Industry business. So, that may explain for the early cycle OEM exposure, geographical exposure, plus the fact that we strictly report &#x2013; or almost strictly report what is linked to automation in our industrial part. And very logically, when the market is rebounding in other parts of the world, we should be an earlier rebounder, as always, in this sector.</p>
          <p>Concerning the U.S. dynamics where we see some rebound but due primarily to variable levels of comparison this year in our Power business. Our Power business is close to double digit in the U.S.; so very good. And it's a good proxy for what we do not own in Buildings and Residential but also in Industry. But I would say, this growth is also well driven by what we do in Industry and in the tech industry, particularly in data centers together with our white space or UPS activity. But we see today &#x2013; yeah, we start to see a rebound which is firmer in the field of Residential, from very low basis on non-Residential business. But this Power business is also sustained by what we do in Power, in Industry and in the tech sector.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. Just a follow-up on industrial information; could you confirm that most key areas of industrial are stabilized in terms of their decline? I mean, I know you have the Japanese inventory-driven tough comparatives last year. But are there any bits in industrial that are really getting worse, or how have all the key elements stabilized do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We see it stabilizing. We see it actually quite stable over the past two quarters. Don't forget that even if we sell lines of products, our strategy is to sell them in Solutions. So, the dynamics are pretty linier or pretty similar or consistent across the lines of products, because at the end of the day they are bundled together by machine manufacturers, system integrators into consistent systems.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; a few questions. The first one goes back to your commentary on integration. Does that mean the fact that you're very happy with the integrations, that Areva and Telvent and the others have pretty much reached your regional targets in terms of synergies? And specifically on Areva, can you comment if the pricing there you have in the rest of the portfolio? Second question would be, you mentioned a few times today that you are less exposed to the U.S. in Industry, and I think you mentioned that the same in one of the other divisions. Does that mean that now your M&amp;A focus is going to be more into the U.S.? And finally, I have a further third question. Are there any areas where you think your market share has moved materially up or down over the last two quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that makes three good questions. Okay. Well, on &#x2013; when I'm saying that I'm happy with the integration it doesn't mean that all the synergies have been put in place, particularly with Telvent which is quite a recent acquisition. It just means that, first, people have been solidly taking their place in the company. I don't take the word integrated. They have taken their place, their responsibilities inside the company, and they know how to operate inside the company. Take a company like Telvent, we are just at the beginning of synergies. So on Areva D is a long integration. As we said many times, it's a complex integration. We are still working on the convergence of the lineups of products. We are still working or putting together completely the teams where we meet always issues of <mark type="ph" /> site (53:01) reporting. But again, the process of merger is well-advanced and a very robust one. So, I feel good about the process, but it doesn't mean that all the synergies are in the bag. On the contrary, we've got still plenty of things to do now more on the revenue side with Areva. But there are still things that will come on the cost as we unified our technical systems in the back office, which will make the collaboration more fluid and easier.</p>
          <p>On the pricing side, frankly it's very valuable by countries and by &#x2013; and this business which is Telvent, Areva and the medium voltage of Schneider Electric is vastly a Solutions business. So, we don't measure the pricing on that part of the business, on the Solutions business. We measure the evolution of the margin. And as you've seen, the margin has been increased at 0.2% in H1 but the very strong semester in this business is particularly the H2, the second semester. So the jury is out, but we feel very confident about the control of our margin in this sector.</p>
          <p>In the Industry, I see you jump too fast into conclusions, we say that we had been integrating over the past 12 months, but we are going to be smoothly back to our preferred profile of acquisitions which is small and medium, but there is no specific focus as the one as you described. We shall keep on reinforcing our presence in Industry as we've done very regularly over the past years. And &#x2013; but no specific point about the place and the purpose of this reinforcement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question, Daniela, was on market share and whether we see that we have been gaining or losing market share. I think that looking at our results, we have assumed that in Power and in IT we've been gaining market share during the first half of the year clearly. Now, if I want to do to &#x2013; to look to the negative element, in Industry, globally because of the mix, as Jean-Pascal described, we've been losing market share. Now, when we look at our end market precisely, which is of course somewhat different to some of our competitors, we don't think that we have been losing market share. We have been forming the trend of the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On &#x2013; back to Industry, I &#x2013; personally, I'm very satisfied of the dynamics we've add over the past years in Industry. The topic was to make sure really that we did have solid platforms for integration. We've created one very straight platform with which we are gaining market share, which is measuring structure for OEMs, while too bad at the moment the market is having negative dynamics. But we are clearly gaining market share because we see it from people converting to our platform.</p>
          <p>And we just came out during this semester with a complete platform for end-user automation, for manufacturing automation that we're going to be launching. So from the platform point of view, everything has been really rationalized and put into place. The second point was to make sure that we will be in the top league in terms of profitability towards the reserves of investment and we are really able to consider further development, which clearly we've done. We are in the first thing in terms of profitability. So, now it's &#x2013; we have to develop and I would so speak that we're going to do a lot organically, pushing the platforms we have through our networks on the markets on which we have access.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. It's Martin Prozesky. Few questions, please. First, on Infrastructure, just a few more questions on the dynamics we saw there. I understand that it's the most seasonal business or the second half being the biggest of all the divisions, can you just give us an explanation why &#x2013; and is that the key reason why the margin is so much stronger in H2, or is there also some mix effects in H2, just why is it actually so big? And then, second on IT, I think you've given quite a few reasons for why the margin was so strong, especially pricing kind of end-solution services that includes quite a lot of mix. Is this now kind of the sustainable level we should look at in terms of margin in that division? It looks like it's close to a record level for this division.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Infrastructure, on the seasonality, that's principally your customers' attitude. I've seen people want to have their project finished by the end of the year. So, we see more realization on invoicing happening at the end of the year. And that's true for some categories of the major customers we have there. So, it seems to be a kind of full &#x2013; habit in the market that we have been observing for many years now. It's due really to our customers' attitude.</p>
          <p>The second, on the IT performance, I think one of the major reasons is coming from the very good results of what we do in the data center space, which is more and more asking for easy-to-install, quick-to-install, quick-to-commission full solutions. And we're probably the only player able to respond of the full system from the delivery of energy from the grid till the servers in the data center. We supply everything guaranteed by Schneider, medium voltage, low voltage, transfer switch, all the white space, all the security of the building, all the thermal control of the building, all of this into one software repository.</p>
          <p>On &#x2013; for an industry which is dealing with very critical missions and with big responsibilities, this has a tremendous value. Not only we ensure it during the commissioning of the system, but we guarantee the reliability. And remember that reliability remains a key value of this market, all over the lifecycle of the data center, because we have an unmatchable network for services helping our customers wherever they are in the world. So, this has driven the performance in H1 and, I would say, across the past year, creating a real difference on this part of the market. And this market is going on &#x2013; through major evolutions, the move to the cloud, the collocation, needs to review, revisit many of the data centers, many of the installations, plus the pressure on energy in many cases, price of energy, makes people privilege our Solutions which are very energy-efficient.</p>
          <p>Now back to your question, is it easy to peak? Is it &#x2013; well, we're going &#x2013; it's linked to the mix, mix of business we take, mix of cycles in the project. In this business, you take projects at low margin, but then you can count on services which come at a higher margin to balance these things. Things vary from geography to the other one. Well, we estimate that we have an advantage today and we want to push the advantage to defend and to grow a good level of margin in this business. I can't &#x2013; I don't want to anticipate about the future margins anyway.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just one follow-up on the Infrastructure side; so just to be clear on H2, so it's mostly volume that gives us a margin uplift in H2 on Infrastructure, there's no real mix effect in terms of the type of volume uplift we see in the second half?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. So a couple of questions please. Maybe coming back to China, can you remind us how much of your sales there go through distributors? And have you noticed, like some competitors mentioned, a significant destocking/restocking phase in the first half of the year in that region although your sales were about the same? Secondly, I think historically you mentioned that the typical margin spread for Schneider H1/H2 was around on average 150 basis points and you hinted previously that maybe with Telvent and Areva D it could go higher. Is that still a fair comment based on the H1 performance? And thirdly, in terms of the impact on the bridge, maybe this has been asked before, I'm not sure. Of the Solutions business in H1, is it also fair to say that it should be dramatically lower in H2 as you decided at the end of last year to slow down a bit the growth of that business? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for these couple of three questions &#x2013; go through the answers. So China, sales through distributors, I should know it but I don't have the exact percentage, but it's a large majority of our sales, okay. We have a traditional strong relationship with distributors. We sometimes created our presence together and we've been actively working together with the distribution to develop our presence in China and by the way sharing success in China together. So it's &#x2013; the proportion of what we do through distribution in China is higher than the average of the company and the average of the company is around 50%, 55%. Now, have we seen stocking and destocking in China? Yes, right, but it doesn't seem that today there is abnormal level of stock &#x2013; or inventory at our distributors. It might have been a bit at the end of June but nothing which is unusual.</p>
          <p>On the H1/H2...</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the 1.5 points, indeed this is the average when you look at the past. So, we think it's important to look at the past because that helps us to understand the future. Now, it doesn't mean that it has been every year 1.5 points, and you have seen some significant difference. So, we are guiding to the fact that the difference is going to be 1.5 or even more, because you have Telvent of &#x2013; Areva. We are just saying, by nature, by construction, there is, observed through the past, a significant difference between H1 and H2. And we see no reason why it shouldn't be the case this year. Now, we see exactly what is the magnitude of this difference between H1 and H2 and we were describing the fact that the Infrastructure business is having a skew toward the second part of the year. That's true. So, it has been slightly reinforced by the acquisition of Telvent after Areva. And we're not seeing that globally this would have a major impact at the group level. That can have some impact, but relatively marginal to my sense.</p>

          <p>On the Solutions business, we kind of already answered that question. If you want to add on that one...?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the fact that the &#x2013; I mean we do &#x2013; we have seen, as I've said, in Q2 a lower difference between Solutions and Products. And now, we certainly do expect for the rest of the year Solutions to grow quicker than Products and therefore a significant gap to remain between the two.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Andreas Willi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions, please. The first one on profitability in acquisitions, it was a bit lower, the contribution to the earnings which &#x2013; than I had expected. Maybe you could comment there. Is it specifically because of the issues Telvent has in Southern Europe or is profitability of the acquired businesses as you would have expected it? And the second question on the Buildings business, you mentioned public spending impacting the turnover there. Is it because public spending is also coming &#x2013; cutting back on energy efficiency projects, even though those projects may be beneficial on a two or five-year view, they're no longer as attractive in the short term, as municipalities and cities cut back on spending? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first one. On the profitability on acquisition, I mentioned that it's very much in line with our expectation. Here again, there is a seasonality impact which will play, which is even more noticeable for Telvent that you have seen that last year. So, so far, I'm going to say that we are on track to deliver with &#x2013; to deliver what we were expecting from acquisition for this year. So, nothing specific to mention really during this first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the Buildings business, the impact of public spending, we are referring in &#x2013; to the U.S. when we are mentioning that. On one side, you've got two aspects; public spending can affect the equipment of new buildings and probably there is less &#x2013; what we mean is that there is less on this side because public spending is diminishing. On the other side, we see the other kind of attitude of people being faced &#x2013; been facing bill increases and wanting to decrease their costs, which creates an opportunity for our technology. But also when you are speaking about that, you speak a lot about performance contracting. And then performance contracting is made of projects that some quarters are better than others from that point of view. I never said let's see in the world some positive trends from energy efficiency, performance contracting point of view.</p>
          <p>Clearly, you see, while the price of energy has really increased in a very strong manner last year, which is raising numbers of questions for many countries. And we've seen countries like Japan, like Germany going through energy transitions which are quite ambitious for different reasons or for reasons which are partially linked. And on &#x2013; from that point of view, the recent change of government in France is probably good news for us because the new government has decided to go more for efficiency, for energy efficiency, for renewables, and this implies the usage of most of the technologies that we have been developing in the past 10 years. So, we have certainly a lot to offer into the new orientation of France, for instance. And this is happening in other countries; no need to remind you that Europe today is not complaining &#x2013; complying with its 2020 objectives of carbon emission reduction but more so of energy efficiency across borders, and these will need to be addressed.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning. It's Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions; the first one, just going back to the support function cost, I don't think you mentioned that some of the investments haven't quite started. I think that you mentioned six months ago that there'll be a &#x20AC;200 million ramp-up in R&amp;D investment over the next two or three years. Should we read from that, that hasn't yet started and if so, how much should we expect to come in the second half of the year? And the second question was just coming back to pricing, is it better that you're expecting the second half the carryover effect from the pricing put up earlier in the half or have prices gone up again over the last month or so? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Should I take both? On the R&amp;D investment, I'm not sure to understand what is your reference of &#x20AC;200 million. We certainly say and we can confirm that we're going to increase the R&amp;D spending. That has been clearly the case over the first half of the year. And yes indeed, we have continued to grow on a regular basis our R&amp;D spending. And when I was describing the expected evolution for the SFC for the second part of the year, I did refer to this R&amp;D increase and other investments that we intend to make. So indeed, that's part of things that we have already seen in the first half and that will continue to develop in the second half. On the pricing, we had a lot of action, of course, to react to the very strong raw material inflation around the middle of the year 2011. That has generated a significant increase in the second half of 2011. As expected, we embarked a positive carryover impact and that we have seen largely this impact throughout the first half of the year. As the last part of what has been done, delivered, both second part of 2011 and first part of 2012, now we still have some carryover impact positive, but much more reduced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But price has gone up again for some products over the last month or so, or has that largely stopped?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. No, clearly we were targeting &#x20AC;100 million to &#x20AC;150 million at the beginning of the year in terms of positive carryover impacts so now we are guiding to around &#x20AC;200 million. So, that means that in addition to the carryover impact we have been putting a number of price increases.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. James Moore from Redburn. Mr. Moore please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Sorry, we'll just take this last question for time concern, okay. So, this will be the last question for this section before we close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi everybody it's James at Redburn. Jean-Pascal, I've got a number of questions. On the SFC cost, you used to give us a number for what the saving was versus the salary inflation. Could you do that for the first half and say what you think the saving will be in the second half?</p>
          <p>On the raw material, you said the second half will be positive. I think we can see that from metal price developments. But is that number going to be closer to &#x20AC;100 million or &#x20AC;50 million? On Solutions, you said that you want to increase the margin by 2% or more. Could you give us a sense of what the first half increase in the Solutions margin has been against the first half of last year to give us a feel of how much has been achieved? And in the Infrastructure division, could you say roughly where margins are for the three pieces of Schneider, Areva D and Telvent at the moment and really where the biggest upside is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a lot of &#x2013; any more detail you want? Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can take for what clearly is financial analysis. On the SFC evolution, I mean you can make your assumption on inflation, but probably we have been impacted by &#x20AC;80 million to &#x20AC;90 million of inflation. So, you see the kind of saving that we have generated to compensate that so just looking at inflation means. On the RMI, I expect a few tens of million, but I don't expect to get to &#x20AC;100 million throughout the second part of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On the Solutions, we say that increasing our margin by 2% is an objective over three years. So, it's not certainly achieved in one first half. So, it's something that we are driving across the quarters. We are &#x2013; I'm optimistic because I see a lot of mastery, a lot of energy spending, understanding better what we are doing, in pricing better, in evaluating better, in managing also the pricing over the duration of the project. So, we see something &#x2013; an objective that I feel confident we are going to be in a position to achieve. But certainly, we've not achieved that in the first half. It has been a gradual improvement.</p>
          <p>Then Infrastructure, well, I see potential everywhere. But I see on the Areva plus Schneider million voltage a potential of synergies which is well balanced between the cost and the revenues. And actually, today there is far more on costs than on the revenues because we really decided to put the emphasis on making sure the merger will be well done. And there are a lot of things that can be rationalized across the two entities.</p>
          <p>On the Telvent side, the biggest potential is with synergies, because we didn't have the equivalent at Schneider. We can plug in the software and the capabilities of Telvent into our systems, but there is no equivalent today inside Schneider. And this takes a little bit of time because, well, we &#x2013; Telvent, if I summarize, was mostly an Americas &#x2013; North American, South Americas presence plus an Iberian presence, Spain. Clearly, we are coping with what &#x2013; the crisis in Spain and we are counterbalancing the effect of the Spanish crisis with what we do in other parts of the world. The old scope or the old target we have with Telvent is to open the doors of the world to the teams of Telvent. And we are doing that very actively in cities with global customers but it just takes a little bit of time. And the time you make the commercial production to your customer that you stop to work on a project and the time that this project translates itself, it will take certainly some time. But again, there are a lot of positive signals that the mix of Telvent or the production of Telvent in Schneider will be very positive. But it's going to be more a revenue upside than a cost upside.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to be clear, you think from the outside we'll see more progression from the Areva side of the Infrastructure development on margin, more so than the Telvent in the next year or so?</p>
