          <p>Thanks for joining us today in this room or online. Today is Valentine's Day or Ballantine's Day as we call it internally. But well, I guess this is not the only reason why you are with us, even if you're in love with Pernod Ricard. So to present our half-year results, we have today on stage, Pierre Pringuet, CEO and Vice President of the Board of Pernod Ricard; Alexandre Ricard, CEO &#x2013; Deputy CEO and COO; and Gilles Bogaert, Managing Director, in charge of Finance. They will take one hour also to walk you through the presentation, and then we'll have time for your question. So Pierre, the floor is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Yes we can toast St. Valentine, the results are good. Of course, I will share the presentation with Alexandre and Gilles. So let's go quickly to the introduction.</p>
          <p>So good performance and of course, this is despite the less buoyant environment. You probably remember that when we presented our full-year result last August, we did say yes, you have to expect that the environment would be less buoyant.</p>
          <p>Having said that, this is the case obviously, for Southern Europe but emerging market continue with seeing very dynamic growth, with a slightly slower pace but really with double-digit growth, I mean, it's good in many countries. And U.S., U.S. is good. I mean, that's really the good news. I mean the &#x2013; we &#x2013; it's almost two years now that we have good performance in this very, very important market.</p>
          <p>We have the technical impact, mainly it's about France. And the loading of the trade which we did last November, December 2011 in anticipation of the duty hike which took place on January 1 and you can see that it's a significant impact. It represents in term of profits, &#x20AC;64 million. We have also the Chinese New Year. It will be slightly later this year than the year before, which means that we have a more modest impact of &#x20AC;8 million under profit. That would be detailed later on by Alexandre.</p>
          <p>Numbers now, so sales &#x20AC;4.9 billion, which is plus 6%; organically, it's plus 3%. And if you exclude the impact of the trade loading in France and Chinese New Year, it is plus 5%. And we think that's the true underlying performance of the group.</p>
          <p>And the profit from the recurring operation &#x20AC;1.459 billion, again, plus 6% that's the reported growth; organically is plus 1%. But if you exclude, again, the technical impact of the trade loading in France and Chinese New Year, it's plus 7%.</p>
          <p>We do believe that the underlying trend of our business are these plus 5% in term of sales and plus 7% for the profit. And you can see that yes, it has a positive impact on the operating margin and again on the right hand side column at 29% plus 8% (sic) [29.8%] (3:35), that's an improvement of 68 basis point.</p>
          <p>There is also this element of comparison, basis of comparison. If you look at the top of this chart, 2011/2012, Q1 and Q2 were extremely high at plus 11% and then Q3 and Q4, respectively, at plus 3% and plus 4%. If you compare now that with our performance this year, you can see that the plus 5% is very much in line or even slightly improving from the last two quarters. And the second quarter reported a plus 1% that, excluding the technical impact, at plus 5% is very much in line with the first quarter. So we can say that we have a steady and consistent growth rate of 5% organic sales, excluding this technical element.</p>
          <p>Regarding the portfolio, we obviously were &#x2013; we had a very good performance overall with our Top 14, but also of our key local brands. And again and in the combination of having international and very strong local brands is for us a very important asset. Indeed we have very good growth with Martell and Jameson. We have a good performance on white spirit but a rapid slowdown of Scotch whisky, but it is also a question of a high base of comparison. Chivas was, for instance, double digit in the first half of last year. So the comparison of two &#x2013; the basis of comparison is taken into account.</p>
          <p>We have continuous favorable price mix, and this is the case for Top 14. Alexandre will give the numbers later on. And a very strong dynamism of our Indian whiskies, and whereas in this country, we're strengthening our leadership position in the premium end of those locally made whiskies, and the premium end is, by far, by far, the most dynamic part of the market.</p>
          <p>By market now. Emerging markets are still buoyant, I mean plus 14% overall, with Asia plus 13%, China 18%, India 17%. Definitely these are two main growth drivers that many other countries like Vietnam, for instance, are still developing fast. Strong dynamism in Eastern Europe at plus 12%, and this is mainly driven by Russia, Ukraine, Poland.</p>
          <p>And in mature market, well we said contracted solid growth in the U.S., that's what I mentioned earlier, of plus 9%. I mean we can be very pleased with that performance.</p>
          <p>France of course, the reported growth looks appalling, minus 28%. But again this is really the counter-effect of the trade loading last year. If you look at what we consider &#x2013; the underlying trend is more in the low-single-digit decline, so minus 2%, minus 3%. If you for instance at the Nielsen numbers, the market is at minus 3%, Pernod Ricard is at minus 1%. So we're overperforming the market. So at the end of the day, we are we can say that our performance is certainly satisfactory in France in the context of the duty hike.</p>
          <p>And challenging environments in Southern Europe, particularly in Spain. Having said that we had a good month of January. So there must be some movement in some of &#x2013; stocking in this country.</p>
          <p>So overall, the pattern which you know well I mean. And definitely the worldwide exposure. I mean Pernod Ricard, where the world &#x2013; where the 80 countries and all the affiliates give us the opportunity to capture every single growth relay in this market for the wine and spirits. Alexandre?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Pierre. So again, as Pierre mentioned, our half year net sales grew organically by 3%, or by 5% excluding technical impacts mainly related to the French pre-buying in December 2012 ahead of the duty hike. Second key message, basically very marginal group structure impact. And thirdly, a very favorable Forex impact with the euro-dollar parity at $1.27 over the first semester versus $1.38 the year before.</p>
          <p>If we have a quick look, a quick zoom on the quarter, on the October, November, December quarter, net of growth of 1%. But again if we exclude technical impacts, it's 5%. And here the message is very clear. As Pierre mentioned, it's perfectly in line with the trends we experienced in our Q1.</p>
          <p>So if we look at the regions, this is the summary table. I'm going to dive in each one of them. But overall what we can say is dynamic growth of 11% in Asia/Rest of the World, strong growth of 6% in the Americas region, a contrasted performance in Europe excluding France of minus 1%. But again that's related to an ongoing bipolarization with Western Europe down 4%, but a very dynamic Eastern Europe up 12%. And finally the decline in France, I'll dive into this later on, but as Pierre mentioned, largely exacerbated by technical and conjunctural impacts.</p>
          <p>So to start with our most important region, which is 41% of our net sales from a group point of view. Asia up 11% organically with &#x2013; from a brand point of view, Martell, very strong growth, very dynamic performance of Martell, up 25%.</p>
          <p>And this despite the slight economic slowdown in China. Just to mention as well, a very marginal impact related to the Chinese New Year and this is just because of our commercial strategy aiming at preempting the shelves on the ground in China ahead of Chinese New Year.</p>
          <p>Very dynamic performance of our Indian whisky portfolio, up 21%. We have strengthened our leadership in the most profitable and most dynamic segment of deluxe and premium whiskies. We've increased our share up 4% in this most attractive segment.</p>
          <p>Our Top 14 Scotch whiskies have had marginal growth in our H1. This is principally related to a challenging South Korean market for Scotch whiskies and second, for conjunctural decline in China.</p>
          <p>Our new growth drivers in Asia have developed very well with Absolut, for instance, in Asia up 38%, with our champagne, Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t and Mumm, and finally our wines, which have grown 20% in Asia.</p>
          <p>Imperial &#x2013; South Korea up 12%. Market share gains albeit bolstered by price hikes, so pre-buying in December because we increased our prices on January 1. And finally, 100 Pipers, which is still suffering, down 7% mainly driven by Thailand.</p>
          <p>From a market point of view, well very dynamic growth still in China, up 18%. As I mentioned, driven by Martell, up 27%, which continues to gain share. Conjunctural difficulties as mentioned in the Scotch whiskey market. The whole market as well is down. And very strong growth of Absolut and Jacob's Creek are key growth relays.</p>
          <p>In Vietnam strong double-digit growth for our key brands such as Chivas, Martell and Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>India, overall up 17%, driven both by our local Indian whiskies, Royal Stag, Blenders Pride, Imperial Blue, but as well by other brands such as 100 Pipers. And clearly as well, our Top 14 brands posting strong double-growth as well.</p>
          <p>Africa and Middle East up 13%, clearly driven by our Top 14 brands. All of our whiskies in that region are posting strong double-digit growth. Just to remind you that we have recently opened subsidiaries or offices in Namibia, in Kenya, in Angola and Ghana or &#x2013; in Morocco or even in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>Travel retail continues to be dynamic, up 15% driven by our premiumization strategy in high-end brands. South Korea, as I mentioned, there is a decline of the traditional on-trade market, which we are compensating with targeting the modern on-trade with some of our key brands, mainly Absolut.</p>
          <p>Thailand, the environment remains challenging but our Top 14 brands are growing strongly.</p>
          <p>Japan, up 3%, which is very good growth driven by our Top 14 brands, especially Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t and Mumm, which are both posting strong double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Finally, Australia, strong growth for our Top 14, but again, our high-value strategy for our premium wine brands has resulted in a slight sales decline in our first half.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Americas which is 26% of our group sales. Americas posted a solid 6% organic growth driven by our Top 14 up 7% with Jameson, Glenlivet, Absolut and Malibu driving this growth. Our priority wines have continued to grow principally in Canada, where they posted double-digit growth. And it's fair to mention as well, very strong double-digit growth for some of our key local brands, such as Something Special in Venezuela or Passport in Mexico.</p>
          <p>Moving on to the U.S. within the Americas region. Clearly U.S. is the key growth engine for Americas, posted a solid 9% organic growth. There's dynamic consumption for Pernod Ricard brands in the U.S. If you look at the Nielsen or NABCA numbers, Nielsen, our volumes were up 1%, 4% in value, NABCA 2% and 6% in value. Clearly driven by the Top 14 with a very strong price mix impact of 3%.</p>
          <p>As well as it would be interesting to mention the very good performance of some of our other brands such as Avi&#xF3;n, which is doing extremely well, very promising start for Avi&#xF3;n, Mumm Cuv&#xE9;e Napa, Seagram's Gin up 3%, or the promising launch of Oddka. I'll just dwell on it a little bit later on.</p>
          <p>And if you look at all of our Premium brands, whether it's Absolut with 1% increase in net sales. We started increasing prices in six states. We're launching next month Elyx. With Jameson still speeding up at plus 24%. Malibu up 10% with a confirmed growth, thanks to the innovation strategy behind Malibu. Beefeater up 16% with the revival of the gin category. Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t up 17% with a strong price and mix impact and very good performance of Belle Epoque within the range. And finally Glenlivet where we have increased our price, very strong pricing power. The brand is up 21%.</p>
          <p>Brazil, well a favorable underlying trends. If we look at the Nielsen data with Absolut posting 20% growth or Chivas 12% or Ballantine's 25%. Now we are &#x2013; we have had a slight sales decline in the first half. This is mainly due to a difference between shipments and depletions related to the tax reform over there and the decrease in stocks in the market.</p>
          <p>Mexico, well renewed growth, 8% during the last quarter, 5% over the six months. And you can start seeing that the new business model is in place when you look at the very favorable price mix up 7% for our top 14 strategic brands.</p>
          <p>Canada, the growth is driven principally by our wines, posting double-digit growth, Jacob's Creek primarily but as well Wiser's, Glenlivet or Jameson.</p>
          <p>Travel Retail has been stable. This is due to an unfavorable comparison versus last year, but the trend will clearly improve. We've seen it already improve in Q2 and should improve further in the second half.</p>
          <p>And finally, well very strong performances most of the other markets. Just to take an example, in the Andean markets, up 20%.</p>
          <p>Europe, one-quarter of our group net sales, up &#x2013; well actually down minus 1% but a contrasted performance with the ongoing bipolarization. On one side you have a very dynamic Eastern market up 12% and a challenging Western European market down 4%.</p>
          <p>From a brand point of view, the key growth driver are our Top 14 strategic brands, with Jameson, Chivas, Absolut, Havana Club and Beefeater driving that growth. The first half has been challenging for Ballantine's, which is down 7%, with a difficult Scotch market in Spain, which the Scotch market in Spain is down 9%.</p>
          <p>Overall stability for our wines, which is very encouraging given our premiumization strategy. And finally our key local brands have posted a slight decline with again, contrasted performance with, on one side, strong growth of ArArAt, Olmeca, Seagram's Gin in Spain or Wyborowa in Poland. And on the other side, a challenging first half for Ramazzotti related to commercial issues, Ruavieja in Spain or Becherovka in Czech Republic, which was hit by an overall industry ban for a couple weeks in September.</p>
          <p>So from a market point of view, Eastern Europe up 12%, mainly driven by Russia, which was up 22%. Poland has experienced a slight decline, but that's mainly due to local vodka brands. But on the international brands, strong growth, except for Ballantine's, where we have a clear premiumization strategy with a strong price mix impact of 5%. Czech Republic, as I mentioned, related to a ban of two weeks back in September. Strong growth in Ukraine, driven by Jameson, Absolut, Ballantine's, ArArAt, and actually all of our brands. Just to mention as well, Kazakhstan, very promising market, up 29%, good market of 20 million people.</p>
          <p>Western Europe, well the decline mainly driven by a challenging Southern Europe and Spain's decline, minus 9%. And as Pierre mentioned earlier, actually we had a pretty good month of January.</p>
          <p>Now France, 8% of group sales, clearly a decline of 28% exacerbated number one, by very strong technical effects, and number two, by conjunctural effects. Technical effects represent close to &#x20AC;100 million from a net sales point of view. And excluding that technical impact, we're down 11%. Now that's mainly as well due to conjunctural effects, which we have here on the chart. Residual inventory in market in Q1 2012/2013, lower inventories mainly due to a prioritization by our key customers on beer ahead of the duty hike on beer, and finally, promotional offers that were not repeated this year.</p>
          <p>So the actual real underlying trend on a net sales point of view specifically for Pernod Ricard is actually minus 3%. And if you look at the market trends from a Nielsen point of view, as Pierre mentioned, we have gained share. The market is down 3% in volume terms, and this is the Nielsen off-trade data. And Pernod Ricard was down just 1%.</p>
          <p>The most challenging category, the one that had suffered most, is the Pastis category. But in that category, Ricard has gained share, down 3% versus minus 5% for the category. Some of our brands have suffered, such as Malibu and Chivas. But very strong performance of some of our other strategic brands, such as Ballantine's up 4%, Jameson up 5%, Absolut double-digit growth, and to mention Havana Club, the best performance, all brands in the industry in France. Some tactical brands as well have performed very well. So overall France, market share gains.</p>
          <p>Very briefly and from a brand's point of view, so our premium brands now represent three-quarters of our sales, so their weight is increasing. Strong growth excluding technical impacts, up 7% for our top 14, 2% for our wines, 8% for our local 18 key brands, and the rest minus 3%. Therefore, posting a 5% increase in net sales.</p>
          <p>Just to mention we have a zoom on our top 14 brands. Despite minus 5% and plus 4% from the sales point of view, if we exclude technical impacts, volumes were almost stable and sales grew 7%.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the table here, you'll see that all of our brands have posted a positive price mix, which is very good, up 8% excluding organic &#x2013; excluding technical impacts. And this is because we have &#x2013; we're focusing three quarters of our investments behind them, and actually they represent 90% of the growth of our A&amp;P over the semester.</p>
          <p>So I've mentioned the price mix is favorable, very favorable. Excellent performance of Martell up 23% and Jameson up 13%.</p>
          <p>Our white spirits have performed very strongly. Absolut is recovering in the U.S. and is experiencing very strong growth in emerging markets. Havana Club has improved in terms of trends, driven by Europe, Germany in particular, and as I mentioned, France as well. And Beefeater is growing very well in the U.S. I mentioned, but as well in Europe in difficult and challenging markets such as the U.S. &#x2013; such as Spain, sorry.</p>
          <p>Near stability for our Scotch whiskies but again they grew very strongly last year during the same period up 12%. There is a very favorable price mix for all of our Scotch whiskies. And again, as I mentioned, conjunctural slower growth in China, structural slower growth in South Korea, difficulties in Spain, and a few unfavorable technical impacts.</p>
          <p>The decline of Ricard, I mentioned it, principally to technical and conjunctural effects.</p>
          <p>And finally, contrasted performance of our champagne brands. Very strong performance of Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t and Belle Epoque driven actually by all regions, and a decline of Mumm, which is primarily due to a strong exposure to European markets, including and specifically France.</p>
          <p>Our wine strategy, very encouraging, stable volumes, 2% net sales growth and double-digit growth from a profitability point of view with a strong diversification from a geographical point of view, which helps profitability especially driven by Asia.</p>
          <p>Our 18 key local brands have grown excluding technical impacts by 8% in volumes and 8% in sales. This is principally driven by our Indian whiskies up 21%, but as well by Passport, which were targeting the emerging middle class with, up 14%.</p>
          <p>Strong performance of brands such as ArArAt, Olmeca especially in Russia, or Something Special especially in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Imperial, again bolstered by a price hike on January 1. And finally a few, well, brands that are challenged, such as Pastis 51 and Clan Campbell, but as well with the unfavorable technical impact.</p>
          <p>Very briefly, you have it in your slides, premiumization, innovation, expansion into new territories or consumption modes. Well we've just gathered a few examples of marketing initiatives or innovations, such as partnerships in the art and fashion community with Pernod and Maison Kitsun&#xE9; or Ricard with Mathieu Mercier or Perrier-Jou&#xEB;t with Claire Coles or the partnership between Absolut and Art Basel.</p>
          <p>From a consumer base point of view, expanding into new consumption modes with Kahl&#xFA;a Midnight launched in the U.S.; or Brancott Estate Flight, lower in alcohol wine, just 9%; with Chivas Brothers Blend, much smoother, exclusive to the travel retail market; or Malibu Island Spiced, stronger taste but lower in calories.</p>
          <p>Limited editions with the very, very successful Absolut Unique. Just to remind you, that is 4 million bottles, each and every single one of them unique. Or Jameson, great urban escapes. We have here as well Ballantine's.</p>
          <p>From a flavor point of view as well, we've been very dynamic. Oddka, I mentioned it earlier, has just been launched. Innovative flavors such as Fresh Cut Glass &#x2013; uh yeah, Grass, sorry, such as Apple Pie or even Electricity. Kahl&#xFA;a, a new holiday flavors. Other examples as well from a consumer experience point of view, with Ricard Twist'R to have people try and taste Ricard under new forms. And new Rituals with a cocktail approach or a pack-in offering approach with convenience packs for Ritual. Or convenient format such as the Kahl&#xFA;a cans.</p>
          <p>As well from a digital point of view, we've been very active creating buzz with the Havana Club Gap Year. If you want to take a full year off, well there's a nice competition going on on the Web. With Ballantine's, where actually you can transform pictures into music. And with the iPad app that we have developed for The Glenlivet.</p>
          <p>And finally, regarding our very premium brand Martell, we've developed a new ad campaign stressing the authenticity of Martell, but as well we have the same regarding the Mojito Embassy for Havana Club or This is my London communication campaign, very successful in Spain for Beefeater. Or again The Legacy Tasting program for The Glenlivet. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Alexandre. Let's go back to the figures. Talking with that overview of the summary income statements. As we can see, as Pierre and Alexandre said, we had a good performance. Excluding the technical effects, organic growth for sales was up 5%, it was even more than that for the operating profits up 7%. And we have some operating margin expansion by 68 basis points.</p>
          <p>Looking at the different effects on the operating profits, from an organic growth standpoint, it was up 1%; 7% if we exclude the technical effects. And as Alexandre said, we had a very favorable ForEx impact in the first half because of a stronger U.S. dollar. ForEx will be obviously different in the second half. Currently the price of euro-dollar is near from $1.34. And last year it was $1.30. So as a consequence, for the full fiscal year 2012/2013, we estimate that the price impact on profits from recurring operations should be slightly positive.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the gross margin. As you can see, there was a significant increase in the ratio, up 146 basis points excluding technical effects. Forex was favorable for 50 basis points, but we also have numerous positive business elements like the portfolio mix, which was positive with the Top 14 sales growth higher than the group growth. We had a positive quality mix in particular among the Top 14 brands, representing a 4% positive impact. We have managed to increase prices on average on Top 14 up 4%. And at the same time, we've been able to control the evolution of our input cost, which excluding mix effects were up only 3%.</p>
          <p>In terms of A&amp;P, we have increased the A&amp;P by 4%. They were clearly allocated to our priority brands and priority markets. Top 14 was up 5%. We had double-digit growth in both the U.S. and the emerging markets. On the other hand, we had some optimization in the less buoyant markets. We had near stability of A&amp;P in mature markets. At the same time, we were preserving investments in strategic priorities, even in tough market like Spain, where we decided to keep some investments to sustain the launch of the Ritual brand by Havana Club.</p>
          <p>The A&amp;P-to-net-sales ratio was almost stable despite unfavorable technical effects. There were some phasing of Absolut investments, because last year investment were lower in the first half as compared to the second half. And in Russia we have pragmatically decided to focus the media spend in the first half. As you can see the A&amp;P increase in first half was clearly above net sales increase, because of the media restrictions taking place on the 1 of January 2013.</p>
          <p>In terms of structure costs there was a continued increase in resources allocated to rapidly expanding markets. As you can see we have increased our structure costs in emerging markets by 28% and at the same time, we have almost stability in mature markets. We have the continued expansion of the distribution network, in particular in our most buoyant emerging markets, China, India and Russia, where we still have some geographical expansion to do. And we have also opened new subsidiaries in Africa and approximately 100 people were recruited in that region.</p>
          <p>At the same time we have reduction on the structure costs in the less buoyant markets. In Western Europe, they were down 2%. In France, they were down 5%.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the current fiscal year, we will finalize the resource expansion cycle originating from the Agility project, which was a &#x2013; it was a company project that was launched in 2010. And whose priorities were reinforcing our competencies in innovation, in digital, in HR. We have also created a Pernod Ricard University.</p>
          <p>So as a consequence the profit from recurring operations is up 7% organically, excluding the technical effects. The operating margin was up 68 basis points, excluding again those technical effects, because there was a significant increase in gross margin, driven as we saw by premiumization, price increases, and input cost control. We also had a control A&amp;P expenditure, and we benefited from a favorable ForEx, which contributed at 28 basis points to operating margin expansion.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the overview by region from a profit standpoint. As you can see, Asia/Rest of the World continued strong growth, up 19%, same pace as last year. Americas up 6% with some acceleration driven by the U.S.</p>
          <p>Europe excluding France there was some slowdown due to Southern Europe, but yet as we saw excellent trend still ongoing in Eastern Europe. And in France, the decline was largely exacerbated by technical and conjunctural effects. You can see that this year it's down 51% and last year at the same period of time it was up 47%, so it clearly shows the importance of those technical factors.</p>
          <p>You have here the breakdown of sales and profit by region. I think it shows the importance &#x2013; the growing importance of Asia/Rest of the World, which now represents almost half of the profit, some 46% of the profit in the first half. And it also shows the more and more limited dependence from the group on the Euro area. In first half it was limited to 20% of the group net sales.</p>
          <p>Splits between emerging markets and mature markets, I think that shows again the increased weight of emerging markets, almost half of the group profits. And interestingly enough, you can see that this expansion has a positive impact on the margins, so the profit's growing at a faster pace than the net sales.</p>
          <p>So covering the different regions from profit standpoints. In Asia very strong growth in operating profits, up 19% organically, well above the 11% organic sales growth, thanks to an excellent increase in gross margins, which continues to benefit from an improved price and mix, positive ForEx impact also. And A&amp;P was up organically 6%. We also benefited from economies of scale for this A&amp;P in major markets and brands. And as a consequence, we had a substantial improvement in operating margin rate from 31% to 33.6%.</p>
          <p>The Americas, there was a strong increase in the gross margin rates, 300 basis points. Almost half of it being organic, thanks to a positive price and mix. We have increased our A&amp;P expenditure in that first half up 13%, so clearly above net sales. That's logical. This is a region where we have a lot of growth ambitions, so we put resources behind that objective. And there was also a technical affecting impact between the first half and second half of last year.</p>
          <p>And we continue to increase the resources allocated to our route-to-market enhancements, structure costs were up 8% in particular in Latin America.</p>
          <p>Europe, there was a gross margin increase, 1% despite the 1% decline of net sales, thanks to Eastern Europe, which compensate for a challenging environment in Southern Europe.</p>
          <p>There was a substantial 7% increase in A&amp;P expenditure in the first half. So the ratio was up because of two conjunctural factors. The first one I mentioned, so media spend in Russia, which was focused on the first half before the advertising restriction came into effect on the 1 of January 2013, and also, as I said, the spend on Ritual in Spain to support the development of this new strategic product.</p>
          <p>We had a strict allocation of structure costs with a reduction in Western Europe, minus 2%. And at the same time, a significant increase in Eastern Europe, in particular in Russia of 16%, to strengthen our leadership position and support the geographic expansion strategy to smaller cities.</p>
          <p>France, so Alexandre mentioned the technical and conjunctural effects from a sales standpoint. Let's have a look at both effects from a profit standpoint. The technical effect of the pre-buying last year before the duty increase had a negative impact of &#x20AC;64 million. This figure was communicated to you one year ago.</p>
          <p>And on the top of that, we had some conjunctural effects, which had total an impact of minus &#x20AC;24 million, because there were already new inventory reduction in the first quarter, the fact that we had low inventories at the end of 2012 in some distributors because of the duty increase on beers, which have led the distributors to put priority to beer loading as opposed to spirit inventories. There were some promotion activities not repeated by major retailers in first half, and obviously we had this decrease in consumption following the excise duty hike that we estimate in net sales, as Alexandre said, at around minus 3%.</p>
          <p>So the sum of those two impacts is minus &#x20AC;88 million. And we believe that those effects are now behind us. And for the full year 2012/2013, we see major decline of the profit from recurring operation in France to be limited to approximately &#x20AC;25 million. So as you can see, it's very similar to the impact of the conjuncturing effects in the first half. So in other words, it mean that in the second half, excluding the technical effects, we estimate that the profits will be more or less flat in France.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look at the elements below the operating profit, starting with the financial income and expenses. As you can see, we had an average cost of debt of 5.4% in first half, so slightly below what we had previously estimated. It's obviously an increase as compared to last year, because of all the debt refinancing we did last year. As a reminder it enabled us to increase the share of bond debt at a higher level than 80% to extend the maturity of the debt. The average maturity is close to five &#x2013; to seven years. And to secure attractive long-term rates.</p>
          <p>For the full fiscal year 2012/2013, the average cost of debt should be close to the one of the first half, should even slightly decline in the second half. And I think that very bold to say that starting second half, financial expenses will start to decrease, starting now in January. And it will go even further that last &#x2013; next year, because we'll have a reduction of the average cost of debt to 5% because of some, I would say, costly past financing and hedgings coming to maturity in April and May this year. So we are clearly at the turning point. Starting now you will see financial expenses decreasing as compared to the previous periods.</p>
          <p>We have here another view of the cash flow statement. So free cash flow was of &#x2013; generation of cash of &#x20AC;416 million. As for the P&amp;L, it was largely impacted by technical and conjunctural effects with effects &#x2013; assumable with effects to be minus &#x20AC;130 million. We have obviously, the French impact which had some impact on the profit but also on the cash. We estimate that the cash impact of that was approximately minus &#x20AC;60 million. You had some first half, second half of phasing differences of certain payments, in particular excise and taxes. And you have an unfavorable base of comparison in working capital. As a reminder last year and also the year before, by the way, we had done some optimization initiatives notably in Asia/Rest of the World, so we had a decrease last year of the working capital, particularly at the end of the June despite the fact that sales were up, so we have an unfavorable basis of comparison.</p>
          <p>As we said earlier this year, we decided to increase our strategic investments, both in CapEx and strategic inventories, so it will clearly go on in the second half.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial charge and cash tax it was a negative impact of minus &#x20AC;90 million, compensated by improvement on non-recurring items. Coming back to the financial charges, the increase is due to the same reasons for the &#x2013; that the one I presented for the P&amp;L. And so starting second half and next year, you will start seeing some decline. And the cash tax was up. It includes the impact of the measures in France. So in second half, cash generation will accelerate and hence, contributing to further deleveraging of the group.</p>
          <p>We have the evolution of the net debt, it was down &#x20AC;215 million to a bit more than &#x20AC;9.1 billion, particularly due to a favorable ForEx impact. The ratio net debt to EBITDA on this first half was stable, obviously because of the numerous significant and favorable technical and conjunctural effects in first half, which will obviously be down as of end of June.</p>
          <p>You have here an overview of the debt structure. I won't comment each figure but just highlighting the key points. We have bank and bond maturities in calendar year 2013 and 2014, which will be covered by forecasted cash flows and existing credit facilities.</p>
          <p>And speaking about those credit facilities, we currently draw &#x20AC;0.6 billion from our syndicated loan, whereas we have availability of &#x20AC;2.5 billion. So we have a very solid financial structure. We have time to return our bond maturities, and we have flexibility thanks to that facility.</p>
          <p>From a currency and rate standpoint, no change. We keep more than half of the debt in dollar. As you know, this is what we call the natural hedging of the debt. We try to split debt between euro and dollar to mirror our split of EBITDA and cash flow by currency. And we keep a large proportion of the debt at fixed rates.</p>
          <p>A word on income tax. There was an increase of the rates, up from 24.7% to 26.8%. As I said in our Q1 communication, it reflects clearly the impact of the tax reforms in France, which cost us on the first half &#x20AC;16 million. So negative impact on the net profit.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we now estimate that the income tax rates from recurring operations will be close to the one of the first half, again in particular because of the impact of those tax reforms in France, the 3% tax on dividend and the limitation of deductibility &#x2013; tax deductibility of interest on debts in particular.</p>
          <p>Quick overview on the non-recurring items. All in all the net impact was limited, minus &#x20AC;10 million. And you had in this first half a depreciation of our wine brand, Brancott Estate, by &#x20AC;64 million.</p>
          <p>So add the consequence, group share now &#x2013; group share of net profits. As the net profit from recurring operations was at 2% and the net profit &#x2013; group share net profit was at 6%.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over to Pierre for the conclusion and the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I will be very short. If I were to summarize, the conclusion is confidence. Confidence in the strength of the portfolio, confidence in our worldwide exposure, thanks to a very wide distribution network, which mean that we're in the position to capture every single positive growth that exists in this market in the world. Which mean that medium term, yes, we're very confident that we'll continue with our growth. And for this year, we reiterate our guidance for plus 6% in the profit from recurring operation, organically obviously.</p>
          <p>So the floor is yours for your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (47:59) Just two question, please. First one on A&amp;P, given anticipated investment and technical phasing impact in H1, I was wondering if we can expect a decline of A&amp;P ratio in H2 and the stability in full year? And second question on Russia. Considering the media restriction, what kind of impact do you expect for sales growth in H2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Gilles on A&amp;P ratio and Alexandre on Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know A&amp;P we keep investing behind our key brands and key markets. And I think for the full year, you can expect a modest increase of the ratio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now regarding the impact in Russia, what we can say is that obviously we focused our traditional types of A&amp;P on the first half on media. But now on the second half, we're going to be focusing on point-of-sale. So we'll still be strongly communicating to our consumer base but basically differently. We don't see this change &#x2013; this environmental change or regulatory change impacting our sales &#x2013; underlying sales trend in Russia.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's take another question here, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Antoine Belge, HSBC. I have three questions. First of all you mention in China, a conjunctural issues whilst actually cognac was doing extremely well. Can you a bit elaborate between the trend that you're seeing in the different categories and why actually Scotch is more impacted?</p>
          <p>Second question relates to India. In India you did extremely well, but Diageo recently did an acquisition there, so what's your view on the competitive situation in India going forward?</p>
          <p>And finally structural costs, they increased at a higher pace than sales. Is it a bit of a one-off period especially this need to be increasing &#x2013; I mean doing some special investment in the emerging markets? Or is it a more structural trend that the cost of doing business is not declining in emerging markets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very briefly, Scotch in China versus cognac in China. Let's be clear on the fact that, number one, the cognac category in China is the most statutory category. So that's point one. So as it's most statutory, it tends to suffer less during a conjunctural slowdowns.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Scotch category itself, you see different impacts depending on the segments you're in. The more mainstream segment, 12 year old, 18 year old; and you have the very, very upper end segment. So the very upper, upper end segment is suffering a little bit more than the mainstream segment, related to a slowdown in the gifting segment.</p>
          <p>Regarding India, as I mentioned earlier basically we believe &#x2013; we strongly believe we are present in the most attractive segment of the local Indian whisky market, which is the deluxe and premium admix whiskies. They tend to start between &#x20AC;4.5 and &#x20AC;5, up to &#x20AC;12 and &#x20AC;13. And we are market leaders in that most dynamic segment with brands such as Royal Stag, Blenders Pride and Imperial Blue. And we've actually even innovated by premiumizing two of these three brands and adding extra brands within these brand families. We have a 46% market share in that specific category. And our largest competitor has a 36% share in that category.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your last question, Antoine, on structured cost. I think as a growth &#x2013; kind of growth you've seen in the first half, an 8% growth, it's very similar to the one you had seen in the previous two years. This is clearly part of our strategy to reinforce the emerging market. And also it was clearly a will to reinforce our competencies in the different topics that were highlighted in our Agility project.</p>
          <p>That said as we commented earlier, we are coming to an end of this cycle of reinforcing our central competencies and brand company competencies in all the Agility strategy topics. We'll keep obviously investing in our distribution network, in particular in emerging market to sustain this direct level expansion. So starting next fiscal year, you should start seeing a less &#x2013; a more moderate increase of structured cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a follow up on what you explained about Scotch versus cognac. How confident are you that actually this decline in gifting is just conjunctural, not more structural, especially with the new Chinese administration in place putting a lot of emphasis on the fighting against corruption.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, the gifting part of the activity in China is small. We're actually more exposed to the mainstream part of our business, which is principally consumer-driven by the young urbanites, we call them the young &#x2013; or Chinese urbanites. So we have clear medium- and long-term confidence obviously in cognac, but as well in the Scotch categories.</p>
          <p>Gifting basically tend to impact the $200-plus-price segments. And we're most heavily exposed up to that segment actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>May I just react on &#x2013; you said two words, gifting and corruption. No, absolutely not. I mean the culture of gifting in Asia is deeply rooted to the culture. I mean for the Chinese New Year, if you don't offer to your parents or to your friends a gift, I mean you're just losing face. So I think that is something which is very important. So the connection between corruption and gifting clearly has to be ignored. I mean it's not the issue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let's take one question from the phone please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Question comes from Simon Hales from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just three quick ones, if I can please. Just sort of moving on with the discussion around China, I wonder if you could give us any indication of your thoughts around Chinese New Year. I know it's only just happened, but I'll be interested in the confidence you saw in your wholesalers running into Chinese New Year, so any comments around that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in South Korea you obviously benefited from stock build at the end of the second quarter ahead of the price increase. I wonder if you could give us an idea of how much of a benefit that was in the context of your overall Asian business in the period, because I assume it will unwind in Q3.</p>
          <p>And finally, just on Mexico, you obviously saw a pickup in sales growth rate in Q2 to plus 8%. Should we be expecting an acceleration as we move into the second half on that 8% growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well just on Chinese New Year, it's a little bit early to tell. It happened last week with the peak being last weekend. But as we did mention in the presentation, we clearly had a commercial strategy to preempt markets, to preempt shelves on the ground by selling ahead of Chinese New Year as much as we could in terms of cognac and Scotch. So it's still a bit early to tell, but we are clearly confident that we'll be having a good Chinese New Year and gaining share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on South Korea, yes clearly the performance on the first half was favored by some technical effects. We believe that the market is down, minus 12%. We believe that <mark type="ph" /> our operations (56:27) were down by 4%. And as you saw, we announced an increase of the net sale by 5%.</p>
          <p>So this 5% was because of the <mark type="ph" /> growth (0:56:37) in pre-price increase, and we did better than the market in the first half. It was also linked to the fact that our price increase was a bit later than other price increases that some competitors have done. So we, yes believe that the 5% we had in the first half is technically favored by both elements. So the normal trend should be some decline in South Korea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the Mexican side, in a few words as you probably remember, we made a complete reshuffle of the commercial policy in this country. We can see now the benefit. It's too early to say that we have a complete turnaround of our brand in this market. So it's too early to really make a prediction for the second half, but definitely the new commercial structure and policy works well.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Perfect. Thank you ever so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. Three quick questions. You said the underlying organic EBIT growth in the first half would've been 7%, and you're staying with guidance of 6% for the full year. Is this just your natural conservatism or are there factors you see will deteriorate in the second half?</p>
          <p>Second question around the U.S., you have been pricing on Absolut. Your price and mix on Top 14 is still 3%, for each one the same as Q1. I thought we might see a little bit of acceleration. Perhaps you can talk about that.</p>
          <p>And finally, question for Gilles, tax rate moving up towards 27%. Is that a more stable rate going forward? Or is that something that will come off in future years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the first question. Plus 7% is an actual performance and plus 6% is a guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So regarding the price mix in the U.S., the 3% price mix, and specifically for Absolut. So as we mentioned, we have increased prices on Absolut in six states in the U.S. We're testing the market. And depending on the results, we'll see if we can take further increases. So far it's too early to tell.</p>
          <p>Second, well actually bear in mind as well that there is a state mix as well. So beyond the price mix of 3%, some states might be performing better than others, and it does need to be taken into account in the equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And as regard, the tax rates, you see the increase was due to the &#x2013; to some changes of tax legislations in different countries that mainly &#x2013; clearly in France. And based on the current tax environments, we believe that these tax rates should stay at that level in the following years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay one question from the room, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello it's Jos&#xE9;phine Chevallier from Natixis. Thank you very much. Three questions, one about Spain. And you have given an interview this morning saying that the trends were improved in January. So generally speaking, what did you see Europe excluding France going forward in H2? Should we see a &#x2013; some better trends or actually what sort of trends with the major countries that you have?</p>
          <p>The second question would be about the U.S. market. Constellation has mentioned weeks ago some weakness in the on-trade, so the publication has been quite mitigated on this ground. We see that you had a superb growth in the &#x2013; in quarter. Could you a little bit give color on the trends in the on-trade segment, and maybe an explanation of this weakness with one trading day less in December, so maybe you can come back on that?</p>
          <p>And the third question would be on China, but from a little &#x2013; a different angle. You mention that you had a very marginal impact from &#x2013; the technical impact of the Chinese, thanks to pre-emptive strategy in the market. Could you give us an idea of the reverse technical impact we could weight in the current quarter? I mean should we weight &#x2013; we would expect a much less positive, let's say, impact? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I take the first one on Spain, just remind us that it's a market what is still dominated by the on-trade, which represent more than 50% of the consumption. In comparison, for instance, in France, we are more in the 80%/20%, 80% on the off-trade, which means that we have a huge element of wholesaling in between, because we don't sell to the on-trade ourselves. That's why we thought that the minus 9%, which we posted for Spain might have been impacted by this element of variation of inventories in the wholesalers and this is confirmed by the fact that we have a good month of January.</p>
          <p>Having said that and more globally, what I would say regarding Spain is that there are some signs that the worst is behind them in term of overall economy and it's in some of export, in some of the trade balance, in some of the current finance balance of the country. Will &#x2013; how fast will that translate into an employment or improved employment and consumption, it's probably a bit too early to say. But I would say that I would be confident that gradually Spain could recover, but I'm not making any precise forecast for our business. It's more a global assumption of the country.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So on the on-trade in the U.S., the on-trade in the U.S. is still growing. Let's be clear about that. And it's growing &#x2013; it's skewed towards the more premium end of the brands, and that's why you see that our brand performances in the U.S., especially our premium whiskies, are faring pretty well actually.</p>
          <p>Our market share overall in the U.S., just to mention, is fairly stable. But amongst the large players, we've been a very good performer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on your last question on China, as we said, we have pre-empted the Chinese New Year in our commercial policy, so we have shift a bit more than normally. So we have level which is a bit higher, because we wanted to be also the first with our products on the shelves of our wholesalers to be ready for that important obviously consumption period.</p>
          <p>And so as a consequence, the technical impact of Chinese New Year as of end of December, which was a negative one, was modest, just minus &#x20AC;8 million. So as a consequence, a positive technical impact you will see in Q3 will be the regular &#x2013; sort of was &#x20AC;8 million so it will be relatively modest.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually most of the questions already been asked, but one small one and perhaps for Gilles. Gilles, you talked about the benefit in South Korea that you achieved from the price increases and this fact that you're taking of the price increases. Could you put an estimate on that? Roughly speaking, what was the upside from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well think, you have the elements. You have I think a good idea of the size of South Korea in the Pernod Ricard net sales. You have the 5% growth that we had in the first half. You have an idea of the, also I would say, the market evolution. I'm sure, Trevor, that you'd be able to do a &#x2013; the rough calculation.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. I have one question on the A&amp;P spend in Asia being up 6%. And you mentioned you were getting some more leverage out of the A&amp;P line, generally speaking in that region. Is there an element of phasing difference in the A&amp;P in the first half? Or do you really think we could be entering a phase now where, perhaps in key markets like China, we are starting to get much better leverage out of the A&amp;P spend? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that yes, in markets where we have big brands, where we have leadership position, we have the ability also to extract some positive scale benefit from it. That said we are increasing our A&amp;P investment in both regions. And we're also investing behind new growth relays like Absolut, the wine, the champagne, and so on, to grow also in smaller second tier emerging markets like Vietnam, Malaysia, and so on.</p>
          <p>So there is some reallocation to other growth relays, but yes, we also benefit from some scale and you can see very, very well in the operating profit of Asia that we have a strong improvement year after year, because of our strong pricing policy, our strong mix, and also because we have the ability with the strong growth we have to benefit from the scale effect.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Melissa, if I may, you could look at A&amp;P in two different ways. One is expenses, the other one is investments, investment behind our brands. And as Alexandre mentioned earlier, 90% of our growth in A&amp;P is focused on the Top 14 brand, 90%, and they attract three-quarter of our investment. So definitely, we are investing behind the future of those brand. That's the way I look at it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Question for Gilles. You mentioned the net debt position will be impacted positively in March, April by the maturization of a certain number of hedges and other products that you put in place. Could you substantiate that and say what would be the net effect of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My point was more on the evolution of the financial expenses. When we bought Vin &amp; Sprit almost five years ago, we've put in place some financing and some hedgings as the market condition at that time, which were not as positive as today. And they are coming to maturity. Some of them are coming to maturity in April, May this year. They had an impact on our current financial expenses. So it has a cost today.</p>
          <p>And this additional cost will disappear starting April, May. And that's the reason why I &#x2013; we guided for next year a cost of debt, which should be around 5%, whereas it was at 5.4% at the end of December. That's a big part but an important part of the reduction of the cost of debt, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Thinking about Venezuela, obviously, we've had some changes in the currency there. And how does that impact your, sort of short- and long-term view of that market? You pointed to some success in that market this half year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well first of all, let's put that into perspective. Venezuela represents less than 0.5% of the group net sales and profit, so relatively marginal. And for our computation, we were already using rates between the bolivar and the dollar, which was indeed already less favorable than the new official rate which has been announced. So I think the new official rate is VEB6.3, and we are using VEB8.5. So in a way I think we are &#x2013; we have a kind of prudence vis-&#xE0;-vis the transition rate in Venezuela.</p>
          <p>I think then what could be at stake, will be important &#x2013; we look at it carefully is the access to the dollar. Is it on the Venezuelan market? Let us see if that's the measure and that devaluation is accompanied by a broader access to dollar on the market. I think to date there is still some uncertainty on that points.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you don't see this being a material impact on your business?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have a question in the room here.</p>

            <mark type="ph" /> Laticia Dulay (01:10:19) <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:10:19) Capital Markets. Just one question on Martell, please. You've obviously benefited from very strong price and mix over the past few months, 15% price and mix. There's a lot of mix in there but also some good pricing. I just wanted to come back on the pricing opportunity for Martell in the next couple of months and in particular in Asia. Do you have confident in replicating what you've done in the past few months there? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just &#x2013; we're not going to give you our forecast in terms of pricing from our talk as that's pretty sensitive competitive information. Depending on the success level of Chinese New Year and from a very pragmatic approach, we'll see how much and when we'll take price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe adding a comment, as we have always said, I think that the 15%, 16% price and mix that you've seen last year is not the long term kind of price and mix that we see for the future. We used to grow with Martell in the last year, that 25% growth rate value. I think that we have said several times that our long-term view was more something around 15%, half of it being volumes, half of it being price and mix. So it is more the long-term view we have for the growth of the brand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in order to secure the volumes, you probably noticed that we made recently an acquisition. And it is clearly to secure the supply for future growth in this high-quality cognac. And so I remind you that we are the leader for the <mark type="ph" /> authority rate, we call them very excel. (1:12:02)</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Sandra Soyer from Natixis on the credit side. I was wondering what can you remind us, what is your strategy in terms of acquisitions? And would you be ready to lose your investment grade rating for strategy acquisition? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Gilles gave us some precise guideline regarding the acquisitions, because he said that we had a clear view to remain investment grade, and you understand clearly what it means. He gave us also very clear guidance about the deleveraging of the group, which mean that we can perform bolt-on acquisition anytime and strategic acquisitions, maybe you give us two to three years, Gilles, obviously. I think that's, yes, very much the answer. Having said that, it will obviously depend on opportunities, but yes, Pernod Ricard shall participate to the future consolidation of the industry.</p>

          <p>We have a last question on the phone I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question is from Andrea Pistacchi from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I have a couple of questions, please. Firstly, on going back to cognac in China, earlier you referred to the fact that the largest part of your consumer base is essentially private consumption. So people good going out on that. Could you give a sense I mean in terms of a split, how much do you think of the consumption of cognac in China is related to government officials sort of going to the private rooms or going out. Broadly, how much you think is more like corporate-related, so private, but corporate rather than people going out and the third group, people going out.</p>
          <p>Second question on, again on China, you talked a bit about the pricing in cognac. Do you think you'll be able to take pricing in Scotch this year given the situation in the market in China?</p>
          <p>And then the last thing, if you could just give a bit of color please on the performance on some of the European &#x2013; your big European countries that you didn't mention, like the UK, Germany. What's going on there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe on the first questions, I already commented on a couple of occasions that the vast majority of our product is consumed by private entrepreneurs, by the emerging middle class who want to enjoy life. And to have our brands is part of their lifestyle, equally important like having an iPhone or a car or the right one and so on. So I think you should consider that our business is sound in this respect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now regarding pricing on Scotch in China, I say it's actually the same answer as for cognac. It's going to be a very pragmatic approach. If we can, we will take price.</p>
          <p>Now regarding UK and Germany, UK sales are slightly declining, minus 1%, so let's basically say that they're flat. We are doing pretty well in some of our key strategic brands such as Malibu, such as Jameson.</p>
          <p>And finally regarding Germany, Germany was hit with Ramazzotti that was due to a commercial conflict we had. But our key 14 strategic brands are growing with a great success, for instance, of Havana Club.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And they're growing by 14% in value, so good double-digit growth of the &#x2013; our priority brands in Germany.</p>
