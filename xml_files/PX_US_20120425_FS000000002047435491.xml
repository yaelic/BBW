          <p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2012 Praxair Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jeff, and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Kelcey Hoyt, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thank you for attending our first quarter earnings call and webcast. I'm joined this morning by Jim Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Liz Hirsch, our Vice President and Controller.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our website at praxair.com in the "Investors" section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page two of the slides and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>In addition, please note that sequential comparisons include an adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2011 and a reconciliation to the U.S. GAAP reported numbers are in the appendix to this presentation and the press release.</p>
          <p>Jim and I will now review Praxair's first quarter results and outlook. We'll then be available to answer questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Kelcey, and good morning, everyone. Praxair turned in another solid quarter, with EPS growth of 7% year-on-year, despite currency headwinds and weakening economic conditions in several markets.</p>
          <p>Our North American segment &#x2013; Canada, the United States, and Mexico &#x2013; turned in a stellar performance, with operating profit growth of 16% fueled by improving manufacturing conditions and strong operating leverage as volumes rebounded. In Europe, we experienced lower volumes and negative operating leverage, particularly due to the financial crisis affecting Spain and Italy.</p>
          <p>In South America, operating profit was negatively impacted, as currency devaluation, a recession in Brazil, and production distribution dislocations in our operations all occurred at the same time. In Asia, a strong performance in industrial gases, with much of our production capacity sold out, was partially offset by falling volumes and prices of products sold to the electronics and solar markets.</p>
          <p>Fully diluted earnings per share were $1.38. Earnings included about $10 million of other income attributable to the net effect of gains on asset sales and the recognition of income from a legal settlement, partially offset by some restructuring and severance costs. Excluding the one-time items, the underlying run rate of EPS is closer to $1.36.</p>
          <p>For the second quarter, we're expecting a continuation of the same business trends and are issuing earnings guidance of $1.40 to $1.45. For the full year, our earnings guidance is $5.75 to $5.90, increasing the bottom end of the range by a nickel. We do expect a stronger second half of 2012, as the Brazil economy gets back on track to a 4% annualized GDP growth rate and as the electronics sector picks up in the fall.</p>
          <p>Our long-term growth plans remain strong, and we're maintaining our capital spending forecast of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion against a backlog of $2.7 billion of projects under construction with committed customer contracts.</p>
          <p>As these projects start up over the next two to three years, the contribution to sales and earnings growth should accelerate. At the same time, we're in negotiation on a record amount of new contracts, mostly in the emerging markets, which should extend our growth horizon significantly.</p>
          <p>The production of cleaner energy is the largest growth driver in our portfolio. Within the next 18 months, we'll start up three world-scale steam methane reformers, which will increase our hydrogen production capacity by 35%. Additionally, our backlog of projects in China, where we're currently sold out, should increase our sales there by more than 40%.</p>
          <p>And now I'll let Kelcey explain in more detail our first quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jim. Now please turn to slide three for our consolidated first quarter results. Praxair's first quarter results reflect solid growth and continuing operating leverage, with sales growth of 5%, operating profit growth of 6%, and EPS growth of 7%. Consolidated sales in the first quarter were $2.8 billion, up 5% versus the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Foreign currency translation negatively impacted sales 2%, as foreign currencies weakened against the U.S. dollar from the prior year quarter. The most significant impact to sales came from the Brazilian real, Mexican peso, and euro.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales grew 8%, excluding currency and the impact of cost pass-through from lower natural gas prices passed through to hydrogen customers. Higher volumes contributed 4% growth, and price contributed 2%.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales grew in all geographic segments, with the exception of Europe. Growth was strongest in North America, driven by strong sales to the metals, energy, and manufacturing markets. Sales growth continued in South America and Asia from new projects and higher volumes from applications for industrial gases.</p>
          <p>In Europe, sales were higher than the prior year due to the consolidation of our industrial gas business in Scandinavia. Excluding this acquisition and negative currency effects, sales in Europe were below prior year due to the weak economic environment, particularly in southern Europe. Sequentially, sales grew 2% from underlying growth in all geographic segments except Asia, where volumes were lower, primarily from seasonal impacts of the Lunar New Year and further weakness in specialty gases for electronics markets.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew to $627 million in the quarter, 6% above the prior year, and the operating margin was a strong 22.1%. Higher volumes, combined with price and productivity savings, were the primary contributors to the growth. Net income of $419 million grew 5% from the prior year and less than operating profit, due primarily to higher interest expense from increased long-term debt issued during 2011 to lock in lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter, we issued $600 million of 10-year notes at a rate of 2.45% to refinance other long-term debt maturities. Our debt to capital ratio for the quarter was 51.3% and debt to EBITDA was 1.9 times. Earnings per share of $1.38, up 7% from the prior year, grew faster than net income due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we completed the $1.5 billion program authorized during July of 2010. $1.4 billion remains available under the new $1.5 billion program authorized during January of this year, which we expect to complete in 2013.</p>
          <p>After-tax return on capital for the quarter decreased slightly to 14.2%, due to the large amount of project capital under construction and therefore on our balance sheet not yet completed. Return on equity increased to 29.4%.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page four for our results in North America. Sales in North America were $1.4 billion, 6% above the prior year quarter. Underlying sales grew 10% from higher volumes and pricing. The negative effects of currency translation and cost pass-through, primarily historically low natural gas prices which are contractually passed on to customers, reduced sales by 4%.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth versus the prior year quarter came from all three distribution methods: on-site, merchant, and packaged; and in all countries: the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Sequentially, sales grew from 1% higher volumes in on-site and packaged gas, primarily in the steel and manufacturing markets.</p>
          <p>On-site sales volumes versus the prior year quarter were quite strong and driven primarily by the energy and metals markets in all three countries, with the strongest growth in the United States. Our Gulf Coast refinery volumes were significantly stronger year-over-year due to fewer of our hydrogen customers taking turnarounds in the first quarter of 2012 versus the prior year, as well as the refineries taking increased volumes of hydrogen.</p>
          <p>We also had strong spot sales out of our Gulf Coast hydrogen storage cavern to meet customer needs. The cavern stores over 2 billion cubic feet of high purity hydrogen and is uniquely integrated into our 310-mile Gulf Coast area hydrogen pipeline, which serves more than 50 refineries and chemical plants from Texas City, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana.</p>
          <p>On-site volumes rose to metal customers in part due to strong oxygen sales on our pipelines in the Northern United States. During the quarter, several customers increased utilization at existing assets in their steel mills. In addition, on-site sales grew from continued usage and new installations of our applications technology in the area of blast furnace oxygen enrichment, stove oxygen enrichment, and oxy-fuel steel reheating at steel customers in the area.</p>
          <p>This includes Praxair's dilute oxygen combustion technology that provides operators with a flexible, low-cost way to convert burners from air fuel to oxy-fuel systems and can increase productivity, decrease fuel consumption, lower operating costs, and reduce emissions. Even with low natural gas prices, our customers continue to use oxy-fuel technology for fuel substitution which provides increased throughput and cost savings and energy efficiency benefits.</p>
          <p>Merchant sales volumes grew modestly versus the prior year quarter. Sequentially, merchant volumes were steady. Canada experienced some slowing in liquid nitrogen sales late in the first quarter as the warmer weather accelerated the timing of the spring thaw, which prohibits heavy trucks from getting to the fracking locations.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas sales remained strong, in line with manufacturing strength. In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business, same-store sales, which excludes currency and acquisitions, were 12% above last year. Gases were up 9% and hard goods were up 19%. Hard goods' strength continues to center on welding equipment, including robotics and automation solutions that help improve customer productivity.</p>
          <p>The packaged gas business is heavily weighted towards metal fabrication and sales are strong for automobile-related welding, including auto parts, the oil and gas industry, heavy equipment building, and repair that requires welding. North American operating profit was $361 million, 16% above the prior year quarter. The operating margin was 25.8%. The strong operating margin reflects the strength and efficiency of our production and distribution systems, which results in improved operating leverage.</p>
          <p>Merchant pricing trends for all products remained positive. As these contracts are typically of a three to five year duration, our ability to increase the price is impacted by the timing of contract renewals. We expect to continue to realize low single-digit percentage impact from pricing actions in North America this year.</p>
          <p>The region has several projects in the backlog that are expected to start up within the next 12 months, including the two hydrogen projects under construction for Valero at St. Charles and Port Arthur, as well as others serving the manufacturing, energy, and metals markets. Proposal activity for new on-site plants remains strong, with activity in energy, chemicals, manufacturing, and metals.</p>
          <p>Last week, we announced a new long-term contract to supply oxygen, argon, and nitrogen to Deacero, a leading Mexican steel company. We will build, own, and operate a new state-of-the-art and energy-efficient cryogenic air separation unit in Northern Mexico with a capacity of 500 tons per day, which is expected to start up in 2014. The plant will also expand Praxair's capacity in the region.</p>
          <p>Now please turn to page five for our results in Europe. Sales in Europe increased 9% for the first quarter versus 2011. The sales increase was due to the acquisition of an increased ownership interest in Yara Praxair in October of last year, which now requires consolidation. This was partially offset by a 3% negative impact from currency, as the euro devalued versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Excluding these items, underlying sales decreased from lower overall volume, partially offset by higher pricing. Volumes in Spain and Italy were below prior year, primarily attributable to packaged gases, where customer demand was weaker due to lower industrial economic activity. Higher volumes in Germany versus prior year partially offset this impact.</p>
          <p>Pricing was slightly higher across the region due to initiatives taken to offset cost increases. Price improvements in Spain, Italy, and Germany were partially offset by continued pricing weakness in electronics and medical oxygen. We remain focused on obtaining and improving price in the regions in which we operate.</p>
          <p>Packaged gas organic sales declined 6% year-over-year and grew 3% sequentially. The sequential growth was driven by Italy, Germany, and Scandinavia, partially offset by further volume weakness in Spain. Operating profit of $68 million was comparable to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Excluding the favorable impact of the Yara Praxair acquisition and the negative currency impact, underlying operating profit decreased 5% versus the prior year quarter. Lower volumes decreased operating profit by 8%, partially offset by higher productivity and cost savings resulting from our fourth quarter restructure.</p>
          <p>During the second half of 2012, we plan to start up three of our four plants currently under construction in Russia. In addition, last month, we announced the acquisition of an industrial gas business located in the South Volga region.</p>
          <p>Two of the three on-site plants scheduled to start up later this year are also located in this region and will allow us to accelerate the establishment of a fully-integrated industrial gas model to leverage on-site, merchant, and packaged gas and build production distribution density in the area. The on-site plants will serve the chemical and glass industries.</p>
          <p>Pages six shows our results in South America. South American segment sales were $562 million, up 1% from the prior year quarter. Underlying sales grew 5% from higher volumes and higher pricing. This growth was offset by negative currency translation impacts, primarily the weakening of the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar, which reduced sales by 5%.</p>
          <p>Higher volumes increased sales by 2% and were driven by new on-site production facilities serving metals and energy markets. Volumes to merchant and packaged gas customers were below prior year, largely attributable to the lower industrial production rates in Brazil. Higher pricing increased sales by 3% and helped partially offset cost increases.</p>
          <p>By end market, year-over-year sales increased to metals, healthcare, and food and beverage customers, and were relatively flat to manufacturing customers. Sequentially, on-site and packaged gas sales grew, but were partially offset by modest declines in merchant.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in South America was $115 million, a decrease of 14% versus the quarter a year ago. Currency reduced operating profit by 6%. Excluding the currency effects, operating profit was 8% below the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Higher pricing increased operating profit, but only partially offset higher costs related to power, distribution, and product dislocation. In addition, a lower mix of higher margin merchant liquid volumes contributed to the lower profit.</p>
          <p>South America has a number of projects scheduled to start up and begin generating revenue under long-term contracts over the next 12 months in Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay, serving the chemicals, metals, and manufacturing markets. The proposal activity for new large growth projects remains strong in the energy, chemical, steel, and manufacturing markets across South America.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide seven for our results in Asia. Sales of $334 million grew 5% versus the prior year quarter, due primarily to volume growth. Volume growth of 5% came primarily from new plant startups in China and India for metals and chemicals customers, which resulted in higher on-site and merchant volumes. Overall volume growth was negatively impacted by 5% lower sales to electronics customers in Asia, due to lower demand from semiconductor, flat-panel display, and solar customers.</p>
          <p>Lower pricing, primarily to the electronics end market, reduced sales by 1% from the prior-year quarter. We expect this challenging price environment to continue as long as electronics volumes remain weak. Asia's operating profit grew 8% from the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher volumes. In most markets growth is constrained, as our plants are operating at full capacity.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we have 11 projects expected to start-up over the next 12 months, including our second gasification project in China, this one for the Wuwei coking project, our fifth expansion from Meishan Steel, and high purity nitrogen for a large electronics customer in Korea. New project activity for the region remains robust, and we expect several new project announcements in the next few months as customer contracts are signed.</p>
          <p>Our results for Surface Technologies are shown on page eight. PST sales this quarter were $169 million, up 8% year-over-year. During the quarter, we continued to see stronger growth in coatings to oil and gas market globally, driven by deepwater and shale gas drilling, as well as strong demand for jet engine coatings, particularly in North America.</p>
          <p>Operating profit in the first quarter was $26 million, driven primarily by higher volume and price, partially offset by increases in cost.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to turn this call over to Q&amp;A. Please try to limit yourself to one question, and if needed, a quick follow-up for clarification. That way more people get a chance to ask questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with First Analysis. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. It's actually Steve Schwartz sitting in for Mike today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, how are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On South America, can you give us more color on the product dislocations and the higher power costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this was one of those quarters where South America didn't do as well as we had expected. And basically I'd kind of describe it as one of those perfect storm situation with three negative factors happening all at the same time. The first one being the currency's off about 5% year-on-year, and about $1.80 real exchange rate. I don't see that getting better during the rest of the year, and I'll talk about that in a second.</p>
          <p>The second one being basically a manufacturing slowdown in Brazil with industrial production off about 3% and vehicle builds off about 10% year-on-year. I do expect that the economy will significantly rebound in the second half as the government is doing pretty much everything it can to improve the economy. They are trying to keep the real from getting too strong, and that's why I don't think it will get that much better for us in the rest of the year. They're also lowering interest rates, putting tariffs on imported goods and so forth. So we do expect the economy to pick up in the second half.</p>
          <p>Now the comment on the production side, we had some plant outages during the quarter which really didn't affect our sales all that much, but required us to <mark type="ph" /> haul (21:10) a lot of liquid, which we lost money on. And we also had less power efficiency and higher power costs all happening at the same time. And those should straighten out in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us an idea of the magnitude of those costs, how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Roughly $6 million in the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>$6 million. Okay, Jim. And you're saying this is all isolated to the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Edward Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jim. The comment on the negative pricing in Asia to the electronics and solar market, assume that wasn't in atmospheric gases; that was all in specialty gases and materials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. It's sort of a combination of a number of products, but it's specialty gases and some of the materials that we sell into the semiconductor market. On top of that, we had argon pricing in China significantly lower year-on-year as a result of the solar production being reduced to about 50% of capacity utilization. And solar production is a pretty big consumer of argon, and so argon prices were also lower this year than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And India, the merchant up 17%, that was very strong; and you mentioned application tech, could you provide some color around that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. India is doing very well. We're getting good solid growth, not only from on-site projects as we build and start-up new on-site projects but also from merchant sales, which are partly just coming from overall growth in the economy and growth in demand. But I also think we're doing a great job with technology transfer and applications development in the metal fab, in welding markets, in food and beverage markets, also growth in the pharmaceutical markets. So I think we're doing a good job in India and we've got a good growth outlook there. Again, similar to China, our merchant capacity is pretty much being fully utilized right now and so we're waiting for some of these projects to start-up to grow the merchant volumes more.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, P.J.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Jim. Jim, electronics was down 5%, the volumes were down, I think, 5%. Can you slice that further, is solar dragging the business down and what are you seeing in electronics, the semiconductors business, and what are your expectations there in second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, there are basically three end markets, is one way to look at it. The semiconductor market, which is the largest market, followed by the LED and liquid crystal displays, and then the solar market, which is really actually the smaller of the markets right now. The solar market is not doing well and is dragging down sales, and particularly silane and argon. Okay? So that's hurting. And I think that &#x2013; I don't know when that'll get better but I think there's a big over-investment in solar production capacity right now. Semiconductor and LED probably will pick up in the second half. It tends to be a bit of a seasonal business where some of the semiconductor and displays grow faster in the second half and part of that's related to the holiday season and Christmas and so forth in North America.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I can't really comment on that &#x2013; the competitive side of it, but basically what we're seeing in North America &#x2013; and really for Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. &#x2013; is packaged sales &#x2013; I'll come back to that &#x2013; but packaged and merchant volumes are recovering nicely, in line with the rebound in manufacturing activity, metal fabrication, equipment, and so forth. On top of that you do see some fluctuation in the merchant volume that is related to the fracking side of the business. And the fracking side of the business was actually fairly strong in the last couple of quarters. Probably be a little bit weaker in the second quarter, because of what they call the break up of the frozen ice in Canada. But we're continuing to see strong growth in manufacturing and I think that we're in for a couple of year &#x2013; a very strong ride in North America in overall manufacturing, pretty much fueled by the low natural gas prices, which makes United States a very low cost production location for steel and a lot of other items.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Abhi Rajendren calling in for John. With pricing continuing to lag in Europe, it feels like the one strong discipline in the industry may be cracking a bit. Do you have concerns about this? And if not, I guess why is Europe a different animal relative to the rest of the world?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a number of differences, but basically Europe is in a pretty tough recession right now. And some of our products get sold into what I would call the capital investment cycle, which means where customers are building things. Not only are they building more cars but they're building plants to build more cars, for example.</p>
          <p>And so with the financial crisis going on in Europe right now, particularly metal fabrication and machinery and construction and maintenance spending are significantly curtailed, particularly in Spain and Italy, but also in France and other parts of Europe as well. And so the lack of clarity on the financial side has really kind of paralyzed the capital spending in Europe.</p>
          <p>So that's really the biggest issue in Europe. I think the second issue is it's harder to control inflation in Europe. And I'm not saying that inflation is out of control, but you have mandated wage increases and so forth for your employees and also power cost increases going on. So we're not getting enough price increases in Europe to offset our cost increases. And so to get back at that we just need to re-double our efforts on productivity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. And just a quick follow up on Asia. So the backdrop especially with the post Chinese New Year's pick up being a little bit slow, appeared a little bit difficult in the quarter, could you talk a little bit about your kind of more positive outlook for the back half of the year in this geography and which country and sectors you're particularly positive on rebounding?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, China always has &#x2013; and other parts of Asia always have the Lunar, Chinese New Year holiday and everybody stops working for a week or two. And plants take turnarounds and shut downs and so forth. So that's not a new phenomenon, it just makes our first quarter results in Asia typically soft relative to the rest of the year, as historically in Europe the third quarter with summer vacation, which makes the third quarter soft relative to the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>So I don't see anything that is a trend of a slow down in Asia, other than in the electronic sector which I just spoke about. We're continuing to see strong, year-on-year growth in demand in Korea, and India and China and Thailand and Taiwan, which are the countries that we operate in. And as I said before, we're bringing on some significant new projects this year, which will not only improve our sales growth and volume growth to the on-site customers, which are the base load for those projects, but will also give us a little bit more liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, and argon to sell on the merchant markets, where we're basically capacity constrained right now.</p>

          <p>Hi, Jim. I want to go back to this strength that you're seeing in North America on a relative basis. Do you think it's that you have a better geographic footprint in North America in terms of your exposure to steel and autos and sort of that strength from the Midwest corridor or do you think it's better applications technology? What kind of drives your strong relative performance in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a comparative basis, I can't really speak. But I can tell you that we're seeing a nice resurgence in end markets. Steel, we're basically near full capacity. Our steel customers in, both the Chicago region and the Great Lakes region, are now extremely competitive on a global basis. And some of the international companies that own operations both in Brazil and the United States, for example, are producing more in the United States and less in Brazil, or Europe and the United States, the same thing.</p>
          <p>For steel, natural gas is probably the fourth or fifth highest cost item in producing steel after iron ore and petcoke &#x2013; I mean, coking coal and so forth. So that's &#x2013; the low natural gas price is helping steel. We're also seeing people like General Motors and Caterpillar and others decide to build more factories, buy more rail cars, that kind of thing. And so it's just giving us some &#x2013; a lot of good sales growth. And at the same time we've got some pricing leverage in North America and very little inflation in our cost structure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I know argon and helium have been tight, but I assume if you're running flat out on steel that you've got very good availability on argon. But can you comment on the helium outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, argon is pretty well in balance. Helium is a different beast. Helium is now made as a byproduct from air separation. Helium is basically created in the Earth from the decay of radioactive materials and, like oil and gas, it gets trapped under cap rocks as it rises. And there are really only about six places in the world where you can get helium and the United States being a strong one, but also the Middle East and Russia. We have really invested a lot of capital in backward integrating in our sources of helium over the last &#x2013; my lifetime at the company &#x2013; 25 years. So we have a very strong sourcing in helium. I think we're the only sourcer of helium, the only company in the helium business, that does not put customers on allocation. And so we are actually increasing price in helium because the supply/demand imbalance there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning, nice quarter. In terms of PDI, continues to post pretty impressive results there; still in the double-digits. Do you see that sustainable for the next several quarters in terms of demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think so. I think that what you have to &#x2013; part of what you have to do is look back. And we are now in this quarter finally back above what I would call pre-recession levels in terms of base business in packaged gas. So we've still got room to grow there. I think the customer base, metal fab, equipment, and so forth that I spoke about earlier is going to continue to grow in North America. So I do see a good solid outlook for packaged gases in North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then when I think about North America volumes in total 7%, pretty impressive there. Can you break that out between maybe new projects? Did you have a lot of new projects coming in? And just trying to get a feel for what base demand looks like here in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Probably about three quarters of that is not related to new projects and about one quarter is related to new projects. We haven't started up a lot of projects in the last 12 months. And if I kind of reflect on that a little bit, we have about $2.7 billion, as we discussed, of backlog of new projects. Just kind of spreads out, when are those starting up, over time. Roughly $400 million starts up in the first half of 2012, $600 million in the second half of 2012, and closer to $800 million in the first half of 2013. So we will start to see some much more significant contribution from start-ups moving into 2013.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I just want to slice the electronics business from a different angle. How much of that is nitrogen projects that are on take-or-pay contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Of our total electronics business, I would say probably 60% or 70% is on-site gases. And they are &#x2013; if you just look at that in isolation, it's not down year-on-year. Okay? And the biggest location for that and concentration is with Samsung in Korea. And generally what they do when there's a downturn is where they've outsourced production to third-party fabs and there's a downturn, they bring that production back into Korea again. So what I would say, the relative good performance for our electronics business is largely a function of the fact that most of it is on-site <mark type="ph" /> packaging (37:44).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But those contracts, then, are above the take-or-pay, so if there's a cyclical recovery you still get the upside lift?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's nobody, there's nobody who's in a take-or-pay situation where they're paying but not taking product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then you've mentioned in a few regions and end-markets sort of being capacity constrained. If you just looked at the portfolio globally, how much capacity would you need just to get to a point where you didn't feel that you were capacity constrained and putting customers at, you know, potentially at risk or in tight situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, perhaps I should correct myself a little bit, I would say, I don't want to leave the impression that if we had more capacity in the quarter that just ended that we would have sold more, that's not the situation. But we've got good growth and we're close to full capacity. And we can always kind of make more capacity by moving product around from one location to another location. Sometimes you're in one particular area you may be totally sold out. But then if you've got a production distribution system, you can haul product in from other locations where you're not sold out. But that tends to increase the distribution cost. But generally speaking, as I commented, around the world, we're running in the kind of low to mid 80s, in merchant capacity utilization, in probably mid 80s in North America, and a little bit higher than that in China and India, but down in the low 70s in Europe.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Your other income was unusually large this quarter at $14 million versus a cost of $1 million in the year ago period. What caused that $15 million swing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We always have non-recurring, I guess you could call, things happening, but basically we had some other income coming from a power contract that we won a litigation award on in South America. We also had a piece of land sell in Korea and gain on some of our electronic components business that we sold. And we also, at the same time, increased our severance cost and incurred some restructuring cost. So we're not going be running $14 million of other income every quarter. So as I mentioned, roughly about $10 million of that was kind of from those items, and we typically see other income of closer to $5 million for most quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then for my follow-up. Some industrial gas companies not only have large capital expenditures, but they also have large capital leases whereas for large capital lease payments, when I look at Praxair, I don't seem to see that structure. Do you have that structure and is that a choice of the industrial gas company? Or does it have something to do with the industrial gas customer? Can you clarify a little bit of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a result of a quirky accounting rule that really doesn't make much logical sense. But basically there's an accounting rule which says that if 100% of a project's output is going to a single customer in a single location, that's really a capital lease from the customer's point of view. And so we would need to book that as a capital leased receivable rather than as capital expenditures. We don't have much of that because we have a more integrated business. And if you're just doing stand-alone projects with a single customer and a single location, it's likely that some of those, the customer will have to account for as a capital lease, and therefore you'll have to account for it that way. The vast majority of our projects, as you know, are places where we have a pipeline system where we can supply to other customers from the same plant or where we've got liquid takeout and so forth. So we just don't have very much of that.</p>

        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>There's another one that's coming on stream in the next 12 months in India from the Indian Oil Company. The other project that you mentioned, the Chevron in Richmond, is still in a delay situation and will not be coming on stream at least in 2012 or 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, for my follow-up, one of the negatives associated with lower natural gas costs for one of your competitors was the fact that bonus payments and efficiency savings are worth less if the natural gas price is lower. Do you have the same kind of a bonus arrangement and are you getting hit just a little bit on the backside by lower natural gas costs regarding that particular item?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really in our &#x2013; I don't think it's really a bonus payment issue. The issue is when you sign a contract to sell either oxygen and you have an escalation formula where you pass through the price of electricity, the percentage of revenue which escalates to your electricity should be about equal to what you spend on electricity, okay.</p>
          <p>And the same thing with natural gas pass-through in hydrogen sales. But you can do contracts which are over escalated or under escalated and then you're really not neutral to the price of natural gas anymore. And part of that has to do with the additional products that we sell in the hydrogen business, where pretty much the underlying escalation will be related specifically to the hydrogen sales. But we're also selling steam in the form of &#x2013; energy in the form of steam to the customer and those sales are based on the value and the price of natural gas. And to the extent to which you've got steam sales going on, that can be real operating profit which goes up or down with natural gas.</p>

          <p>Well, I don't know if I would call it a leading indicator, but just clearly the places that don't have government finance issues are doing pretty well. And that would be primarily our business in Scandinavian, which is really pretty much unimpacted by that; followed by Germany, which has got a lesser impact; and then Spain, Portugal, and Italy, where basically people just aren't making spending decisions right now. And hopefully that'll correct itself pretty soon.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Jim, I guess, two questions on Europe. I think you have some moderate restructuring activity there. And how is that going and what is the associated cost savings that you would expect in the back half of the year?</p>
          <p>Then the second question I have was on Russia, with regards to your three plant start-ups. How much could that contribute in 2013, and perhaps you could comment more broadly on how you see the Russian market shaping up over the next three years or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Severance costs or the benefits from severance, we'll start to see some benefit in the second half in Europe. It's not going to be a huge number, especially where we've got inflationary costs greater than we can get price increase, but kind of a $5 million a year run rate, repeat kind of a number.</p>
          <p>Russia, we actually are absorbing that benefit because we're spending $5 million to $10 million a year in business development costs right now without any revenue today to show for it. But we will be starting up our first on-site plant next quarter or in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>And what we're basically doing is building an integrated on-site and merchant gas business in the Volgograd region, which is sort of in the center for chemical production as well as some steel production. Then also up near the Ural mountains the large projects that we're doing up with Evraz up there. So we should start to, I guess, as we start up the first plant that'll probably cover our business development costs and then as we start up the larger plant in the Urals they'll start contributing pretty significant amounts of operating profit in the second half of 2013.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Just to go back to the U.S., which I thought had a wonderful quarter, the 7% volume and 3% price that you got, does that feel like about the right run rate if U.S. underlying business stays at the same level it was at in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's pretty good. I mean, if you look at it, industrial production is growing faster than GDP. And if you look inside of industrial production at markets like machinery and so forth, are still showing 8% increases, so our numbers pretty much line up with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then if you're getting price &#x2013; and we're already kind of touching 26% margins or close to that in the first quarter. Can this segment get up 27% or so if this recovery lasts for another, call it, four to six quarters?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. It's a pretty good margin. The guys are doing a terrific job. We and a lot of other companies really have restructured our people costs in the United States and Mexico and Canada so we're operating at a very high level of sales and productivity and that's helped a lot not only for us, but some of our customers. I don't see a lot of upside in the operating margin percentage in North America, but I'm very happy with what the guys are doing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning, Jim. My question is on the negative impact of natural gas and currencies in the second quarter and beyond. As I am looking at the revenues, the combined negative impact this quarter was about 3%. Is it possible that could be as much as twice the impact next quarter? And similarly, on the gross margin line, just given the natural gas pass-through, rough calculations, I'm coming up with maybe 50 basis points of gross margin improvement because of the collapse in natural gas prices. And there, too, couldn't that be as much as twice as big an impact as we look to the second quarter and third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't see the natural gas impact being much different in the rest of the year than it is in the first quarter. In other words, we've had roughly $2 natural gas through the quarter and that's probably what will continue on. That's been about a 50 basis point impact on the margin. I don't see that changing going forward.</p>
          <p>Now the other half of your question, I think, was about currency, and we're expecting currencies to stay about where they are right now. Of course, they could end up being different than that, but I'm not smart enough to forecast that. But the year-over-year comparables to last year's second and third quarters are going to see more like a 4% to 5% year-over-year comparison. And that's because the dollar was much weaker in the second and third quarters of last year than it is right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then just quickly, you've always been really good at growing your SG&amp;A plus D&amp;A at a slower rate than sales or I guess, more appropriately, your gross profit dollar growth. Is there any reason that this year should be any different? As I'm looking at your guidance range and the EPS, it's sort of shaking out that SG&amp;A growth would be in excess of sales growth or GP growth. And I'm just wondering if there's anything unusual going on that would cause that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, generally we would expect to see SG&amp;A growth much lower than sales and gross margin growth. The one factor I would add to that which is the increase in our pension cost, which is a kind of a step change from the fourth quarter to the first quarter where we had on an annualized basis about a $30 million increase in pension and benefit <mark type="ph" /> cost in the period (55:00).</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, thanks very much. Maybe just as a last question, Jim, you talked about the low natural gas prices in the U.S. being a stimulant for all sorts of activity. Are any of your customers coming to you and asking you to hedge that gas for them? Obviously, you have no reason to do it for yourself because of the pass-through, but are your customers looking for hedges?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, basically our customers are primarily the refining industry, okay. And the refining industry is quite well able to hedge its own exposure to energy prices, if you will. So basically what we want to do is &#x2013; I'll describe it this way. The energy sector is a big end-market for us and a big sector for growth, but we don't want our margins to be impacted plus or minus by changes in their prices. We don't want to be in the energy business in that way. So we really just try to lock in our operating profit dollars.</p>
          <p>But what I would say is that the low natural gas price relative to the price of oil significantly reduces the cost for refineries to use hydrogen in their refinery as their proportion of their total refining costs. And that's tending to drive up the production of hydrogen which is a good thing.</p>
