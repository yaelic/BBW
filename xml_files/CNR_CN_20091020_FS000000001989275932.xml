          <p>Welcome to the CN Third Quarter 2009 Financial Results Conference Call. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Robert Noorigian, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Noorigian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and thank you for joining us for CN's third quarter 2009 financial results conference call. I'd like to remind you about the comments that have already been made regarding the forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With us is us today is Hunter Harrison, President and Chief Executive Officer of CN, Luc Jobin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Jim Foote, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing. Also with us today, although they are not taking part in the formal presentation, are Claude Mongeau, Executive Vice President and Chief Railroader in Training, and Keith Creel, Executive Vice President of Operations.</p>
          <p>After our presentations, we'll take questions from those of you who are on the phone, and could you please identify yourself when you are asking the questions? In order to be fair, can you limit the questions to two, and we would appreciate that, and that way you will be fair to your colleagues too. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce CN's President, Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison. Hunter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Bob and thank all of for joining us this afternoon. If you will just let me just take a moment to kind of address an issue that we normally don't talk about here, and that's my future with the organization here. I think most of you are aware that I'm retiring officially effective December 31. This will be my last conference call, doing the quarterly results. And I want to take this opportunity to thank every one of you here that have showed &#x2013; shown this organization the confidence that you have and the reliability and credibility that you've shown the group. And I am certainly appreciative and it's been a nice experience working with you.</p>
          <p>One other note I am proud to be able to report today. Most of all know that Claude will be replacing me come the first of the year, but also the Board this morning at our Board meeting officially elected Claude to the Company Board of Directors and so congratulations, Claude for that recognition from the Board. I look forward to turning the key to the office here over to Claude sometime in mid December, and I don't think you'll ever see him miss a beat as we go down.</p>
          <p>I was really pleased that for my last quarterly conference call that I can &#x2013; we can talk about a quarter that I was very, very proud of, particularly with the conditions and some of the headwinds that we've had to face with the economy.</p>
          <p>And Luke and Jim are going to go over the numbers in detail, but just a couple of highlights. The revenues were down as reported 18% and there will be some more explanation of that. The operating ratio we're really pleased with, is 62.7% OR, which is essentially flat year-over-year and our earnings, our diluted EPS, came in at $0.97.</p>
          <p>But what I really want to take a little bit of time today to do is to call your attention to the second panel of the presentation which is the highlights, some of the operating results. And I think there is two important points here. One, is we can certainly &#x2013; obviously not achieve the type of quarter that we did in this kind of environment without these outstanding operating metrics that are all once again records for this organization.</p>
          <p>But the important thing, even going forward, is these things are all going to stick. So if you take these type of numbers, these operating metrics which I'll go through, and start applying some growth and some rebound in the economy, it's going to create a lot additional leverage for this company start going off some record numbers, I think, in 2010 and '11.</p>
          <p>And I'll just highlight and go through them for a moment. The gross ton per train mile was up 7%. Once again, 7% on a world record. The cars per yard switching hour were up 29% and effectively if you look at the &#x2013; our terminal cost which is all in, they're down on a system basis, 32.5% when our business levels down measured on RTM basis, the kind of run rate of running that about as we speak down, about 11%. So this whole issue of Smart Yard and some of the initiatives in the pipeline have flowed in the hump. Edmonton and New York and Memphis are all starting to really allow us to take advantage of some of the opportunity we saw there the dwell time in terminals, a big important factor with terminal cost and congestion down 9%.</p>
          <p>Gross ton miles per available horsepower was 320 and I can remember we were talking about the ceiling was at 250 and now we're at 320. Car miles per car day was up 16%. The biggest individual quarter I think has jumped in that regard. And train velocity, which Keith has been spending a lot of time on with the regional operations, was up a whopping 11%.</p>
          <p>And I would emphasize that I understand a little bit about operating costs. I've spent my whole life fooling with them. And I can tell you it's very difficult to set these kind of records, but it's extremely difficult to set these kind of records when your revenues are down to the degree we experienced here. So congratulations to the operating team. And with that having been said, let me turn this over to Luc and Jim to give you further in-depth explanations here. Luc?</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, Hunter. I'm happy to be here today to do my first report on the financials for the third quarter of 2009. Works out good because the results are actually quite good, despite the difficult economic environment which Hunter has referred to. We feel that our volumes have bottomed out. And Jim will certainly have a lot more to say about that.</p>
          <p>We have seen some gradual improvement in the third quarter. And in fact sequentially our RTM's have grown 4% from Q2 to Q3 of 2009. Our car loads for the third quarter were down 15%, while our RTMs was down 11%. Obviously handling this kind of top line pressure is difficult for any business with a high fixed cost, but we continue to make the most of it.</p>
          <p>Back to what Hunter mentioned, we reported EPS of $0.97, which is down 16% versus last year. However, if you exclude the deferred income tax credits in the quarter, our adjusted EPS came in at $0.94, which is down 12% versus 2008.</p>
          <p>Our revenues came in at 1.845 billion, which is down on an FX adjusted base of 20% in the third quarter, mostly due to lower volumes and lower fuel surcharge revenue, which actually was 250 million on an FX adjusted basis. Fortunately, this was partially offset by some mix &#x2013; good mix and some pricing.</p>
          <p>Looking at the expenses, they were certainly well behaved at 1.156 billion. They were an improvement in the reduction of 20% on an FX adjusted basis from 2008, which translated into an operating income of $689 million, down 20% again on an FX adjusted basis.</p>
          <p>Income tax expense came in at $152 million, and for those of you who are keeping tabs this translates into a 24.8 effective tax rate. However, adjusting for the deferred income tax items which I referred to earlier, that would translate to 27%. And that's much closer and we maintain for the longer term our effective tax rate will be hovering somewhere around 28 to 30%.</p>
          <p>So, net income 461 million, down 16%, and adjusted EPS of $0.94, down 12%. We once again had outstanding cost management and our operating ratio came in at 62.7%, essentially flat to last year.</p>
          <p>In terms of foreign exchange, just to give you a picture, it still created a little bit of a tailwind in the quarter. It amounted to roughly $0.03 favorable in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses, here the story that has been unfolding throughout the year continues. We've managed our costs very tightly, while at the same time supporting initiatives to prepare and to handle the recovering volume. Our expenses were reduced 20% on an FX adjusted basis versus 2008. The biggest contributor was the fuel costs, which was down 53% from last year as the WTI came down from $118 last year to roughly $68 during the quarter. We also had very good fuel productivity during this quarter, up 5%.</p>
          <p>So our GDMs per U.S. gallons came in at 985 million versus 939 last year. There was a lag &#x2013; a little bit of a lag effect during the quarter, roughly $10 million worth of revenue, and that compares to last year where we had an unwinding, if you wish, of the fuel lag which actually was positive to the tune of $0.04 per share. So net quarter-to-quarter, comparing 2008 to 2009, we had a fuel headwind, if you wish, of $0.06 per share during this quarter.</p>
          <p>Labor and fringe benefits were down 4%, a favorable reduction of $17 million. However, if you exclude the acquisitions that we have made during the last year, the CSQ  and EJ&amp;E and the one time cost associated with higher stock-based compensation resulting from a higher stock price, the decline would be 10%, or roughly $40 million. And that has been achieved through a number of means but mostly reduction in manpower. So the average manpower used during the quarter was down 5%, and again adjusting for acquisitions it was actually down 7.5%.</p>
          <p>We also had some favorable adjustments or favorable results in the purchase of services and material. Our expense was $227 million. That was a favorable $47 million or 18% on an FX adjusted basis mostly resulting from the lower third party transportation services and material.</p>
          <p>The other area where we had a favorable adjustment or favorable performance was in the casualty and other. Our expenses for the third quarter were 64 million. That's a 31 million reduction from last year where it was 95 million. Now that 30 or so million dollars improvement was principally resulting from our adjustments to provisions for U.S. personal injuries and other claims.</p>
          <p>The last few years, I should mention, that this type of actual review and update of our assumptions typically occurred in the fourth quarter. And so if you look for it last year, you will see a similar amount taken in the fourth quarter of 2008. So all in all, 2009 the expenses at 1.156 billion, and that's a 20% improvement over 2008.</p>
          <p>This was also achieved while maintaining a very safe and fluid operation and network. A couple of statistics, which I think are worthy of mention, our injury rate actually improved from 2.13 to 2.1 compared to last year, and our accident rate is actually down to 1.98 from 2.16 from last year.</p>
          <p>We also, as Hunter mentioned, achieved outstanding operating productivity results. And just to name a few, GTMs per train mile were improved by 7%. Our cars per yard switching hours improved by 29% to 39.8 cars per hour. Our terminal dwell was improved 9% and down to 7.4 hours, while the main line GTM per available horsepower was also favorable 6%. Car miles per day up 16%, and train velocity up 11%.</p>
          <p>Now, looking at the year-to-date free cash flow, we continue to generate some very strong free cash flow. Year-to-date we registered $657 million worth at the end of September and that's actually slightly higher than 2008, even when you back out the $157 million which is attributable to the sale of the Western Sub in the first quarter to GO Transit.</p>
          <p>We clearly are focusing on cash flow and managing very tightly the cash. As an example, our DSO is actually down to 23 days versus 27 days at the end of the year. And we continue to focus on investing our capital expenditures. Our target remains at 1.4 to 1.5 billion for the year, and we've to date spent $838 million. We are focusing those investments in the productivity, safety and service areas.</p>
          <p>The net debt at the end of the quarter stood at 6.3 or $6.4 billion and our balance sheet ratios were very good, very strong and healthy. Our adjusted debt-to-total cap was at 38.8% while our adjusted debt-to-adjusted EBIDTA was 2.13. Those numbers are well within our target objectives of 45% for debt-to-total cap, and 2.25 in terms of debt-to-EBIDTA.</p>
          <p>To wrap it up, maybe a few words on the current outlook. As you can see, we've delivered some very solid results in the third quarter, both on a relative and an absolute basis in what can best be described as a difficult economic context. We believe we've seen -- we've been through the worst, and we're very encouraged by the signs that we see of gradual recovery.</p>
          <p>Looking at the fourth quarter, we are conscious; however, that some of our shock absorbers are becoming headwinds. As an example, the foreign exchange in the fourth quarter of 2008, you will recall, had really came down and stood around $0.82, $0.83; versus we're currently running exchange, the Canadian dollar's running at about $0.95. So this could translate into a headwind of roughly $0.04 per share.</p>
          <p>Also and more importantly, the fuel lag is a key item. Last year, again, there was a very steep correction in the WTI from $118 in the third quarter down to $58 in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now this unwinding of the lag contributed to our fourth quarter results to the tune of $100 million pre-tax. So that's roughly a $0.17 or so headwind compared to what we are looking at this year.</p>
          <p>I'll also remind you, as I mentioned earlier, that we did take the positive adjustments for casualty and other legal claims this year in the third quarter as opposed to the fourth quarter of last year, and that in itself is roughly a $0.04 per share of difference.</p>
          <p>So in a nutshell, having said that, we're remaining very focused on locking in the productivity gains which we've achieved and gradually adapting to the progress that we're making in terms of the volume and the business coming back.</p>
          <p>We want to ensure that we have the right level of resources to balance the service versus the productivity of our assets. So we're focusing on the smart capital spending. We continue to maintain a prudent financial management of the company while obviously running a safe and efficient railway.</p>
          <p>So we look forward to the next quarter and the future with a high degree of optimism. And on that note, I'll turn it over to Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thanks Luc. I'd like to go through a couple of slides quickly here talking about the revenue performance. First slide, really just trying to put things in perspective. The company's performance during the quarter here really from a volume standpoint. Carloads were 15% below the same period last year.</p>
          <p>However, volumes were 11% better this quarter than the previous quarter. Volumes clearly hit bottom in late May and showed steady sequential growth throughout the quarter, rising above the preceding week 10 out of 14 times.</p>
          <p>Sequential growth was experienced in the vast majority of our commodity groups. We take a look at the next slide. We will go through the company's revenues and dig a little deeper into the various segments.</p>
          <p>Total revenues were down 20% excluding the positive impact of 50 million in higher revenues due to the year-over-year weaker Canadian dollar. Price increases of approximately 4% could not offset lower year-over-year volumes and reduced fuel surcharge revenues that contributed about equally to the reduction in revenues.</p>
          <p>When compared to the previous year, the decline in petroleum and chemicals reflects the lower operating rates of chemical producers and weaker demand for petroleum-based products. However, condensate continued to show strength versus the previous year as did new movements of jet fuel and consistent shipments of LPGs.</p>
          <p>Although carloads improved sequentially this quarter, the metals and minerals group continues to reflect weak overall markets when compared to last year. Iron ore volumes improved throughout the quarter, as did steel products. But they still have quite a ways to go to get back to normal. Forest products also showed sequential improvement this quarter versus last. The carloads were still down 22% from last year's third quarter.</p>
          <p>Coal move showed the best upward movement followed by lumber and panels, which also showed improvement, but paper continues to decline.</p>
          <p>Moving to the bulk segments, our coal volumes were higher on a year-over-year basis due to increased Canadian originated metallurgical coal shipments. As output from several mines increased, a mine reopened and we started a new destination move.</p>
          <p>This was offset by reduced steam coal volumes in the U.S., which remain very weak to reduce -- due to reduced demand. Grain benefited from a strong Canadian export program for wheat and barley; however, this was offset by slow U.S. corn and bean shipments.</p>
          <p>Fertilizers, primarily potash, continue to be impacted by the farmer's decision to delay putting down the product. Reduced North American consumer demand continues to impact overseas intermodal improving volumes over the Port of Prince Rupert are being offset by ongoing significant year-over-year declines through the Port of Vancouver. An improving export program through the port of Halifax has started to have a positive impact there.</p>
          <p>Our domestic volumes remain stable when compared to the previous quarter. However, they are down when compared to last year, reflecting lower U.S. and transborder shipments, which are typically shorter haul and more susceptible to truck competition when fuel prices are lower. Automotive volumes have stabilized but continue to be down significantly year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Our other revenue line item is impacted by the economic slowdown and reduced activities in the non-rail transportation businesses.</p>
          <p>We take a look to the next slide, the market drivers share, taking a look at the merchandise side of the business. It appears many commodities have bottomed out in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, we're seeing sequential improvements in steel, iron ore and chemicals, lumber panels and automotive markets appear to be stable, albeit at a significantly lower levels.</p>
          <p>The bulk side of the business is really a tale of two countries. In the U.S. both the corn and bean crops are very good. In our draw territory corn production is estimated at 6.9% ahead of last year and 9.2% ahead of a five-year average.</p>
          <p>Soybean production is at 4.6% ahead of last year and 1.7% below the five-year average, so very, very good crop conditions there.</p>
          <p>The Canadian side, the Canadian grain crop production estimates have recently improved somewhat. Wheat is expected now to be down only 1% from the five year average and canola up about 6%. Even though production will be down from last year, a much larger than normal carry-in should put supplies near the five year average.</p>
          <p>In terms of coal U.S. thermal coal is expected to remain soft but Canadian metallurgical coal shipments should remain positive. And in terms of potash we are not really expecting any kind of a recovery until we get into 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving over to intermodal. International volumes continue to be supported by the growth of Prince Rupert, which is helping to offset the weakness in Vancouver. On the domestic markets, although down on a year-over-year basis are clearly stable sequentially. And for all of our segments, in intermodal in particular, the company's quality service that we have talked about is really helping support us to grow these volumes during these difficult economic times.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn it back to Hunter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks, Luc and Jim both for those very informative reports. So let me just finish up this way. As Luc mentioned, rightly so that our safety performance during the quarter also did not deteriorate as a result of these productivity gains. In fact, if you look at it from a dollar and cent standpoint, our accident costs I think through the year so far it's about $20 million improvement over last year, which was a big improvement over the year before.</p>
          <p>And the other thing I would hasten to mention is this. This was all achieved while we were having, setting records for service, virtually no complaints. We are filling 99% of the car orders on a timely guaranteed basis.</p>
          <p>And so this puts us in a position, these productivity gains, maintaining service, not taking our eye off the safety. None of this is new &#x2013; to Jim's point now, to sustain pricing discipline which positions us for long-term sustainable growth and it really excites me from a shareholder perspective, the opportunity that as we see the rebound, as we see what this organization will be able to produce in 2010 and out years.</p>
          <p>So with that, we would be happy to answer questions the group might have.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. And Hunter, wish you all the best. The question that I have to start is on currency. So when the Canadian dollar was last at parity, we certainly saw a suffering of the transborder trade and the economy was quite a bit stronger at that point. So how do you think about how this will affect your volumes from here? Does parity actually mean you could see loss of customers in that they actually can't afford to operate anymore? How do you think that will affect the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bill, this is Jim. The biggest area where we saw the impact when the dollar moved towards parity was in the forest products business, and that business right now is really, I would think that to the point where we are not going to see any kind of material change due to a dollar move from where they have become more accustomed in the $0.80 to $0.85 range up to a dollar. They were accustomed and had focused more on the actually higher 60, low $0.70 range and so the move was more significant and it took them time to adapt. So I don't anticipate -I'm certainly not anticipating the kind of issues that we saw with the move up last time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So currency you don't think affects growth at all at Prince Rupert? Because that's primarily originally it was designed as a U.S. destination port anyway, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>U.S. dollars, we priced that traffic in U.S. dollars.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second question, I don't know if this is better for Hunter or for Claude, but CN's already incredibly efficient. So how do you think about exploiting that going forward? You talked in the past about, maybe letting the operating ratio creep up a little bit just in terms of trying to win some new business. Is there another way to exploit that? Does it make sense to try to think about acquiring anything that is maybe noncontiguous and sort of improving their operations? Or how do you think about the best way to exploit your already beating costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well let me &#x2013; we will both comment. Bill, I think &#x2013; I'm not sure I agree with the term 'let the operating ratio creep.' I want to move away from &#x2013; we are not upset with the operating ratio. And I'd much rather have, in a high fixed cost capital intensive business like this, I'd much rather convert to growth and be a $20 billion company than a $10 billion company just simply do the math.</p>
          <p>But there is a lag between when we announce initiatives and ideas and concepts and as we did Smart Yard before they kick in. And I can tell you that the pipeline is not dry of initiative from an operating leverage standpoint. I guess one of the best examples I'd say to you is, is one of the things that we talked about earlier in the year that Claude was kind of cautious about is that if we could produce cash flow, positive cash flow like we are going to produce this year in this kind of environment, we could be opportunistic. And so we're going to be able to do things like probably acquire some locomotives year-end, I think that the Board approved this morning. And we got the locomotives at pretty good price and we are sitting, able to take advantage of those type of opportunities. And there will be others like that.</p>
          <p>Now, look, I am not going to walk out with the last good idea, I tell you that this group is too bright, too smart, and too sharp. They have got lot of things, that they are going to bring to the table. I'm sure Claude has got a set of ideas that is going to take this company to different levels. And so I think that you are going to see this company continue to perform and be the leader of the sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would echo that, Bill. I think we have a very full pipeline of breakthrough initiatives, whether it's on the growth side or whether its on the productivity side and I think the sweet spot is, as this economy is recovering we're going to have the volume working for us and so we certainly view the next few years with a very bullish set of eyes and we are confident we're going to be able to continue to drive performance. Hunter and I have a deal, he told me he would come out of his grave if we don't continue to perform or if we cut the dividends, so I have no intention of having that fight come my way.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hunter, best of luck in the new endeavors and Claude, best of luck going forward here. My question here right now is for Jim. Jim, you mentioned the Canadian coal being positive. If you took out the new business from Teck, are there still growth drivers, will it still be up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It would be &#x2013; probably not up but close to flat. The new Obed mine opened although it is much smaller and the production out there is ramping up, so it's more than just the new Teck business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jim as you look out, obviously the coal markets are weak &#x2013; particularly on the thermal side in the U.S. and demand is down natural gas is cheap and stockpiles are high. But there is also the mountaintop mining issue that we don't know which direction it's going to go, and if it does go against some of the eastern producers they're going to have to source coal from either the PRB or the Illinois Basin. Now you guys have the joint venture on mid-American corridor that down the road was supposed to potentially source new lanes for Illinois Basin coal. Any chance of moving that timeframe up given any potential action by the U.S. government?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're positioned and ready to go as soon as the need and the demand for the Illinois coal grows. And the producers there are ramping up and bringing on more mine capacity. So we are very optimistic for the Illinois Basin as well as being positioned to move more Central Apps south and east, I mean more PRB coal south and east as some of the Appalachian mines become under pressure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Luc, just a little bit more clarity on the casualty. You said that you took a $0.04 benefit. Let's call it 25 million or so, I think. Is that a fair pre-tax number? That's in third quarter and then in fourth quarter if we take the 64 million for casualty and other and basically add 25 back, that's more of a normal run rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somewhere around the low 90s is probably a decent run rate, yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>O.K. Jim, can you talk a little bit about pricing, net of currency and fuel, where we're at and what you are seeing as you start to negotiate contracts for next year what you are expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we will stay consistent in what we expect to achieve in the 4 to 5% range. That's where we have been with slight variation and we have somewhere between 55 to 60% of that locked in already for next year. So we'll maintain our focus and maintain our discipline, and that's what I would expect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up to that, within that 4 or 5%, where is international intermodal on that scheme? Is that at the high end, low end, below that? Where do you expect that to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over a reasonable period of time, there is very little difference between the commodity groups in our pricing strategy. We have for a long time been focused on pricing and have rebased or readjusted all of our contracts a long time ago. So now it is -its' more a factor of what we think is appropriate than seeing some variations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So for 2010, you feel the same way or is it different in 2010 but longer term it evens out?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a couple questions. On the casualty line, why are you &#x2013; why are you taking this adjustment this quarter and not just waiting until next quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simply, the timing for the actual review that was performed, so I mean, it was teed up and was actually completed in the quarter. So we didn't want to delay that and we just put it through.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the purchase side &#x2013; purchase services side. How much of that improvement was volume related and how much of it do you think is sustainable going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably difficult to have a precise number on that. I'd say most likely half of that is probably volume related. The other half stems from the fact that we've changed some of our practices and we've done things a little bit differently. So we've insourced a little more and we've done different things. So I'd say about half and half probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I can just ask one more real quick one. Could you talk a little bit more about train length and how close you might be to siding limits and how you view, how you could handle train length as volumes pick up coming out of the recession?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, number one, as you saw the metrics, I mean, we've had real top-notch performance in that area. We're building the network effectively to 11,000, 12,000-foot sidings. Our average train length now is in the high sevens. So we still got capacity there. All the locomotives that we're requiring now are DP equipped. So the DP gives us the opportunity to maintain that much more so in the winter than we have in the past, because of the train lines which will affect our over the lake operation, where we were looking at possibly doing siding extensions over the lakes two or three years ago, I mean, that's pretty rugged territory. It's a long way.</p>
          <p>And if I remember, the capital cost was somewhere in the close to $200 million range, and we just said to ourselves we can't justify it and I'd be doggone if we figured out a way to double saw up there and you've got to be a railroader to be able to understand that term.</p>
          <p>But that group up there has, without spending minimal capital, less than $5 million capital up there have increased the train speeds to 37 miles an hour which are all-time records handling fewer trains and so there is a lot of opportunities still on the train length side and we run trains up to 20,000 tons on parts of this railroad. And I can tell you that that 8,000 -- that last 8,000 feet and then the 9,000 feet, margin on that business is awful damn good. There is a lot of opportunity there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Matt Troy from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you and excellent comments, Hunter. Best of luck. Wanted to ask a question on incremental margin, which I think you were just touching on. And specifically, as we think about volumes recovering in a slow growth or gradual economic recovery, what you would describe or quantify as the incremental margin per carload across the system. I know the averages are tough. But what's your sense for that first 5 or 10% of improvement that comes? What's the incremental margin there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a pretty broad question. It's -- let me answer this way. If you see what we're producing today with the volumes levels we are at, and we're at 62 OR. And you got a high fixed cost capital intensive business, and you're going to bring additional business on and spread it more. That business is better than the business you got. It's good.</p>
          <p>And the next 5% is even better. The next 5% is even better than that. So that's some pretty exciting numbers. I mean you can run the numbers better than I can. You know our all time records of quarterly OR performance. If there is not opportunities to take that cash and do something else with it, you'll see some record OR numbers as a result of the incremental margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And then echoing the comments on the cash build up, certainly good cash flow numbers. You've talked about transition in focus for CN, Hunter, from being the best railroad to the best transportation company in the world. And I'm wondering with the cash you're building up, might it be time to look at investing that cash in businesses that aren't necessarily related directly or rolling in stock, iron and ties, beyond the network? Might we see a strategic shift there or should we look for money to go back to the asset-based business and the rails?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, a couple things, Claude should comment on this. I don't have a whole lot of time to focus on the long-term here. But I do think this. I think you'll continue to see this kind of organization with the same kind of discipline we have had in the past.</p>
          <p>The railroad is our core business; we're going to take care of that first unless something else comes up that I'm not aware of. But I do think this group will be smart enough that if we provide the cash -- that if there is opportunities to go into other lines of business that support the same transportation effort, the railroad effort, I'm sure this group will take a hard look at it.</p>
          <p>And so all these things, these ABC's that are producing these kind of results give you a lot of opportunity to Claude's term of being able to take advantage of weaknesses in the market out there and be opportunistic. Claude, you want to comment there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would just echo, we love the rail business. We think it's a very good industry and structure and we are at the beginning of a secular shift with the economy rebounding. And we believe we can improve our rail offerings and differentiate what we have to offer by being willing and able to take on last mile activity that are non-rail and help us put a package together that makes sense to the customers and help us grow our business. So that's the direction we'll continue to focus on, and the opportunities are there going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow up to that on the CapEx side you've articulated your budget. It seems to be heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter. Could you just tell me in terms of what &#x2013; if they were one or two or three big projects in the fourth quarter that would put you into the full year range? That would be helpful just in quantifying spend in the near term? Thanks guys.</p>

          <p>Just &#x2013; first question on the &#x2013; you are currently in some negotiations right now with your union. It seems to be on again, off again. But could you talk a little bit about the tone with the &#x2013; it seems a lot more conciliatory compared to last time obviously. But can you give us an update as to how those negotiations are going and what you are &#x2013; how optimistic you are that they will finish up sooner rather than later?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, they are negotiating as we speak, as we sit here. I think its fair to say that the two sides are not far apart. I would certainly characterize it that way. I think both sides want to reach an agreement. We don't want to see &#x2013; neither one of us want to see the work stop, God forbid, in this kind of environment. And so I think that I'm hopeful that we will be able to put out good news here in a week or so or two that we've got an agreement subject to ratification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And second question here on your project decisions, Hunter you mentioned you did a &#x2013; you guys invested in some locomotives in the quarter. I am just wondering given the amount stored &#x2013; in switching over to DP and taking opportunity on pricing there. Just given the amount that gets stored I would have thought you might have put off locomotive purchases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think there's some pressing issues there. If you look at our stored fleet and you look at the difference and the productivity of those locomotives as opposed to the newer locomotives, from a fuel standpoint &#x2013; where fuel prices are or they potentially could be. If you look at the DP and the opportunities those give us. If you look at the lower maintenance costs and if you look at the lower purchase costs that we were able to do it, you can't turn your back on it. It's just too compelling and too opportunistic.</p>
          <p>Now, at the same time I'd say to you that the locomotives that we think are not very efficient they will often have to put to work, we're not just sitting here at the storage, we're going to try to take opportunities when there's there to sell those locomotives, monetize them, lease them and do something with them. But that's not &#x2013; we have done a pretty good job in this organization of getting our fleet with our acquisitions and all, the age of our fleet had gone up and now we're down to about I think the average age of our higher horsepower is probably 11.5 or 12 years, pretty good, and its a clear, compelling issue to replace, locomotive.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Chris Ceraso from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. This is Allison Landry in for Chris. Congratulations Hunter. Just a couple of questions. I guess now that you guys are done with the Memphis Yard, can you maybe talk about the projects you'll now tackle to integrate EJ&amp;E into the network?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean we're going to -- Claude and Keith and I are going to meet next couple weeks in Chicago to try to talk about the longer term opportunities for Chicago and get our arms more wrapped around that. And there are a lot of opportunities there, further in Chicago when we make our final decisions on which is going to be the operating yard which one we will have an opportunity to convert potential to industrial centers or, to use Claude's term, the last mile facilities.</p>
          <p>But there are several other opportunities. I mean you need to think about, for an example, see there is a wonderful initiative going on now in Vancouver and their productivity at Vancouver terminal is up 35 or 38%, which is about -- just that one terminal is about 11 to $12,000 a day savings.</p>
          <p>So we've closed the Edmonton hump. The productivity is up dramatically there. Mac yard is probably the highest producing yard in the world to date. And every time you can do that, you open up more opportunities. So all the yards that we said we would rationalize and take advantage of those opportunities, as I told the Board this morning, I looked at my list and the final one got done when I got Edmonton done. And my final effort in those regard will be to help assist Keith and Claude with the so-called Chicago plan to try to open the door to more opportunities there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one other question. We've heard some anecdotal evidence from a few manufacturers in China that U.S. and European retailers replacing some last minute rush export orders since their inventories were so low. Have you guys seen any of that at Prince Rupert or in your international intermodal volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. At the end of the last quarter Hunter, your comment was that it felt like a bottom. And just wondering is your current thought still that things bottomed in the second quarter? And any thoughts about, or is there any evidence here of a double depth recession in your mind?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. I mean look that's not my cup of tea. I know a lot more about operating railroads than I do about the economy and what's going to happen in the recession. But my experience and evidence and what I've looked at in the various trends and our loading reports of sequential growth, I think we have bounced across the bottom and now we're starting to float to the top. How fast are we going to float? I can't tell you that. I just know that we're going to go up I think and the higher we come up and the faster we go, the better it's going to be. And I'm not worried about the bubble popping and going back to the bottom. That's something that I don't have concerns with.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My next question is about Prince Rupert. Just thoughts of another ship visiting there, I'm not sure how early that discussion would be. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the export versus import volumes. Are we still running about 35%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I'll answer your second question first. Our export volumes are much higher than that, over 50% and continuing to grow. In terms of additional volumes coming through Prince Rupert either with our existing steam ship partners or with a new customer, I think that there is still great interest across the board to increase that volume there and I hate to keep saying it but I'm very optimistic that that could happen. And I think, it's easy to look back, had we not hit the bottom with the markets 12, 18 months ago, I think we would have had it sold out and I think what I said then, if business starts to come back, I would hope to be in a position to say we will do that in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just a quick question on the EG&amp;E. There has been some talk about the Illinois Department of Transport being able to modify the merger agreement there. Can you provide any type of an update on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can tell you they can't do it. That's not their jurisdiction. It's SVV. We have &#x2013; we passed all the tests with flying colors. But I would say to you &#x2013; certainly we can work with them. If there is issues they have that we need to deal with. But I think just to give you a little update there, I think I'm correct here; we have mitigation agreements now with 19 I think communities which represents about 65% plus of the population.</p>
          <p>So we are kind of, no pun intended, over the hump there and moving forward with those projects. We continue to get a lot of opposition but we knew that was going to happen. And with due respect we are trying to work with those people, some of them, but they said that we -- we got a correspondence this week that we thought the dialogue was counter productive. There is no use having a dialogue if it is counter productive. So but &#x2013; EJ&amp;E is going to move forward and it's going to produce everything that, and plus, that we had anticipated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the only thing they have asked for Jacob is to extend the date for the start of the construction of those two great crossings, in actual five years as was actually ruled on a similar request previously. So it's in the hands of the STB but doesn't affect the merger.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you and good luck Hunter in your retirement.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, good afternoon, Hunter. Great quarter to go out on and good luck in your next phase. Just a quick number question. The other income, the $21 million, does that include real estate in there? Is that the station that was sold? What was that bump up for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. The reason &#x2013; the principal reason for the difference is we sold our equity investment in the EWS back in 2007. And as part of that transaction, there was an escrow account which was kept to meet potential indemnities. And so after a couple of years we had an amount which was released. So there was about 8 or $9 million that came-in in the quarter as a result of that. So that's the real issue there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just jumping over to Jim if I can on a follow-on. Jim how does the grain crop look? And then I guess a follow-on to add is just the regulated grain, how is the relationship with the Board following the last cost increase to the rails that went through? Any additional changes that they are looking to take on the horizon just thinking of the profitability of the business and kind of the economy we're in just wondering if it's getting more antagonistic or less? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, the grain crops. The grain crop in the U.S. is exceptional. Both corn and beans are exceptional and in our draught territory it's going to be very strong. We need pricing to increase so that product will begin to move, but we're going to be sitting a tremendous amount of stocks there to move.</p>
          <p>In Canada, the crop, the wheat crop is a -- the estimates are improving for that. And although it's going to be down compared to last year, because of a significant carry-forward of the crop that didn't move, it's about 13 million tons carry-forward north versus a normal eight.</p>
          <p>When you add the crop with the carry, we should have a five-year average. So we're sitting very good on both sides of the border in terms of what we have available to move when and if the pricing returns and it moves.</p>
          <p>In terms of a relationship with the regulators, I think our relationship with the regulators is much, much better today than it was when we were first working through some of the regulatory and cap issues.</p>
          <p>And we don't have a problem with that now. We understand the mechanisms and how the prices increase and are comfortable with working within that regime and don't have any problems with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Randy Cousins from BMO market. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jim, just looking at your weekly carloads chart, you've got a really nice recovery coming out of Q2, and it looks like we are not far from crossing over on the 2008 number. Again, your RTMs are performing much better than your carloads.</p>
          <p>Can you give us some sense, whatever sense you are getting from your customers about the prospects for volumes for Q4? Do you see a situation where Q4 volumes are going to better than Q3? How can you sort of shape that up for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look at October that trend line continues, and I don't see anything in the future that would lead me to believe that what we're seeing is this kind of gradual growth that all of our customers seem very comfortable with.</p>
          <p>We clearly, from an operating standpoint, are pleased with and it's something we can get our heads around and manage through. We'd much rather see this than some kind of volatile up one month down the next, up one month down the next. So I think that's what everybody is looking for.</p>
          <p>And yes, I would hope that those lines should cross, hopefully sooner than later, but they will cross in the fourth quarter and it's kind of a coin flip now as to whether or not there we will be a plus or minus in the fourth quarter. But that's where the trend line appears to be heading.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Hunter, your productivity numbers are spectacular and the train velocity is just amazing. As you add the volume back, can you sustain these metrics? And have these metrics been improving over the course of the quarter, or has there been some sort of ebb and flow? In other words, we see good Q3 sequential, are we going to continue to see improvements into the fourth quarter in terms of these metrics or as the volumes come back do the metrics kind of stall out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the metrics should improve. Not the analogy like the holiday period when things are going to be real soft. If you start comparing fourth quarter to third, year-over-year is fine. But this group is &#x2013; its operating group has worked very, very hard on this. They have learned a lot in a short period of time. They have got to be very, very good with the DP power.</p>
          <p>They've got to be very good with meeting long trains over the lakes. There's couple of other initiatives that we have got at one spot on the railroad where we'd get a almost a 2% grade. It requires a real high horsepower for trailing ton.</p>
          <p>I think Keith is working on an initiative there to get around that. So you are going to continue to see these productivity gains go up. And if you go back &#x2013; if you really want to mess your mind, go back and look at where they were at 10 years ago and it is pretty staggering. But its there and I think it will continue to get better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the real takeaway here is that the productivity is not a function of the fact there is less load on the railroad. We can add load back without losing any productivity whatsoever.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes from a productivity standpoint, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on a related question, in terms of head count, labor costs are the single biggest cost that you have got. How much volume can you add to the railroad before you have to start adding people back in?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean we've done a lot of things differently than others. If you look at our head count, I don't know it's down, what, maybe 4 to 5%? But you take into account well, where you've made the acquisition of the short line here in Quebec and we have EJ&amp;E and we have done a lot of things for an example with the maintenance season we hire maintenance workers, we keep the train and engine men that were going to be in a laid off status and offer them jobs in engineering.</p>
          <p>And we &#x2013; to be able to keep us in preparation for a rebound we've insourced a lot of work that we've done, where we used to contract it out, we are doing it ourself. So I think we would like to be worried that we couldn't handle all the business if it came back. That's not going to happen for some period of time. I hope it does. The only cap I see is they got to be miracle workers to figure a whole lot out more than terminals. I have spent all my life in terminals and I don't know what more we can do there. But if we can sustain that level that we are now, that's powerful. But its more the over the road metrics that will continue to improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So is it possible that you can add 5 or 10% volume without having to add to the head count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, 5 to 10% a not a bent. It's effectively a not of bent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My question is for, I guess either Luc or Claude. And I am just wondering what your thoughts are, and maybe what the Board's thoughts are, in terms of share buybacks as we get into sort of a better environment. I know this question is a bit premature, but just what's your thinking about use of cash flow? You talked earlier about investing in the railroad and possibly looking at some opportunities outside of the railroad if those become available. But in the event that sort of that latter scenario doesn't play out, could we see buybacks returning in 2010 or is it still too early for that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, I mean, we've got some very good cash flow up to this end of the quarter and we foresee that to continue on in fact to build momentum. Our balance sheet ratios are very healthy, so we're in good shape. And I think we're going to watch and see how the economy performs over the next few months.</p>
          <p>And we continue to have the same sort of sequence in looking at things. First, meeting our CapEx requirements and making sure that our network is in top shape. I mean, that's always first call on our cash.</p>
          <p>Then obviously we look at whatever strategic projects we have out there that could make significant demands on cash. And last but certainly not least, we look to dividends, and historically we've had a very good clip of increases in dividends and the last issue is stock buybacks. So I think those are things which we'll take care a little bit of a closer look at in early 2010 as we see where the fourth quarter actually ends up. But we're in pretty good shape, all things considered. So we'll see.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good afternoon. Hunter, when we were down in Memphis you did point to the Port of Vancouver as a place on your network that might benefit from some investment to improve efficiency. And I think you alluded to a project that Keith got underway earlier in the call. Could you just offer some more color on what you are up to there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Vancouver?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is &#x2013; first of all, just improving raw productivity at Vancouver. We have had some &#x2013; that can from time to time be a rather congested port, particularly in grain season. So we put some new leadership in Vancouver, made several personnel changes, and there are several new initiatives going on with the DP.</p>
          <p>We made some changes where we are not hauling from a couple of the intermodal terminals. We are tracking that because of the very low volumes. And all those things have worked pretty well to start to clear up until we improve dramatically the productivity in Vancouver, which is by far our highest cost terminal.</p>
          <p>Chicago and Vancouver are the two high cost centers we have. So to make a &#x2013; like a 13 &#x2013; 12 to $13,000 improvement a day in Vancouver is a huge, huge breakthrough.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is also a couple of hinge point that will be addressed with the Gateway investments that the government of Canada and stakeholders have announced which will be helpful going forward. A few road cross things, a few track extensions, pinch points in that terminal that will help that more fluid operations going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And my second question is, I presume that you absorbed the 4% sequential increase in your RTM holding train starts constant. Just wondered if you could confirm that, did you absorb that volume with the same number of train in yard crew starts versus Q2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were less train crew starts. I think and the numbers are pretty close, somebody will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the road crew cost down about 12 to 13%, which probably is effectively the same &#x2013; road crew starts were down 22% year-over-year. So, yes, and we can absorb more of that growth without additional train crew starts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's where DP comes into play. As we are rolling out, we are training our employees to be able to run DP trains across more of the territory. And as we are getting these, the units that we are converting from the ones we already own that we are converting to DP and the ones that we will receive early next year, the 40 that we had ordered we are getting more DP power steps and that will allow us to continue to add to our grid those higher and longer and more efficient trains.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. My question obviously you show very good strong financial performance this quarter. You talked a little bit about the NCIb but I was wondering if there is any other business ventures that you are looking at that could positively impact free cash flow generation? Could you maybe provide more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are always looking to a highest best use approach. There is some little transaction in the real estate side whereby we are working, our operating people, our real estate people are looking at the assets that we own and are basically focused on highest best use.</p>
          <p>This one transaction earlier in Toronto was a good example of that, although a larger one and it is possible as GO Transits continues to want to own more of its network to improve its service, we are certainly willing to sit down with them and do transactions that make sense for both of us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And just my second question, you talk about the DSO performance down to 23 days from 27. Just wondering if you could provide more color about how sustainable it is going forward</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it is quite sustainable. I mean, I think we've made a number of improvements in terms of the way in which we relate to some of the customers which have had historically longer payment terms and so on and so forth. And keep in mind that this has been a very difficult environment as well. So, I mean, to do 23 days in this environment has been a bit of daunting task. So, I think it will probably will hover around 23, 24. I don't expect it to go back up to 27. On the other hand, it's going to be tough to bring it any lower than this.</p>
