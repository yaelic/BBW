          <p>Good afternoon, and welcome to our Q1 conference call. First, I'd like to focus on the market environment and the highlights of the first quarter 2009. And then Lothar Steinebach, our CFO, he will provide you with the Q1 financials in much greater detail. And after that, I will comment on the outlook for 2009. And at the end, we will take your questions.</p>
          <p>However, before we start, I would like to remind you that the presentation, which contains the usual formal disclaimer to forward-looking statements within the meaning of relevant U.S. legislation, can be accessed via website at henkel.com/ir. The presentation discussions are conducted separate to the disclaimer, we will not read the disclaimer, but propose we take it as read into the records for the purpose of this conference call.</p>
          <p>And by this, I like to start and starting off by saying that we continue to execute around our strategic priorities that we've defined for the next four years with our long-term targets in mind, and these are the driving forces for our overall execution.</p>
          <p>Now, let me get into where we're coming from. I will start off by briefly talking about the market environment and the highlights of the first quarter. What we've seen in the first quarter of 2009 has been a strong recession continuing from the fourth quarter into the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And unfortunately, we have seen a recession spreading to all regions. So all regions where we conduct business are more or less impacted. It is very clear that the industrial side is significantly harder impacted than the private consumption. You have all seen the numbers from the automotive, the electronics, and the aerospace manufacturers. And of course, as direct supplier to those, we are heavily impacted by their manufacturing capacity and utilization.</p>
          <p>On the private consumption, this has been less impacted, and I will go slightly into detail on this topic during my presentation and then further on in the Q&amp;A session. But we are seeing private consumption on heavy duty items it is impacted on fast-moving consumer goods to a lesser extent. However, there are also positives that we are starting to see in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We are starting to see an acceleration of the decrease in raw material pricing. We are seeing significantly lower inflation rates, and we are also seeing government stimulus packages stabilizing not only the financial markets, but also impacting the overall manufacturing market, particularly on the automotive side in the low end of the market. So while the overall environment is still very constrained and is under stress, we are seeing certain positives in the overall market set up.</p>
          <p>Now, go to the highlights, we have seen a significant downturn in our Adhesives business and we've seen that downturn starting in the fourth quarter and that has been further accelerated into the first quarter. That has also been further accelerated by extended vacation periods around Christmas, but of course, also destocking in all elements of the supply chain.</p>
          <p>We've seen mature markets in Western Europe and U.S. strongly affected by the recession. And we are seeing a slowing growth in the emerging markets. Eastern Europe is being impacted and Asia.</p>
          <p>On the Chinese economy, it's worth mentioning that that is still growing by 6%, but the consolation of the 6% now compared to previous is very different. The 6% you see now is much more infrastructure-related, and the beneficiaries are local manufacturers, whereas the old quote, unquote "6%" was driven by export manufacturing into the Western European and North American markets and that has had a significant impact.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, we've had a very successful start of our Laundry &amp; Home Care business and Personal Care business. We've taken real response to the crisis with specific counter measures, which are helping our P&amp;L. We have a very solid financial position post the Ecolab sale and our recent bond insurance, and our implementation of strategic policies are well on the track. And we are making consistent progress in each of the different areas as it relates to ensuring operational excellence, focusing on our customers and strengthening our global team. But overall, it's fair to say that we've had a restrained start into 2009 with 50% of the business performing very strongly and 50% of the business being heavily impacted by the recession.</p>
          <p>Our Laundry &amp; Home Care business has seen a continued strong growth in the emerging markets, particularly Eastern Europe and Middle East. We've seen a significant EBIT increase confirming our strong performance of the fourth quarter, so the turnaround in the middle of the third quarter continues and we continue to see a very strong EBIT increase.</p>
          <p>We're seeing the efficiency measures starting to pay off. The early decisions we took last year with the implementation of our Global Excellence program is starting to show signs in its P&amp;L. And we are seeing a number of products being launched which is helping driving not only growth, but also profitability; the one being cold power formula for premium detergents in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>And lastly, our strategy around focusing on our core brands is a core element of our growth and profitability strategy, and is performing well. So for the Laundry &amp; Home Care side of the business, we've seen a successful start into the new year.</p>
          <p>For our Personal Care part of the business, we've seen the strong organic growth that continued in a market that is declining. We are clearly outgrowing the market. We have seen emerging markets with very solid growth rates and we have seen in our mature markets that we are outperforming the respective markets and market segments in which we operate.</p>
          <p>On top of that, we've seen an over-proportional EBIT growth, so further strengthening the profitability of business in Personal and Home Care. And again, also in this area, our top brands grew more than 5% organically, really been the driver for the growth in this business. So for the Personal Care side of the business, we've had an impressive first quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Moving on to Adhesives, there is no doubt that this is the more challenging element of our business. We've seen a very strong decrease of sales and EBIT driven by automotive, electronics, and durable goods and metal, which has significantly impacted our results in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We have seen a recession which on the adhesive side is particularly related to North America and Asia-Pacific. Asia-Pacific for the reasons I just mentioned that China being the manufacturing country. For the Western part of the world, we have seen an acceleration of the downturn through destocking and lower capacity utilization across all manufacturing industries, and that in combination with the recession was a significant challenge for us in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We have, however, seen that our consumer-related businesses are performing much more stable than the industry-related businesses. We're seeing continued strong market position across all businesses. So we believe that we've either maintained or further strengthened our market share positions in the respective markets where we are present. And we are taking a number of various specific counter measures to ensure that we work against the markets that we are working within.</p>
          <p>Overall, the first quarter which was strongly impacted by the recession and which was also the primary driver for our health message on April 8.</p>
          <p>The key financials for Henkel for the first quarter is revenue to the tune of &#x20AC;3.258 billion, an increase over last year's 3.1%, but a decrease organically of 7, because in the number of Q1 2008, the 3.162, that number did not include the National Starch number, so a decrease organic of 7, an increase overall of 3. And adjusted EBIT compared to last year of 235 versus 318, so a decrease of 26.1%, and adjusted EBIT margin going from 10.1 to 7.2 and adjusted EPS of 0.51 to 0.31, so decline of almost 40%.</p>
          <p>As I said, the sales increase was due to National Starch, we have seen an organic decline. And our adjusted EBIT and EPS is significantly below previous year, all driven by Adhesives business following a strong first quarter from fast-moving consumer goods business. So clearly a challenging first quarter for Henkel.</p>
          <p>We will now go into the details, I will then speak about the outlook, and we will subsequent move to the Q&amp;A. Lothar, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll provide some perspective on the financial for the first quarter and go right into the sales growth by business sector.</p>
          <p>First of all, Laundry &amp; Home Care with total growth of minus 1.7%; foreign exchange effected plus 0.4; Personal Care 1.7 total growth; foreign exchange adjusted 2.9, and Adhesive Technologies total growth 7.7, FX-adjusted 7.2.</p>
          <p>I'll get into the organic growth figures in a moment. For the total company then results in total growth of 3.1% and 3.8, respectively, FX-adjusted.</p>
          <p>Going into Laundry &amp; Home Care, first, organic growth of 0.4%, which is composed of price impact of 7.4, a very strong price impact and a minus 7 on volumes, so a decline in our organic growth in terms of volume. Price increases, which we have taken in the fourth quarter of last year and continuing through the first quarter this year, have overcompensated the volume losses. And we have been able to continue our strong growth in the emerging markets in our Laundry &amp; Home Care business with double-digit growth.</p>
          <p>Backing out the impact from discontinuing our business in China, which we have ended at the end of last year, organic growth would have been 1.2%. So despite difficult markets conditions, despite the strong lead that we have taken in increasing our prices we still managed to generate good organic growth.</p>
          <p>Personal Care, our next division, with organic growth of 3.5% composed of 1.1 from price and 2.4 from volume, so very healthy composition of our growth, price, and volume driven. We've continued on our growth path in emerging markets and surprisingly in North America still organic growth, positive organic growth in North America.</p>
          <p>All organic growth 3.5% versus a very strong prior year quarter, we have had achieved 6.1% organic growth in Q1, '08, so then another 3.5 this year makes for a strong performance of our Personal Care business.</p>
          <p>Strongest contribution to growth was from our retail hair business, which has been increasing above the average rate of the total division and the other divisions have contributed.</p>
          <p>Next, Adhesive Technology organic growth minus 18.2%, price plus 4.5, volume minus 22.7, this is strongest as we have communicated during the course of the first quarter. In our Specialty Adhesives and Surface Treatment division, which have as their major customer base automotive, metal, durable goods, and the other part, which has been performing negatively was our Electronics business, which obviously is affected by the downturn in the electronics materials markets.</p>
          <p>Sales growth by region. We have almost all regions, except Latin America, negative sales growth. Europe, Africa/Middle East minus 4.6, North America minus 14, and Asia-Pacific minus 20, plus 5.1 organic growth in Latin America, which was driven -- contributed by all divisions. Only Latin America in terms of regions shows, for the total company, positive organic sales growth.</p>
          <p>The next item refers to our sales growth in what we perceive as emerging markets for the Henkel businesses which is Eastern Europe, Middle East/Africa, Latin America, and Asia, excluding Japan. We have had even through that difficult period of time double digit sales growth in our Home and Personal Care division. We have had Adhesives strongly declining and therefore in total in the emerging markets 0.3, basically on the same level as last year.</p>
          <p>EBIT growth by business sector; there again we see the impact from -- good performance, strong performance of our Home and Personal Care divisions and we see the negative impact from the strong negative volume impact in our Adhesive Technology division. We've had experienced an increase in 100 basis points in our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, increase in 30 basis points in our Personal Care division, and a minus 780 basis points in Adhesive Technologies.</p>
          <p>Looking first at our Laundry &amp; Home Care division, 100 basis points increase in our EBIT margin based on a pretty low level of organic sales increase. So we have had the experience of strong price increases in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. And additionally, we benefited from measures to reduce our cost and enhance the efficiency in our division, which has resulted in a strong increase in our margin. We've not seen much of a positive impact from the reduction in raw materials, which we would expect to kick in, in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Personal Care, 30 basis points increase over last year. We've had already a high level of our EBIT margin in the Personal Care division last year, and we have still increased it yet another 30 basis points, which signifies our drive towards profitable growth in the Personal Care division having been successful again in the face of increasingly difficult market environment.</p>
          <p>Adhesive Technologies, minus 780 basis points, obviously a strong impact from the reduction in volume, low capacity utilization in our plants despite the cost savings initiatives that we had undertaken beginning last year and continuing through this year. The volume decline has overcompensated in a negative way the cost savings measures that we had undertaken in the first quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Again, looking at the EBIT, the evolution of our Adhesive Technology division Q1, '09 versus Q4 '08, we've seen strong margin erosion -- stronger margin erosion in the first quarter, which has been accelerating over the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in organic sales started by mid of Q4 '08 and lasted throughout the full first quarter '09. So therefore, the impact from the sales decline or the volume decline was much stronger in the first quarter. Plus, we've seen stronger impact in the high profit segments, Specialty Adhesives and Electronics, which have experienced a stronger decline in terms of volume than the other divisions. And furthermore, we have seen a strong decline in the high profit regions, particularly Europe and Asia, Asia having been affected as much as the other regions in the world.</p>
          <p>Look at the income statement, in particular the gross margin evolution, we have, compared to the first quarter of last year, minus 230 basis points in terms of margin. Gross margin at closer look, the evolution of our gross margin is composed of a positive impact from price volume 2.6 percentage points up. We've seen a negative on the cost of sales of 1.6, of which major part is from still an increase in raw material prices in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of last year, which has then ended up in a margin of 47.1%. The additional impact on the reported margin is from restructuring expenses of 0.3 percentage points and 2.5 from acquisitions and divestments that is basically from the National Starch businesses, which have come along into the Henkel portfolio with a far lower gross margin than what we have in terms of average gross margin in our businesses.</p>
          <p>The 1.6 negative from cost of sales is 0.5 percentage points from price increases on raw materials and packaging. Even though the development is down from the high point in the middle of last year, we are still having compared to first quarter of last year a negative impact on our gross margin from raw material price increases, which obviously, will turnaround in the next quarters as we get the impact in our P&amp;L from the lower raw material and packaging material prices.</p>
          <p>We still have a negative impact, particularly, in our Detergent and Cosmetics division from the higher raw material prices, while the impact -- the negative impact on the Adhesive division is already lower. That's again a shift in terms of comparing the negative impact from raws and packs on the gross margin compared to Q4 '08, where we had a negative impact of 2.5 percentage points. In other words, the negative from the raw material price increases has come down considerably and we expect that to reverse in the next quarter.</p>
          <p>Now this 47.1% gross margin, the intermediate step is an improvement of 220 basis points against Q4 '08, and the 44.3%, there again, it's more than six percentage points improvement over Q4 '08, because the impact from National Starch has become much lower. We have already realized some of the synergies and savings, and therefore the negative impact from National Starch acquisition on our gross margin has come down to 2.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>Look at the income statement from gross profit to adjusted EBIT. We have an increase in marketing, selling, and distribution expenses by 2.7%, R&amp;D expenses 15.1, and admin expenses by 10.4.</p>
          <p>A quick look at marketing, selling, and distribution expenses, that's a structural impact from the National Starch acquisition, again, because National Starch, obviously, has lower marketing expenses than the Henkel average. It's not a branded products business, and therefore there is a lower increase in marketing, selling, and distribution expenses then otherwise would have to be expected in terms of additional sales that we have acquired from National Starch.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D, there again that's in structural impact because National Starch comes along with a higher ratio of R&amp;D expenses compared to sales than the original Henkel business. And we expect that again to benefit from some of the synergies and savings that we expect to realize during the ensuing quarters of this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, admin expenses up 10.4% compared to the same period last year. Obviously, that includes the impact from National Starch, which we have not seen in the first quarter of last year because we consolidated National Starch as of the second quarter of last year and also compared to Q4, is an additional element of savings that we had been able to generate in the fourth quarter of last year compared to the normal expense ratio.</p>
          <p>Income statement. EBIT to net earnings, financial results more negative than in the first quarter of last year, from minus 19 to minus 52. And the tax rate up to 27.1%, 120 basis points compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Let's look at the financial results, which obviously has two basic changes in the financial results. One, is the lack of the income, the debt equity income from the Ecolab participation, which we have disposed in fourth quarter of last year, and therefore there is a lack of, so to speak, 19 million, plus the additional increase in net debt, which we have incurred compared to the same period last year as a result of financing the National Starch acquisition. So therefore, the net interest results -- financial results composed of the participation and the net interest results has decreased, or is more negative than in the same period of last year, particularly as a result of the increase in the net debt that we have undertaken.</p>
          <p>Tax rate higher than last year by 120 basis points. We have experienced lower taxable income from countries with lower nominal tax rates. So therefore that's a structural impact and therefore the best estimate for the remainder of this year is that we will be living with a tax rate of 27% compared to a lower tax rate -- slightly lower tax rate last year.</p>
          <p>Reported to adjusted earnings just to provide the transparency necessary for the calculation of EBIT as reported to adjusted EBIT. We have one-time gains, which we have adjusted of 3 million one-time charges, again adjusted 4 million and the restructuring charges. The one-time gain that we have adjusted is a post retirement healthcare gain, which we have realized as a result of the disposition of our client in North America, the cosmetics plant, which we have disposed of earlier in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>We have a one-time charge, the integration costs for National Starch of 4 million, which we have incurred in the first quarter of this year. And finally, the restructuring charge of 16 million, which we have adjusted for the calculation of adjusted EBIT is composed of normal restructuring expenses of 5 million. That's basically the level that we would expect for the full year or maybe a little bit more third quarter, and 11 million from National Starch the final integration measures</p>
          <p>Development of net working capital, basically, on the same level that we had last year with improvements in our Home and Personal Care divisions and a slightly deterioration in our Adhesives division, basically, compensating each other resulting at about the same level of 13% net working capital -- cash net working capital to sales.</p>
          <p>Look at the cash flow from operating activities, which is negative by minus 45 in Q1. In order to provide a look at free cash flow, we have added back batches of intangible assets, batches of property, plant and equipment, and proceeds on disposal of other non-current operating assets arriving at a free cash flow of minus 126 compared to minus 78 in the same period of last year. However, there are a number of one-off charges particularly in the cash outflow -- cash flow from operating activities, and therefore we are providing, and look at adjustments one-off items, which have to be adjusted in order to take an appropriate look at our free cash flow. That's the cash out tax payment, which we have undertaken in the first quarter of 125 million. We have communicated towards the end of last year that, while we had completed the transaction, the cash outflow of the tax would be incurred this year. So that's 125 cash out, which obviously is not a recurring item, and the cash out for National Starch and our restructuring program of 36 million in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Packing out those two one-offs, one would arrive -- we would arrive at an adjusted free cash flow of 35, plus 35 compared to minus 70 compared to last year, which is quite an achievement in the difficult environment in which we are operating and showing the impact from the measures that we have undertaken to generate free cash flow, such as going down on our expenses and also improving our cash net working capital.</p>
          <p>Net debt development. We have an increase in net debt by roughly 400 million. That's basically due to the cash out for the tax payments, the equivalent tax payments, which I mentioned earlier, there has been a true-up of a purchase price payment to octo an adjustment of 50 million, and foreign exchange effects of almost 100 million, plus the restructuring expenses or cash outs, which I mentioned earlier, the 36 million.</p>
          <p>Quick look at debt structure and maturities of our instruments, the hybrid bond, which has the maturity in 2104; senior bonds 1 billion, 2013; another senior bond, which we have issued in March of this year having the maturity in 2014; the floating rate note, which we have issued in March of 2009 with a maturity in 2014. The remainder of the bridge loan, the 0.7, which we still have following the retirement of almost 1 billion from the proceeds of the senior bond is 2010 April; commercial paper outstanding about 0.3, this is three months papers; and bank loans and other instruments with a duration of less than 12 months 0.4. That is compared to total liquidity and reserves of about 3.2 billion. We have liquid funds invested still of little bit more than 1 billion. We have unused committed bank lines of 0.3, and undrawn commercial paper of 1.8. So we are in a pretty comfortable liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Timeline of our Global Excellence. Savings, planned and actual savings in the first quarter of this year we have realized for Global Excellence savings already 27 million. We are maintaining our guidance for full year of 100 million, but obviously there is an upside to it.</p>
          <p>Timeline for the National Starch savings, we have realized already 30 million in Q1. We are maintaining our outlook for the full year of 125 million. We should be well on our way to realize those savings.</p>
          <p>With that, I hand over to Kasper for the outlook 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lothar. It's clear that in the outlook of 2009, we're still experience severe constraints as it relates to transparency. What I have outlined here is basically the forecast from Feri over the last seven months, and it gives you the starting point October, where the global outlook for GDP growth was estimated to be 2.2%. In November, they estimated the global output or global GDP growth rate to be 1.0, in December zero, in January minus 0.5, in February minus 1.3, in March minus 2.4, and in April minus 2.5.</p>
          <p>So as you can see, it seems not likely that the recession has finally hit rock bottom. We also are seeing certain industries affected much harder than consumer goods. We are looking upon private consumptions going back with 0.5%, retail sales minus 1.6, automotive around minus 20, and electronics around minus 25. So pending on industrial sector and also even region, the impact of the recession is different, but quite severe overall. And based on this, we are still remaining on the outlook parameters that we have outlined previously. But let me go a bit more into detail.</p>
          <p>Based on the current market outlook, we've taken a number of countermeasures. And these countermeasures were not taken yesterday. They were taken very early on. And we've categorized them in three different categories. On the sales side, I believe it's very important, through these times to make certain that we keep the focus on our customers. Our top five customers today still grow faster than twice the rate of our company. And making sure that we position Henkel as a reliable supply in difficult times is quite important. We are seeing a number of smaller or medium sized suppliers having significant difficulty, and we're seeing larger customers of our own where the reliability aspect of the supplier is playing a bigger, bigger role.</p>
          <p>However, that is the top line. And the cost line, it is clear that we cannot go above -- beyond that. And we've already within Global Excellence and National Starch initiated more than 60 projects in manufacturing and supply chain. We are starting to realize purchasing savings, and as we've indicated earlier on, we see savings on our raw materials in the mid single digit compared to last year, and we've been early on in trying to ensure that we capture these savings as early as possible.</p>
          <p>We have been very restricted and continue to be so with either no hiring or restricted hiring. We have significantly reduced our travel and entertainment expenses. We are delaying and postponing any project where it makes sense to do so. We have intensified our collection of overdues and dues. We have reduced our CapEx by more than 30% and we have a zero M&amp;A budget.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we want to make sure that we balance the short term with the long term, i.e., make the right decisions in the short term to ensure that we still keep our strategic priorities and targets at the forefront of our mind. But as I've said, we've taken a number of countermeasures and are implementing those very vigorously.</p>
          <p>More specifically to our Adhesives business, which is more hit. The plant consolidation is continuing. That means that we have announced more than 30 plant closures and undertaken more than 15 at this stage. We have initiated the temporary closure of plants. We are implementing reduced working time according to the market requirements where we operate, along with fixed working hours and short time work. We have complete hiring freeze and shallow increase in the countries where it's doable, we have implemented significant intensive reduction programs. And I want to be very clear on this that we continue to consider all options that will help us mitigate the impact of the current economic crisis, meaning that we are going to take decisions along the lines that we've done previously assuming that we deem those decisions to be the correct decisions moving forward.</p>
          <p>Now let me move to the market outlook. For 2009, we have not changed our outlook. So that means that we are still in a quality environment. What we're saying is that we believe we'll outperform our markets when it comes to organic sales growth, meaning defend or grow our market share. We will continue to initiate measures that will support the development of our EBIT and EPS. So no change in the outlook as previously communicated.</p>
          <p>As to the second quarter, and we are not making this a rule, this is more an exception, because of the lack of quantifiable outlook for the year, we see a second quarter with a consistent strong performance of our Home and Personal Care business and we see a slight -- and I mean a slight improvement in our Adhesives business. We will make quantifiable expectations for our fiscal 2009 as soon as the market will allow us to do so.</p>
          <p>I believe, overall, we are well positioned to meet the current challenges. We have very strong positions in attractive markets. We have a balanced regional presence, as you have seen from our numbers. We have a high focus on cost management and we are fully committed to delivering the National Starch and Global Excellence synergies according to plan or ahead of plan. Now along with this, cash management and cash generation is playing a key role in how we manage the company moving forward. All of this within the framework of our strategic qualities that we've communicated on to you early on in the road to hit our financial target for 2012.</p>
          <p>This brings me to the end of my presentation. And we would now be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Rorsted. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes through from the line of Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. My first question is on the Adhesives. Your pricing has remained strong. It's a bit lower than in Q4, but still remain good. So I was wondering, you were mentioning in February that you could see some pricing pressure there. It doesn't seem to be the case at least so far, even despite very high of volume decline. So I was just wondering if you could shed some light on that. And still on adhesives, when you talk about a slight improvement for Q2, are you talking margin and sales or just margin or just sales, if you could clarify that?</p>
          <p>My second question is on home care, I was surprised by the minus 7% volume drop. And I was wondering whether you could shed some light on that, whether it's been specific impact of de-stocking or whether -- because it seems that you have increased your pricing throughout the quarter because your pricing is higher in Q1 and Q4 last year, whether that has been the impact. It would be great if you could clarify -- if you could shed some light on the volume side. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the first part and Lothar will take the second. The slight increase means a slight increase, and it's more on the bottom line than on the top line. It's clear that you can see from our numbers, we are more struggling on the bottom line than on the top line. But without being more specific, that's why we said a slight increase.</p>
          <p>On the pricing, we have been able to maintain our pricing at this stage throughout the first quarter. We expect that the pricing will continue and to be under significant pressure moving forward. But so far, we have been able to maintain the pricing level throughout the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the volume decrease in Laundry and Home Care, I think it is fair to say that it's a major part from our price increases, which we have undertaken. As you might remember, we've gone through the same experience in 2006, where we were leader in increasing prices and reacting to the strong pressure on the input side. And we've seen an initial negative reaction on volume, which then during the course of the year has come back to basically normal level. So therefore we have taken the leads in doing what is necessary. And I think we'll see recovery of the volumes in the next quarters.</p>
          <p>There is going to be some counter pressure, obviously, from the retailers as a result of the deflation in raw material prices. And so therefore, obviously, as we obtained the benefit from the raw material price deflation, we need to carefully balance volume and pricing. And that's going to be the challenge for the second and next quarters. But we're pretty confident that we're going to be on the upside of this.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions, please. On cosmetics, of course, you had strong growth except for Western Europe, obviously Western Europe was down. Can you give us a split how the business in Germany cosmetics performed in contrast to the rest of Western Europe? Second question also on cosmetics, did you see any de-stocking at retails in the cosmetics markets countries like Spain, U.K., Russia and so on? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to Germany and Western Europe, basically, we've done slightly better in Germany than in Western Europe. But in both cases still negative. With respect to de-stocking, there has been some de-stocking. It's always difficult to differentiate exactly between de-stocking and weakness in the market because of the brevity of time that is available in order to make that analysis. So we've seen some de-stocking, but we wouldn't be able to basically or exactly scope it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a question on the performance of the Adhesives business through the course of the quarter. So of the 23% volume decline in the quarter, are you able to say what the monthly performance is just roughly from Jan, Feb, and March? And also do you have a figure for April? And then, secondly, of that volume decline in the quarter, are you able to split out how much comes from de-stocking? I appreciate it is very difficult to tell, but just some rough idea of how much of that decline was attributable to de-stocking rather than the underlying in market trends? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As I am sure, you'd appreciate, we don't give monthly figures out. But to give you the trend line is, February was better than January and March was better than February, so that is the trend line. On April, we will give you the numbers when we're sitting in August here again. So I can't really speak about that. But sequentially through the month of the first quarter each month was better.</p>
          <p>On the de-stocking side, there's no doubt that de-stocking has started to take place, but that de-stocking didn't start to take place only in the first quarter, it started in the fall of last year. And there is no doubt there is an element of de-stocking also taking place throughout the first quarter. But that is really difficult to quantify because it's different by country and by industrial sector. But there is -- I'd assume there is a certain element of de-stocking continuing to take place.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Oh, good afternoon. Sorry. Just one question, please, just on the temporary cost measures you are putting in Adhesives. So you are kind of sending people home early or longer holidays and so on. How quickly will those people come back as and when demand bounces back? What I am trying to say here is, should we expect a very strong recovery in the margin as and when sales stabilizes or improve or would the margin recovery be more gradual because those people, which were effectively offline return to the factories? If you could give us an idea of how the system actually works, that will be useful. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I need to point out that the measures that we have undertaken were among others an extended vacation following Easter, and some, but only limited short-time work, whatever that is called &#x2013; Kurzarbeit. So therefore those are very flexible measures. In other words, any time we see a pickup in activity, we can call people back or else for that matter, where the extended vacation has ended already. So that's a very flexible, very fast movement that we can undertake in order to react to additional demand. And that was necessary, as you might appreciate because of the additional demand that was generated by this famous bonus on wrecking cars, disposing of old cars. So therefore we had some additional demand to produce on a short notice.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So has it saved you a lot of -- put another way, has it saved you quite a lot of money to be able to do that, i.e., to send those people home early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It has saved us money, but obviously not as much as we have had in terms of fixed cost. So therefore -- and that's the negative on the margin that is visible.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Harold, just one additional word along these lines. As I've said in my presentation, we have more than 30 projects going on as relates to manufacturing closures in the adhesive side and that of course is really what will drive the difference. When you start getting the fixed cost down and the utilization rate up, there is simply a delay factor of getting these things done. We've done more than 15. If you take a net what we've done with the remainder of our manufacturing plants in other divisions and then take into account that we have been working on this for nine months, you can see if you start dividing the number of plants with the months we've been engaged we have actually been quite active of trying to take capacity down.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Well, could you shed some more light actually on the market share development in the Laundry business and especially with this kind of volume losses and especially on the private label segment already substantial price cuts in the pipeline and executed, how you expect well, you and the whole branded Laundry and Detergent segments to do in the times to come?</p>
          <p>And secondly, with regards to growth in emerging markets in the Home and Personal Care segment, well, do you regard -- you mentioned double-digit growth. If you adjust for the high inflations that we have in these countries, do you think you are still -- you are above the inflation rates in these countries? Or what's your take on that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the market share. We are seeing a market that will grow but with a slowing growth rate. We've experienced a slight increase in market share, a very light decline in the mature regions and a growth in the emerging regions. And particularly, we're seeing the impact of private label playing its role in the more mature regions; i.e., being Germany and particularly, Spain having a larger part of private label than other regions so far.</p>
          <p>So we have seen consistent doable slight growth in market share, slight moved with a slight decline in the mature markets, growth in the emerging markets, and very little presence of the private label in the emerging markets. In the U.S., we are seeing a presence of the private label. But the private label in the U.S. market is still single digit. So that has kept itself on the low side. So overall, I would say satisfactory development from a market share standpoint.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to high inflation double-digit growth, we do that analysis usually once a year. So I don't really have the exact figures available. We're pretty sure that we have still outgrown the markets. In other words, that we have higher growth and inflation rates in the countries. So that's obviously right now a guess because we need to look at it closer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got no further questions in queue. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We've got a question coming through from the line of Christian Weiz from Unicredit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, or hello, rather. On pricing initiatives, are there any pricing initiatives planned for quarters to come? And on the raw materials and packaging costs, do you see there a standstill or a decline in the second quarter when you talk about an improvement there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You are saving our day, Christian Weiz. Thanks for the question. We do expect more pricing initiatives. Obviously, that will be very selective because there is a relief on the input side, there is no question about it. And therefore, we need to be very selective in terms of our pricing initiatives. And that's our current strategy.</p>
          <p>With respect to the impact from the raw material prices, what we see is -- first of all, what we observe is lower level in the pricing in the first quarter of this year, which has not come through in our numbers yet. There is a time delay between, obviously, experiencing repricing the prices when purchasing and then having the lower cost of goods in our P&amp;L. So therefore, there's going to be a positive impact from that in the next -- certainly in the next quarter. We see lower level of pricing which we experienced in our actual purchases in the first quarter and that therefore will have an impact in the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And maybe again coming back to the slight improvement in Adhesive Technologies, does that mean that you see a stabilization or rather really an absolute increase in the second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we're seeing is in the -- that is I'll give you the take of what we are seeing in the first quarter and then you can extrapolate into the second quarter. We're seeing a second quarter, which has less holidays than the first because you have extended the Christmas vacation. So you have a longer trading period. You have a quarter where you have a decrease in raw material cost and you have, for us, a quarter where you have a high impact on savings from Global Excellence and National Starch synergies. And that is really along with our cost management driving what we see a slight improvement in the overall results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello. Regarding raw materials, obviously, raw materials are down and the volatility is quite high. Nevertheless, perhaps you could give us a little bit of hint what you would expect on the yearly basis given today's raw material prices in terms of savings percent wise or absolute wise?</p>
          <p>Second point is regarding cosmetics or better to say  hair care. It seems you are growing quite nicely in hair care. Obviously, professional care seems to have some difficulties, at least competitors telling that, do you see significant market share gains of all in hair care, and how it's development especially in professional care?</p>
          <p>And the third question is advertising/promotion costs, did you change anything on your spending patterns regarding advertising/promotion costs? And what would you expect for the full year 2009? And given the slowdown in the market, are you reacting on that cost side here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the raws and packs. We always look at it together, so called direct materials that we use in our production. We have guided that this should be down this year compared to last year in the mid single digits. And that continues to be our expectation for this year. We see quite good opportunities to at least reach this level.</p>
          <p>With respect to cosmetics, hair cosmetics, it is true that the markets and the hairdresser, the salon business are down. Actually they are more down than our business is affected. So we are still outperforming that market as well and that contributes to strong performance in terms of sales growth that we have experienced in the Cosmetics division. So therefore -- and maybe -- maybe there is a shift from people, otherwise would have gone to the hairdresser, now doing that at home and that then would benefit us in our retail business. That's something which is obviously more difficult to rest, but there could be an impact from that.</p>
          <p>With respect to advertising and promotion, we continue to expect that we will not change the ratio of advertising and promotion to sales that we have experienced in the average of last year for both divisions, Home and Personal Care and for -- yeah, for both Home and Personal Care. What we see though is a bit of a differentiation per quarter because of the launching activities. So sometimes first quarter is higher than the average in one division and bit lower in the other division. But overall, per year we should remain at basically the same level that we have experienced last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So to just elaborate briefly on the performance of Cosmetics division, there is no doubt that the driver of the success area within our cosmetics has been our hair business, which you also alluded to, it has been very, very successful in the first quarter and more than compensating any kind of effect &#x2013; setting or sitting back we've had on the professional side. And we've also in the first quarter had one of the most successful launches of new products Syoss, which you might have seen in the marketplace which has been an extremely successful launch and is doing very well in that marketplace. So it's good to see that the very successful way of running our Cosmetics business, particularly on the hair care side, is continuing in a market that we see has been declining where we continue to go strongly in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may, advertising/promotion you just mentioned that you can't differentiate the quarter, but in some for cosmetic and detergents, did you see any relief or any additional cost in Q1 versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. If both taken together, we're basically at the same level in terms of sales -- ratio to sales at last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But then, cosmetics was higher and detergent was lower, was it or --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was the other way around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. Firstly, on you taking out capacity in the Adhesives business, are you taking out surplus capacities, sort of post National Starch, so that capacity that would leave you running at sort of full capacity on 2007 sales? Or do you think there has been sort of secular shift in the sort of global adhesives market and so you are taking capacity out deeper than that so that you've got capacity utilization at sort of '09 run rates?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, previously you've spoken about being very committed to credit rating. If you could just give a little bit color on what's happening there, that would be great? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the first one on the capacity side. We will continue to take out capacity to drive up utilization rates. So beyond the National Starch side, the question -- the key question is going to be what is the new run rate of volume in the market in '09. I don't think anybody knows that, and that's why we've been very clear in saying we are committed to make the appropriate decision when the market let us know. So &#x2013; but right now, we are taking capacity out more than the '08 run rate because we don't believe '08 run rate is what will be the new run rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to the credit rating, we have consistently communicated that we are committed to the A rating to the category. We are still well within the category. Whether and how that evolves over the course of this year, obviously, remains open in terms of what will be our cash flow generation and therefore how much will we be able to continue to retire debt. So therefore that obviously is also a decision by the rating agencies. It is not entirely upon us. But having said this, our commitment remains to A category and we're quite confident that we're going to be able to do that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. First, on the home care, and I am still surprised by your ability to price up when -- I mean I can imagine in some emerging markets, FX transaction means that you can price up. But I am surprised that you can still see price increases in the market where probably the consumer is looking for value. And following that, you had 100 basis point margin improvement. In the first quarter, you said that you will see the lower rollbacks in the second quarter. So do you think that this kind of margin increase is sustainable or could even be better going forward? Is that what you are trying to point out? So first question. Second, on your -- there is a chart in your presentation about the gross margin, and I am sorry I can't remember which pages is it now. But it seems you have a positive impact from price and volume on your gross margin. Having said that you've seen such a sharp decline in volumes, I'm a bit surprised that you don't have a negative operating leverage there.</p>

          <p>With respect to the first question, the answer will be given in having the experience from the second quarter. However, I think it is obvious that we have not undertaken price increases only in the emerging markets. Otherwise, we would not have been able to generate this amount of pricing component in our growth. So therefore that's from our perspective a major achievement in our Home Care -- Laundry and Home Care division.</p>
          <p>Now, again, it is also obvious that we're getting a lot of pressure from the retail sector, particularly in the mature countries and therefore -- and I mentioned that in response to another question, the balance will be to react such that we're going to catch up in terms of volume and take the benefit of further decreases in raw material prices in order to maintain our margin at that level. That's our intention. I can't tell you whether we're going to be successful. But that's the way we're going about it.</p>
          <p>With respect to the gross margin, that obviously compares to first quarter of last year. And therefore, we must take into account that we did not have the National Starch business in the first quarter of last year. And therefore, the additional pricing volume impact is entirely from the stronger increase that we have experienced in personal care and home care. And backing out the impact from the National Starch because that's then in the bridge if you look at the chart in the second part.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah. That's good. Your Adhesives business, so ex National Starch, you probably see this went from high volume drop or not?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't quite get your question, what is it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. In your Adhesives business ex National Starch, I presume there was as well a sharp contraction in volume. So I can see that, okay, maybe the volume and price equation has been good on HPC, but on the Henkel historical Adhesives business, it must have been a hit. So I'm a bit surprised that it's such a positive contribution.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no. I am surprised that the gross margin has been &#x2013; or was there such a big leap in gross margin in HPC, is it what you are trying to say that will counterbalance maybe a lower gross margin in the Henkel Adhesives business ex National Starch?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">

          <p>That was -- it was negative, but not strongly negative in the Adhesives business.</p>

          <p>Let me just clarify the question, or be more clear on the question that you ask about the pricing power on the branded business. It's clear we are seeing the consumer market in our Detergents business moving in two directions, upscale for strong brands and downscale for private label. That's why you're seeing the volume growth in private label, but you're also seeing a much stronger growth on the high end with the strong brands and that's why our branding strategy is so important that we've strengthened our strong brands. And if you look upon the improvement in gross margin that Lothar had spoke to on the Detergents business, that is of course coming from product mix changes that you are going into a portfolio of stronger brands and need to be away from direct competition in private label.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Again, just one on the performance of National Starch on the top line. I think you alluded to it performing a bit better than the legacy Henkel Adhesives business. Do you have a like-for-like number for National Starch? And I guess I was surprised to see it was performing better. I thought it was more biased towards electronics in Asia. So I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't have breakout for the National Starch business because it's been fully integrated into the Henkel -- respective Henkel businesses. In other words, the Electronics business have been consolidated with the Henkel Electronics business and the Packaging Adhesives is now part of the Packaging Adhesives. So therefore we don't report -- not even for own purposes report it separately.</p>
          <p>What I was trying to say was not National Starch is performing better than legacy Henkel. What I was saying was the Packaging Adhesives business, and that's the combination of old Henkel and new National Starch, was performing better than the average of the Adhesives business. As a matter of fact, it was almost on the same level as last year. So like-for-like, this business component has performed better than the average. Electronics was down and was part of the negative volume development, which we had shown, and that's true for the National Starch component as well as for the Henkel because that's all in one now.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in our first quarter conference call. Overall, it was a restrained start to 2009. And while the fast moving consumer goods business came off on a really good start, the final results were clearly not satisfactory for the company. However, I believe we are well equipped for the future and I am, what I would call, cautiously optimistic, but also realistic as we move forward.</p>
          <p>I wish you all the best, and I look forward to talking to you soon again certainly by the time of our second quarter conference call on August 5. And in addition and in closing, I'd like to inform you that we will hold an Analyst and Investor Day on September 2 here in D&#xFC;sseldorf, and the focus will be on our Laundry &amp; Home Care business headed by Fred Stara. And of course our IR department will send out further details shortly. Thank you for dialing in today.</p>
