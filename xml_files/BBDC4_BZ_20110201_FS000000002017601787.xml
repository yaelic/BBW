        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. I would like to thank you all for attending this conference call. Without <mark type="inaudible" /> 2010 was a year marked by economic recovery as other emerging economies received a solid GDP growth, which we estimate at around 7.8%. It's confirmed this will be the highest figures for the last 25 years.</p>
          <p>Advances were observed in both economic scenario and the social front, leading by sustainable investments which generate employment and income, sequentially leveraging consumption and credit. It's worth noting that in this context of social mobility and increasing demand for banking projects, that this will have achieved a strategic presence through increased investments in organic growth with an expansion in the numbers of service point. In terms of branch, service point and correspondent banks, more than 10,300 new points were opened in 2010. 178 of which were new branches. In 2011, we expect to open another 183 new branches.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we have strengthened our sales force, thus improving business segmentation and customer service. With these initiatives, our client base has exceeded 60 million, comprising 23 million checking accounts, 41 million savings accounts and 36 million clients and issuance group.</p>
          <p>In 2010, our investments in IT and infrastructure totaled R$3.90 billion and we estimate that we will offer around this R$5 billion for 2011. In our opinion that we have achieved an important position in the world, we are therefore reaffirming our confidence in the high favorable outlook for the Brazilian bond in the coming years, with the focus on bank inclusion and social mobility, which are the drivers for sustainable development.</p>
          <p>I will now comment of our financial results for the first quarter and full year of 2010. We'll start with slides 2 and 3. Here we show some of our highlights among which we would like to point out on slide 2, out adjusted net income for 2010 that totalled R$9.80 billion, represent an evolution of 29% in comparison to 2009. In the final quarter of 2010, adjusted net income reached around R$2.7 billion. Total assets amounted to R$637 billion, a 26% improvement over December 2009.</p>
          <p>Our funds under management totalled R$873 billion, which represents an evolution of 24% in the year. I'd also like to follow your attention to our delinquency ratio, with three quarters substantial decline of 1.3 percentage points over 2009, and our coverage ratios for loan overdue by more than 60 days or 90 days, which includes considerably throughout 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide number 4. We show the reconciliation between book net income and adjusted net income, summarizing all the events that in our opinion are non-recurring, and which affect our results for the respective periods.</p>
          <p>The main non-recurring tax in the first quarter were; one, the partial sale of our investments in the BM&amp;FBovespa totaling R$59 million. Two, the partial reversal of provisions for loan losses amounting to R$220 million, due to technical adjustment in its calculations. And three, a constitution provisions for civil contingencies for economic plans in the amount of R$86 million.</p>
          <p>After these adjustments, our book net income went from about R$3 billion to R$2.7 billion, generate an annualized return of 25.1% in the quarter. I'd also like to draw your attention to our return on average equity, which reached around 22% in the year both in terms of book and adjusted net income.</p>
          <p>Slide 5 shows our quarterly and annual net income. The 6.6 obtained in the first quarter was simply due to the growth in the net interest income, due to the increase in the volume of operations and the higher fee income, especially from credit cards and checking accounts.</p>
          <p>This quarter there were also higher provisions for loan losses, mainly due to the increase in the volume of the loans operations, since the delinquency as we will show &#x2013; see later on has demonstrated improvements, as there was higher operating expenses, personnel and administrative, which we will discuss in more detail later on.</p>
          <p>The 30% evolution of our net income in the year was due to the result of reduced delinquency, with the result in lower provisions for loan losses. Higher revenue from insurance segment and improved fee income together with the helped results of the overall increase in our business. I would like to point out that our 12-month earnings per share recorded an important evolution this quarter, increasing from R$2.38 to R$2.61.</p>
          <p>Slide 6. In this slide, we show our efficiency ratio. The blue line represents the ratio adjusted to risk, which fell for the first and second quarter reaching 52.4%, a 0.9 percentage point improvement over to the third quarter 2010, reflecting reduced delinquency and the consequent reduction in provision for loan losses.</p>
          <p>The increase in the 12-month ratio, not considering the effects of the provision for loan losses, the red curve, in recent quarters was primarily due to exception of value gains and derivatives. And the reduction in advertising expense in 2009, favoring these indicators in those views as well as higher expenses from the organic growth of our distribution network and improved business segment.</p>
          <p>The increase in the quarterly ratio was simply due to the seasonal increase of the expense as a result of the higher business volume in dispute of the year. Despite our recent organic growth, we believe this ratio will remain close to the current levels in the short term. In the mid term, however, we expect an improvement in these indicators, thanks to the conclusion and maturation of many projects that we have in the special IT projects.</p>
          <p>Slide number 7, total assets reached R$637 million registering an evolution of R$26 million in 2010. Return on average asset remains at 1.7%, while return on average adjusted equity totaled 22.2%. The Basel ratio closed the period at 14.7%, which leaves us in a profitable position to sustain expected growth in our operations. The quarterly decrease is explained by the evolution of assets and the reduction in subordinated debt, which maybe considered due to capital.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that we have initiatives underway that aim to increase our capitalization level. For example, if you consider the recent reopening of our subordinate debt issue in the amount of $500 million and a good capital increase in the amount of R$1.5 billion, our Basel ratio would have increased to 50.4% and our Tier I Capital would have returned to 13.5%.</p>
          <p>Slide number 8. Here we present the relative share of our main operations in the composition of our net income, which remains flat in this quarter. In the annual comparison, low operations presented a stronger recovery, representing once again around 30% of the net income after the end of 2010 versus 20% at the close of 2009 due to the reduced delinquency.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, securities posted a relative decline due to the reduction in treasury gains this year in comparison to the outstanding results of 2009. Although revenue from insurance operations registered an important increase in 2010, its relative share of net income declined in the year, as a result of the strong growth in the growth segment.</p>
          <p>Slide number 9. Unrealized gains remain at the high levels, totalling R$10.6 billion. The reduction in the quarter was simply due to one, lower price in bank operations reflecting high interest rates. Two, the decline in the stock markets, the Bovespa index, with effective area of some of our investments, especially in Cielo. And three, higher market value of our subordinate debt issued abroad, due to the reduction in the foreign interest rates partially offset by the mark-to-market of secured index to EBITDA in the portfolio of our insurance. Note that these figures do not include a potential goodwill for our own properties of R$222 million.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, here you can see that net interest income increased by 90% in the third quarter of 2010, primarily due to the increase in interest earnings operations, especially in the insurance and plan segments. The growth in the non-interest earnings portion was secured from gains in <mark type="inaudible" /> security operations.</p>
          <p>I would particularly like to draw your attention to the good performance of interest earnings portion, which increased by 60% in 2010. This was mainly due to high average business volume, positively impacted by the incorporation of Banco Ibi and also to the increase in lowest to micro-businesses, SMEs and individuals.</p>
          <p>Slide 11, annualized net interest margin corresponded to 7.8% in the fourth quarter 2010. The improvement over the previous quarter is largely due to higher gains in relation to the average spread in the insurance segment, which we will discuss in the next two slides. As we have been saying, our expectation is a decrease-induced indicator in the mid term, due to the inclusion of lower margin operations, which should be offset by an increase in the business while thus contributing to the continuous evolution of the net interest income.</p>
          <p>Slide 12, this slide gives a breakdown of net interest income. The quarterly highlight was interest income from insurance, which increased by 57% due to high returns on those assets indexed to IPCA and they are turning revenues, which is common in the final quarter. Again, a comparison, they highlight to us that 60% growth in the interest income from loss chiefly driven by loan growth included <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide 13. In this quarter gross net income, a big area on the graph, increased by 5.3% to around R$6.1 billion, once again due to higher business volume given that the average spread has been shown at downwards trend. The red area, which shows the provisions for loan losses accounts for 35.4% of the gross interest income, increased by 11.5% due to the upturn in the lower operations in turn reflecting higher generality provisions.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, net interest income, the blue area, increased by 2%. The annual comparison shows the large intake of the reduction in delinquency costs, given that gross interest income increased by 16% and the provisions for loan losses dropped by 24%, thus increasing net interest income by a substantial 71%.</p>
          <p>Slide 14, this slide shows our expanded loan portfolio, which also includes securities such as the debentures and other notes issued by large corporate, assumed as a risk by our commercial head. The portfolio closed 2010 at R$293.5 billion represent an evolution of 8.4% in the quarter and 23% in the annual comparison. This increase is chiefly driven by loans to micro-businesses and SMEs, which grew by 9% in the quarter and 29% in the year, as well as loans to major corporations, which grew by 11% in the quarter and 22% in the year, led by <mark type="inaudible" /> credit cards and mortgage loans.</p>
          <p>Slide 15, confirming our expectation, the total delinquency ratio for loans overdue by more than 90 days, recorded a decline for the fifth consecutive quarter, reaching 3.6% in December 2010. Favored by the continuos improvement in the domestic economic scenario and within this entire credit cycle, especially they would go faster. Expectation for the following quarter, assuming that the good macroeconomic fundamentals would be maintained, is that it is indicated we will stabilize since a large part of the improvement has already happened.</p>
          <p>Slide 16. This slide shows we are continuing to maintain a high provision's level, with a substantial surplus of R$3 billion in December 2010, in relation to the amount required by the Central Bank. The difference between the first two curves or R$7.3 billion, if we compare the currency allowance for loan loss, the red curve, to expected gross losses for the next 12 months.</p>
          <p>The dotted blue curve or even R$9.6 billion in relation to the expected losses net of recovers, the dotted purple curve. This provision levels in a profitable situation to face any reversal in the growing current favorable economic strength.</p>
          <p>Slide 17. Underlining the previous slides, this slide shows the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses in relation to the credits overdue by more than 90 days and 60 days. As you can see, we've had once again reported highest levels of ratios in both criteria, especially due to a reduction in delinquency, as we've pointed out previously.</p>
          <p>Slide 18. Fee income increased by 4.1% in the first quarter of 2010, chiefly driven by checking accounts 8.4%, as a result of the net increase in new accounts and the expansion of our client sets portfolio. And two, credit card revenues with 7.1% impacted by the seasonal increase in business and the expansion of the clients in card fees. And three, the increase in loan operations with 7.1, especially with regards to income from returns on guarantees provided. In the annual comparison, fee income presents an important evolution of 15%. The best performance were on cards, which increased by 22.8% due to the expansion of the client base driven by organic growth and partially by the incorporation of Banco Ibi. Two, consortiums with 23.4%, and three, low loans operations with 13.5%.</p>
          <p>Slide 19, in the quarterly comparison, operating expense increased by 9.2%, partially due to higher personnel expenses usually impacted by wage increase and expansion of the work force by more than 3,000 new employees due to the growth of the distribution network and improved segmentation.</p>
          <p>In the annual comparison, the increase in these expenses was primarily due to the impact of the collective bargaining agreements in 2009 and 2010 and to the net addition of about 7,600 employees, as well as the impact of the incorporation of Banco Ibi in November 2009. The growth in administrative expense in both periods, mainly reflect the increased volume of business and expansion in the numbers of service points. We will refer to this expense in more detail in the next slide.</p>
          <p>In slide 20, in order to better demonstrate the evolution of operating expenses, we have developed a calculation separating the effects of organic growth reflected by the opening of 178 new branches for example and the strengthening of our retail service network with the incorporation of approximately 2,000 new professionals. And incorporation of Banco Ibi, given that in 2009, it contributed to only two months of the results. It's clear in the slide that excluding this impact our administrative expenses would have had grown 13.3% in the year, a level comparable with this year's strong increase in business.</p>
          <p>Slide 21, administrative expense increased by 12.7% in the final quarter, primarily due to end of the year seasonality, which is reflecting higher advertising expenses and other variable expenses, as well as the expansion of the distribution network by more than 2,800 service points in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that the consolidation of Banco Ibi's figures occur from November 2009, we have that a column reported devaluation in the year's administrative expense excluding the effects of Banco Ibi. In this case, the year 15.6% evolution arise essentially from increase in business and expansion in service points and also from advertising expense with a return to their historic levels in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 22, this slide shows income from insurance segment, which increased by 17.2% in the quarter, led by life and pension plans with 31.5%, saving bonds with 7.3%. In the annual comparison, if we have to maintain a consistent and robust improvement in practically all the business lines, it's also worth noting that in addition to the period's higher revenue gains from the financial results and the decline in delinquency ratio also contribute to the improvement in adjusted net income in 2010.</p>
          <p>Slide 23, this slide shows some of the main figures from our insurance activities. The combined ratio recorded 85.1% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than in the previous three months. Our total financial assets amounted to R$96.5 billion, while technical provisions stood at R$87.2 billion, R$76 billion of which are related to the life and pension plans.</p>
          <p>Slide 24, this slide shows our economic department estimates for GDP, interest rate, inflation and exchange rates for 2011 and 2012. Generally speaking, in our opinion, the international scenario in 2011, we continue to be characterized by extraordinary liquidities and the increase of appetite for risk and high commodity price. We believe the Brazil economy will move from an estimated growth of 7.8% in 2010 to 4.3% this year. The growth rates for employment in fact should present some moderation in 2011 but still continue at a strong pace. A global vision towards Brazil in our opinion will continue to be stable. The exchange rates should remain stable at around R$1.70 per dollar.</p>
          <p>Slide 25, as usually done, here we present a comparison of our 2010 guidance with our results. With regards to the loan portfolio considering the expanded portfolio, we achieved all our guidance figures in both segment and broad terms led by substantial growth recorded by credit cards and payroll-deductible loans, whose growth was partially impacted by portfolio acquisition and mortgage, which originates R$9.1 billion registering an increase of more than 90% in comparison to 2009.</p>
          <p>In relation to the net interest income, fee income and insurance premiums also did exceptionally well. The increase in operating expenses was basically due to substantial growth in 2010 relates not only to the expansion but of the service network, but also to decrease in the volume of the business as we discussed before.</p>
          <p>In the slide 26, we present our guidance for 2011, we believe the loan portfolio will continue to grow in 2011, although at a slightly lower pace than in 2010. We expect growth of between 15% to 19% boost by corporate loans as well as specific individual lines, especially payroll-deductible loans and cards. We expect mortgage loans to originate approximately R$10 billion from new operations, around 10% more than in 2010.</p>
          <p>To conclude, I would like to say that our results for both the fourth quarter and full years of 2010 were highly satisfactory. I would also like to highlight here that we are investing strongly in our distribution network in not to only to increase the number of service points but also to improve the quality and provide our clients with the best of service.</p>
          <p>In 2010, we added more than 10,300 owned and 35 service points increasing our client base by more than R$2.2 million, which contributes to the sustainability and the expansion of our future business and results. Consequently, in order to support the performance generated by these objectives, we will continue to invest in technological innovation and new projects, improving our standard even further and closely monitoring operating efficiently.</p>
          <p>Thank you all for your attention so far and now we are available for &#x2013; to answer any questions you may have.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Daniel Abut from Citi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Domingos, a couple of questions. I'm curious as to why been so modest in the guidance for fee income, you are guiding for 6% to 10% after fee income had such a great year in 2010, blowing your guidance, <mark type="inaudible" /> 15%, even though your guidance was 7% to 11%. So you're now guiding below what you guided for last year even though you exceeded the performance so much. I can understand that the economy is going to slow down compared to 2010, but it seems to me too moderate a guidance. So if you could elaborate on the fee income guidance a bit more.</p>
          <p>And the second question is on capital, you explain in slide seven that if you adjust for some of the recent activity <mark type="inaudible" /> your Tier 1 ratio could actually be closer to 13.5%. That number is still significantly below what it was a year ago, when it was closer to 15%.</p>
          <p>So if you could talk a bit more about any plans to beef up that Tier 1 ratio further, particularly in the context of the current debate about the implication of Basel III rules? And how it will impact your capital, when that your rules are known and you have to eliminate certain components of Tier 1 capital that are less tangible such as deferred tax assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Daniel. First of all, the fees, normally, you know when we give guidance, we like to be more conservative in terms <mark type="inaudible" /> could be conservative. But look when you compare 2010, we grew in fees around 15%, but if you make a discount of the effects of the incorporation of Banco Ibi, you see that we grew around 11% something, right? If you assume that in 2011 the economy will grow &#x2013; low &#x2013; less than in 2010, you can assume that it's not so. But if you work &#x2013; I think, I argue that it could be conservative, but we need to be when we did this.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital, it's important to understand that &#x2013; remember that at the end of 2009, we used to use the extra provision as capital Basel I, remember that it was changed in this year, at the April this year. So it was a bit difference when you compare December 2009 with the rest.</p>
          <p>In terms of plan to a new capitalization, assuming the current situation &#x2013; we don't think you need to make any movement going forward. But if you think about Basel III, we need to &#x2013; we don't have yet exact what Central Bank has in mind, we have some effects in terms of tax spreads, in terms of a non-banking guesstimate that we need to understand how the Central Bank review exactly this. But the feeling that we had so far what &#x2013; so that it shouldn't be a big challenge for us to adjust the new requirements going forward. So I don't think it should be necessary to make any strong movement in the actual terms like this. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just as a follow-up, Domingo, this is highly likely and we already expect</p>
          <p>that that there will be a period of transition to implement the rules not only in Brazil but globally, where banks will be allowed several years to do this. Have you done any calculations if you were to apply what is likely to be the rules all at once? How much the Tier I ratio will come down from the current 13.1%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, Daniel, we made just a simulation like  &#x2013; is the worst scenario like Central Bank say, right now, we need to discount to consider only 10% of tax spreads, 10% of your capital as a tax spread or you can consider &#x2013; we cannot consider the investments in <mark type="inaudible" /> in bank like insurance, like other investments that we've had, we cannot consider the capital.</p>
          <p>It makes this very strong stress like there it should be a stress movement. They shouldn't need to increase something R$1.5 million &#x2013; something from R$1.5 billion to R$2 billion on the capital. Look, again, it's a stress movement; we don't expect to have that. As you know that as you mentioned in your questions, we have until 2019 to implement any regulation that we &#x2013; it could be done. But we understand the Central Bank Brazil could be &#x2013; to start a movement to implement this in advance than in the global. We have this in our scenario too.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a couple of questions on your costs and you gave a lot of color during the presentation. But can you &#x2013; just first of all, a more specific question, was there anything unusual in the administrative expense line this quarter that maybe had an abnormally big impact on your cost base? You did mention in the quarterly release the change in your card processing relationship with Fidelity, for example, anything that adversely impacted your cost. Could you &#x2013; just give a little bit more color on whether there's anything unusual in addition to the organic growth that hits your cost?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, a broader or maybe more important question, obviously, I think the right strategy is to invest for growth, and hitting short-term results shouldn't be the driver of what you do. But at the same time, we have, for a few years now, heard that the investments in the IT program were ongoing in that after a couple of years, the efficiency ratio would start to normalize. And we're continuing to hear that now that it's more of a medium term event. Why has it taken so long for these investments to start to generate results in terms of helping your efficiency? It seems &#x2013; or am I wrong in that assessment, because it seems like it has taken quite a long time for these investments to just start to &#x2013; just to come together in terms of delivering better efficiency metrics?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Saul. Let's say them specific request about the last quarter. Normally, in the last quarter, we had seasonality, normally &#x2013; it's normal to have that. The last quarter, it has more &#x2013; the economies grew more <mark type="inaudible" />. But you heard some &#x2013; you mentioned that this affected immigration with regard Fidelity, it was in fact different. So I would say that it should be substantial to explain the growth, right. It's one thing that was different this year &#x2013; this quarter when compared. But I'd say that should explain too much the growth. I'd say that the biggest movement is the natural movement at the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>We had some expenses that we tried to distribute the expenses along the year in a good way, but sometimes some specific situation you cannot do it. It's like we say for some example we say negotiating with the companies sort of adoption price like diesel. Normally, we recognize only in just one shot. We had some movement at the end of the year. Normally, we have that.</p>
          <p>But when you compare quarter, the last quarter this year with the last quarter, the growth in the last quarter 2009, you'll see more or less the same movement, it's just I would say that is more normal to expect to have a growth in the last quarter. Of course, we expect to have that in the next quarter not to grow too much, is normal I would say.</p>
          <p>In terms of IT improvement, it's important to point out &#x2013; and thanks for the questions, it's important to clarify that. You know that we started this movement in 2003, but you need separated projects. Different &#x2013; it's five different dimensions with 25 different projects. It includes to build a complete contingency site. It includes construction of new buildings to have this computed. It includes to change the corporate governance inside the IT department. It's a lot of process, right.</p>
          <p>That's why we are talking about this for a long time, right? The most challenging part of this project far is new architectural systems. That we started just &#x2013; it was the last ones to start. It started one year, two years ago, I guess. It was far the most challenged quarter, it's not easy to &#x2013; we are just simply &#x2013; yeah, rewriting all the systems of the bank. So that's why it's been so. And why we put pressure in costs because while you are building a new system, a new architecture, you are &#x2013; you need to have people taking care with all the system, all the time. It not includes only people inside the IT department, but includes people inside all the department, all department, all situations who depend on the system. So we need to have more or less as you &#x2013; I had to say that this is what <mark type="inaudible" /> system, but in some situation, you have double &#x2013; structure to deal with this, right. So that's why I say that.</p>
          <p>This is specific by a portion the new system is in 2011, it has a very &#x2013; would be a key year for this project. We are &#x2013; we estimate that we finish the 2010 with around 35%, between 35% to 40% of this project developed. We expect to finish this year with something around 75% to 80% in 2011. We're having some gains, quickly wins in this project, yes, but the investment that we are doing, you cannot notice this in their numbers, all right. That's why it takes long to &#x2013; it's normal, I don't think it's &#x2013; we don't have &#x2013; we are learning with this process, process too. We know that all these companies that we are giving can support for us in this project, they say that there's nothing comparable that is doing in the work.</p>
          <p>In the same time, they say that sooner or later, many, many banks, many, many companies will need to transfer these projects to process because it's a, it really is a very challenging process, it's just simple &#x2013; it's not simple, but it's exactly the way they'd say. I don't know if we are able to clarify your question.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>

          <p>Good morning Victor.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the guidance, Domingos. Focusing on the guidance and looking at the loan growth against the net interest income, you're implying here that there is a potential for some margin or spread improvement since 2011. Is this driven by better mix? And my other question I suppose is if we see any more macro-prudential measures in the form of higher comprensorio coming through, can you give us some sort of idea of what the potential impact could be of that? Do you think slower loan growth, is there any crimp, squeeze on margins here? That's my first question; I'll leave it at that for the moment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First, Victor, just to say that the net interest margin of course will have a very strong correlation with the growth in the portfolio, yes, it's true, but it's not &#x2013; it doesn't explain completely everything. It's important to say that we &#x2013; this year, we have compared the margin, we start with the portfolio, that have been grown 23% last year, so we had this effect, you transfer this effect for the 2011. We have some expectation to increase selling rate this year. And then average would be higher than it was in 2010 we had in the margins this year. You have some pressure in term of, some movement in terms of spread, in terms of mix in the way that you &#x2013; I would say these three factors should explain why expectation of net interest income is higher than the expectation of the growth in the growth portfolio. In terms of new, I would say, it's important, thanks for your question, to clarify that this guidance we consider all the measures that we already have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That we already know, all right. We don't have &#x2013; we don't know what different measure we can have going forward. But I assume that we have some measure in the same direction that we had this &#x2013; that goes along in December. I'd say the movement you have &#x2013; we have to directly reduce the correct portfolio, but maybe you need to increase spreads to this. So I think in terms of margin, maybe we can see a movement in it &#x2013; to reduce the credit growth for the margin to &#x2013; the standard to be sustainable.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Just one quick follow-up there, I mean in terms of current trading on loan growth, in terms of what you're seeing so far in Q1, would it be fair to say that because of the measures of December, you've seen the biggest slowdown in origination in vehicles and other personal loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, They're equal. This had &#x2013; normally when you compared January with December is &#x2013; you have the personality there, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But what we talk with people in the &#x2013; our people, they say that this January has been, the reduction has been stronger that as, for example, when you compare January of 2010 with December 2009, for example. They see this affect this market directly. In terms of personal, in our case, personal affects more loans, when they have long-term personal, gradually towards more in payor deductible loans. In our case, it doesn't affect too much because we don't use to have this day-to-day long terms of spreads, so it doesn't affect them. We didn't note any movement, Victor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. Just one quick follow-up, effective tax rate, what &#x2013; could you give us some sort of guidance in terms of what we could &#x2013; should be using for 2011 for effective tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, you know that &#x2013; and thanks for your question, it is important to clarify this point. You know that we are using that tax credit derived from the increase of social contribution, right. We are using these in order to &#x2013; why we are doing seasonally, we have this increase. Our expectation that we have these tax spreads something around R$220 million something to use yet, I think to be announced for the next quarter maybe another month or other things. So we expect that after that, until then, we can use something around that we have now, something around 30%.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Going forward, I think we can add something around 4% in the expectation that total 2011, we can assume something around 34% &#x2013; from 34% to 35%.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for the call. I have couple of questions. The first one in relation to the IT platform. In this 15% to 20% software development that still would be pending for the year-end 2011, which still &#x2013; would that include the core transaction processing engine? What is your expectation in terms of the rollout of this piece that I understand is probably a last version, the last part of the whole IT process that needs to be rolled out?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to the insurance operations. We've seen how there's been a strong growth in premiums, et cetera. However, bottom-line growth has been much slower, around 10% in the year, if I'm not wrong. And probably one of the surplus is pieces in the admin expense ratio for over 100 basis points in the year, what could we expect for the growth in terms of bottom-line in the insurance operations this year, we know that there was a factor that you mentioned related to the margins on the financial income. But what could we expect in terms of selling and admin expense ratios? Are they expected to continue to inch up and what kind of guidance could you give us on this, I think some values on the costs and we'll appreciate if some one could comment on this. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boris, if I understood your question, today you see that our premiums is stronger, increased very stronger in this year. Highest than the market, the market which you show us until November, 16% there &#x2013; increase in terms of total market. And Bradesco improved 18%. But in terms of overall results, so it seems to you that to, you're not increasing so much that relate to the premiums is because we &#x2013; we consider that that part of the investment income is not part of the personal results. As you know because the &#x2013; it reflected the correct hedge for our technical provisions. So even then, the IPCA increases are highest than the very good increasing. And what happened with us, the correction which apply in terms of the technical results increased a little bit more. It's the reason why it shows you the operational results did not increase so much.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance or the projection for operational results, I suppose that would be better than in 2010. It seems that if you can see the group or the numbers or the figures relate to the claims ratio, the claim ratio discussed will go down in terms of health, in terms of, you know, in terms of PMC, in terms of life, I think now would be show us a projection for the next year is very better than 2010 in terms of the operational results.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Boris, your question is about the effects of IT, that upon improvements and how &#x2013; how we expect to have improvement in our efficiency. Am I right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no, yes I was saying this because I remember when we had the conversation in the Investor Day last year, probably the last piece of the puzzle and probably one of the most important in terms of achieving savings was the core transaction processing engine, which was, I understood, the last part of the rollout. So I was wondering whether this was still expected to be rolled out by the end of this year or the first half of 2012 and you know how could we see like you mentioned the efficiencies starting to flow afterwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, as I mentioned this year, it'll be &#x2013; I'd say it'll be the crucial year for this project where we expect to be finished this year &#x2013; finishing this year with this new architectural system, let's say, when &#x2013; as I mentioned in the previous question from Saul. This project, IT improvement is a very extensive program, but we are just talking about specific project that you call new architectural system. Right, this one is the last one, the most challenge &#x2013; important, this year, as I mentioned would be crucial where we require perhaps more investments and we expect to be finishing this year with this &#x2013; this project, finish &#x2013; what around 75% to 80%.</p>
          <p>The rest of 20% of course &#x2013; to be during maybe the first semester 2012. Why we expect to have gains in terms of efficiency coming from this? As I mentioned, we have, doing this implementation, we have almost double cost in some situation, right. Directly, you can see very a clear possibility to reduce cost. The other line, we understand that we have many, many opportunities to improve to gain productivity in our branches. Like for example, we have some specific system where managing the branch to make operation. They need to enter in three or four different systems to just to implement one operation.</p>
          <p>So when they are able to do just one thing, in one way, they gain productivity. So that's why just in some examples, have examples of specifically small project inside is biggest projects that give us this, let's say, we don't &#x2013; we did this to help we can be sure in terms of the opportunities that we have to improve. We don't have specific numbers to give, but we normally say that we can &#x2013; we have &#x2013; I have we understand this project has a power to be likely to say to be a kind of synergy that we can have going forward like if you have bought a bank &#x2013; a bank in order to say. I'd say that we don't &#x2013; we don't like to give this number, but one number like this. But when you look for to reduce our efficiency by something around 39 nowadays we are around for 42. We are &#x2013; we expect to be in a mid-term maybe 2014 something around 39. We don't know again, we don't know that it's possible to reach that, but it's one thing that a goal that we have going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. Good morning everyone. Good morning Mr. Abreu. I have a follow-up question on the investment cycle, on the branch network and the IT investments and the impact on efficiencies.</p>
          <p>On the branch network, you just finished the year with 174 new branches. Next year, 2011, you plan to increase that slightly from the account. And my question is when do you expect that cycle to slow down if they will, like, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the on the IT project, you mentioned that you're finishing with 80% of the project this year, and with the most crucial portion being finished this year. So should we expect some gains in efficiency already for 2012? As you said, efficiency ratio should maintain flat when you were going through the slides in the short-term, but then you said in the mid term, you expect efficiency ratio should come down. To look at your December numbers, the last government you had finished with 42.7%, how much do you think that you can already reduce in 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay Eduardo. Look, you're right about the 183 &#x2013; expected for 2011, it's 183 new branches. We don't have our plans yet for 2012, but one thing that we are sure, we have &#x2013; we know that we have the opportunities to opening more branches going forward, but we don't have yet &#x2013; we don't think &#x2013; we don't know when the cycle will finish, but I don't think it will finish at the end of 2011, right. We don't &#x2013; unfortunately don't have exactly the dynamics, but it's one movement that we will &#x2013; when we analyze that the Brazilian economy, the movement in social mobility that we are seeing so far, you can find a lot of opportunities about the necessities to open new branch. So with some one think that we manage this movement, we will continue to go.</p>
          <p>In terms of IT, as I mentioned in the previous question, we already have been some quick gains in these projects, yes, but I don't think we can be &#x2013; it can be noted during this year even during 2012, maybe 2011, we can see some slowdown, but not &#x2013; we don't work with this hypothesis &#x2013; we worked &#x2013; hypothesis. We worked with &#x2013; we prefer to be more conservative in terms of projecting to expect &#x2013; better in &#x2013; from 2014. But you're right in terms that once we are developing, this is not just one specific program. We have a lot of programs inside the system. Okay, you have some pretty gains inside this but you can &#x2013; once you're investing in the same time more you cannot notice this in the numbers maybe. Right?</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. We noticed that the outstanding balance of latest series, our bank notes almost doubled in the fourth quarter. How should we think about the cost of funding of this instrument? I mean how does it compare to a regular time deposit and how much as a percentage of total deposit plus the interest do you think letras financeiras could reach?</p>
          <p>And my second question is related to the payroll of state of Pernambuco, that we noticed that you're about paying R$700 million in the fourth quarter and we thought the trend of acquiring the right to exploit payrolls would reduce, especially after the Basel III proposal. That would exclude intangible assets from the calculation of the common equity Tier I. I would like to know how many years this contract will be valid and how many accounts it represent in &#x2013; if there is a particular strategy regarding the Northeast region that make through about this payroll?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Regina, letras financeiras, normally we are using more to attract investment for situational investors, normally. We &#x2013; it has been proving to be a very interesting instruments for us as to attract funding for the investors because we are able to pay a little bit higher for the investors and the costs, the total costs for us should be very, very similar with, for example, if you pay for a time deposit, for example. We know that we don't &#x2013; when we issue latest share we don't pay just the costs. We don't have these costs and we don't have the requirements in this. So it makes this more competitive for us.</p>
          <p>We estimate that we can pay, for example, 3%. If you pay a 100% for a time deposit or for Selic rate you can pay a 103% in these instruments. So &#x2013; and the other thing that's more interesting in here is not only the price, but we can help funding for long-term letra financeira. The minimum payment that we can have is two years, so it depends. Normally time to pause is one thing that we are looking for is to attract 24 longer field, so it's one thing that has been interesting. We will try to use more letra financeira, as much as we can in this figure. All, right, so far it's just used for institutional investors, but we expect to have opportunity to use it more commonly.</p>
          <p>In terms of the payroll, in term of book we paid &#x2013; you're right, we paid R$700 million for this, is that contract, five years contract. They have more than 220,000 employees with &#x2013; and then average of the payroll is very, very good, hence we have very good expectation in this sense. We know that's not usual for us to make these kinds of approach, but I think in the sense Pernambuco and other states, we have some opportunities we can indeed find in Brazil. We are growing very strongly, but in the &#x2013; when you look different regions are growing more, in the case of Pernambuco, where we have very good expectation of growth there. So in the sense understood that it should be a very good opportunity for us to re-force our presence in this state, different. We have very strong in state of <mark type="inaudible" />, Pernambuco. We were weaker when compared for our competitors in that state. So we understand that it should be a very good opportunity to grow, yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Telles from Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone, once again. Thanks for the opportunity. Two questions, the first one on your 2011 guidance. What's kind of surprised with the growth that you still expect on payroll lending more than the 30% for 2011 and for vehicle financing about 10% to 14% growth, I mean this is despite the market position measures. Are you considering any acquisition of loan portfolios in your guidance or you would expect that to be pure organic growth?</p>
          <p>And my second question is a follow-up on the question on Bradesco's effective tax rate. You mentioned that in 2011 your effective tax rate should increase by 4 percentage points. But I just want to make sure, we're talking about the same thing here because my understanding is that the additional or the tax credit, right, generated by the difference in social contribution, right, between the 9% and the 15% is &#x2013; flows into income statement, but it's considered as extraordinary gains. So, in fact when you look in terms of your recurring earnings that tax credits not really impacting your earnings possibly. So can you &#x2013; I just want to make sure I have a correct assessment of that and if you could clarify I would appreciate? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. Marcelo, first, in terms of vehicles, it's important to understand when you gave the growth in the vehicles, it does not include only individuals, right. We have a very, very strong position in terms to finance vehicles for companies. So that's why sometimes you cannot note this growth. We can expect to grow 10% to 14%, even with this measure that you had to impact this segment, right. The biggest portion of the growth came from the companies, not for individuals.</p>
          <p>In terms of payroll-deductible loans, well, the sense is, as I don't think if you got that but we were asked one question before in terms that we &#x2013; this measure did affect our models of &#x2013; because we have not used so many the biggest P&amp;L quite at the moment. So we don't expect to have in effect in our position. You'll have some movement indirect as I mentioned in the question before in terms of when we pay &#x2013; when we bought the payroll, <mark type="inaudible" />. We expect to grow the payroll loans there. So that's why you have this expectation of growth in the difference, maybe we can. We have some &#x2013; it's possible to have to buy other portfolios but you don't have this in mind. We understand that portfolio could even too reduce in terms of &#x2013; if we consider the acquisition because as you'll notice we grew the market in these things.</p>
          <p>The other question in terms of tax, effective tax; important to say, when you give this, we expect to grow the tax rate is assuming that you have 220 something million reais to use as tax credit during this year. And assuming that you don't have &#x2013; you have some companies that &#x2013; who don't pay the extra tax, like you have some not financing, not insurance companies inside of our company. Right? So that's why we understand that in average considering all of these we understand that our effective tax rate this year was something around 30%. It's good growth, 4% and 5%. In the normal terms we could expect to grow 6%. If we're just a bank like our investment company or bank or insurance you don't have any great tax spread, you can assume that just could add 6% in our tax rate. But considering these things that we're not completely only bank, we're not &#x2013; we have some specific other operations on the &#x2013; this extra social contribution side, the company &#x2013; if this affect that's why we are giving this guidance for 34% to 35%.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call again. I just have two quick follow-ups. One, the impact of inflation index, the assets in your insurance, net interest income, it went from I think 579 to 907. How do &#x2013; how should we think about that? Is that something that is &#x2013; is that we should think of as a one-off kind of impact or is this kind of &#x2013; with high inflation, should this kind of interest income be seen as more of a sustainable level or should we think of that gain as a one-off? And then secondly, the auction of the post office contract, the ability to provide banking services at the post office, can you give us an update on what the status is there and whether you expect to see an auction process when that contract runs out, I believe late this year, if I'm not mistaken, but if you can just give us an update on that, appreciate it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me start with postal service and then transfer to Samuel. We had this contract with post office that we finished at the end of this year, right. We have some &#x2013; we didn't see any movement yet, bur we see some, I'd say, some signs in the newspaper that the government is planning to make this auction during this year. We understand that they need to do this by the mid of this year, because if you have another winner in this auction they need time to transfer this project. We understand that we are in the terms. It's important to say that we are in a very good position to be &#x2013; to compete with this product. And &#x2013; but again, we don't have the additive &#x2013; the agenda that we had talked about. I this should be happening by the mid of this year, our expectation. Samuel?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm good. Thank you, Samuel. How are you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine, thank you. Let's talk about the inflation, what happened with the insurance and results with the inflation. I'll say too it depend of the line of business. I can be short time. I can explain you what happened for leases in terms of what I see. In terms of pension, nothing matter because you know we have the correct hedge for our operation in terms of pension and life. In terms of health, nothing does matter because you know the inflation rate for the health is another kind of inflation, inflation &#x2013; bottom inflation and we have a lot of conditions to reduce the costs related in inflation in terms of health because we have a very huge portfolio which include around five million or six million of insured. We can make a lot of impression in terms of the stakeholders like <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>And in terms of PMC, I would say two of the best ways to deflation the high inflation, in terms of being a few user unhappy is good for us, because we'll issue the premium in advance. We have a lot of conditions to control the cost of the dealers, the repairs, because we have a lot of very huge portfolio, which represents 1,800,000 vehicles. I'd say to you the inflation rate is not a problem for us really, because every thinking in terms of insurance is we have the protection in terms of their revenues and we have the protection in terms of the cost because we have a lot of things to do to compensate the depression of the dealers, of the stakeholder which works with us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, thank you for that and that's a good color. But I guess what I was referring to though is in your release you say that when you explain your insurance financial margin that was a R$288 million increase in the average spread due to the profitability of assets index to the IPSA. That was up from 0.5 in the third quarter. I guess what I am trying to get at is whether the interest income and the investment income from the insurance business was abnormally high because of the higher inflation and whether we should expect to see the interest income in the insurance business as a result decline in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's why really the time period is short.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, yes. Just a quick follow-up if I could. Domingos, you mentioned in the call, when you spoke about credit quality, how you expected it to level off this year, the NPL ratio. So you didn't expect to see more in terms of improvement going forward. Have you seen any evidence of that in the first quarter so far? And if so, have you seen it in the corporate side, on the consumer side? And what would you say if you can give us some guidance for the implications for provisioning for 2011? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Especially. We do not have any evidence that there have been any changes going forward, but we are assuming that that we work with this that will be more stable. In terms of provisioning, what &#x2013; we'll be very happy, let's say, of course, happy if it would be better, but we'd be very comfortable to have &#x2013; when you look at this chart, it's 13 that you have.</p>
