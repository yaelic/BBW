          <p>Thank you, Patrick, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. 2011 was an exceptionally successful year for Celgene. We achieved or exceeded major corporate objectives across all areas of the company. The results delivered in 2011 are all the more impressive as they were accomplished while simultaneously advancing key strategic initiatives that position us for sustained near and long-term growth. Jackie and Mark will review the results and achievements of 2011 and how they position us for 2012 in a few minutes.</p>
          <p>The financial results were outstanding. 2011 revenue, earnings and cash flow, all exceeded our expectations. Our commercial teams across the globe are maximizing the potential of our products. Our regulatory, clinical and research teams significantly progressed key development and research programs, positioning us for multiple high potential milestones in 2012. In a moment, I'll outline some of these key inflection points.</p>
          <p>But first, I would like to review with you the acquisition that we announced this morning. We were very pleased to announce our acquisition of Avila Therapeutics, a privately held biotechnology company located in the Boston area, a company with world-class talent, an innovative and productive drug discovery team with a promising drug candidate targeted in hematology, our core area of expertise.</p>
          <p>This acquisition is fully aligned with our strategic initiative of expanding and enhancing our hematology franchise and further strengthens our global leadership position. Avila's lead drug candidate, AVL-292, and Avilomics drug discovery platform, position Celgene to play an increasingly important role in the treatment of B-cell diseases, areas of high unmet medical need.</p>
          <p>This transaction deepens our hematology and drug discovery pipelines and creates research and development synergies with existing Celgene programs. It's an exciting combination. We expect the transaction to be completed in this first quarter, and plan to absorb the additional research and development expenditures within our existing budget with no impact on our 2012 guidance.</p>
          <p>AVL-292 is a highly selective Btk inhibitor currently in phase one development where it is showing early signs of clinical activity as a single agent in patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We anticipate that Phase II trials will start in the second half of this year.</p>
          <p>Importantly, we'll develop AVL-292 in combination with REVLIMID and other agents to further advance the treatment of B-cell hematological malignancies with the intention of delivering a best in class therapy.</p>
          <p>We're also encouraged by efficacy signals in animal models for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Avila has a very productive drug discovery team which through their Avilomics platform has already generated three drug candidates in less than five years. Avila's unique approach to protein silencing offers great promise to accelerate our research initiatives in both cancer and immune inflammatory diseases.</p>
          <p>Let me now return to 2012. 2012 has the potential to be the most transformational year for Celgene since the launch of REVLIMID in 2006. We're now beginning to capitalize on the sustained research and development investments of the past decade. We have upcoming exciting milestones across our portfolio of products and programs this year.</p>
          <p>It's our job in 2012 to continue to maximize the full global potential of REVLIMID. There are multiple important commercial, clinical and regulatory milestones during the year, including label expansion in newly diagnosed and post transplant maintenance indications in myeloma. Our programs outside of myeloma in lymphomas and leukemia are also progressing rapidly.</p>
          <p>2012 will be a defining year for pomalidomide. Pomalidomide is our next generation immunomodulatory agent for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients. We've received fast track designation from the FDA for the treatment of relapsed refractory myeloma and it's our intention to submit our NDA to the FDA this quarter and our marketing application in Europe in the second quarter. These are high priority corporate objectives. Pomalidomide has the potential to have a meaningful impact on myeloma therapy globally.</p>
          <p>One year post integration of Abraxis, we are pleased by the progress of our global solid tumor franchise and the market prospects for ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer. In 2012 we look forward to FDA action on our application in first line non-small cell lung cancer, full enrollment of our Phase III pancreatic cancer trial and data from our fully enrolled Phase III melanoma study.</p>
          <p>Apremilast holds the promise of a novel oral agent with a unique profile in a new therapeutic franchise for Celgene. We've completed enrollment of our five Phase III registration studies in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and expect pivotal data beginning in the middle of this year. We also will initiate our Phase III study in ankylosing spondylitis this quarter and look forward to Phase II data in rheumatoid arthritis this spring, all significant milestones in realizing the potential of Apremilast.</p>
          <p>As usual, we don't have much time to discuss our deep and diverse mid-stage pipeline, but there will be numerous important milestones in this year that will position a number of these programs center stage next year. We're excited about many of these events including proof of concept data from trials with PDA-001, our proprietary cellular therapy.</p>
          <p>2012 is a year of many important inflection points, regulatory approvals, multiple pivotal data presentations and numerous regulatory submissions. We will share our progress against these key milestones with you throughout the year. We're making excellent progress on key strategic initiatives and enter the year with strong momentum. 2012 promises to be an exceptional year for Celgene, with a potential for truly transformational milestones.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn the call over to Jackie to review our financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. I'm happy to go through our financial results with you for what was a great year for Celgene. Our year-over-year total revenues grew by 34% in 2011, and both operating profit and earnings per share grew faster, at 36%. This growth was volume driven, and we will look at its components, including product detail, in just a moment.</p>
          <p>We also added shareholder value from some financial drivers, including the deployment of just over $2.2 billion in capital to share repurchases over the course of 2011. We did all of this while investing in our own internal R&amp;D, and expansions of our collaboration agreements with partners, as we enhance our commitment to the research and innovations that will sustain our strong growth trajectory well into the future.</p>
          <p>The deal with Avila that you saw us announce this morning shows you our ongoing commitment to investing in innovation. Mark will cover the details of our commercial performance and I will just say here that our commercial team executed very well across all of their main metrics.</p>
          <p>When we look back at the past three years of our non-GAAP revenue performance, we see how favorably 2011 compares to the previous two years, despite the generally challenging macro and industry environments, and despite the significant issue REVLIMID faced as we navigated through and successfully concluded the Article 20 process in Europe.</p>
          <p>Q4 year over year growth was very solid on an ever increasing base and should be remembered in the context of the Abraxis acquisition in Q4 of 2010 and the early months of our launch in Japan in that quarter, both of which positively contributed to Q4 2010 growth.</p>
          <p>The lion's share of our Q4 year over year growth came from volume, with price and foreign exchange contributing very modestly. Obviously the price impact in any given quarter is influenced by the timing of list price changes and price impacts are more appropriately viewed on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>So, looking at the components of our revenue growth on an annual basis. We can see that almost all of our 34% growth in 2011 was driven by volume. The net global impact of price was negligible as declining prices in some jurisdictions, mostly across Europe, offset any positive price movements in other jurisdictions. In addition, the net impact of foreign exchange was also small as a result of our hedging strategy.</p>
          <p>Turning to earnings per share, we grew EPS a bit faster than revenues at 36% for the year 2011. Like revenue growth, this too compares favorably to the prior two years as does the strong year over year Q4 growth at 46%. Q4 2010 growth was below the like periods in 2009 and 2011, as it was impacted by certain expense items associated with the Abraxis acquisition.</p>
          <p>The quality of our earnings growth was high. Most of it came from operating income growth in the quarter, and the full year increase in EPS was entirely driven by operating income growth as the net impact of all items below operating income was negligible. The year-over-year contributions from our effective tax rate and from share count were positive and offset the negative impact of other income expense.</p>
          <p>As you will see when we discuss our 2012 guidance, we will continue to see our EPS growth driven mainly by operating profit growth. So we expect the financial drivers to remain modest, positive contributors to our P&amp;L in the future.</p>
          <p>Looking at the details of our sales by product, we saw very good performances from both REVLIMID and VIDAZA on a year over year basis for both the fourth quarter and the full year of 2011. During 2011, REVLIMID became the fifth largest global oncology product by revenues and VIDAZA grew extraordinarily well outside the US.</p>
          <p>We are quite pleased with the first full year performance of ABRAXANE and with the integration of Abraxis into Celgene, which is now complete. ABRAXANE ended 2011 at an annual run rate of about $420 million, and we feel good about its momentum going into 2012, and new indications to come. Mark will speak more about the details of our product results in a moment.</p>
          <p>With respect to the split of product sales between the U.S. and international, we saw strong results around the world for our three major products, with ABRAXANE's international rollout still in its early stages. We are very happy with the evolution of our portfolio from both a product and geographic perspective.</p>
          <p>We continue to see solid sequential total revenue growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by REVLIMID and despite VIDAZA being flat globally, as was expected, given the strong buying we had from our partner in Japan in the third quarter and despite ABRAXANE being down sequentially as the generic paclitaxel shortage was resolved, an issue we had previously highlighted as a modest benefit in Q3.</p>
          <p>Even with our larger base, our growth is strong. Now with a more diversified product and geographic portfolio, we start to see sequential growth rates in a tighter range than in the past while at the same time, our latest annual growth compares favorably with prior years. Though it is not easy to predict quarterly patterns for our revenues, we have typically seen our lowest sequential growth in the first quarter of each year and we now have an essentially flat growth environment as we enter 2012 for VIDAZA in the U.S. given last May's loss of exclusivity. It is early in the year, but the first few weeks of 2012 are so far in line with our internal plans.</p>
          <p>On a sequential basis, REVLIMID performed well in the fourth quarter of 2011, and sequentially grew at a faster rate than total revenues with growth accelerating slightly from a Q3 that came in on the heels of a strong Q2 growth. With total REVLIMID sales now at over $3.2 billion globally, we are both happy with its past success and with its current momentum as we finished 2011 well, and anticipate another good year in 2012 with our guidance REVLIMID growth at 19%.</p>
          <p>Sequential growth in the latter half of 2010 was positively impacted by the launch of REVLIMID in Japan and we completed a very successful full year of operations in that country during 2011.</p>
          <p>Reviewing the key line items in our P&amp;L, and these are best looked at on a full year basis, we saw leverage in both our cost of goods, saw an improvement in gross margins and in SG&amp;A expense with this latter coming despite Abraxis integration costs incurred during 2011. I will talk a bit more about SG&amp;A in a moment when we talk about our 2012 guidance.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expense went up slightly as a percentage of revenue versus 2010, but was generally in line with our expectations. Q4 R&amp;D expense included a $20 million payment to Agios made to extend the term of our collaboration agreement with them.</p>
          <p>We drove non-GAAP operating profit margin improvement of 80 basis points in 2011, even with the integration of Abraxis and during a year in which we had a number of milestone payments that flowed through R&amp;D expense. Finally at 18.4%, our effective tax rate improved by 60 basis points versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Since 2008, the Celgene business model has produced the operating leverage we should see in our P&amp;L, and our operating margin now exceeds 45%. I will speak more about this trend when I cover our 2012 guidance, but will say that it is a trend we expect to continue in the future.</p>
          <p>We generated strong cash from operations during 2011, exceeding $1.8 billion. During the year, we entered into new R&amp;D collaborations and strengthened or expanded existing ones and we used just under $400 million of our cash in the context of these agreements.</p>
          <p>In addition, we returned over $2 billion to shareholders via share repurchases as we dynamically manage our capital structure and seek to optimize our capital deployment over time. Our business is not highly capital intensive and we spent just about $130 million in capital expenditures during 2011, including the impact of Abraxis.</p>
          <p>As you have seen, we announced the acquisition of Avila this morning and we are very excited about the strategic nature of this asset within the Celgene portfolio. With respect to the financial terms of the transaction, we expect to close during the first quarter of this year, and at that time, we will make a payment to Avila's shareholders of $350 million. In the future, we may make additional payments to those shareholders contingent on the meeting of various development and regulatory milestones related both to the lead compounds in Avila's pipeline, AVL-292, and to future compounds that may come out of Avila's technology platform.</p>
          <p>Though bringing this early stage asset into the overall Celgene R&amp;D project portfolio does come with incremental expense, we plan to prioritize our spending and leverage our business model to deliver on the 2012 earnings guidance we announced back on January 9.</p>
          <p>So having a look at that 2012 guidance, I reaffirm the high level revenue guidance midpoint growth of 15% and a range of $5.4 billion to $5.6 billion, and the REVLIMID revenue guidance midpoint growth of 19%, and a range of $3.75 billion to $3.85 billion. I also reaffirm our fully diluted earnings per share guidance midpoint growth of 25%, now including the Avila acquisition and the range of $4.70 to $4.80 with a constant share count assumed from year end 2011 through 2012.</p>
          <p>Giving you more detail behind our high level guidance, we expect R&amp;D as a percentage of revenue to be about 25% with a growth rate in 2012 at about 10% slower than revenue growth. R&amp;D expense in 2011 included a number of milestone payments that influenced 2011 growth and the comparison to 2012. We have many late stage clinical trials that will have their data readouts in 2012 and our R&amp;D expense reflects that activity and our preparations for multiple regulatory filings. It also includes the addition of Avila to our R&amp;D platform.</p>
          <p>We expect SG&amp;A for the full year 2012 to be around 21% of revenues as we remain disciplined with expense growth and as we come out of 2011 having absorbed the integration of Abraxis.</p>
          <p>Finally, we expect a modest positive evolution of our effective tax rate down to a range of 17.5% to 18% versus the 18.4% of 2011.</p>
          <p>To summarize the main drivers of our growth in 2011 were operational, as revenues were driven by strong volume growth and earnings by operating income growth. This operational growth was complemented by added value from financial management.</p>
          <p>Celgene performed well in 2011 across all of our key operating and financial metrics and we have strong momentum and a great business model as we move into 2012. In addition, we have invested to build an industry leading research and development capability that supports a robust pipeline of projects that will sustain our strong growth for many years to come.</p>
          <p>Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. As Bob and Jackie outlined, our global teams combined to produce excellent fourth quarter and full year 2011 results. We are particularly pleased with the operating results driven by our global commercial team, and I'd like to offer our perspective on their success.</p>
          <p>Despite weak global economies and generally challenging market conditions, non-GAAP total net product sales grew 34% from a multi-billion dollar base in 2010. Full year 2011 REVLIMID sales grew 30% to $3.2 billion, establishing the brand as the fifth largest global oncology product by dollar sales. The significant majority of REVLIMID sales are from &#x2013; and growth are from therapeutic use in global, relapsed refractory multi myeloma markets, leaving tremendous untapped clinical and commercial potential in newly diagnosed myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphomas and all risk classifications of myelodysplastic syndromes.</p>
          <p>Our strategic and tactical product acquisitions from the past several years produced significant results in 2011, combined sales of VIDAZA, ABRAXANE and ISTODAX exceeded $1 billion. Of course, these products are components of our plan to establish multiple hematologic disease franchises in myeloma, MDS, CLL, lymphomas and a global solid tumor cancer franchise.</p>
          <p>We have always known that we have outstanding global teams capable of managing any challenge, but the early 2011 emergence of second primary malignancies as a business and regulatory priority demonstrated our ability to manage unexpected events and still deliver better than expected results. The affirmation by the final European Commission report on the positive overall benefit-risk profile for REVLIMID in relapse or refractory multiple myeloma is a strong measure of the clinical, statistical and regulatory data provided to more fully characterize the product profile.</p>
          <p>We exit 2011 and begin 2012 an expanding base of physician experience, treating patients and conducting innovative research with our in-line therapies. In meeting after meeting with physicians, top research groups, and payers in all major markets, it is obvious that global customer confidence in our brand is very strong. In 2011, this market confidence led to the treatment of approximately 175,000 patients with at least one Celgene product.</p>
          <p>The continuous flow of new clinical data and our strong commercial execution positions REVLIMID and VIDAZA as global leading brands in multiple myeloma and higher risk MDS respectively. We are advancing ABRAXANE in metastatic breast cancer, preparing for U.S. launch in non-small cell lung cancer, evaluating the commercial potential in lung cancer across multiple international markets, and we expect near term clinical results from Phase III studies in pancreatic cancer, and metastatic melanoma.</p>
          <p>The ongoing U.S. commercial launch of ISTODAX for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma is generating a meaningful Celgene presence in the global lymphoma market and provides excellent preparation for the first REVLIMID indication in lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma. We expect results from our special protocol assessment trial, MCL-001 later this year and anticipate filing in the U.S. by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter 2011 REVLIMID sales were $855 million, 4% quarter over quarter growth, and 20% year over year growth. In the U.S. and Europe, fourth quarter overall and line two myeloma market shares remain consistent and strong. Total prescription volume from increased duration was an important growth component and will be a major clinical and commercial priority through 2012. We expect continued market share gains in the second line setting in all of our major markets and in newer markets like Japan and completely new markets such as Russia, Brazil, Korea, and China.</p>
          <p>We realized excellent launch momentum for REVLIMID in Japan in the fourth quarter and have high expectations for growth this year. The marketing and eventual market access approvals in Europe for REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance remains on track and is a major driver of future growth.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., the major growth drivers in 2012 are continued increases in duration of therapy and increased market share. We are pleased to have received confirmation that the results of our pivotal registration trial, MM-015 have been accepted for publication in a future edition of The New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter 2011 VIDAZA sales were $189 million, sequential quarterly sales were essentially flat, but year over year growth was 34%. Full year 2011 sales exceeded $700 million, reflecting year over year growth of 32%. The lack of a generic entrant in the U.S. and our commercial launch momentum in new markets across Europe, in Canada, Japan, Australia and in Argentina combined to produce excellent results. As reported at ASH, multiple strategies for VIDAZA and REVLIMID are being advanced in a series of combination studies in high-risk MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. The development oral azacitidine remains a very high priority program, and is on track with the expected initiation of a Phase III trial in lower risk MDS later this year.</p>
          <p>Our clinical, commercial and regulatory strategies for ABRAXANE have never been clearer. Selectively demonstrating improved efficacy in traditional taxane indications and developing compelling data in indications where taxanes historically have had very limited patient benefit. In breast cancer and lung cancer, this means generating evidence in specific subsets of patients defined by stage, histology, and certain prognostic features like HER2 status. In pancreatic cancer and melanoma, we expect results of Phase III trials later this year. With positive data we will rapidly pursue global regulatory filings and expect significant commercial opportunities.</p>
          <p>During the first half of 2011, we focused on integration activities and our commercial platform for ABRAXANE. Total sales during this period were $169 million, total second half 2011 ABRAXANE sales improved to $218 million, a 29% growth rate over the first half.</p>
          <p>While we continue to optimize operating leverage across our teams, this year will be one of the most important and potentially transformative periods for our hematology and solid tumor franchises. We are in advanced stages of commercial planning for REVLIMID approvals in new markets like China and for an anticipated approval in newly diagnosed myeloma in Europe.</p>
          <p>Expanding global access to VIDAZA and REVLIMID in MDS will expand our leadership and drive international sales growth. And we are positioning ISTODAX for multiple market approvals for relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma.</p>
          <p>Commercializing ABRAXANE for metastatic breast cancer in existing as several new markets while we prepare for pancreatic and melanoma results make 2012 a critical year for this novel product. Plans for the potential introduction of Pomalidomide for patients with heavily pretreated relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma are being accelerated into this quarter.</p>
          <p>We expect 2012 to be another very strong year for Celgene. Thank you very much. And I'd like to turn the call back to Bob Hugin.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mark and thank you, Jackie. 2011 was an exceptional year for Celgene, as we delivered excellent operating results and advanced the key programs that position Celgene for sustained growth.</p>
          <p>Superior performance does not happen by accident. I want to thank all of my colleagues at Celgene for their dedication and commitment in producing these outstanding 2011 results and for the results that we anticipate in 2012.</p>
          <p>Our 2012 catalysts for growth are the result of a decade of focused, intensive investment in research and development. We have numerous value inflection points this year that have the potential to improve patients' lives across multiple therapeutic areas, and to transform Celgene. This will be an incredibly exciting and pivotal year for Celgene.</p>
          <p>Let me close by welcoming the Avila team to Celgene. We are now an even stronger organization, a combined team committed to producing exceptional results and discovering and delivering breakthrough therapies for patients in need.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us this morning and we look forward to updating you as we progress throughout the year. Operator, now let's open the call to questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, guys. Congratulations on the quarter and the Avila transaction. Great to see. Question just on the U.S. dynamics for REVLIMID. We haven't got an update in terms of things like market share and duration of dosing. I'm just wondering if you could maybe characterize the sequential growth we saw year over year and how much of that was driven by category growth, duration growth, and market share growth, and just as a follow on, in the post transplant setting, how far penetrated are we in that market segment in the U.S.? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi, this is Mark Alles. So thanks for the question about U.S. dynamics. So market share overall has been consistent and strong. So we haven't seen a huge dynamic change in share, but that reflects the brand's adoption across all segments of myeloma. The components of improvement really are led by duration of therapy gains which have been strong, market share secondly, and then the expanding market base that REVLIMID is being used in, in myeloma. So things like expanding the use of maintenance therapy generally, those kinds of things. And we see those continuing into 2012.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges of Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and also congratulations and also thanks for the presentation. It's very helpful with the detail. I just want to follow up on understanding what's really going on in the myeloma market, Mark. You seem &#x2013; the penetration seems to &#x2013; trajectory seems to have flattened. And I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how much incremental penetration you think that you could achieve, both in first line and penetration for maintenance if you get the label in the U.S., because certainly there's been a lot of scrutiny of off-label promotion? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, again, thanks for the question. I appreciate that. So on a macro level, of course, we have a lot of opportunity around the world for significant growth in the myeloma market. So I want to make that statement first.</p>
          <p>In the U.S. in particular, again, duration of therapy is a major component of the improved performance of the brand, and there is no question that we still look for the approval in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma as an induction maintenance regimen, because this is really how on a share basis, an absolute share basis, the market will expand and REVLIMID's prospects in that expanding market in induction and in maintenance would be driven. So we really look for the label and a lot of the other elements of geographic expansion to drive the U.S.</p>
          <p>Remember, we have a product, and as Bob outlined, it launched in 2006 and yet from a dynamic point of view, we still have the untapped potential of a true commercial presentation to the market in newly diagnosed myeloma and we think the data from 015, the two maintenance trials that all of you know so well, will be a compelling way to expand the prospects for the product in up front and other segments of newly diagnosed myeloma. So absolute points of share remain to be seen, but still very, very strong opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the other things just to keep in mind is the great thing about where we are now with the geographic portfolio is you've got different trajectories for the different components that drive the growth. And so in markets where we're in the early stages of launches of REVLIMID, or any other product for that matter, you've got steeper trajectories on shares and then you get the duration of treatment contribution taking up a relatively greater contribution later. And so now that portfolio and new indications coming on, starting the whole process over again in the different geographies and making your way through that makes for quite a powerful future portfolio geographically for REVLIMID and with its new indications.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we're higher than mid single-digits really anyplace in the world in newly diagnosed myeloma outside the United States.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's exactly right. And that really refers to the traditional induction setting. When we think of maintenance as an add-on to the population with newly diagnosed disease, that's another dynamic element that would establish a better growth profile than we even expect.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Yaron Werber of Citi. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. So it's a question for Mark and Jackie, and just maybe give us a little of a sense &#x2013; I guess it's a two-part question and I apologize for that. One, what are you seeing in France? I mean, the understanding is that you were seeing sort of a $30 million to $50 million roughly headwind in France last year. And is that turning the corner already driven by the upcoming publication of the IFM study and the &#x2013; it seems like IFM is getting more comfortable as they added the second year of maintenance in the IFM study?</p>
          <p>And then second, in the guidance for REVLIMID, are you including Brazil, Russia and China or is that upside? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Yaron. Yeah, it's Jackie. So what we've said in France is that given everything that went on in that market over the course of the year, it was the market that was probably most relatively affected by the second primary malignancy issue, and it certainly impacted the growth trajectory. And what we've said is that had that market grown in line with our original expectations, we would have been in a different place in terms of the trajectory today and the impact of that could have been something more or less in that $30 million to $50 million range that you highlighted.</p>
          <p>The beauty, again, of the portfolio is that we had other things that, to some extent, made up for that. So you saw the very strong performance of REVLIMID on an annual basis globally over the course of 2011. And as we move into 2012, post the very positive data from ASH and other things that are going on, we feel like France actually is an opportunity given how we've come out of 2011 and that over time France will make its way back to the trajectory that we were on that would lead us to where we think it can go in the future over a longer period of time.</p>
          <p>And I'll let Mark maybe take up the rest of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So the other &#x2013; there were two other parts, China, Russia and then the IFM Dana-Farber protocol. So let me start with the protocol. The two dynamic organizations, DFCI, IFM continue to discuss absolute duration, and it's largely unresolved at this point, but we think that that will be an ongoing discussion in this important trial. I do know that the dynamic, in terms of confidence in the reality that duration in and of itself is linked to second primary malignancies, that that has largely been resolved, the protocol of course being a secondary issue in terms of maintenance duration.</p>
          <p>In the markets Brazil, China and Russia, of course, these are markets with, we think, tremendous potential and they are high corporate priorities for us to gain approval market access. In the case of Russia and China, China would be later this year for sure, because even if it does happen &#x2013; so I think the question I heard was is there upside? The upside would only come if we realized a sooner than expected SFDA approval in China. Russia is really linked to when reimbursement happens, which could be, again, some upside depending on the timing in the year and that is built into our forecast.</p>
          <p>And then for Brazil, we continue to work with the regulatory authorities for full approval of REVLIMID in myeloma while we work on market access in the private payer market and seek to get public reimbursement. So Brazil could have some upside depending on the dynamics there. I think all three markets in our outlook over the next two years are much more 2013 events versus 2012 events.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats to everyone involved on the Avila transaction. Just a question along those lines. So can you talk, Bob, what was central to your interest in Avila? Was it more about gaining expertise in covalent chemistry or was it more about the specific product candidates? And related to that, what are your thoughts on differentiation of 292 vis-&#xE0;-vis competition in the Btk space?</p>
          <p>And then lastly, more generally, can you comment on where you are in terms of your acquisitive appetite? You still have solid tumors and information platforms that you can leverage and obviously Avila doesn't constrain you from doing more and larger deals if you wanted to. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Thanks, Matt. The Avila transaction at its basis is multiple factors involved in us supporting this decision to really strengthen our hematology franchise. And I think 292 is an important consideration there. It is showing exciting early promise. It fits where we're going, and it has not yet been fully explored in a wide range of indications. So I think the synergies we'll get in terms of bringing our clinical expertise and our focus in hematology to fully making 292 the best in class Btk inhibitor in a wide range of combinations and different therapies is a very important driver.</p>
          <p>But it's only part of it. I think the Avilomics platform in terms of its productivity in producing three product candidates here in a very, very short period of time is very encouraging about what we can do and how we can now have a Boston presence. And the synergies with our existing programs was also a very, very important consideration.</p>
          <p>So it fit right in the wheelhouse. We thought it was the right thing to do. The synergies with research, we can do it in a financial way that will have no impact on our bottom line guidance for the year. So we are very excited about the promise of it. We've got a lot of work to do to fully capitalize on its potential, but it was certainly important for 292, but it was not the only driver. It's a nice strategic fit for us. And high quality people that will really, we think will help energize our organization.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just with respect maybe to the appetite for future acquisitions, I think, Matt, one of the ways that we've talked about that for a while now is that we always want to be out there looking for potentially transformative technologies or assets. As Bob said, best in class type assets are what we would like to have that can be complementary to our internal capabilities and fit well within the portfolio and that it could very well be that those would be of fairly modest size. So the &#x2013; what you saw happen with the Avila transaction, I think, is very descriptive of that approach. And we'll continue to be looking out for great assets like that where we can find them.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations first on a really good deal this morning. And secondly, Jackie, just some questions and clarification of REVLIMID. The first question I just wanted to understand, was Japan, when did it really kick in, in terms of growth in 2011?</p>
          <p>And secondly, also just your current thoughts on share buybacks as how you're thinking about the rate of share buybacks going forward, looking at this year's trajectory, how should we think about it going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Sapna. Thanks for the question. So, yeah, I mean, we saw continuous good momentum in Japan over the course of the first full year of operations in that country in 2011. I would say that it accelerated somewhat in the second half of the year, and particularly we were quite happy with the momentum that we saw in Japan in the fourth quarter and we feel very good about where we're going with that in 2011. So we would characterize that as accelerating momentum over the course of last year.</p>
          <p>With respect to the philosophy on share repurchases, you've heard me say multiple times, and the company say that we will manage our capital structure dynamically. We've got very strong cash flow generation. We're in the fortunate position to &#x2013; where we're starting to hit the sweet spot of our business model and really move into the early innings of what that business model can do. So we've got a great growth model with great profitability, strong cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>So we can do all of the strategic business development deals that we think are important for us to do to sustain our long-term growth trajectory and continue to optimize our capital structure over time with the right balance between returning funds to shareholders and investing in our internal R&amp;D portfolio and all the rest. So you will see us continue to do that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just a question on Pomalidomide. You're talking about the decision to file this quarter, so coming up in the next couple of months, seemingly. Can you maybe describe or give a little bit of color on discussions with FDA? Is it your sense that they've decided that a panel is a prerequisite to accelerated approval?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris, Pomalidomide is a big, important objective for us in 2012, but I don't think we're comfortable discussing specific discussions with regulatory agencies in the public domain, but clearly we wouldn't be moving forward if we didn't feel we had a reasonable chance for success. And do I think outside of Pomalidomide, it is &#x2013; would not be unexpected to see advisory committee hearings when you do have accelerated type applications.</p>
          <p>So I think as a general rule, you're going &#x2013; I would expect to see when you do have these Phase II applications, if companies are fortunate enough and products are fortunate enough to have their applications accepted, that you would see the FDA seek guidance on it, but that's not a comment specifically on Pomalidomide.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So assuming that you guys are approved for first line use of REVLIMID, in Europe you'll obviously have to go through reimbursement discussions. So my question is one, what do you think the speed of these discussions will be, given that you are approved in relapsed/refractory? And two, you'll have a longer duration of therapy clearly, would you anticipate initially or at some point having to make any price concessions with the longer duration of therapy? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Geoff &#x2013; and Mark will add on in a minute. The reimbursement of REVLIMID has been one of the strongest aspects of the performance of the drug over these past number of years. The value proposition has been one that has been extremely well received by physicians, by patients and by payers and therefore has created the opportunity for us. And so the value proposition is extremely important, extremely valuable. So I think that &#x2013; and it's not something that is a one-shot deal. It is a conversation and a discussion with payers around the world and multiple, multiple payers within country. So there isn't one negotiation that takes place. And it needs to be a very constructive, thoughtful, proactive discussion on multiple fronts again, across the world with different payers.</p>
          <p>And there will be different strategies. I don't think you will hear one strategy for REVLIMID as we expand the label to this indication and hopefully to smoldering eventually and to CLL and different lymphomas, et cetera, will force us to make sure that we maximize the value proposition and can articulate that benefit to payers and to patients alike.</p>
          <p>So, again, I don't think you're going to see a simple answer to us being able to expand the value proposition as we expand the label. They are going to be intensive discussions, negotiations, going to end up with different solutions in different markets within the same country. And so I think it will take some time, but we're very excited about the opportunity it provides for us to really expand the patient access to REVLIMID.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I could add to that, because that's exactly the right description of the environment, is, one, the timing of everything, on an absolute basis is difficult to put together. So we look at this year and our outlook and the potential for some early reimbursement wins to be rather modest and then 2013 going into even 2014 upside from reimbursement success.</p>
          <p>I'll just finish my answer by telling you that as a corporate priority, working even on the success base we have to build expertise across the company in markets and across the global platform for market access and reimbursement excellence is a high priority and we've invested even now in more expertise, more opportunity to plan for success.</p>

          <p>Thanks for taking my question. In the past you've been quite optimistic for &#x2013; or perhaps even confident for front line approval and maintenance approval out of Europe.

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Maybe a question for Mark. I was just wondering what your perspective on the recent blood article was authored by some of the International Myeloma Working Group members was, is? And also could you help us quantify just in general terms, the commercial opportunity in Europe in the first line setting in the transplant eligible setting and then in the transplant non-eligible setting, maybe the breakdown, is it 60/40, 70/30 something like that to help guide us? And then just quickly any updates on the timing of the next 020 interim. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Mark. So the first part of your question was a perspective on the IMWG consensus paper. And broadly speaking, we understand and are aligned with a lot of what is in that paper. We have through our medical affairs team, through our clinical research group, have been working with the IMWG membership on a number of platforms in the current environment, future research platforms and Celgene for the last decade has been aligned with the myeloma thought leaders. So broadly speaking, there is nothing in that statement that we think of as dynamically changing the way the myeloma algorithm for treatment existed or exists following that statement.</p>
          <p>I think there are some substantial debates in myeloma today about &#x2013; because of the chronic nature of the disease now, you see such prolonged periods of progression-free survival, the question scientifically, clinically, of overall survival is a very, very large debate amongst thought leaders who have to build guidelines and clinical trial platforms.</p>
          <p>So I think, my commentary would be that is probably the inflection point for a lot of academic discussion going forward. Do we do studies of novel agents in combination in the upfront setting, in the relapse setting where PFS or OS would be the primary outcome we're looking for? So I think that would be my commentary on top of what's happening.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to the market opportunity of transplant eligible, non-transplant eligible and we can put it into the categories of young and old patients. We've thought of Europe as being a marketplace where it's less likely that elderly patients or good fit patients would go to transplant, so we split the market into about kind of a 40% transplant eligible, 60% non-eligible, where the U.S. is much more of a kind of 50/50 market for eligible young patients.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the opportunity, the most important thing is to understand that REVLIMID is being built for all segments. We have the MM-020 trial which of course is continuing to mature and the readout for Rev/Dex in that study would position it in young and old patients. The study is predominantly a non-transplant eligible population, but of course, Rev/Dex is not stem cell toxic. So if we win in that trial, this becomes the standard of care in multiple segments.</p>
          <p>Of course, MM-015 is an elderly non-transplant eligible induction regimen, but what we like about the study is the follow on after best response of single agent REVLIMID maintenance. So again, in induction, whether we're talking about young or old patients and then maintaining best response, we have data that supports the use of REVLIMID in multiple combinations irrespective of the stage, the setting, intent to transplant or not. And I think that's an important thing to understand. We're building a data evidence package that takes some of these questions about treatment algorithms off the table.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on the progress. We noticed that ABRAXANE sales looked pretty flat in the U.S. quarter over quarter. I'm just wondering if you're seeing any impact on prescribing patterns from the CALGB breast cancer study that was stopped, recognizing that that trial obviously didn't completely overlap with the current indication.</p>
          <p>And then separately, when does your guidance assume a generic VIDAZA entrant this year? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian. First &#x2013; and I'll let Mark elaborate, but we haven't seen any impact from that CALGB study, which is not our study. I'll let Mark elaborate a little bit more on that. The biggest thing that you see and the difference between Q3 and Q4 for ABRAXANE in the U.S., and I believe that we talked about this in the Q3 call as well, was we know that we benefited somewhat. It's hard to calculate exactly how much that is, but maybe something on the order of $8 million to $10 million from the generic paclitaxel shortage. Back in Q3 I think we had said that we thought it was in the mid to high single-digits. In fact when we look back on that, that's what we think and we saw that shortage essentially resolved in Q4 in the U.S. So that's the single biggest difference.</p>
          <p>And then maybe I'll let Mark talk about the CALGB study specifically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Brian, it's Mark. The CALGB study, of course everyone knows was really testing Avastin across three combination strategies with paclitaxel-Avastin as the base combination, the control. The hope was that Avastin would make a meaningful difference in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. And of course we understand the dynamic of multiple data sets with Avastin leading to the revocation of the label by FDA. Where I think this is going is it really puts the overall paradigm for treating metastatic breast cancer back to the basics that is single agent palliative therapy with drugs like ABRAXANE for HER2/neu negative patients has been a standard and I would see this continuing into the future.</p>
          <p>We need to be a little bit patient here to see if there is any, let's say market impact, but so far, it's been more of an academic, clinical research, what do we do next discussion, versus it translating into those segments of the market that truly use ABRAXANE as a strong palliative drug for women with this disease. So it remains to be seen a little bit, but my view, our view is that it's more of an academic discussion than it is a market discussion right now.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe 30 seconds on global revenues, just because you will notice now that we're giving you the international/U.S. breakdown of ABRAXANE that the international revenues are going to be not in an orderly pattern yet, because we are in the early stages of launches of that product in various jurisdictions around the world. So you'll see choppiness there, and I think that that from a futures standpoint is an area of great opportunity for us as we get the product continuing to roll out internationally and we'll eventually see a little bit more stable trajectory in total for the international revenues but you'll see it choppy for the time being.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much. Just a quick question on MM-020, you've given a sense of timing, but because we're talking about an interim analysis, can you give us a sense of how you are thinking about filing assuming that data is positive? Do you need to wait for that trial to mature more extensively before it could be part of a label expansion strategy?</p>
          <p>And then a quick question. Apremilast, assuming your Phase III program is successful, how would your commercial investment there impact future operating margins? Is that going to be consistent with your Hem/Onc model? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Rachel. It's Mark. Of course Bob and/or Jackie could address this question as well, but I'll speak a little bit to MM-020. Of course, the trial fully accrued a little bit more than a year ago and so from an event driven basis, one could expect in this year that there would be at least one planned interim analysis. So I think the timing is something in 2012, so exactly what that timing is remains to be seen, because it is event driven, there is a very, very robust defined statistical analysis plan.</p>
          <p>So then the follow on to that is the need or the potential label expansion that comes from Rev/Dex and in fact your question is actually a statement of fact. We would absolutely look to expand the global label for REVLIMID following the global approval of what we expect would be MPR-R from the 015 trial and then the maintenance from the two CALGB and IFM studies that everyone is familiar with. So it is a gated, regulatory approach on the back of what we expect is positive data from 020.</p>
          <p>So we would see a 2012, 2013 window for regulatory approvals on the current data set followed immediately by what we would expect to be label expansion with Rev/Dex and I don't think that these are conflicting strategies, as I said, Rev/Dex could become induction for a more elderly population or a frail population where an MPR induction in that elderly group 65 to 75, that may be a preferred subset coming out of the label. So I think it's multiple strategies, all built on a comprehensive, regulatory clinical program, which would then ultimately position REVLIMID irrespective of novel therapy or existing treatment trends to be the backbone of newly diagnosed myeloma.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, just from a timing standpoint, the company has always said that we would expect that data readout at a high level to be maybe in the second half of the year, possibly mid-year and we'll just see how it goes with respect to the occurrence of events and then the maturing of the data.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; and related to Apremilast, the team here has done a great job in preparing for the data and the potential commercial implications of the data. So multiple scenarios are being planned with different strategies for different geographies and different indications. I think it's fair to say a couple of things, first, that we have to see the data, and the data will be very determinative into what our strategies are. We are obviously optimistic that we'll see positive results, but it's near term now, and we're very excited about 2012 in terms of what this data could do for patients and for Celgene with Apremilast.</p>
          <p>I think the philosophy that we take to it is that as a company, it has to fit our philosophy and strategy as we go forward and I think the indications that are treated by specialists and we can go out and access without extensive general practice-type sales forces are the indications and geographies that we would look to retain ourselves, again, depending on the data. And if we are successful in broader indications that require broader sales forces, et cetera, beyond specialty forces, we'd likely look for partners and there potentially will be geographies even with very strong data that we may decide that based on the dynamics of certain markets, we may look for partners there also.</p>
          <p>So I think the clear guidance we have is it's the data that will determine our strategy. We are well prepared with multiple scenarios, how we'll go forward and we do think the specialty areas will be great areas for us to &#x2013; as a company to expand into the right geographies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just wanted to go back to this question of REVLIMID overall market penetration in the U.S. It seems like one of the easiest ways to grow REVLIMID  share beyond 52% would be to leverage the whole concept of REVLIMID with a proteasome inhibitor in dexamethasone and show that REV adds something over and above Vel/Dex alone. But I guess I'm curious, it doesn't seem to be a very high priority in your list of studies or even among <mark type="inaudible" /> groups. I was just wondering if you could help me understand a little bit more why.</p>
          <p>Is that because you think the Phase II data are strong enough or IFM/DFCI is good enough, even though the comparator there isn't Rev/Vel/Dex or is it that you're waiting for the proteasome inhibitors to shake out and see which one ends up being the market leader? Any sort of context there would be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thomas. It's Mark. Thanks for the question. I think you raise a couple of really important concepts or themes, starting with how does the overall market for myeloma patients grow, the treatable population, et cetera. So let me just take a few minute and walk through a couple of things that I think would give you more confidence that we're not leaving any stone unturned to get to optimal REVLIMID performance.</p>
          <p>First, remember the PETHEMA group has had a readout multiple times now with survival in a smoldering population. The NCCN guidelines now have adopted REVLIMID in that setting and actually call out high-risk patients with smoldering disease who would be candidates for Rev/Dex. It's not part of any label, but this is the earliest possible stage for an expansion of treatable patients around the world.</p>
          <p>The second thing is I really like your positioning of Rev as the back bone but I want to be sure that we go through a couple of things. First of all, the U.S. Cooperative Groups as well as Dana-Farber/IFM have advanced a strategy quite far with Rev/Velcade/Dex. So the IMiD proteasome inhibitor with a steroid. SWOG S0777 is a trial of RVD versus RD, that's been ongoing for, I want to say around two years. I couldn't give you the exact accrual today, but that study will ultimately have a readout of RVD versus RD. The other study, of course, we've talked about already on this call is the Dana-Farber, IFM RVD, where then patients get randomized to continue with RVD or go to transplant and both arms get maintenance. So that's an important study. Let's take it one step further. MM-020 in its core is testing RD against a melphalan-based regimen MPT. So those are three or four examples.</p>
          <p>The other example I need to offer is that the marketplace is following your advice. If one looks at the oral proteasome inhibitor from Millennium that's in development and many, many academics are excited about it, its development is with REVLIMID. So we have partnered with Millennium to be able to develop their next generation oral. You know that carfilzomib's development program for confirmatory studies in the U.S. and in Europe are with REVLIMID. So the CRD or RCD regimen is very far along and is the basis for confirming the regulatory approval of that proteasome inhibitor.</p>
          <p>And the last example is Alemtuzumab, the antibody that is highly active in combination with Rev/Dex and the Bristol-Myers Squibb platform is once again a Rev/Dex, plus minus, Alemtuzumab backbone. So I think the market will grow and I think irrespective of any novel agent and how that would change some of the interim dynamics, it would be on the Rev backbone.</p>

          <p>Yes. Thanks. Obviously we have signed the deal. We have not yet closed. We've done extensive diligence. We feel very comfortable of the IP position with it. In terms of competition, clearly accelerating the clinical development is a high priority for us, both as a single agent where it started today, but also in combination with Rev and other therapies. So &#x2013; and different geographies and different indications. So speed to market is very important to us, but most importantly, find the right combination, find the right indications and produce the best data both from a safety and efficacy point of view and we're confident that over time that this drug will be the best in class Btk inhibitor, but it's work &#x2013; it will take time for us to do that, and as we make &#x2013; as we progress, both with the clinical plan and any parts of the development, we'll keep you informed throughout the calls and period.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones really. Just in terms of REVLIMID and kind of overall guidance, one of the things I found helpful in the past was that you used to speak about the split of revenues between the U.S. and Europe as being currently it's still in the sort of 40% to 60% breakdown, and then over time, I think it was by 2015, maybe that's a little bit pushed out now, because there's a stall out last year on the SPM issue, but that number was supposed to sort of flip flop around. And I'm just wondering how maybe Mark and Jackie, if you can comment on how you are thinking about longer term, if that sort of 40% to 60%, Europe to U.S. split is going to still continue to kind of come closer together and then obviously flip flop around.</p>
          <p>And then also just, Mark, if you could just give us a clear definition of what you &#x2013; of the second line setting that you described earlier on in the prepared remarks in terms of greater penetration. Exactly how you're defining second line. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Gene. Thanks for the question. So with respect to the U.S.-international split, we continue to see that trend moving in the direction that we have all along. So we would expect international sales fueled by all geographies, including some of the new ones that are going to come into the mix and be greater contributors many years out than they are now.</p>
          <p>The growth rates there should be quite strong. So we continue to see that mix between U.S. and international from a percentage &#x2013; the total standpoint &#x2013; shift over the future in favor of international. When we actually get to the point where we have the flip, and things like that, I don't know, but I would expect three to five years from now, we could very well have the international piece flipping. It will depend on the timing though of new indications and different things, but it's all quite positive in terms of the trajectory for all of international and the emerging markets and then in the U.S. with continued contribution from duration of treatment and new indications in the future. And I'll hand it over to Mark maybe for the other part of the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Gene. Hi, the question about defining second line. Generally speaking, we look at the second line market through our internal data and market research and then a lot of the external source data that is available to the broader audience is after induction with or without the use of autologous stem cell transplantation. So that's how we look at the marketplace and we specifically carve out maintenance as a different segment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for squeezing me in, guys. And let me add my congratulations both on the quarter and Avila. Can you just talk about &#x2013; I hate to start thinking about limits to growth, but the margins have been so spectacular, both above the line and on the operating line that where can they ultimately go to? I mean, I would think that there's maybe a number in your guys mind that where you get to, you're not going to be able to squeeze much more juice out of that lemon. Just wondering what you're thinking about margins in that respect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No end in sight for the moment to margin improvement. I think we've talked about the 2012 guidance, and included that we expect the operating margin to move up to the 47% to 48% range. We finished 2011 just a little bit over 45%. I think if you triangulate back to some of the details that we gave you behind the 2012 guidance, you see how we get there.</p>
          <p>And then when you go back to the 2015 high level guidance that we've given, and maybe take your models out from where we were in 2011 and where we will be in 2012 and go beyond that, you get to operating margins that are somewhere in the 52%, 53%, 54% range, and there's a lot of different assumptions that can get you to some different margins that might even be a bit better than that.</p>
          <p>So a lot of this is also going to depend on the timing of future approvals and different things. We are on a faster, better trajectory than we thought we would be. And beyond 2016 is, we don't know how that's going to look yet because there's a lot of things going on. It could be &#x2013; continue to be a very exciting margin enhancement story, but let's see when we get there. Between now and 2015, I have no doubt that we'll see continuously improving operating profit margins.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Let me add my congratulations on the quarter. It looks like a nice deal and thanks for squeezing me in. With regard to Japanese dynamics, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color, REVLIMID revenue there and growth in 2012 that you'd anticipate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Charles, for the question, it's Mark and, again, my colleagues will jump in here. Japan is a strategically and operationally critical market for us. So as a priority opportunity, our teams are very, very focused on it. There are a number of dynamics that I think maybe we don't talk enough about. We do some very elegant research that's unique to the Japanese market. So, for example, there is an epidemiologic difference in lymphomas and leukemias, where in Japan, ATL is a type of disease where we're doing pivotal study in a Japanese population with that form of cancer. That's moving along nicely.</p>
          <p>Japan is participating in many of our global studies so that we can limit the burden of all the bridging studies that traditionally have to be done in unique Japanese populations. So Pomalidomide in myelofibrosis, Pomalidomide in relapsed refractory myeloma, these are things that we try to add on and make sure that Japan is dynamically involved.</p>
          <p>From a core operating perspective, there are a number of things about the Japanese market that are more behind us, giving us a lot of optimism for the future. I think everyone knows the safety obsession and I think it's quite important in the Japanese market where the risk management environment for our brands is a &#x2013; believe it or not, a notch more intense and we've just finished a very important pharmacovigilance safety approach that happens during the launch phase of all oncolytic drugs.</p>
          <p>So we are now in a position where, for example, a prescription can be written for the full 21 day out of 28 day course of therapy, where in the past, there was a limitation on the absolute number of days per prescription. So these are the kinds of underlying dynamics between thought leader management research, market execution, and then the way the regulatory environment post marketing is helping us, that gives us a lot of confidence going into 2012.</p>
          <p>There are some of the normal procedures that happen around reimbursement, and we'll navigate through that this year with Japanese regulators, but I think coming out of Q4, we're very bullish on what we think will happen in Japan overall in 2012 and for multiple years to come.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To clarify the second part of the question, the combination, meaning RVD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="21" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Rev, Velcade and whether it be Dex or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rev/Velcade loaded with Dex. So the subQ approval for Velcade is following a long development cycle that looked to reduce the neurotoxicity of this agent in the market. One of the steps that came before subQ is a fairly broad use of weekly Velcade that was able to reduce the dose intensity which kept responses pretty good but reduced neurotoxicity. So I think this progression to a subQ formulation has been important for the brand.</p>
          <p>We don't see that as a major difference in the overall product profile, although remember, Velcade is approved in first line or newly diagnosed myeloma and so I think incrementally this probably improves the profile a bit. But this is why on a comparative basis, we are expanding our program to be more looking towards improved outcomes and progression free survival, multiple combinations. And then the bigger picture, we need an approval in newly diagnosed myeloma to really take this on as a direct commercial comparison, and we'll get there.</p>
          <p>I think with respect to RVD, we have seen some flattening of the growth rate of RVD overall. Some of you may remember that historically, the last year or so, we've seen that as a regimen that was gaining a lot of favor and it was very, very fast growing. So I think right now we're seeing somewhere in the mid-teens in terms of overall use of RVD. And when it is used, it is exclusively used as induction.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Obviously as we mentioned earlier, we're in the middle of those discussions and that review process. So we'll see what happens, but certainly it's our expectation that we've talked about all along, since the data was made available, that our expectation is that the benefit of the label and what's in there will be a result of the data in the package. And clearly there are certain patient categories that have the most benefit and those are the ones that we would expect that would be highlighted in the overall &#x2013; how we would actually present the product to the marketplace. So I do think the label and the whole package will reflect the data that's in there. And I think that's pretty clearly well understood. And I do think as Mark pointed out earlier, The New England Journal of Medicine article on MML-015 will really highlight the importance of this therapy to the myeloma regimen or practice in treating myeloma patients. So we're very encouraged and we're very excited about that.</p>
