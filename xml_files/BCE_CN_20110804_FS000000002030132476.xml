          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the BCE's Second Quarter 2011 Results Conference Call. I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Thane Fotopoulos. Please go ahead, Mr. Fotopoulos.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Donna, and good morning to everyone who has joined us this morning. As usual, I'm joined here today by George Cope and Siim Vanaselja, our CEO and CFO respectively. A short while ago we did issue our news release announcing our second quarter earnings, the release along with the Q2 information package presentation, other documents were all posted on our website this morning. So, you can reference them on our website.</p>
          <p>Following a review of the slide presentation by George and Siim, we'll move to Q&amp;A and answer period and answer as many of your questions as time permits. However, before we begin, as usual, I want to remind you that today's remarks will contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to such items as revenue, EBITDA, adjusted EPS, free cash flow and capital intensity. Several assumptions were made by us in preparing these forward-looking statements and there are risks that our actual results will differ materially from those contemplated by our forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For additional information on such information and assumptions, please consult BCE's 2010 Annual MD&amp;A, as updated in BCE's Q1 and Q2 MD&amp;As and BCE's press release dated August 4, 2011, announcing our financial results for the second quarter of 2011. All of which are filed with the Canadian Securities Commission and with the SEC, and which are available on our website.</p>
          <p>Any forward-looking statements made by BCE represent expectations as of today and accordingly are subject to change after such time. Except as may be required by Canadian Securities Laws, we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, and I'm making this cautionary statement on behalf of both George and Siim, whose remarks today will contain forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to George.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. Thank you, Thane, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin the presentation and then Siim will take you through an update on the financials.</p>
          <p>I'm on what would be I guess slide four, the headline being the strong wireless postpaid acquisitions, and I'll go forward from there. In terms of the quarter, our focus continues in the postpaid segment of wireless. People would be able to see the increase in the gross adds of 13.7%, driving the net add to 94,000, down slightly last year, and naturally the competitive churn that we continue to see at the bottom end of the market, but really quite pleased actually with the net adds on the postpaid side.</p>
          <p>I think the real opportunity for us continues to be the migration to smartphones. 38% of our base now are on smartphones. More importantly, from an investor perspective, we have 62% remaining obviously over time to convert, which continued to drive improvements in our mix of ARPU. And on a blended basis, you can see for the six quarter in a row, up, although the postpaid not up on a quarterly basis. We would like to see that to continue to stabilize and improve as we've seen in previous quarters, but importantly for us having the blended number move up obviously contributes to the revenue growth.</p>
          <p>Cost of retention moving up 1.3 points, starting to move more in line with the industry average as we manage the upgrades in the marketplace. Obviously, as we go through that process to move that number up, it has some impact on our margins, but ultimately it will get to a stable number. And on the COA, that really just reflects the competitive intensity, the smartphone market, we had $0 iPhones by competitors in the quarter.</p>
          <p>I do believe that 2011 will likely be the peak in terms of subsidies, simply because of the competitive dynamics now in the smartphone market. For instance, in the most recent months, for the first time, Androids are our fastest growing and leading product sales, and that helps us from a subsidy perspective. We think that will help us as we go forward more into '12 than in '11.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide five, our wireless network investments continue. The LTE launch in certain markets this fall is on track. We've also now covered 67% in Canada with the 42-meg speed service. And importantly, we announced a Wi-Fi hotspot location transaction with McDonald's, and already had Starbucks. So, we have over 2,000 locations in Canada.</p>
          <p>Important for us going forward is our expanded handset line up and access to a number of phones exclusively, the Motorola Atrix, the HTC Sensation, and really important for us a tremendous phone in the market, the Samsung GALAXY S II, which we have exclusive as we go through 2011.</p>
          <p>We continue to see acceleration of Bell Mobile TV subscriptions. Now, we have 300,000 Mobile TV users at the end of Q2. I've really seen the benefits of the Bell Media acquisition and seen that integration paying off as we see subscription revenue in that segment continuing to grow, and will obviously accelerate when we rollout LTE going forward.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide six, I think quite a positive story from a NAS perspective. Total NAS loss is down 22% year-over-year, both residential and business improving. Business improving to a large extent also through some wholesale additions, but residential down is important. Most importantly, it's the revenue decline for voice revenue and LD, and local down to 3.6% year-over-year versus a year ago, down 7.1%.</p>
          <p>So, declining number, both in terms of the rate or in terms of the absolute number in NAS and the revenue decline, all quite positive, and I think probably a little better than people thought we may be able to do. And I think as we've said over and over, it's a tricky one to call given local wireless substitution, but it continues to move in the right direction for us.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide seven, I think TV is a bit of a mixed bag. I think we're pleased with the revenue growth at 6%. We're very pleased with the ARPU growth to $76.22, and that includes both our Fibe TV and satellite, and I'm really pleased with our Fibe TV footprint now of **$1.1 million. We're on track in terms of marketing activities and take rate, and our activities from a marketing perspective will clearly accelerate in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>The net adds for Fibe TV are where we want them to be and our western distributor, it also continues to do what we want from a wholesale perspective. Where we've definitely seen an impact is on the satellite side where churn is up reflecting some of the competitive intensity around free HD PVRs and some other markets where we've obviously got some pretty aggressive competition in the space.</p>
          <p>So, I think, overall, I think the net adds were modest, but what we're pleased with what we're seeing on the Fibe side and really excited about getting that footprint expanded to the 2 million by the end of the year. And at the end of this year, obviously we'll update everyone on the footprint plans for 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of the data segment, two really different stories here. Residential market's quite positive, data revenue growth of 6.6%. And of course our TV business is not in our data numbers as it would be for a number of carriers on a global basis, our TV revenue is a segmented number. But you can see Internet ARPU up 3.7%, driven through a migration of customers to the FTTN service that we provide, some stronger numbers in Quebec year-over-year. So, a positive story there.</p>
          <p>On the business market side, worth mentioning there was $14 million of data revenue last year from the G8/G20 Summit that we &#x2013; clearly we're not going to repeat this year, and also we did move to our portal business, it was moved into Bell Media's. That's about $12 million of data revenue that previously would have been in this line. So, on balance, the data revenue was, from a consolidated basis, roughly flat, but residential was clearly the story of the quarter in terms of revenue growth there.</p>
          <p>Turning to page nine, our focus on cost reductions continues at an excellent pace, $160 million year-to-dat. And importantly in the quarter a $70 million reduction year-over-year while we absorbed the launch of Fibe TV in those numbers; reduction in support costs and labor; continued improvement in our service offering driving dramatic improvement in the call volume into our call centers taking costs out of the company, and obviously benefiting from things like capital tax and a better Canadian dollar.</p>
          <p>Overall, seeing our margins go about 40%, giving us the headroom on a consolidated basis to make the investments we want to make from a market share perspective on the wireless side and yet maintain all of our EBITDA consolidated targets for the company.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 10, I think we're off to an excellent start with the Bell Media assets. Siim will comment on the financials, but healthy organic growth in advertising and subscriber revenues for both TV and Digital. We're making progress in concluding BDU agreements for the TSN/RDS rate increases that will have &#x2013; be helpful for us, more so in the 2012. We have settled with two organizations so far. We won't give any more detail than that, other than obviously we'll be positive from a revenue perspective for us and a profit perspective for us as we settle those arrangements.</p>
          <p>At the moment our product is priced in the market below the other sports competitor, so we feel quite comfortable in the type of pricing we're looking for. The four-screen strategy is a strategy being pursued by Bell Media, making sure that they're securing rights for all their &#x2013; as many series as possible for all four screens. And most recently with the NHL coming back to Winnipeg, Winnipeg Jets both TV and radio, but be carried by the Bell Media Group.</p>
          <p>So, in summary, a great start at Bell Media, as Siim will mention, contributed I think approximately $0.05 of EPS in the quarter. Wireless competitive intensity continues. Quite pleased with the postpaid numbers. We're clearly a couple of costs in the quarter. One is the COA, which is we think obviously a positive investment. Cost retention trying to get that closer to our competitors.</p>
          <p>The one disappointment was some $12 million of non-recurring costs, which had some impact on the EBITDA growth in wireless but were one-time in nature, which Siim will make a quick comment on. And leveraging the wireline cost reductions across the organization and the growth in ARPU to drive the consolidated EBITDA we want to maintain the position we have in the market, and at the same time comfortably meet all of our financial guidance for this year. So, I would say, a solid quarter, and we just continue executing on the strategy.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn it over to Siim.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. So, I'll start with slide 13, an overall view on the quarter. Total revenue growth at Bell was 13.5%, a significantly higher year-over-year growth rate than previous quarters, and that was driven by the acquisition of CTV, which we completed on April 1. CTV's results of operations are reflected in the new Bell Media segment, which also includes the operations of Bell Sympatico portal effective from April 1 and that's on a prospective accounting basis.</p>
          <p>In addition to Bell Media's contribution, revenues were also up from wireless revenue growth of 6.1%, TV revenue growth of 6%, and residential Internet revenue growth of 6.6% this quarter.</p>
          <p>Overall top line growth was moderated a bit by our business markets' performance which, as George mentioned, generated non-recurring revenues in the second quarter of 2010 from the G8/G20 Summit in Toronto and as well from lower product sales this quarter. If we normalize for the reclassification of the portal and the G8/G20 revenues, Bell's overall revenue growth before the contribution from CTV was well over 1%.</p>
          <p>Total Bell EBITDA increased 10.2% year-over-year in the quarter, again reflecting the inclusion of CTV in our results. Excluding Bell Media, EBITDA grew 2%, driven by continued wireline cost reductions and wireless growth. Our year-to-date EBITDA growth stands at 8.3%, and that's in line with our full year guidance range of 8% to 10%.</p>
          <p>Capital spending in the quarter was on continued expansion of our broadband fibre programs, including the start of construction on our 4G LTE wireless network. BCE's statutory EPS for the second quarter was $0.76 per share. That's down $0.04 from last year, and that year-over-year decrease was due to a $164 million charge, which we took for the CRTC benefits obligation that was incurred on the acquisition of CTV.</p>
          <p>Our adjusted EPS before severance and acquisition costs and investment gains increased $0.08 per share over last year to $0.86. In addition to the higher year-over-year EBITDA, adjusted EPS picked up on lower net pension financing costs and gains from derivative contracts that we had entered into to hedge our share-based compensation programs and our U.S. dollar capital purchases.</p>
          <p>EBITDA less CapEx grew about 6% this quarter and total free cash flow of $427 million, while substantial, was negatively impacted by the reduced accounts receivable collections that was caused by the Canada Post strike, and we estimate that the net working capital impact of that postal strike was about $200 million in the quarter. Now, all of this is timing in nature and we do expect to fully catch-up on our collections in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>So, with that let me turn to our wireless segment on page 14. Bell wireless revenues grew 6.1% on 8.8% postpaid revenue growth, reflecting the increased postpaid subscriber base over the past year, as well as continued strong data revenue growth of 34% and that's driven by increased smartphone adoption which, as George mentioned, represents 56% of postpaid gross activations this quarter.</p>
          <p>Our wireless service revenue growth of 5.7% slowed slightly in the quarter, and I'd say that's a reflection of more aggressive acquisition offers in the marketplace and more competitive voice and data pricing plans and deeper discounting of handsets.</p>
          <p>Wireless product revenues increased 9.5% over last year. And with the strength of Bell's total EBITDA this quarter from the performance of both the wireline and media segments, we were comfortable investing in wireless subscribers at a higher year-over-year level. And accordingly, wireless EBITDA this quarter reflected $49 million of higher spending to gain 41,000 more postpaid gross activations and to convert 52,000 more customers to higher end handsets.</p>
          <p>In addition, we also absorbed approximately $12 million of non-recurring costs in our wireless EBITDA this quarter. That's mainly in respect of finalizing a number of outstanding settlement adjustments and roaming adjustments with other carriers, as well as making a provision for the class action lawsuit on early termination fees.</p>
          <p>So, with these impacts and higher year-over-year spending on new acquisitions and upgrades, our wireless EBITDA margin remained close to the 40% level. I can say that looking forward with retention spending now more in line with our peers that we clearly expect to see improved EBITDA growth in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Our wireline segment, on the next slide, continued to deliver strong overall financial performance. Second quarter wireline EBITDA increased 2.5% resulting in margin expansion to 40.7%, and that was underpinned by growth in TV and residential Internet revenues and a slower pace of residential voice erosion. Year-over-year, local access lines declined and we sold higher global long distance minutes as well.</p>
          <p>Wireline OpEx decreased close to 5% year-over-year by $70 million, as George said, bringing our year-to-date cost reductions to $160 million. The savings were realized across the board on lower labor cost, the elimination of capital taxes, lower marketing and sales expenses, and a number of productivity improvements in field services and call centers.</p>
          <p>These cost savings in the quarter more than offset the start-up costs relating to our IPTV roll out and the lower year-over-year contribution from the Business Markets unit. But all in all, another solid financial quarter for the wireline business overall.</p>
          <p>So, let me now turn to the Bell Media segment which, as George mentioned, had just a great quarter with strong advertising and subscriber revenue results in both digital media and television. On a year-over-year basis, both advertising and subscriber revenues each grew by a healthy 5%. Advertising demand was robust in the quarter, particularly in the automotive, entertainment, equipment, and consumer goods sectors. We saw strong audience levels which were maintained at CTV through the quarter, and across our Specialty TV channels.</p>
          <p>Subscriber revenue this quarter reflected the first TSN contract renewal and rate increase concluded with a major third-party broadcast distributor, and we are working aggressively to conclude and sign agreements with other BDUs before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>In digital media, we saw contribution to year-over-year growth in subscriber revenues, including the introduction at the beginning of April of Bell Mobility TV services offering live and on-demand access to Bell Media content.</p>
          <p>Bell Media generated $123 million of EBITDA in the quarter, corresponding to a year-over-year growth rate of around 14%. But that's not the whole story, so I need to note that as part of our purchase price accounting for the CTV acquisition, we took a non-cash charge against Bell Media's EBITDA in the quarter in the amount of $21 million and that was to amortize the fair value increment of CTV's programming inventory which we acquired.</p>
          <p>And excluding this non-cash accounting charge, Bell Media's EBITDA was up in fact 33% over last year. Bell Media also absorbed a number of costs in the quarter resulting from CTV's integration into Bell.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 17, on adjusted EPS, it was $0.86 per share this quarter, 10.3% higher than last year. That's a strong result reflecting higher year-over-year EBITDA and good earnings accretion from the CTV acquisition.</p>
          <p>Higher year-over-year depreciation and net interest expense that you see relates mainly to the acquisition of CTV. Our tax recoveries in the quarter amounted to $0.03 per share versus $0.09 per share in the second quarter of 2010. And in our statutory EPS, we also realized an $89 million non-taxable accounting gain on the fair value remeasurement of our previously held 15% equity interest in CTV. That's just all part of the purchase price accounting for CTV.</p>
          <p>So, excluding that non-taxable, non-cash gain, our effective tax rate was 24.6% in the second quarter, and that's in line with our guidance. Year-to-date, adjusted EPS is $1.58 per share and we are positioned comfortably to achieve our increased full year 2011 guidance of $2.95 to $3.05 per share.</p>
          <p>Slide 18 shows the details of our free cash flow generation, which totaled $427 million this quarter, down $175 million year-over-year due to the temporary impact of the Canada Post strike, which I already touched upon.</p>
          <p>In line with our plan, CapEx in the quarter was $97 million higher year-over-year and that reflects investments in the build of our wireless LTE network, the steady deployment of broadband fibre, the expansion of our IPTV footprint, and increased demands capital to meet growing network data usage, and finally of course the capital spending of Bell Media that's now included in our results.</p>
          <p>All of this is very much within our 16% capital intensity target for the full year. Very briefly, on the balance sheet, in the quarter we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and we issued $1 billion of long-term debt at an average interest rate of 4.3%. That completed the permanent financing of the CTV acquisition, but in addition it also prefunded all of our 2012 debt refinancing requirements.</p>
          <p>Also, in early July, we completed a BCE preferred share issue that generated $345 million in gross proceeds, and with that it brings our expected year-end cash balance now up to the $700 million to $800 million range, up from our previous forecast of $400 million to $500 million.</p>
          <p>And finally, to wrap up on slide 19, we see good momentum to take us forward for the remainder of the year. Bell Media's contribution improved wireless profitability and stronger free cash flow generation in the second half of the year. It will all benefit our performance trajectory and position us to finish the year very positively.</p>
          <p>In terms of financial results, our visibility and confidence and the outlook for all of Bell's core businesses position us to achieve all of our financial guidance targets for the year.</p>
          <p>And with those comments, I'll turn it back to Thane and the operator to begin the question-and-answer period. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Siim. So, before we start, I ask that you please keep your questions rather short and to the point, so we can get to as many of you as possible with the remaining time we have.</p>
          <p>So, Donna, with that, please explain the polling instructions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Maher Yaghi from Desjardins Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to maybe touch base on the IPTV launch that you are doing right now. Maybe discuss what's your experience so far you've seen on the ground relating to customer servicing cost of hook up, and also in terms of subscribers it was a bit weak this quarter. Can you maybe talk about if you're seeing a lot of customers with satellite choosing to switch to IPTV and that's making maybe life a bit more difficult?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, and we're happy to answer the question. First of all, no, that's actually not the &#x2013; the last point isn't the driving issue. The churn on satellite is definitely up. It's up, we think, one is free HD PVRs are very costly, cost of acquisition, and it can move customers and it's interesting strategy from an incumbent to follow that, but we'll let their results deal with those issues and we'll just keep competing on that front. So, that's part of the issue.</p>
          <p>In terms of Fibe TV, no, it's actually tracking where we want it to track. The marketing will pick up now that the footprint is getting larger. Our real goal, as we talked about, was to get the major Montreal and Toronto exchanges covered this year, because then our ability to market in a large footprint will accelerate.</p>
          <p>Installation times are in the timeframes we expected. ARPU is where we want it to be, and the customer satisfaction is where we want it to be. And every month we see an acceleration on the gross sales. And in fact, our gross sales, on a consolidated basis, were positive. All the analysts would be able to see that simply by looking at the churn rate going from 1.3% to 1.7%.</p>
          <p>So, I think on balance, very happy with Fibe TV. We've got work to do to manage some of the satellite churn issues and we are doing that now in some areas using some retention programs to compete with some of those offers we've seen in some of the core cable, and it's really not a matter of migration from satellite to our own IPTV.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning guys. My question is on postpaid ARPU. The voice decline more than offset the growth at data this quarter, and I understand the pressure on voice ARPU is an industry-wide phenomenon as we've seen in Rogers' results last week. But your data ARPU is still sort of, has a lot of headroom to I guess grow and your blended ARPU is still $6 to $7 below Rogers' and TELUS.</p>
          <p>Just wondering, whether you think the growth in data will be able to offset the erosion in voice going forward and as you continue to drive smartphone penetration through the mix in your subscribers, or do you think that assumption is too optimistic as data plans become more affordable? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean that's &#x2013; it's a really important question and one that &#x2013; the first thing for investors is clearly all our guidance reflects what we think will happen there and we've got the headroom to manage those issues. I do think, from a mix perspective, because of our focus on postpaid, certainly it's helping to narrow the gap between us on our blended ARPU and our competitors' and even on the postpaid side.</p>
          <p>I mean, I would say there was a time where our postpaid ARPU was quite a gap to our competitors. It's narrowing and granted some of the narrowing has got more to do with them coming down, one of the major ones, than us going up as much, although we have gone up every quarter other than this one.</p>
          <p>So, frankly, it is a matter of &#x2013; as we migrate to smartphones, the competitive dynamic, we would like to obviously see postpaid stable and growing to narrow the gap with the competitors. But quite frankly that will just have to be in our execution as we go forward. It's too hard to provide a forecast here on a call.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. And if I could just squeeze a quick one on -follow-up on IPTV, and my sense is that you haven't really pushed all that hard this quarter. First, can you confirm whether that is true?</p>
          <p>And second, now that you have 1.1 million homes passed for Fibe TV and I think you've been advertising in select neighborhoods for a couple of quarters now. I just want to get your thoughts on when do you think the best window of opportunity is to make a bigger push on it? I think you said marketing is expected to pick up. And also what you've seen in terms of reaction from competitors as you expand your TV footprint, Fibe TV footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. No, no, thanks for the question. I think as we've said, there will be some ramping up in the last half of this year, but getting the exchanges finished, for instance, finishing all of 416 we think is a very easy way to brand and advertise, because everybody in that area, for instance, in the City of Toronto, will know now we have the entire markets covered. It's so much easy from a distribution, branding, advertising perspective, and all of that will be completed at the end of this year.</p>
          <p>So, you'll see a ramp up between now and the end of the year and significant next year. And we will take our footprint up a huge amount in 2012, which we will talk about again at the call in the quarter. So, I would look for those second half of the year to see ramp up in Fibe TV and in some of our awareness and with the dramatic increase once we're finished with the 2 million households.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The question I have is on media, very strong result this quarter. So, without much historical info relative to history in your outlook, it seems like this asset is potentially beating what's implied by guidance. I wonder if you might comment on that, particularly given the TSN rate increases. So, maybe comment on just generally the outlook for the media division on advertising, in particular, relative to what you thought when you originally came out with the guidance? And then also whether the rate increases are in the guidance numbers that you gave, that would be helpful for us going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I would say a couple of things, and then over to Siim if he feels he needs to add to it. I think the acquisition is doing better than we had anticipated at the time of the acquisition. The results are very positive and we have a range of guidance on our EBITDA and revenue that we think reflected those possibilities.</p>
          <p>I think Siim made a prudent point, we clearly see the success of the media business helping to contribute to our market share growth across all of Bell, and so that obviously gave us the headroom to make sure we maintain the market share on wireless in a competitive dynamic. And so that &#x2013; as much as that business is contributing, it's clear some of that money was invested in making sure we're driving the market share across the whole company that we need, and I think our guidance reflects the outlook we expect here.</p>
          <p>In terms of the rate increase, as I mentioned and Siim had touched on it, we have begun and finalized a few arrangements. I don't want to get into the details there much, and most of those we'll conclude through this year and we'll have some positive impacts we believe for us in 2012. I don't want to make this a guidance call. And we'll talk about that right when we get into 2012.</p>
          <p>But clearly, the asset is off to a great start. And what I'm so excited about is the cash flow this business is generating to &#x2013; early on relative to where we thought it would be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And a quick follow-on to that, George. Can I read from your comments that you think media is having a positive impact on, let's say, wireless subscriber growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is no doubt in my mind, 300,000 people leveraging mobile TV and the longer our competitors don't want to acquire our content, the happier we are from the subscriber wireless perspective. And when they want to put on their handsets, then we'll be happy from the revenue perspective. We're happy either way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add that certainly media's performance is exceeding the acquisition plan that we had in place for CTV. I noted that in the quarter we had a $21 million EBITDA impact on the purchase price adjustment. For the full year, that impact will be approximately $63 million. That's a little bit higher than we had contemplated, but we now have finalized the entire purchase price accounting for CTV. So, the number will be $63 million. All that said, CTV is certainly, even with that charge in there, clearly going to meet and hopefully exceed the expectations that we've set for it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the remaining $42 million will be in the third and fourth quarter? Will be heavily skewed one versus the other?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the business is seasonal. So, you'll see about $9 million of the remainder in the third quarter and then about $33 million in the fourth quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. If we can keep on the wireless side, your churn ticked up a little bit, you cited some of the competitive pressures. You've obviously spent some more money on retention here. Can you just talk about how you see churn evolving here? Do you think you can sort of bring it down from these levels? Do you think these churns pressures are going to be elevated for a few quarters to come?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the churn pressures continue in the competitive environment we're in. Having said that, the benefits of our retention program and moving that expense up as we can absorb it through the cost structure will help us manage that going forward. I mean, it is a competitive intense market. We've seen that with the new entrants in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>But I think if you look at our postpaid churn quarter-to-quarter, not year-over-year, people have started to see where that is.</p>
          <p>And so, I wouldn't give an outlook at the moment and say this is going to reduce in the next couple of quarters. I would like to see, we all like to see the benefit of the increase in the cost of retention start to benefit that over time. I would say this, it's important to us. We obviously monitor the churn of the customers, and our subscriber churn is higher than our revenue churn, which is absolutely meaning that the customers we're losing are not the customers on balance. The revenue ARPU of those customers is lower than the ones that we're keeping and getting and that's why you're seeing our blended ARPU move forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much, and good morning. I want to go back to the wireless comment that you made about improving EBITDA trends, if I heard that correctly, for the rest of the year. I'm just trying to reconcile how that can be accomplished given some of the ARPU pressure that we had just talked about, subsidy peaking this year, and competitive dynamics perhaps not getting easier going through the back-to-school season, especially with new entrants getting into the subsidy game. So, I'm just wondering, how will you see that &#x2013; how you see that EBITDA growth improving for wireless in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's a couple of things. First of all, I'm going to keep going back to the strategy, which is, the consolidated EBITDA is the strategy of the company. So, investing and maintaining that postpaid market share, we've talked about for the last three years, continues to be the core strategy, provided all the other levers of cost reductions are funding that. That's the first overall.</p>
          <p>Why I think Siim made the comment, and we do, we believe in that this quarter we had the one-time cost issues that we would hope not to recur. And just based on our own internal outlook and how we think the last part of the year should evolve, we would think with the year-over-year comparisons that we should see some improvement in the EBITDA from this quarter, and I think people would expect that given the cost of this quarter's growth.</p>
          <p>But having said all of that, we don't give guidance by business unit and I don't want to get into doing that. I want to continually say over and over, as we did last year, we invest in that growth strategy because that's where the growth of Bell is, and offset that through the cost reductions in the other businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, that improving trend is &#x2013; that comments apply to the overall business, not just to wireless?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Siim made the point. We would expect the wireless EBITDA to improve in the third and fourth quarter over this quarter. That is what we believe would happen. But the overreaching &#x2013; so all our investors understand if it means market share give up, we will not give that up, provided we stay within our financial guidance overall and our dividend discipline model that we have overall. That's really what I want to make sure the investors understand.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. One of your ARPU challenges seems to be disproportionate exposure to Ontario and Quebec, where ARPUs are much lower than the West and ARPU pressure is a lot worst. I am wondering if you are seeing that within your numbers, and while you have made some market share gains in Western Canada, they've been relatively modest. Do you have strategies to enhance exposure to the West?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think it's a very good point. I think that the opportunity is, Western Canada's ARPU are clearly higher than the Quebec market ARPU. Our market share has grown there as some reports come out, and I'll let people decide how accurate all those reports are, but we are seeing growth in the West. We think that's one of the &#x2013; the mix for us of subscribers and regional presence has been an important movement to improving our ARPU the last, frankly, six quarters. And we think, frankly, to grow that, it is a proportionate mix issue, not just by the customers we get, but by where that geography is.</p>
          <p>So, we continue to make a significant focus from distribution expansion in Western Canada and we will do that. And our pricing behaviors that people have seen sometimes in the West reflect decisions that we've seen other competitors make in the East. So, I think there is a real opportunity there. If we can get a better mix in the West, I think that helps on the ARPU. I think it's a fair point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, George, just to follow-up. Do you think that ARPU pressure in the West will worsen, or do you think it remains more resilient because of unique dynamics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it depends on &#x2013; from our perspective it's upside because of the market share mix and the ARPU in the West as reported by the CRTC, So, now people have seen it, it is significantly different than say the ARPU in Quebec, which we've talked about for a number of years. And so, from our perspective we can grow share just by the usage profile of those clients that can help us. So, we have a very simple index at Bell that says, making sure in each segment we're in the higher ARPU segments, and in each geography we improve our share and those share opportunities are particularly in Western Canada.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much. Just wondering with all the talk about the wholesale UBB file and the CRTC hearing you went through. Anything you expect to come out of that that would cause you to change any of your pricing or cause anything to be materially different in your numbers going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I mean, the UBB hearing, to remind everyone, is on wholesale billing. Wholesale is an important item for us, because they have a different billing method or have that method regulated differently than what happens in a competitive retail market, makes absolutely no sense from an investor perspective or a marketplace perspective.</p>
          <p>But in terms of our strategy of making sure the lighter users on the retail side pay less for the Internet and the heavier users pay more, that continues to be our strategy and I think a competitive dynamic here in Canada that's been in place for five or six years, and I don't anticipate that changing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, could you discuss your view of the discipline and the transparency within the marketplace with respect to early handset upgrades, and what your role is in that marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is &#x2013; it's &#x2013; clearly we've gone from an industry that five years ago was 5% retention spending to one that's &#x2013; ours is 9%, some people are as high as 12%, and that's accelerated for two reasons; one is the cost of the handset, and because the payback is there because of the data usage; and two, the propensity of the people to upgrade quicker is clearly part of the cost that we're absorbing in the industry. And so, I think, that's a fact.</p>
          <p>As we look out, and a number of analysts have commented on it, and we are moving towards it trying to get our retention spend as close to in line with the others, making sure therefore we're managing the churn issue is something we're absorbing through our cost structure, and you saw that in this quarter, and good news is, through cost reductions on wireline we've been able to do that.</p>
          <p>I am hopeful, could be wrong, but hopeful that 2012 helps on the handset subsidies, both as the dollar has obviously strengthened over the last year again. Even with what's going on today, it's stronger than a year ago. And also one being the dollar. And two as I talked about, the market share shift to products like the Android where there's multiple suppliers. We think in time it's going to create a competitive dynamic amongst the distributors of handsets that will be helpful to carriers.</p>
          <p>That will drive the &#x2013; hopefully that will see some of the subsidies cost come down and therefore, Rob, then the story that the upgrade costs come down, the subsidies come down.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Peter Rhamey from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. George, I was hoping you could address the whole issue. The engine of EBITDA growth this quarter, and I think you've touched on it a few times has been cost reduction at Bell Canada, down some $70 million in absolute dollar terms despite the fact that you're launching IPTV. I was wondering if you could take us through the major drivers there, maybe that's what Siim could do, and then maybe the outlook. How much runway do you have on 2012? As I'm sure that's what you've been working on for the last few months? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. 2012, Peter, I apologize, we won't comment on other than to say the strategy would continue. We have a $10 billion cost base and managing that cost base had to become a core competency for us over the last three years as we've migrated this NAS issue through our P&amp;L and maintained EBITDA margins on wireline. We think they're as good as any peer. In terms of some of the things that helped us in the quarter, maybe Siim can make a few comments on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Well, we certainly continued to take head count out of the companies. Particularly, as vacancies have come up, we've benefited from labor efficiencies and lower call center volumes as well in our field center operations as we become more productive there. There is fewer truck rolls that are required and installation times are coming in. All of that saves cost. I think George mentioned the elimination of capital taxes that's benefited us.</p>
          <p>We certainly have the &#x2013; in the first quarter of the year, the impact of 2010 Olympics that is behind us in the first quarter of 2011. Public utility tax rates in Quebec are coming down and that represents about a $5 million to $10 million savings this year and probably each year for the next few years going forward. So, I think it's a variety of things, including the lower exchange rate where we've hedged our U.S. dollar purchases of OpEx and CapEx, and that's delivering meaningful EBITDA pick up in cash flow for us through the course of 2011.</p>
          <p>And I'd also say that based on all of the proactive hedging that we've undertaken to-date for 2012 and in fact into 2013 and 2014, we continue to see some pick up on U.S. dollar purchases benefit our performance. All said though, as we look at the business today, I think we're firmly confident that opportunities for greater efficiencies, for example, consolidating some of our call center activities and operating functions between segments will all help us deliver on our future cost reduction targets. And when we get to the end of this year, we'll provide more detailed guidance on that in terms of what we see for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's fair to say, Siim, that there was no one big initiative or that was a major contributor year-to-date this year or in 2011, that's not repeatable in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah &#x2013; Peter, yeah. No, there's not. And I would say one of the things for investors, the number one driver of our cost reductions is providing improved service and the improved service is driving call volume down in an $8 a call and $150 a truck roll. Improving service is driving costs out naturally. Somewhere &#x2013; our call centers, not through having people, people who leave at their own accord, we don't have to replace, because our call volumes are dropping. And we think that continues as we go forward as we improve the operation of our company. And that's really, Peter, has been an important part of it. And so we'll talk about that as we get into next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Having a culture of cost reduction that's taking hold across the company, particularly in our procurement group where there is few, if any, contracts that come due for renewal in the country that &#x2013; in the company that we don't bring out to tender to ensure that we get the best value for the services that we're getting.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Glen Campbell from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. George, I wanted to follow-up on this OpEx theme which has been a great driver for the quarter. You're best-in-class it seems amongst the big telcos, and Bell Aliant is best-in-class amongst, say, the smaller ones with even higher margins. When you look at the OpEx structure in the two companies, can you talk about some of the factors that account for the gap in margin between Bell and Bell Aliant, and whether you see any potential to narrow that gap over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter, one &#x2013; I'm sorry, Glen. I apologize. One of the issues would be, we have the satellite business in our ILEC, which of course, the margins in the satellite business without &#x2013; I don't want to have given a number beyond, so assume somewhere 25%, 30% just for the purpose of conversation. You take that and weight that into our revenue, pull that out, you get a little different wireline margin I think for us. I think that's part of it. And beyond that it's just a little different structure in the company.</p>
          <p>Part of it would be Bell Aliant without getting into their business. It is a great benefactor of enterprise customers, not just from us, but from other carriers in Canada too, and they want access to Eastern Canada. There is not multiple choices as you might have in a market like Toronto. And so that's not a bad business for a vendor, a great supplier to us. And clearly that's reflected maybe in a little bit of what Karyn runs as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a quick follow-up on that. I mean is your bigger share in the corporate segment dragging the other way? I mean, should we be thinking that the enterprise segment margins are significantly below what you get in residential and SMB?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, significantly it would be aggressive, but clearly the enterprise business is a great business for us to be in, but it's not at the margins, let's say, people would expect in something like an SMB business segment. So, that would be fair and we are clearly one of the largest player in Canada in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for the questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from the Matthew Niknam from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. Question is on the macro environment. We obviously have started seeing some weaker macro data in 2Q that might have negatively impacted consumer behavior. I am wondering if you can share with us any impacts you saw across your business in the second quarter. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly haven't seen a lot of job creation and it seems every day that we look at new economic data and indicators. They get more and more challenging to interpret in terms of what the outlook is going forward. I'd say that in the second quarter as much as there is a heightened level of volatility in world economic markets and the U.S. in particular, apart from maybe some impacts in our enterprise business, there wasn't any major or significant factors that I could particularly point to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're actually &#x2013; it's interesting that from the consumers perspective we've had a strong quarter and you can see it in our media results from an advertising perspective, and at The Source we actually saw year-over-year increases there as well in execution at the retail level. So, it'd be fair to say probably, no, not a consumer impact. We would like to see some acceleration in job growth from an enterprise perspective, because as enterprise is growing, of course, our organization being so linked to GDP, would see some of those benefits.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so, as it relates to voice ARPU pressure in wireless, is it fair to assume then that most of that is mainly driven by competition?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah, it was not economic at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got it. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question is from Adam Shine from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. Maybe two questions for Siim, one for George. Siim, just from the context of Bell Media, any particular list of note in the context of the May election as it might have related to TV, radio advertising?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, did you say --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The May election, the federal election?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Certainly, the May elections, the hockey playoffs, the royal marriage were all items that benefited CTV's performance in the quarter. And each quarter they're going to have, whether it's the Academy Awards or other special events, they're going to benefit from those type of one-time programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Obviously, you get those one-timers, but I think unfortunately the elections don't come around quite so often on an annual basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not as often going forward for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe another one for you, Siim, just in the context of last month's CRTC position related to group based licensing. Do you see any incremental flexibility as it relates to CanCon spend and any potential margin improvement across the networks going into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's something that we're evaluating, but it's not our expectation that that will have a benefit on us. And it's more of the status quo that we would expect to continue by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then maybe just lastly for George. Just in the context of changes maybe to download capacity limits in broadband plans, there continues to be this fairly material gap between East and the West, and obviously that's a function of some of the competitive landscape. But do you see you possibly moving up those download limits in the context of any competitive differentiation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I won't get into a pricing discussion here. It's just the competitive dynamic for the Internet, I guess, has been different in the markets, and certainly our cable competitors, particularly in Quebec. I think Quebec, as the leader was Videotron with this context of making sure those who pay more for the Internet are paying more for the Internet.</p>
          <p>And frankly, as you look at the explosion in broadband investment that we need to make and the explosion of usage on video, our goal for our shareholders is to monetize that. And monetizing that is like any other utility on a global basis that if you use more, you pay more, and if you use less, you pay less. We think that's the model how package has changed because the competitive dynamics, they do change every quarter, I agree with you. And we'll have to obviously remain competitive if those things change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Donna, given the limited time we have left, this will be our last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the last question will be from Blair Abernethy from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for taking the question. George, just wondering if you can provide us with a little more color on how the business market for you guys is progressing this year. And also if you could touch on the competitive environment out there, we're hearing more noise from some of the cable companies about expanding their footprint in this market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, it would be as we've touched on I think every quarter, the margins are good in that business, the cash flow is good in that business, but the growth frankly has not been there, on the landline side of the business you're asking the question. On wireless, we're absolutely thrilled with our business market share growth we're seeing there because of our handset being global, et cetera, and all those great benefits.</p>
          <p>So, on the business side, it continues to be a grind having to really deal with the cost structure to make sure we stay ahead of that. I do believe economic growth at one point will held back. In terms of competitive intensity, I don't &#x2013; we don't find it more competitive intensive than it's been. Some of our stats would show our market share has grown in some areas. But in some other areas, at the bottom end of the market, where some people are playing in the NAS basically see some impact. But you can see our NAS numbers year-over-year, and they were a little bit better as well.</p>
          <p>But it really is re-pricing of contracts in a competitive marketplace. And then if the organizations are not adding growth, then we don't get the add-ons and that in our business is a scale that is really what makes the difference. And I don't think that's particularly different than other North American and global telecom players in that particular segment. But clearly, it is the one that &#x2013; any help there that we get, makes this &#x2013; the profile of the business just improving that much more.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, then we're obviously comfortable with our guidance for the year. Comfortable with putting it in a position to increase &#x2013; continue increasing over time our dividend with our capital market strategy. As we get into 2012 that will be our goal, and we're feeling really quite good about the cash flow of the organization, to be in a position to do that as we head into next year.</p>
