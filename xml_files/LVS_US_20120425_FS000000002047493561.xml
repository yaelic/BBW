        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My name is Ashley and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Las Vegas Sands Corporate First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Briggs, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Briggs, you may begin your conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Adelson let me remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that we are making under the Safe Harbor provisions of federal securities laws. The company's actual results could differ materially from the anticipated results in those forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release under the caption forward-looking statements for a discussion of risks that may affect our results.</p>
          <p>In addition we may discuss adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted property EBITDA which are non-GAAP measures. A definition and a reconciliation of each of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release. Please note that this presentation is being recorded.</p>
          <p>With that, let me please introduce our Chairman, Mr. Sheldon G. Adelson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you all for joining us today. Before we go to Q&amp;A let me make some brief opening remarks. I want to apologize in advance if I &#x2013; if you hear some paper rattling because I've got several papers that people have given me; I'm trying to take the information from the papers.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with the overall financial results for the quarter. As you saw in the press release we have set an all-time industry-wide record. No company in our industry has ever achieved $1 billion EBITDA for a quarter. We're very proud of that and we hope it'll be the first of many record &#x2013; well, we know it's the first of many records that we're already setting and we hope it'll be the beginning of a continuation of a lot more records that we're going to set.</p>
          <p>We also &#x2013; we went up &#x2013; the earnings per share went up 89% from last &#x2013; from last year to $0.70. Now I know there were a lot of estimates coming out in the 50's, in the $0.52, $0.53, I even saw an analyst last night that jumped his estimate the day before I ran into these from $0.56 to $0.61 or something like that. That was probably the highest.</p>
          <p>Our net revenue after &#x2013; according to GAAP, net revenue increased 31% to $2.76 billion. Now frankly the gross revenue was somewhat higher and I've been having discussions with our auditors, Pricewaterhouse, as to why the industry reports net. And if I &#x2013; I've read the rules regarding it under the FASB, the Financial Standards &#x2013; the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Under their rules I read that and I have some questions about that. In any event it would be up to $3 point something billion. The EBITDA margin is an industry-leading EBITDA margin of 38.6%. In the case of Macao we have results that are in excess of our co-fair share.</p>
          <p>This is the eleventh consecutive quarter of EBITDA growth, and I have the chart in front of me and it comes to a whopping &#x2013; instead of CAGR, compound annual growth rate, we've got &#x2013; I don't know how to pronounce it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>CAGR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>CAGR &#x2013; compound quarterly growth rate of 14.2% from quarter-to-quarter. I'm looking at a bar chart. For the last 11 quarters, we've gone from $247.6 billion EBITDA &#x2013; million EBITDA to $1.70 billion EBITDA.</p>
          <p>I suppose that might have surprised a few of you guys, because nobody even approached $1 billion and most of the analysts' projections were in the &#x2013; I believe, some in the $800 millions, some in the low $900 millions. In earnings per share, we had a 47.1% increase in earnings per share. In gross revenue, we had a 9.4% increase and in net revenue we had a 9.1% increase. There was the &#x2013; let me look at our two biggest markets.</p>
          <p>Our business at Macao has never been in a stronger position. Our managed business is growing. Our VIP efforts are working and are now gaming revenue, the backbone of the IR model, also increased significantly. We've had record consolidated non-rolling drop of $1.92 billion, up 10% versus 2011. We're cooking on all cylinders.</p>
          <p>We've had record consolidated slot handle up 53% to $2.1 million. Retail mall revenue increased 30% versus last year, and I'd like to address the issue that somebody talked about that we were truing up or loading up our books to show more income, more retail income in the fourth quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>So, let me point something out to you. In the United States, I've seen figures that, and you guys would probably know better than I, but I'm only going by memory, that 40% of an annual sales are done between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So, the larger percentage of sales over there are done during these periods, during the same period.</p>
          <p>Hong Kong is not just &#x2013; doesn't have exactly the same holidays that the mainland does. There are a lot of Christians in Hong Kong. There's a lot of Christmas shopping going on from different visitors to Macao.</p>
          <p>And the interesting part about it is that it &#x2013; it's natural that in the fourth quarter, because of the relationship with the &#x2013; there is no truing-up, we don't do true-ups. But where something is required to do a true-up we'll do it, but this is not a policy nor a practice to say we're going to pump up the figures in the last quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>The reason why the last period of the year is because that's when people exceed the percentage, it's called the natural breakpoint, where they exceed the percentage of revenue that constitutes the base rent and they go beyond the natural breakpoint. And therefore, they go into excess rent. So we get excess rent during that period and that is why, it's substantially more during that fourth quarter than there are in other quarters, because we break through the percentage brackets.</p>
          <p>Now there are some retailers that pay percentage on a monthly basis, because they're doing so much more than the basic rent and there are some retailers that &#x2013; everybody reports on &#x2013; well, not everybody, but the majority of the retailers, of the several hundred retailers we have, report on a monthly basis and there are some that report quarterly. I think there's even some that report on an annual basis. So as far as retail is concerned, there is no truing-up. The percentages and the income is the way that it occurs.</p>
          <p>Hotel revenue is up 19% versus last year and we have now &#x2013; we will have 10,000 hotel rooms before this time next year. We will open &#x2013; our plans are to open the second phase, Phase IIA, I guess it's called, of Cotai Central by September &#x2013; mid-September. And I think the last Phase will go to either December or January &#x2013; probably January.</p>
          <p>So that'll give us a total of close to 10,000 rooms and that represents probably 50% of the hotel room supply in the entire city of Macao. As far as four &#x2013; four star and five star rooms are concerned, we're way up there with a high percentage anyway.</p>
          <p>Referring to what's going on in Singapore, we had another very strong quarter. The mass win per day increased 21% to $4.47 million per day &#x2013; $4,470,000 per day. The mass win, the rolling volume was up 26% over last year's quarter one. I'd like to address questions that had been brought up before where people think that we've plateaued or the market has plateaued. Let me point out to you that there is, if you take 73% of about $34 billion that was conducted in Macao in 2011, you come to about $25 billion of high-roller VIP plus.</p>
          <p>Now all those players don't come down to &#x2013; they don't represent the fertile opportunity that 100% of those VIP players are going to come to Singapore on one weekend. There will be a turnover, there will be a revolving number of people coming from Macao just like those people that come &#x2013; that are going to Macao that typically also go to Las Vegas, they go to Sydney, Australia, they go to Melbourne, they go to other places to play. They will &#x2013; there is a very healthy market of $25 billion of VIP play that occurred in 2011 or already a quarter beyond that, that represents a truly fertile opportunity for us to increase and to get beyond what people think potentially is a plateau in the number of VIP players.</p>
          <p>We are constantly surprised at the &#x2013; who they are, the number of people, how they come out of the woodwork and how many there are in the world. There was a time many years ago, 10, 15 years ago, that people thought that in the entire world there were as few as 150 VIP players. We sometimes get that in a few days, a week or two weeks or whatever. So there are an awful lot of people that are playing all around the world and from many different countries that nobody ever thought of before. So the word plateau in terms of Asia is not in our vocabulary.</p>
          <p>Let's see, the high margin segments continue to grow. Our hotel room revenue was up 38% over 2011 and our mall revenue was up 25% over 2011. As in Macao, Marina Bay Sands also achieved a new record property EBITDA of $473 million. And clearly, we &#x2013; if you look at the last 11 quarters, you see we've grown an average of 14.2% quarter-to-quarter and a compound quarterly annual &#x2013; compound quarter...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Compound quarterly growth rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. It's one of those. And if you look at that that we're just going to continue quarter-by-quarter. I know there are a lot of people out there that &#x2013; there's some analysts out there, who I've seen, there seem to suggest that they either are playing on a quarter-to-quarter basis. This company is out to attract long-term value investors, investors who want to invest in a company that pays dividend, investors that want to be in a special company, and that we said to some degree to you. At our September, Investor Day that we had in New York, we read out there were six companies that fit into several categories. And I'll tell you there are fewer than that today, but let me tell you what they are. There are 12,222 publicly traded companies on U.S. exchanges.</p>
          <p>The next category is market capitalization. There are 155 over $20 billion and we are pushing back up against $50 billion, and revenue compound annual growth rate of over 20%, there were 12 companies.</p>
          <p>So starting off with 12,000 plus companies, we're now down to 12, that have compound annual growth of 20%. There are in 2013 estimated free cash flow that will yield 7.5%, there are only three companies, so now we're down to three out of 12,000. And the companies that pay current dividend, all of this plus including companies who pay dividends, there are only two, LVS and Apple. Well, considering what Apple did today, let's put Apple first and say Apple and LVS. I think that puts us in a very unique position for me to consider a value investment.</p>
          <p>The second item is that &#x2013; the next item, I'd like to address is that somebody came up with the idea that there was going to be a seventh concession here in Macao. Now, I don't know whether they're reading the press or looking at press clippings or talking to the government, but the government &#x2013; or listening to the government, the government has said both in the prior chief executive administration and the current administration, 2009 was the year they were going to reconsider it. They said no, no, no. If there's anybody that doesn't understand what no means, please give me a call offline and I'll be happy to explain it to you.</p>
          <p>There was also somebody who said that &#x2013; somebody speculated that we're going to have to move 386 with some odd number of tables from our other properties. Let me address that.</p>
          <p>On a daily basis, we are always shuffling tables around, moving them from one place to the other, changing the game of play from say blackjack to a baccarat or vice versa. And we're always trying on a good operational basis to improve performance of every one of our products, whether it's a table, a slot or an ETG. And so, we always move tables around, both with in each property and in between properties. Now we have to get approval from the government every time we move it, so we do that.</p>
          <p>The government is committed to lenders to provide 400 tables. They gave us 200 tables for the opening the first of the two mass casinos. And they're going to give us, presumably, the second 200 tables when we go to open our second casino. The casino in Lot 6 as part of the Cotai Central. So I don't know how &#x2013; I don't know how somebody knows so much about the government. For those people that are interested in &#x2013; know more than we know and maybe even ostensibly more than the government knows, if you'd like to apply for a job with us as the government relations person, maybe we can improve our flow of information in a more qualitative way.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to straighten out another issue, and that is there's been a lot of mention of $35 billion that we're going to spend in Europe, for Europe in Spain, for the European market. That figure was taken from a press conference that I conducted at the opening of Sands Cotai Central in on April 11, where I answered the question vis-&#xE0;-vis what was the total budget going to cost. But I'd like to explain that so we can put that issue, that false issue, to bed once and for all.</p>
          <p>We're going to build the property, at least that's the way it's planned, over a nine-year period. That will include building four 3,000-room hotels integrated resorts, hotel room integrated resorts, every two years. The first one will start off and we're only estimating and we haven't drawn our plans, we don't have the blueprints, we don't know exactly. We've had quantity surveyors, these are independent estimators of construction, give us numbers. So the most we can estimate at this time is that each property will be between $2 billion and $3 billion per property. So it could be from $8 billion to $12 billion. As Ken Kay announced in September, Investor Day meeting that a 25% to 35% of that will be equity, so let's say the largest amount of money this company will be expected to put out over a three-year period is $4 billion in equity; not $35 billion.</p>
          <p>That's only the first phase. And I want to make it clear for about the 942nd time that I have said to the market we will not go into any development where we don't see the 20% cash-on-cash return. So repeat that for the 975th time. No investment without a 20% cash-on-cash return. So then we'll take the money that we're earning in Phase I and we'll have another three years to take that amount of money that we're earning to put up for the equity for Phase II, so far we're up to about, give or take, $3 billion to $4 billion in equity. And then the Phases I and II we'll earn enough money over the following three years so that we can finance almost fully Phase III.</p>
          <p>So far we're at $4 billion. If anybody else has any arithmetic over and above that, I'd be happy to receive it. But this is what I know we're going to do, and since I'm the CEO and Chairman, our board has agreed with this. This has been discussed ad infinitum and within our own company and that's what we intend to do: 20% cash-on-cash return, otherwise we don't go. Equity goes up to the first phase only and the equity we earn for the second phase will come out of the first phase operating earnings.</p>
          <p>I don't think I could be any clearer than that. Let's see, let me finish by talking about our development activities and then we'll open up to questions. Two weeks ago we opened the first Phase of Sands Cotai Central. As it ramps up, Cotai Central will add to the critical mass of rooms, retail to the Cotai strip, which will make it an international destination for leisure, business and conventions and it will validate my original vision for what was then a swamp and a bay. If anybody wants to see the pictures of what it was at the time, we'll be happy to send it to you and just send me an e-mail. And we will then have accomplished the establishment of a Las Vegas in Asia or as I've said many times before, Asia's Las Vegas. And what we intend to do in that respect will add Europe's Las Vegas. It will either be called Europa Vegas or EuroVegas or something like that.</p>
          <p>So that's it. I think that &#x2013; let me look at my papers. I'd like to tell you that in terms of Macao, we're extremely happy with the progress we're making at Macao. As I've said in my last couple of earnings calls, we expect our market share would be the same as Cotai Central, which by the way is the only product opening over the next three years. The only product opening &#x2013; there is no other construction underway.</p>
          <p>I'd like to also point to something else because everybody that didn't want the product, didn't want Cotai in the first place because they didn't think it was either ready or they didn't think it was viable or for whatever reason, all those people that didn't want to have a piece of land in Cotai now will cut off their arms to get a piece of land in Cotai. Just want to remind everybody we bought, we paid for and we own Lot 3. Lot 3 can hold 3,600 rooms. We are applying to the government for permission to move forward with that. And, of course, that requires &#x2013; will require an extension of time to build.</p>
          <p>I might also point out that not in the history as Macao has the government ever re-acquired a piece of land because somebody didn't build on time. The government is a very cooperative, accommodating government and the government wants &#x2013; likes &#x2013; they attribute the change in Macao to a leisure business convention destination to Sands China Limited, and our majority-owned subsidiary, and of course our parent company Las Vegas Sands Corporation.</p>
          <p>And they know that we've done more &#x2013; as a matter of fact, I saw a clipping recently that said that Sands hoped to petition the government or made a statement that the government shouldn't require her to put up convention space and shopping space and this and that and everything because a Venetian has done a good &#x2013; such a good job on it that she didn't have to add to the MICE space that has to be done. We have the biggest footprint in Macao in terms of hotel rooms, MICE space, retail, and they're all important visitation drivers.</p>
          <p>There are no other development activities; the government has not approved any development and, to the best of my knowledge, no land has been transferred to anybody except Galaxy got the land at about the same time that we did. And one of the clippings said that they're going to announce, the rumors are that they're going to announce a non-gaming hotel on &#x2013; more rooms on the balance of the land. And I understand they're putting it next to our exhibition center so they could take advantage of filling up some of the rooms from our MICE business.</p>
          <p>So that's it. I can't &#x2013; I'm very glad we're only one of two out of 12,222 companies. And I just want to tell you that our whole team is here listening and we'd be happy to answer your questions at this time.</p>
          <p>Operator, let's go to the questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This wasn't going to be my first question, Sheldon, but since you brought up the topic of Spain, have you entered into a memorandum of understanding with either Madrid or Barcelona? And do you know what the gaming tax rate is, the corporate tax rate? I know you were trying to get some concessions on labor and things like that. I guess how far along are you?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are at the point where I'm going to pry our Board of Directors over it. It's a very big decision. We're going to look at Madrid and Barcelona and let's say we're on the cusp of having a decision. I'm just having a little difficulty in getting the whole Board schedule to be worked out. On any one day somebody isn't available. We'll take as many Board members as we can as soon as we can, and I hope that we can &#x2013; I'm looking forward to doing a &#x2013; having the decision where it's going to be located and which parcel of land where we're going to select maybe within the next month or so.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Joe, this is Mike Leven here. Negotiations continue with both governments of Barcelona and Madrid. We expect those negotiations to not only continue, but at some point once we make the city decision, those negotiations that we agree upon go to legislation at the various legislatures of the various governments involved. And at that particular time when that legislation goes through the government, then it becomes public knowledge as to what's going to be happening.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Okay. And then switching over to a question on Singapore and then I have a quick follow-up after that. Obviously, Genting got two junkets approved for their property. Can you share with us your strategy, your position, whether or not you're sponsoring any applications in the near-term and what your views are there with the use of junkets or IMAs there? And then I had a quick follow up.</p>

          <p>Yes.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Very interesting, when I was at the opening another analyst, a colleague of yours, I don't know if he was from JPMorgan, came over to me and he said &#x2013; and he talked about the advantage that RWS has. Let me explain to you. You've got to understand what they mean by international marketing agents, and they specifically did not call them junket reps. The junket rep in Macao does three primary services: one, brings the customer; two, provides and collects the credit; and three, shares commission with the customer; and four, somehow or other gets the money to us.</p>
          <p>Now, in Singapore, as we read the rules and regulations, the junket rep cannot share commission with anybody else. So that takes away a major incentive for the junket reps to be &#x2013; for players to go through junket reps because there is a sharing of the commission. Secondly, they can't give out credit. So that kills something else. We compared the over 100 field salespeople that we have in various offices, particularly around Asia, with those two junket reps because our customers can &#x2013; our field salespeople can go out and bring in customers and get paid on a basis of productivity and &#x2013; probably a lot of detail you're not interested in is how they get paid.</p>
          <p>But the bottom line is they don't get a percentage of the roll, they don't share any of their commission. They're called junket reps here in Las Vegas. And a Las Vegas style junket rep is a field sales guy who gets a limited amount of money for bringing in a player based upon the theoretical play that the player plays &#x2013; the theoretical win. In Singapore, they call them international marketing agents because that's all they are. They're salespeople that bring in a customer and I suppose they get paid. They can't provide credit. They can't share the commission. So they're the equivalent of our more than 100 salespeople.</p>
          <p>So we don't see that that RWS has any advantage over us. And for those kinds of international marketing agents we already have over 100 of the equivalent of the function of those two international market agents. So what are we going after them for? Let me be clear. That's satirical. There's no reason for us to go after those, that kind of junket, that kind of IMAs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me tell you what we've done. We have &#x2013; I keep telling people it isn't a quarterly hold rate, whether it's plus or minus that should be adjusted. If the hold rate is 3.3%, 3.5%, 4%, you've got to bring it back down to 2.85%. We've prepared documents that show a 200-day moving average. The 200-day moving average was 2.85% company-wide. It was a higher percentage in Singapore. I'm sorry; I don't have it in front of me. Somebody had it; they didn't give it to me. I think Ken has &#x2013; somebody's run to get it to me. Let's see, the total Macao properties is 2.90% and Marina &#x2013; oh, sorry, 4/20, well, I can't get it to 4/21; I can only &#x2013; because that includes part of the second quarter; I can only go to the end of the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The moving average is 2.90% in Marina Bay Sands. Total Macao and Singapore properties 3.05% on a 200-day moving average. So that's what counts. Now, if somebody wants to go to a more rapid evaluation, I'd like to hold a contest. We can have people guess on a quarterly basis, on a monthly basis, on a weekly basis, on a daily basis, an hourly basis and minute-by-minute. And, I would provide a multimillion dollar prize for anybody who can guess and determine where our entire company is going based upon win or loss or percentage of hold on a minute-to-minute basis. Just being sarcastic about that. 3.31%, total Macao, and Singapore properties 3.05%.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a little bit more about Cotai Central. I understand the property has only been open for 15 days but I did want to see if you guys could give us any &#x2013; your just &#x2013; your early thoughts on any metrics that are coming out of the property and also maybe most importantly what you're learning about cannibalization across the other properties. Are you seeing any impact at some of your other resorts?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I keep talking about cannibalization. I keep telling everybody that critical mass in a supply-driven industry brings in more people; it doesn't cannibalize others. We are trying to cannibalize our competitors and not cannibalize ourselves. I cannot talk about anything that has occurred since April 1 because that's in the current quarter. And, I urge you to turn &#x2013; to call this number again, maybe a different number, 90 days from now, and we'll give you all the information you want.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I've got to tell you I see no reason that our 14.2% growth per quarter of the 11 quarters won't continue because every quarter we do the earnings call everybody &#x2013; and by the way, for all except four of those quarters, it's all organic growth because we opened up Singapore, it became organic with us, became a legacy property and from that point on it has grown I think more than 14.2%. But, over the last 11 quarters it's spread 14.2% quarterly <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At Cotai Central, all you have to do is look at our history, look at the position that we occupy in the market. I don't see any other company earning $1.07 billion EBITDA for one quarter. So, there must be something we're doing right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Totally understandable. We'll check back on that. So, the second would be on Singapore; I just wanted to ask, there's a lot of questions around sequential improvement in the market and some of the seasonality there. It does look like volumes came back on the VIP side. So, we just wanted to get a sense of &#x2013; historically, if you look at visitation patterns, Q1 and Q3 look like they'll be the strongest. Does that still seem like a reasonable expectation as we think about modeling what you guys are seeing there? And, how much did &#x2013; do you think Chinese New Year really drove some of the activity now that you guys have had a chance to digest that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Frankly, I'm not as smart as Goldstein; I think he understood the question better than I did. And, the same thing for Mike Leven. Do you guys want to answer that question because I didn't understand it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. On the gaming side, Shaun, I think we obviously never underestimate the impact of Chinese New Year's and obviously that's our bread-and-butter quarter in this company vis-&#xE0;-vis Asia. And, there's no &#x2013; and we did show nice growth, I think, year-on-year; we're pleased with that. Again, we're only in our ninth quarter of operating there. So, it's hard to predict seasonality and even more difficult to estimate the importance of all the new infrastructure such as the cruise ship terminal, increased roads to China and to Singapore in general, the mass market growth out of both Indonesia and Malaysia.</p>
          <p>But, I think we're very confident that if you look at Singapore's position in the market, it's a very, very exciting place to travel for the Asians, especially newly affluent Asians. I think it continues to grow both in the VIP and mass side. Again, being one of two competitors there is a huge advantage. The duopoly situation is hugely advantage for us and RWS. Singapore set a new quarterly record for its &#x2013; for us results-wise. I don't think there's any question there's growth in Singapore in the future. It's hard for me to determine, except for Chinese New Year's <mark type="inaudible" /> second quarter versus third quarter is the better quarter. Fourth is obviously challenged as the summer is in there. But, we see bright days ahead with the cruise ship terminal, the botanical gardens, the growth of tourism, infrastructure, et cetera; and the affluence throughout Asia; I think it bodes well for our growth <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Rob. And, last question maybe for you as well but just gotten a few questions from investors on the margins at the Four Seasons; obviously, there's some negative mix from all the junket initiatives. But, the question is, is this probably a reasonable run rate in the low 20%s just given where the junket business has stabilized? Or, is there anything else in that number that people should be aware of? That's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good question you asked; I'm glad you asked it. We &#x2013; the Four Seasons was &#x2013; had &#x2013; first of all, there's a non-gaming variable in there. The fourth quarter versus first quarter was down by $13 million as it relates to our retail operations. And, I can't &#x2013; I won't go into the detail why, but suffice it to say there's a $13-million quarter-on-quarter miss there. You should know that we are very pleased with what's happened to Four Seasons. Rolling volume is up four times from the first quarter of 2011 to first quarter of 2012 so we're thrilled about that.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we did experience a heavy concentration on our win-based versus volume-based commissions. It cost us about $10 million to $11 million in additional compensation. And that was a big bang to our numbers. Across the entire portfolio, to put your mind to rest, we ran about $800 million of wins. We were 11%-plus on the margin. We feel good about that. We still probably unperformed about a point. There's concern in the marketplace right now as it relates to our bonus program, and I think it's simple to say that over $800 million of gaming win of that segment, we did less than $3.2 million. So, it's $800 million versus $3.2 million out of these huge junkets that experience our bonus program.</p>
          <p>So, I think what you're seeing is I'm disappointed because we had a much better quarter at the Plaza. We got rich somewhat vis-&#xE0;-vis the win-based versus volume-based. We got hurt on the retail comparison and I think in normal operating we should have done &#x2013; we should have had normalized profit of roughly four times we did in the first quarter of 2011 and twice we did in the fourth quarter. So, I have a lot of confidence. I think what David has achieved over there &#x2013; David Sisk is extraordinary. Our growth, for the first time in the junket segment, exceeds the market across the board. I see even brighter days ahead for us in that segment as we get stronger in Cotai Central and we have no fears whatsoever that Plaza is on its way both in the mass, the retail, and especially in the junket segment to performing very, very strong.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to get into the &#x2013; put aside the retail list. Look, the retail value of our assets is still great that we could eliminate &#x2013; almost completely eliminate on a net &#x2013; if that were included as cash and we were able to monetize that, which we don't want to at this point, it would pay off all our debt. We would essentially be on a net cash basis including the monetization of retail, debt-free. I want to point out to you that the &#x2013; I don't understand; you take one of our four properties and to make a valuation. Well, that's liable to hurt. But, we can get down as steadily as estimating the impact of every hour's worth of activity. I want to find out that from first quarter of 2012 our gross gaming revenue went up 32%, our gross rolling revenue went up 40% and that was helped by a big jump in the Four Seasons, in the Plaza Casino. Our non-rolling table revenue went up 19%, and our slot revenue went up 21%. Those are the numbers. If you want to &#x2013; we think it would be an exaggeration to say that one of the properties didn't perform as good as somebody expected that everything is going to hell in a hand-basket; I would strongly suggest that that would be an overreaction and over-exaggeration to the reality. We've got a 14.2% quarter-to-quarter EBITDA and that's what really counts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, just to close the door on that; in the first quarter 2011, we rolled out 2.375. We should have made $8 million &#x2013; we did make $8 million on that. This year we rolled 10.7; we should have made $39 million normalized if you take out all variations. So, $30 million plus year-on-year growth in that segment profit-wise is &#x2013; from my way of thinking, is just great. And, I think we're going to be very strong in that segment.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Just one question for me; on the mass side of Macao, just &#x2013; the business is growing nicely there on a sequential and a year-over-year basis but still growing slightly slower than the overall market. Can you talk about what kind of steps you're taking to narrow....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now that's, this &#x2013; on a longer-term basis that's true, but on this quarter, we grew in excess of our fair share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. And just in terms of thinking about the steps you're going to take to continue to grow that business and when and how you see Cotai Central contributing to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this company, Mark, keep out of Cotai Central. That's for this next quarter. I think, Mark, we all know there's no confusion here that what this company has is probably the most dramatic opportunity in the history of gaming to be very, very strong in the mass segment. I think we all recognize the junket segment has ruled Macao, has been amazing, hard to believe the last seven, eight years the growth we have seen. I think the junkets are important, they mix everybody, but everyone can participate in that. I think what LVS has, we are working hard on is maximizing our huge table end lodging advantage we have over there because I think at the end of the day, it's about capacity to gamble, a place to sleep, a shopping opportunity and a place to eat. We have those in spades across the board.</p>
          <p>And I think that's our future. I'm back in Macao next month to meet with the team once again to review how we move forward in every one of our properties to get that 45% business. As nice as the junket business is, we're thrilled to be doing it, and it's a great business for us, we all know the opportunity. If we do our job and we get 1,000 plus mass tables to perform the upper reach of the market at a 45-point margin, I will make these numbers look small. So we're very focused on it, we get it, we see it, we are very uniquely advantaged at this point. I think the Cotai opportunity is amazing for us, and that's our focus, and that's where our energies will be.</p>

But as I've said earlier that the only thing they could do &#x2013; the only things they could do is that exactly which our own 100 or so field sales people can do. And as we understand it, they can't do any more than that. And if they cannot and if we're correct in interpreting the law, if they can't do any more than that, there's no reason for us to work with them &#x2013; to have them work for us.</p>

We're really proud of that team. Larry Chiu runs it. I think he's the best in the business. And I think our team is extraordinary also in Asia. Andrew and Mark and the team, Jeremy over in Singapore have examined and continue to look at all aspects of the junket situation over there and we'll see where it goes. Sheldon is obviously right at this point, we don't see enough importance to jump into that, but we'll look &#x2013; we'll keep looking at it and obviously we won't be disadvantaged if there's an opportunity there.</p>

I know we've talked a lot about Spain, but what about some of these more &#x2013; some of these markets in Asia? Where are we in the legislative process? If you could give us an update and also where are you in terms of your negotiations in both these countries? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very heavily petitioning, let's call it in U.S. terms, lobbying the government. They don't have lobbying firms over there in Asia. But we are asking the government and do what we can to contribute toward regulatory structure in terms of the drafters of the legislation. We're sticking our $0.02 in there. You probably have heard almost the same thing. We have &#x2013; I wouldn't want to get into anything you may not have heard because it'll give the roadmap to our competitors. So we're doing what it will take to get that. I can't tell you it's going to happen tomorrow. I can't tell you it'll happen this year.</p>
          <p>But the possibility, there are elections in Korea this year. There are elections in Japan this year. Those are the two primary properties we're still &#x2013; we're very heavily involved with Vietnam. We're looking at Taiwan although Taiwan has &#x2013; Taiwan has passed a law for any of the islands from the mainland of Taiwan to Kinmen and Matsu adjacent to the PRC. So they're talking &#x2013; I don't know if they have talked to the mainland there. So we're out there. We have resources that we're applying and are petitioning or lobbying process and it's very difficult to say when. It could happen this year, it couldn't happen till next year; maybe it'll happen not till the year after.</p>
          <p>But we're right on top of it on every single move. We're talking to the legislators. We're helping to contribute to the drafting of the legislation. We're touring a lot of people, a lot of government people that come from any of these countries. They've all heard about Singapore. They've been on to Singapore. We carry out a regular practice. It's a revolving door of government people that are coming to see how Singapore works and they want &#x2013; typically want to follow on that model.</p>

          <p>Hi. Just a couple questions, Sheldon, on Spain. Just to go back to it for a second because I still don't completely understand the idea of self-funding. And the reason I bring it up, Sheldon, is that originally Macao and Singapore in some ways was going to be self-funding and project finance and you're going to use the debt markets. And then, as you remember and we all remember, the debt markets closed down, and you had to put up your own capital. So don't we run that same risk with Spain so even though you're saying it's not truly a $35 billion investment, you still have to have a solid capital market and a solid debt market in order to be successful here?</p>
          <p>And then second, just on Spain, the core Asian player is such an important part of Macao, and Singapore obviously it's not going to be the same, it's there in the middle of Europe. So I want to understand that part of the strategy too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't understand...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, one final point, sorry Sheldon, one final point. With all of this capital and all of these opportunities ahead, what does that mean for dividends for 2012 and 2013, given some of the cash flow needs you have or should we expect continued dividend increases at a solid pace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not going to put a shovel in the ground without having the financing. There is no more taking equity and putting 100% equity. I attribute that to my former management who followed that practice. We will have financing before we put a shovel in the ground. And if the financing is not available, we're not putting the shovel in the ground. So if we have the financing, we'll finish the project. If we start it, we'll finish it. And if there's no financing available as things in the market change, then we'll simply delay that. It didn't go on for many years. It was a relatively short-term phenomenon where money wasn't available, but I've seen, in the last 20 years, money being and not being available almost on a revolving basis; certainly no more than annually or 12 to 15 month hiatus.</p>
          <p>So, we're not going to get into &#x2013; listen. It's like the expression: fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. We've already gotten caught in that mess, even though it wasn't my mess, but although once I was a CEO. It was our mess and we're not going to make &#x2013; we've learned from it. We're not going to make that same mistake again.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>What about dividends? Are we going to continue &#x2013; well, I've got to tell you, I do own a few shares in the company. One can easily assume that I'm all in favor of dividends, but I've also said to the Board, I recuse myself on voting on it. And if the Board voted for more dividends, it's not because they think I want it, it's because they think it's appropriate. If they voted for less, which I don't think will happen, we'll &#x2013; it's without my vote. I recuse myself, because I think I have a conflict here. Mike, do you want to answer that?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just want to answer Steve's question on the core Asian player that he talked about. We've talked about a lot of this. Basically our forecast, what we've looked at, is not counting on that core Asian player. As you recall, what Sheldon mentioned earlier in the day, that we &#x2013; we much forecast to 20% return cash-on-cash return for our investment. And those forecast, those run-ups that we've been doing, we have had limited situations involving core Asian players. However, we do have a distinct competitive advantage. We use a very significant Air Force to bring players around. You've seen major baccarat improvement here in Las Vegas. That's as a result of the Air Force that we have.</p>
          <p>There's nothing to say that we can't bring players to Spain as well. So &#x2013; and the initial forecasting of our revenue and our bottom line in Spain that we're working on now, subject to the government agreements we make, we have not counted on those Asian players, Steve. There are many Asian players in Europe, but perhaps not at the caliber of the high end that you see in Asia.</p>

          <p>We've done about a dozen or more studies about the market in Europe. And we probably have more studies and more validation of our vision than any other project ever. After all this will be one of the largest projects ever built. And I don't want to mention the number, because I'll be reading it in every journalist's article or every analyst's report. But we've done an awful lot of study on this. We feel quite confident. And the bottom line is no 20% cash-on-cash return, no project.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Good afternoon. I was just wondering if you could maybe help walk us through your table skew across Macao as Sands Cotai Central opens and where we should expect to see the biggest hit. And then, if someone could just quickly address maybe the Singapore VIP event calendar over the rest of this year; if there's anything notable you guys are doing in certain quarters that we should be aware of? That would be helpful. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Carlo, hi. It's Rob. On the first &#x2013; on the second question, that's easy enough. The Chinese New Year has come and gone, so that's our event calendar for the first quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>And obviously, there's holidays and there's F1 races and there's all the events that takes place throughout Singapore. But as far as a specific calendar, we do events there for our customers. But obviously, Chinese New Year is the &#x2013; by far the most important event of the calendar. There is F1. There is our events internally. But I don't think there's anything worth mentioning that's going to be that earth-shattering and that important to you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Rob, guys, I know you're not going to give any &#x2013; you don't want to talk about Sands Cotai Central, make sense, given that it's next quarter's data. But just wondering if you could tell us how many VIP rooms and tables are open at the property now? And then maybe give us a schedule for how they're opening across the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we're fully occupied in the month of May. We opened, all the rooms are committed to, Felicia. We had some issues with some of the physical issues in the rooms and the hotel getting it done in April. It's fully operational except for one junket, on the third week of May, the last junket rolls in there of, the 12 that'll be there. We expect a full hit in the month of May and we feel very, very good the <mark type="inaudible" /> of operators we've assembled there. Again, I think what that team has done is exemplary and our advantage on the VIP side is that we have so much capacity now in Cotai that people want to be in our buildings.</p>
          <p>We feel very confident that the product and the VIP business sells, we haven't had a change to see them but they're very impressive. And we've got the best and the brightest junket operators and they'll be fully occupied in the month of May.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we are. We'll start renovation shortly and I think you'll see a big change there. Obviously we're overdue and we've had to push back with some customers and operators about it. It's been a problem for us. I think there is a lot of upside. I'm pleased with our performance in the VIP tables on destination, but there's room to improve. I think the new tech &#x2013; the new &#x2013; I'm sorry, the new tables, the new rooms we are building at Venetian are very, very nice to look at, very pleasant, coupled with again our presence in Cotai in general gives the advantage of good performance at the Venetian as well, although <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>

And then can I just take another stab at this question, I just think it's important to ask so that everybody is just on the same page and we're not all guessing different numbers. If you could give us, either Rob or Ken, the EBITDA impact at &#x2013; from the holds at Marina Bay Sands, Las Vegas and then I guess it was slight in Macao?</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not me. It's actually your line. Okay so I understand the logic behind that but in other quarters you've given us the color so is this just that we're just looking at things differently now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're looking at it realistically. I'll tell you honestly, Felicia. I've been after my people for a couple of years that on a monthly basis I want the first 30 days of a 200 moving day average dropped off and the last 30 days added on. And I've been a proponent of a 200 day moving average for years but unfortunately not all the people in my company do exactly what I want them to do. So this time, and I'll make sure that I'll have it &#x2013; I'm going to have it from now on.</p>
          <p>I finally got the figure today and the figure for Macao and Singapore which constitutes almost 90% of our total business, it's 3.05%. That's the number and that's the 200 day moving average. So what can I do? If 2.85% is less than that or that's more than 2.85%, you think you want to adjust it because it's too high than the average total. You've got to &#x2013; you have to take into account the habits of the people that play. And the habits of the people that play in this industry can change the results of the law of averages. The law of averages is 2.85%, but I tell you I fail to be amazed at the fact that the game of blackjack when we have a 17% to 22% hold, say give or take 20%, here in the States in Las Vegas the Mecca of gaming, it's 36% over in Asia. Why is it 36%? Dramatically it's like 80%, whatever number higher than the law of averages calls for is because the people don't play on the rules that people play here. They play on the basis of luck. And people's behavior is &#x2013; that's an excellent classical example of how that can change returns.</p>
          <p>So if you take the law of averages return in Las Vegas and apply it to what you want &#x2013; you think the law of averages or the result should be in Asia, it is the risk that those numbers won't jump. I don't think it's a risk. I think it's assuring. So the 200 moving day average is going to give us a more authoritative and a more lengthy basis on which to make our own internal projections and to report whether we're above or below a milestone.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I know you commented on VIP business in Singapore, but I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on the mass business where it was a little bit more flat sequentially, and just &#x2013; is that seasonality or how you view the mass business and how you think that will grow sequentially from here? And I've got one or two other after that.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Sequentially, it was flat. Not sequentially. I mean, year-on-year the way reported the numbers, it was 22% year-on-year.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've talked about sequential the last two or three conference calls. And basically, you're dealing in a business that sequential comparisons are not relevant compared to year-over-year comparisons. Because as you see a product matures, if you look at Macao where it's getting more mature, you have to &#x2013; you can see where the annual comparisons year-over-year work.</p>
          <p>In Singapore, it's not mature enough to really understand the seasonality which we've talked about before. And I think honestly, you get into a little trouble when you look at sequential. And that happened looking at various rolled numbers, etcetera and so forth. Someone said previously that the first quarter and the third quarter tend to look like the stronger quarters. Right now, that's what they do. But, comparing it month-over-month is really not, days change, holidays change, things affect those particular situations. And the mass market is particularly sensitive to seasonality, particularly sensitive to various months. So...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Robin, before you leave the Singapore question, I can't help but think that we're two years in Singapore and forget sequential year-on-year, the fact is we have duopoly with all those people in Indonesia, Malaysia. It seems to me an awfully good bet that the market across the board, be it lodging, be it retail, be it gaming, be it high-end gaming, it's got to grow and so it keeps growing because as you saw Macao in the early days back in &#x2013; no one would have guessed back in 2003 and 2004 what's happened to mass or VIP. I think with anyplace in Asia you can get duopoly in a major city with an airport like that, it's an awfully good bet that we're sitting here down the road whether it's next quarter or next year, astounded by the growth in Singapore. I just think you have to give more respect to how good that market will be and can be.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rooms and the price we get the ADR in the rooms is clearly, unequivocally subject to seasonality. We can have trade shows and conventions going in the spring in the fall and not in the summer. The FIT leisure rate in the summer is totally different. The retail, with Christmas and other golden week spending periods in Asia is seasonal. The gaming is seasonal. We just happen to be in the seasonal business. We're I guess under the category of consumer discretionary, and unless somebody thinks we're under another category, and that is seasonal. Look if 40% or more of all the retail done in the United States between Thanksgiving &#x2013; the four weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas, I can't make any stronger case for seasonality than that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I was looking for factors outside the seasonality that you might address. But then the other question, just last one is on Spain and I wonder if you could just give us &#x2013; and this could be wide range or just kind of ballpark on what kind of revenue assumption you have for the market there that gets you to the 20% return.</p>

          <p>They're just all figures. We can't &#x2013; it's much too early to make that assumption, particularly to make it public. We've done most studies, about a dozen studies and we did feel confident that the amount of money that we need, the amount of business we need to get to the 20% cash-on-cash return and we will continue it. We just pull it back and say we're sorry, everybody, we wish that it was different. But we don't believe that that's in the cards. We believe that all the studies that we've done validate our vision.</p>

          <p>And there are no further questions in the queue. I will now turn the call over to senior management for any closing remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have any closing remarks except to say I'm looking at the chart that shows us two &#x2013; one out of two of 12,222 companies. That &#x2013; I look at the constant growth, I look at the 14.2% quarter-on-quarter EBITDA growth and frankly I don't understand &#x2013; I don't want to encourage analysts to overreach and to overpromise because that happened once before and we just barely made it. Everybody's projection &#x2013; so everybody make your own projections. We're going to keep doing what we're doing. I can't &#x2013; it's very difficult for me to give a lot of credibility to people who think that there is a plateau level and that it's predictable in Asia, just the nature of their culture that they have a greater propensity for play and to shop and to do other things than other cultures. This is a cultural sensitivity issue. And we live with that. And I see no reason for our 14.2% quarterly EBITDA growth to go backwards or to reduce.</p>
          <p>So that's my closing remark. I want to thank everybody for calling in. And we'll talk to you in 90 days. Thank you.</p>
