          <p>Good afternoon.  This is a Chorus Call conference operator.  Welcome and thank you for joining the UniCredit Group Second Quarter 2009 Results Conference Call.  As a reminder, all participants are in listen-only mode.  After the presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredit.  Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon or good morning to everybody, many thanks for being connected with us on the 4th of August.  We will start immediately the presentation of the second quarter results starting from page three of the presentation, the Executive Summary.  We had a net profit in the second quarter of 490 million with a very good operating profit, 3.9 billion, which is the highest number we have since second quarter '07.  The revenues are close to 7.8 billion, up 18.3% quarter-on-quarter, thanks to diversification, with net interest income up, net fees back to growth and 957 million of trading profits. I will provide later on the split of this number, which is partially coming really from MIB, partially from Central Eastern Europe and partially from the corporate sector.</p>
          <p>The cost income is down to 49.8%, and the loss absorption capacity, which is also the highest since we started to show the number is allowing us to post higher loan provision, while growing pre-tax profit quarter-on-quarter as well.</p>
          <p>The total trading assets continue their decrease, both net of hedging instruments and gross is down 1.5 and 12.4 respectively, mainly due to the de-leveraging strategy. The Core Tier I ratio is up to 6.85% with positive contribution from organic capital generation.  As I said, the operating profit allow us to absorb higher provisions.</p>
          <p>Moving to page four, we have the line-by-line profit and loss.  And as usual, we have the quarter-on-quarter change, the year-on-year change and year-on-year normalized, which means that cost on ForEx and <mark type="inaudible" />.  I would highlight mainly this number.  So, as we can see year-on-year the revenues are up by 6.6%, while operating costs are down by 5.8%, which I think is a very good result in line with what we promised to the market.</p>
          <p>So that the operating profit is up to 22.1%, which is the highest quarter since the second quarter '07, which you remember as being a real record.  Net write-downs are significantly up, 2.4 billion; we'll see later on numbers on that.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating items, 458 million of which 242 are integration costs.  These integration costs are related to severance payment and cost closing of foreign branches and other activities, the payback period is close to 15 months.  So you will see also later on what is the running rate of cost reduction we can have, thanks to this investment in reality.</p>
          <p>Income tax for the period is 363, a very high tax rate mainly in Italy and Germany, the net income is, before PPA, 554 and after PPA, &#x20AC;490 million.  As we said the cost income ratio is down 49.8%, which is also quite a good number.</p>
          <p>If we go to the usual chart showing numbers for commercial banking and MIB, page five. As you can see the operating profit is stable, is nicely growing.  If we wouldn't consider the one-off costs, operating profit would be up by 125 million quarter-on-quarter with a very good number and the cost income would be 50% &#x2013; 51.6% on a stated number. The one-off cost are mainly related to VAT for intra-group services, which has an impact on that the first &#x2013; on the second quarter plus MBO release of the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>MIB, the operating profit is up to 870 million with strong client-projected activities and also thanks to the market conditions, is also very important to stress the fact that we continue our de-leveraging and de-risking process as we promised again since July last year.</p>
          <p>Page six, the breakdown of the different elements of the revenue line. Interest margin is still growing both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year, quite good. The fact that finally we have reversed the trend in the fees area where six quarters we were going down in terms of net commissions due to some market conditions, now we are again up by 2.3%, is a small amount but is a first signal of a change of the trend.  And the interest margin &#x2013; sorry, the trading income, as we've said, is quite significant, &#x20AC;957 million.  Of which, is important to say, more or less 200 million are related; it is the last line of the second bullet point, related to buyback of our own Tier I instruments plus the option we had on the disposal of our own shares.  So, out of 957, 200 are more or less related to sales.</p>
          <p>A detail on the net interest income, which is up both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year. As you can see, quarter-on-quarter, the commercial banking and corporate center is up by 214 million. MIB is down by 150 million due to the lowering of volumes on one side and also the lower trading related interest. You remember in the last quarter we were talking of that very transparently, so the numbers on the commercial banking and corporate center are positive. There is 91 million of an accounting adjustment, which is on the corporate center side.</p>
          <p>The volumes, as you can see, are quite positive on the deposit side and are positive as well on the long side in the sense that we are going down mainly reducing non-core portfolios in order to continue our de-leveraging process.  The loan to deposit ratio, if we consider the total securities in issuance is at 99, below 99, which is again quite a good number.  This number is comparable with what is provided by our competitors.</p>
          <p>Moving to page eight, commissions. We have a growth both in the commission coming from investment services, 1.9% growth mainly from mutual funds, which are up by 2.8% quarter-on-quarter and also the other net commissions are up by 2.6%, mainly thanks to current accounts, loan and payment services more than offsetting lower ForEx fees.</p>
          <p>Page nine, this is one of the most relevant numbers because we have a significant reduction both in western countries and in CEE. As usual we consider the normalized numbers, we are down in western countries year-on-year by 6.7%.  We are down as well in Central Eastern Europe by 2%, despite of inflation rate which is there and despite of the fact that in any case we have opened new branches is the tail of the last &#x2013; of the old project, you know that we were obliged to respect the contracts we had signed. Despite of that the costs are down by 2% as well in Central Eastern Europe.  So, that the year-on-year cost reduction is 5.8% at the Group level normalized number, which is quite good. Actually it is even higher in fact &#x2013; again there is a very significant impact of the ForEx exchange ratio, which makes the number non-comparable.</p>
          <p>Also page 10 is very relevant to see that quarter-on-quarter we are down in terms of costs, if you don't consider the one-off, because we are down by 56 million in a significant portion by structural items.  Structural items if you remember these costs reduction will last also in the future.  So, that the jaws in terms of revenues and costs is higher than in the past, creating a stable value for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Page 11, staff rightsizing is ongoing. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced the total number of employees by 6,500 -- 2,700 on the second quarter, which is also a very significant number.  As you can see, 3,000 is the reduction in Central Eastern Europe, other 2,700 is the reduction in the rest of the Group and with a good contribution coming from all the different entities. Retail clearly is the main contributor, thanks to the Capitalia deal, we are capable to achieve significant synergies; we have done more than what we have planned at the time of the acquisition. MIB and asset management are reducing in line with the market condition and we are streamlining continuously the corporate center and the service center.  The bottom of the page is very important because as you can &#x2013; in the first half, we had integration costs of 264 million <mark type="inaudible" />.  This cost reduction will bring us a reduction of the cost base by 190 million.  So in reality the NPV of this type of investment is incredibly high, because if you don't include the discount of 190 for <mark type="inaudible" /> number.</p>
          <p>Page 12, we have the contribution and the change quarter-on-quarter of all the different division. If we don't consider the one-off costs, commercial banking would be up in terms of operating profit by 6%.  Asset management is clearly affected by the lowering of the <mark type="inaudible" />. MIB it is non-comparable since it is back at level of horizontals, which is quite significant.</p>
          <p>Now, we have the less exciting side of the presentation, write down of loans. Clearly this is an area of incredible focus for all of us which is in line unfortunately with the economic cycle -- clearly we had a conservative stance on provisioning so that we have the level that you can see.  I think it's important to say that retail is slightly growing in terms of cost of risk than our 35 million which are related to the disposal of the branches we made last year.  And we have had to pay back in this year after the due diligence and the actual situation organized by the buyers in corporate and MIB there is a significant contribution of single names which are bringing this profitability up to 153 basis points for corporate and 262 for MIB.</p>
          <p>In MIB we have also to consider the fact that the MIB stock <mark type="inaudible" /> in loan receivables so we have provisions related to the downgrading of some of the assets we have.  But on the contrary we had a significant higher value when we consider the model value vis-&#xE0;-vis the book value.  So, and this is implied also in this 262 basis points.</p>
          <p>If you go page 14, you can see that clearly in this context of macro environment deterioration, all the division are suffering although in the second half of the year the pace of the deterioration should slow because again with the model we are anticipating the cycle. The loan loss provision for the first half are higher than the annual run rate, however the increase in the second quarter is caused mainly by single name contribution, coupled with a conservative provisioning approach and a material component of the provisioning which is driven by model and already captures, as I said before, the weak macroeconomic scenario.</p>
          <p>Clearly both in corporate and retail we have taken a series of actions in order to reduce the run rate of provisioning, which on corporate maybe related to specific underwriting criteria by industry, which has been changed many times during the year; cautious management of position towards the specific customers in industries involved in the economic crisis.  We have reinforced the collateralization in mid and lower-rated segments. And we have approaching with a pre-restructuring activity as the clients provide future potential defaults.  A similar process has been organized in retail with two key projects, ARCA and LAPIS respectively for households and for small business as well as a soft-collection structure, which is working, not only in retail but as well in Central Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>If you go to page 15, you can see that the major growth in the other gross impaired loans, which are continuously growing, we are reclassifying in a very conservative way all the <mark type="inaudible" />.  There is a single <mark type="inaudible" />, which is reclassified and restructured on which the collateral is higher, the actual exposure for this. So we don't pay any provision but has been reclassified. So these are also the reason why we have such a change in gross impaired loans and also slightly, a slight lowering in the coverage ratio of other impaired loans.</p>
          <p>As you can see the coverage ratio in NPLs is almost stable &#x2013; is likely higher than what we had at the year-end.  While there is a small reduction as well in other internals due to this effect of restructuring. The cost of risk on the first half is 136, very strong as I said before we don't consider the second quarter as <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Moving to page 17, the loss absorption capacity is a concept, which is I think well known.  Is the highest number we had in previous &#x2013; previous number we had shown to you is important to stress the concept that the trading income of Western Europe are not considered in the gross operating profit and consequently in the loss absorption capacity, so is relatively conservative as a number.  If we would add the trading profit in Western Europe, the overall Group loss absorption capacity would go up from 200 basis points to 276 basis points.</p>
          <p>Page 18, non-operating items. I have already said something on restructuring cost, the 242 are related to severance cost and closing of branches.  As I said before, if we examine this number plus what we had in the first quarter we go to 264 million and the savings &#x2013; the run rate savings is 190 million.</p>
          <p>I'd like also to highlight for a second the fact that the net income from investments is negative and would be slightly more negative considering the tax effect because there are no taxes on disposal while there are the savings on the minus, so that in reality this impact to 490, the net profit would be 550 million. Also the tax rate is relatively high, mainly due to the IRAP effect in Italy.  The IRAP as you know is a non variable tax and as well too a relatively high tax rate in Germany, which is due to the fact that foreign branches had a significant negative impact on the tax situation.</p>
          <p>If you go to page 19 is also quite important. We continue to de-leverage and de-risk the balance sheet. We are down to &#x20AC;983 billion in terms of total assets.  And there has been a significant reduction both in the assets, excluding hedging instruments and also in the hedging instruments.  So that the tangible assets and tangible equity, and tangible equity without all the intangibles not only the goodwill, is down to 27.3, the previous number was slightly more than 29.  So we continue to go down very significantly. So we think that is an important number.  The net interbank position is down by 39% quarter-on-quarter.</p>
          <p>In the following page, you have the breakdown of the reduction so I don't think is relevant, I would prefer to go to page 21 where we have the capital base.  The capital base, the Core Tier I is up 6.85%, Tier I also at 7.66 and the total capital ratio is 11.33.  This growth that you will see in the following page is also due to the fact that risk-weighted assets are going down by 3.5%.  We continue to optimize our structure in terms of deferred assets adding quite good results.</p>
          <p>If you go to page 22, I think is also important because we have a very good organic capital generation, 29 basis point partially reduced offset by non-recurring effects of 13 basis point which is available-for-sale reserve, the negative forex effect on risk-weighted asset and some technical and accounting adjustment.</p>
          <p>So, today, we are pretty close to the 7% level clearly 15 basis point is relevant but there has been a good improvement.  But also what is quite important that the 29 basis points of organic capital generation.</p>
          <p>So, I would stop here and with the colleagues, we are ready to answer to all your questions.  Just for you to know there are clearly the CFO and the CRO with me, Marina Natale and Karl Guha plus the three colleagues of the three strategic business areas Roberto Nicastro, Sergio Ermotti and Paolo Fiorentino.  All of us we're ready to answer towards your question.  There is also the Chief Accountant in the case of very technical questions.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, this is the Chorus Call conference operator.  We will now begin the question and answer session.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>Our first question is from Marcello Zanardo of KBW.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to all of you.  It's good to see some good numbers despite the provisions increases.  The first question is on the margin environment. Clearly we've seen no credit growth, so all your net interest income development, which is actually positive Q2 and Q1 is coming from, mainly from margins.  Could you give us an idea in Italy, Germany and especially in CE we saw the numbers the other day which actually show some solid numbers also in the CE.  What you have been doing on the repricing side, the first thing?  Second, especially in Italy, what is going to happen on the deposit spread compression, because I think in the last call, we were expecting, at least I was expecting the net interest income to bottom down &#x2013; to be the lowest in second quarter, actually it's getting better.</p>
          <p>And also the MIB contribution, the net interest income is still quite high despite the crisis.  So, really to give us an outlook on the margin and what you have been doing?  And the second question on the net interest income just to clarify on page seven, the positive items in the corporate center how much it is and if there going to be any other in the second quarter.  So, that's the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second one you commented on the provision, clearly a very big rise here.  It is at least good to see, if I understood correctly, that some of this relate or most of it relate, I don't know to specific positions in the corporate and in the MIB. I don't know, which level of disclosure you can give here, but if you could quantify at least the amount if not the name on the corporate MIB, I think the market will be happy because at least we see a significant rise in provision, but rather than being widespread, actually we see some stabilization in the retail space of deterioration.  We actually see that most of this relate to specific position here.</p>
          <p>And finally also on the provision line, in Central and Eastern Europe, I saw that your provision indeed have increased, but because we haven't got the number from this loan breakdown if you could give us an update especially in the riskier countries, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Hungary if you want. We saw the Polish result this morning, which were very good and low provisions there.  But what the situation is there on the non-performing loan side consider I haven't got this breakdown?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, before leaving the floor to my colleagues, we have to consider in the third quarter on the net interest margin, we will have the overdraft commissioning factor, because as you know before we're -- account has the net interest income. Now, with the new structure we will lose this portion on the net interest income and then Roberto and Sergio can provide some major detail on that.  And we will be partially recovered with the commitment fees that we will see on the fees side.</p>
          <p>Then, the LIBOR is still going slightly down.  So we have still some compression on the deposit side, because we have seen that, I think that today we are at, on the three months, 77 basis point, so which is even lower than what we had at the quarter end.  So in reality we are still seeing some compression in the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>On the other side we have some improvement on the deposit side in terms of volume, so which is an important element.  On &#x2013; Roberto if you want to get in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on the retail corner, yes I can confirm that in the past we were expecting quarter two to be the bottom for net interest margin retail.  In reality this doesn't hold true anymore, because on one side we have in Q2 a positive impact of a one-off item close to &#x20AC;100 million coming from the late hedging of the former Capitalia fixed rate mortgage that clearly is enriching the Q2 net interest margin a one-off that we are not going to add in the next quarter.  On the opposite side we have instead moving forward two negative factors influencing the future net interest margin dynamics. As Alessandro was pointing out, we have the passing of the new commission, you must not compare to law that we'll attain revenues by approximately, in retail &#x20AC;50 million at a quarter and we'll have also the impact that this 50 million kroner will be actually minus 90 or 80, 90 more or less of net interest income plus 40, 50 of fees.  And also the actual levels of Euribor have further decreased from the averages of Q2. So these results make me believe that next quarter will be weaker in terms of retail net interest margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In respect of the MIB loan loss provision, approximately a third is coming &#x2013; for the first half is coming from market related activities, so, ABS portfolio or any security that's been reclassified into loan and receivables, while two-thirds is coming from the financing side and here the big chunk is coming from the LBO portfolio and also some major names in the multi-national portfolio in corporate. So, maybe German names. So, and the total amount is around 405 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Central Eastern Europe, if you go to page 33, there is a detail of the cost of risk and there is also the weight on the Group. So you have almost all the numbers you were asking for, Marcello.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I was just &#x2013; thanks for that. I was just, I don't want you to go through each single country, mainly on the non-performing loan ratio, which I don't have or I can't calculate from this, but on -- per main country, but we can look at it later.</p>
          <p>Just on provision to conclude, sorry, your question to you, my final question.  Each quarter you've been giving guidance, clearly this crisis is evolving in very severe ways and we don't know, but I guess your last guidance of 115 to 125 bps, although you said that Q2 is clearly not the run rate, because you've some one-off provision, this probably no longer valid unless I am mistaken, am I wrong do you think or just...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have to discuss if you're considering the loan at the beginning of the year or at the end of the year now because since we're going down in terms of loan portfolio, the denominator is changing in the meanwhile. So, clearly it is quite important to look at what we had at the beginning of the year, because this is always relevant. All right, so the environment is quite challenging.  We said that we do see a run rate which is below what has been in the second quarter. We are working heavily on that. So we continue to &#x2013; being in totally committed in reducing as much as we can the number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Francesca Tondi of JPMorgan.  Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, good set of numbers, I think that's going to help a lot. Few more questions, however. Just continuing on what Marcello was discussing on asset quality. You can imagine that this is going to be again an area of focus. More generally, what is going on in German Corporate, I know you've said there's some large names, but can you give us a feel for really what is happening, what's &#x2013; what is going on. Are there finance and structure and transactions specifics that actually are being hanging on there and are now going badly or are we actually seeing a more general wave of the direction in the German Corporate and why should this not continue? Why should it get any better in the following quarters?</p>
          <p>In MIB you've given an indication of how you break down provisions for the half, but what I'm interested really is, there is a significant change from what you provided in Q1 going in Q2.  What is actually explaining the change? Is it more larger provisions on corporate or is it more ABS markdowns? And by the way on &#x2013; while we're on that subject, have you reclassified anymore assets or financial transactions into loans in this quarter at all?</p>
          <p>If possible, I wanted to also understand a little bit better the central financing costs, your cost of net interest income, which is a negative charge normally in Corporate Center, it's actually going down to almost zero. Should we take that actually your financing costs are improving across the board? Should we understand that or simply is it a reflection of reducing internet banking exposure? If you can tell us a little bit more how financing, liquidity how it's all moving?</p>
          <p>Your capital &#x2013; you've given out the breakdown of the increase and improvement, I seem to capture at the beginning of the presentation and some of the capital gains in Corporate Center are due to sale of treasury shares, presumably that has a positive impact on your capital? Could you tell us more or less how much that is?</p>
          <p>And on a broader issue, you're generating more capital, results are getting better, asset quality is deteriorating, but actually it looks as if you're generating enough and more earnings to take care of that. Do you still see the need of issuing government bonds at this point? What are your thoughts there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sergio will start to answer on German loan loss provision and corporate sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in general the dynamics for loan loss provision are quite different.  When I look at Germany and Austria, they tend to be very concentrated in big names or tickets where we're taking a fairly conservative view. Slide, for example in Italy, the first 10 position would account for around 20% of the entire loan loss provision. So you'd clearly see the effect of the macroeconomic environment driving the probability of defaults for our loan loss provision.</p>
          <p>In general, as I said, we don't have major items affecting the P&amp;L. When I do get the reclassification impact on loan loss provision, there are around 65 million accounted on the market segments and the rest is as I said before, is spread all over the portfolio. We've not reclassified any assets in the second quarter and in any case, the net P&amp;L effect, if we would have not reclassified the asset, would have been positive in the second quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You asked about the infringement of net interest at the level of the Corporate Center level and there have been several elements. One is account for 180 million for adjustment related to '02, some position, derivative position and ECBA repo while we have a lower cost of participation financing, which amounts for 63 million, which is due for sure to the kind of the current interest rate market.</p>
          <p>I think that the 97 &#x2013; there is also to be considering 97 million lower in term of cost on funding related to the interest company funding with the other division i.e. overall the market has improved and also their wholesale activity has shown significant improvement in the last days and the recent issuing of our covered bonds has contributed to the overall result.</p>
          <p>I think that there was another question about the impact of our own shares on our capital. It was an option, so it didn't contribute to our capital ratio and <mark type="inaudible" /> for example about the government bond.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I've a couple of questions. The first one is on the net interest income going forward, if I can just summarize the elements that you gave us, so the target in the third quarter there would be negative effect of 91 million because there was a positive one-off accounting &#x2013; one-off in the second quarter, 100 million of lower net interest income in the retail sector because of the hedging gain that you had and also 50 million of negative impact because of Commissione di Massimo Scoperto.  I'm right in this summary of the effect in the third quarter?</p>
          <p>And the second question is more generic; on the third quarter in terms of fees, lease conversion or lease propensity of the clients if you're seeing, let's say, some improvement already in the third quarter in spite of the fact that it is seasonally a low activity quarter?</p>
          <p>And the final, just an indication if you believe that we can say that in 2010 the peak of loan loss provisions can be seen in 2009 rather than in 2010? Just I mean your sensation; obviously it's impossible to say what the economies are going to do in 2010. Just a sensation; if you believe that the peak can be this year in terms of loan loss provisions?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So clearly you're &#x2013; I'd say more or less right when you consider the data of net interest margin due to many different elements.  Clearly a portion of that could be recovered in the fees side.  So as we already said, the overdraft could be partially offset by the commitment fees which are in reality quite important in terms of services we are providing to our customers.  You have to consider the flexibility of the current account is something which is existing on -- when we're talking of lease service in reality is a very high valued added service because we have two, three <mark type="inaudible" /> in order to manage potentially the drawdown for the committed lines on the current account we have. So it's very important.</p>
          <p>So we do expect that there will be a lowering of interest margin coming from all these factors.  And so we are considering other 50 million more or less on top of what you have listed there but again then we have to see how everybody is moving. So there are many elements which are consequently changing.</p>
          <p>Clearly the overdraft will have this impact that &#x2013; of movement from one line to the other.  Having said so, on provisions for 2009 is a peak. Clearly it's also very related to the real economy, how the real economy will evolve. And today we are seeing some small signal of improvement but it's not yet the trend.  So it is very difficult to foresee.  What I think is important is the fact that 2010, we do expect it to be better in terms of net interest margin and in terms of fees, so the revenues will be better.  The structural cost reduction we are achieving will remain. So at the end, we consider that the bottom line could be better.  But now we'll go through the budgeting process during the fall season, and as usual we could be more precise when we'll go through the process.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll talk of the third quarter when the third quarter will be finished as usual. As you know we're &#x2013; all of us we're focused on delivering results.  As Roberto has shown, and I think that there is quite &#x2013; some quite interesting page in the retail presentation in the annex. I'll tell you which page -- page 29. I think it's very interesting because it gives you an idea of the probability of the network where the delta of the old Capitalia branches vis-&#xE0;-vis the old <mark type="inaudible" /> branches is still significant, is narrowing but the potential we have and the portion of this de-cap  is also due to that, and it is quite significant.  So clearly we continue to improve the sales capability.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone.  A few questions also from my side.  First just to clarify on the Corporate Center. Is there any sort of formal guidance or rough guidance you could give us on the net interest income run rate excluding the one-off for this quarter because there was quite a few moving parts?</p>
          <p>The second; you've quite a bit reduced your trading assets. What was the negative impact on revenues from doing that? It would be of interest since other banks go rather the other way.  And On the corporate clients, I've seen that you have clearly reduced your loan book there.  And I just wanted to ask you, what do you see on the ground? Is it like clients that have less of a loan demand or do you see a shift from corporate clients just to go to the bond markets and basically rather issue a bond than take out a loan like in the past?</p>
          <p>And last two questions, one is the Basel II impact. How much of impact from pro-cyclicality have you seen so far this year and what are the expectations looking forward?  And lastly on the LBO book, I mean we've seen a huge improvement in the pricing of leverage loans in the secondary market. And on the one hand one would expect that probably provision expectations will come down.  But secondly, I want to ask whether you will use this as a window to potentially sell off some of these more risky assets?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To clarify, in the line of the net interest income as you have seen in the presentation, 91 million which are of an exceptional item as we stated before.  And the trading income level, you &#x2013; at the Corporate Center, we had some extraordinary events, the buyback and the unwinding of call options. So they both amount approximately to 200 million.  These are the extraordinary events and this is what cannot be repeated in the third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the trading assets side, as you know, is giving you a precise answer is very difficult. For sure we had an opportunity cost. Already in the first quarter we had also opportunity costs, but I don't think this is the way we're focusing right now. I think that we are basically looking at make our revenues on market-related activities including the net interest income line stable over the quarters rather than looking back into what has been the opportunity cost. So, we feel comfortable with  these positions.</p>
          <p>In respect of the LBO book, as you know, first of all we have been looking at this category from a loan and receivable standpoint of view. We are taking, where necessary, provisions against the books.  The secondary market may be an opportunity for us if we don't feel comfortable any longer about the ability of the underlying company to fulfill their obligations but in that respect that portfolio is not subject, other than a couple of positions where we had &#x2013; we have been left with more exposure than we wanted due to the deterioration of the market in the second half of 2007. I don't think we would go through a massive reduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the loan book, the reduction is really spread there but mainly is coming from non-core markets. So we had a significant reduction on foreign branches and in some exposure of low ADA generating customers. And also what is quite significant that the reduction which is on the core market is mainly on the highest ratings, so from a four to the highest one.  So we have &#x2013; so we are in the IT reducing properly the loan portfolio.  On &#x2013; in terms of <mark type="inaudible" />, the impact is really not that significant so far, also thanks to the fact that in the meanwhile we are improving the way we manage Basel II.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have, just as a follow-up, any guidance as to how much of a potential impact we could expect over the next 12 months from Basel II?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Clearly this depends quite a lot on the real economy because as we said &#x2013; but the numbers today we are considering in terms of potential deterioration are offset by optimization of the use of Basel II.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Arturo De Frias of Evolution.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi good afternoon.  I would like to ask also &#x2013; again I am sorry but I would like to ask about capital and about credit quality.  Credit quality &#x2013; I am not surprised by the speed of the increase. I know you have mentioned a couple of one-offs.  I'm rather surprised by the increase in gross non-performing loans.  The sequential increase, the quarter-on-quarter increase, is more than 10%. Of course, it's always dangerous to extrapolate these trends but 10% sequentially would lead to a very, very substantial increase year-on-year.</p>
          <p>And I would like to know your feelings in terms of &#x2013; or your impression in terms of what kind of increase in NPLs are we going to see in coming quarters?  Also continuing with some &#x2013; with credit quality, you say that the coverage ratios are pretty much stable. They are but they fall a bit; they fall 1 point especially on the non-performing loan side.  Is this because of this sudden increase in NPLs? And if we continue to see similar increases in NPLs going forward, do we let the coverage decrease slightly more or you think you have to increase it going forward?</p>
          <p>Finally, just on NPLs and then on capital.  Finally on NPLs just to clarify some guidance that I think Sergio Ermotti gave a few minutes ago.  In MIB where the loan loss ratio increases very substantially -- more than in any other division including Eastern Europe, I think you said that around two-thirds of the loan loss ratio could be underlying and around one-third could be driven by all the credit exposure like maybe I don't know LBO or other reclassified assets. If that's the case, am I doing &#x2013; am I looking at this right assuming that the underlying loan loss ratio in MIB is now in the region of 160 basis points, which in any case would be a very high level?</p>
          <p>Finally sorry, one additional small question on detail, on another &#x2013; we talk about the reclassified assets.  You reclassified I think it was 27 billion of assets with around 2.4 billion of underlying losses. How much of this 2.4 billion of underlying losses is coming through P&amp;L in this quarter?  How much you think it will come in through in coming quarters?</p>
          <p>And then on capital, just one short question, if I look at other banks that have &#x2013; in Europe, that have very comparable business models to you, I think in international diversified banks like HSBC or like Standard Chartered or like Santander; they all have substantially high capital ratios than you have.  HSBC now has an 8.8% Core Tier 1.  Standard Chartered just today is announcing a 1 billion book building to get to an 8.4% Core Tier 1, Santander has a 7.5% Core Tier 1.  So, the average of these three not to take the highest, the average of these three is around seven point or 8%, 7.9 or 8% and this is more than 100 basis points of what where you are.  You have 6.8% now.  Of course it is much better than what it has been in the past quarters.  So, there is a good trend there.  But I would still imagine or I would still have the impression that looking at your most comparable competition, you're still around 150 basis points short of capital, would you agree with that or not?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So starting from credit quality and the different clients, as you have seen that we had a significant growth mainly in the other impaired loans, which were &#x2013; restructuring is quite relevant.  In restructuring, we are also strict in terms of reclassification there, because for instance we have reclassified the single position with an exposure of <mark type="inaudible" /> collateral the value of net exposure.  So liquid collateral there, but there has been no restructure, so it's classified, we don't have any provision on that clearly.</p>
          <p>So this is the process.  In terms of pace, now we have to see how the real economy will evolve, but we have seen some slowing down in terms of pace of deterioration as I said before mainly in retail, which is Central Eastern Europe as well.</p>
          <p>Corporate is different then Sergio will comment the MIB loan loss provisions, but as I said or was saying before in MIB out of the total provision we had in the first half one-third is coming from the ABS portfolio and so the reclassified portfolio, where the provision are related to the rating of single assets.</p>
          <p>As I said before, for instance in the ABS portfolio today the model value is significantly higher than our book value.  So, we have to consider that.  This also brings me to your question on reclassified assets; there are no losses that are coming to the profit and loss from the reclassified assets.  There are only the impairments there, which we have seen in the provisions, nothing more.  The pool to par is going to the interest margin in MIB or in the holding company, but mainly in MIB because clearly the pool to par is going to the net interest margin.</p>
          <p>But the Delta is mainly due to the fact that of the issues not of risk issues.  And on capital, I've answered when I was talking with Francesca first of all I think it's important to consider also all the accounting topic because as you know for instance in UK you don't deduct the available-for-sales reserve.  So, if you would deduct the available-for-sales reserve for HSBC, they are not so different from us in terms of Core Tier 1.  But, even so the accounting standard are quite relevant because unless you can compare different numbers, but having said so, as I was saying before or answering to Francesca Tondi, we are considering in our numbers the 12 billion of the government bonds.  And I think this answer to your question.  And talking of MIB and our loss provision I leave the floor to Sergio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess, Alessandro you already answered. I guess what I said is that one-third of the loan loss provisions are due to the reclassified assets, two-third are due to a combination of LBO book plus a large ticket, multinationals, Germany. And maybe also to complement Mr. Profumo's answer on the reclassified assets if he would not have reclassified the second quarter would have been a positive contribution to revenues.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So thank you.  Thank you very much.  Just as more of follow-up on that one particularly talking about the government bonds, I was reading, I don't pretend to be an expert and sometimes these things are very complex.  But I was reading what some of the rating agencies have said about the Tremonti bonds and I remember for example having read Moody's that they say that they only assign a limited equity component to these Tremonti bonds because they are not mandatory convertible, they are only convertible at your decision, and there is a very high step up.</p>
          <p>So I &#x2013; do you really feel 100% comfortable plugging the potential capital shortage with these instruments which are not real equity.  I mean they can be something that is I think your main competitor called it a useful insurance, but it's not real equity.  So to what extent it's reasonable to plugging the potential deficit with these kinds of instruments?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>First of all, we have to consider the fact that the target capital for Q1 is in the range between seven and 7.5 and today we're at 6.85.  Having said so, when we are considering them assets, you are right that the rating agencies have not considered 100% of the Tremonti bond, but the Tremonti bond can be converted on our request, if we want.  So, clearly do have a cost for our shareholders because in terms of cash, earnings per share, they do have an impact. So they are &#x2013; they do feel this is the reason why I was answering as I answer to Francesca in terms of shareholders' interest.  So, you have to consider the cost of them.  We went through two different stress test and we feel that also in a stress test scenario with the actual capital base, we can go through.  So again, then we can discuss on when, how, and at which time you have to be at the target in terms of Core Tier 1.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  I have two questions, if I may.  One is on the risk weighted asset reduction and the deleveraging surprisingly, extremely strong again in Q2.  Do you think there is still room for the group to further reduce risk weighted asset going forward and continues trend and if yes, in which areas you think you can do better with regards to risk weighted asset reduction?  Also on these, in case that happens because so far it happened without major pain for the P&amp;L.  Do you think this could continue or going forward, we should expect some more pain on the P&amp;L wise?</p>
          <p>And the last point is more in general a bit more long-term question on Germany. It's still a big part of the Group if accounts were considering investment banking and the retailing corporate division is one-fourth of your risk weighted assets.  Do you think there is a risk in Germany that with the local banks focusing more on the internal market profitability of banks can be penalized in the long-term, if that is a risk, what do you think can be the strategy of UniCredit going forward and the commitment to the country?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of risk weighted asset reduction, clearly at the beginning you do the easiest path.  We think that we have still room for optimization and the assumption, which will be ongoing. I'll give you an example, using leasing instead of mortgage; you're going to have a significant capital benefit.  The problem is that you can do that on new deal not on the existing one, so, we'll continue to work on that.  And we think that we have still some room for further improvement in terms of the risk weighted asset.</p>
          <p>On Germany, the commitment to the country is strong, because first of all, the corporate business is &#x2013; remains profitable.  We don't have to be confused by the actual cost of risk, because on average, it's a business which is more profitable than what we're seeing in Italy, the corporate sector.  Retail in affluent and in affluent is quite profitable in small business, could be profitable if we are focused in areas where we are &#x2013; you are stronger.</p>
          <p>And on the top of that, we think that what will happen within the market to the Handelsbanken on one side and actually to Danish Bank today are under pressure will improve the profitability of the sector.  So overall we remain quite positive on the accounting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes good afternoon.  Actually, I have more than three questions, but I will try to be very quick.  On net interest income Mr. Nicastro before mentioned the effect of the switch, I mean the overdraft from NII to net fees and he quantified in 90 million euro, less NII. I mean I would like to understand if this includes also the effect at corporate division level.</p>
          <p>The second question is on trading, because we have seen huge numbers also from the other European banks in this quarter.  I mean we are at the beginning of August, but maybe you can give us some visibility on the third quarter and maybe let us understand how this will evolve going forward, just a clarification on capital because I see the Core Tier 1 down quarter-on-quarter maybe it's because of the FX &#x2013; sorry, AFS reserve.</p>
          <p>And other question on Italy, specifically on Italy, because so far you have commented on credit quality division-by-division, I want to focus a little bit more on Italy.  We have seen the bottom in the industrial production actually in April and GDP as well.  And I would like to understand if you see going forward at normalization also of non-performing loans in Italy only.</p>
          <p>And another question on Italy again in retail, the line of personnel, actually this is up quarter-on-quarter, I would have expected the bulk of the cost-cutting here considering that you're cutting people at Capitalia.  So, I would like to understand how this is going to evolve going forward and whether you see significant here cost synergies in this line?  Thank you.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> for our corporate has been in the second quarter around 10 million negative impact.  I think if I look into the second half of the year, the net impact will be around 30 million and net negative impact around 30 million also with the movement from NII of around 130 million to around 100 million into commissions and fees.  So, that is factored in fact on the second half of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Staff costs are actually going down second quarter or first quarter for retail. One aspect that you have to keep in mind is that you have the release of the MBO of a provision that was 30 million in Q1 and 50 million in Q2. So these two aspect some years ago were relieved in Q2 compared to Q1. Two aspect that you have to consider as kind of one-offs in a way moving forward for the rest of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody, I have just a couple of questions. The first one is on loan-loss provisions. I am, just wanted to be sure if among two billion and 2.4 billion as you reported in Q2 is there anything that you would qualify as one-off? It's not clear to me what is your guidance here? And the second question is just to get back to the previous question from a colleague of mine who was asking why the Core Tier I in absolute terms is down quarter-on-quarter Q2 and Q1 the results 400 million, 500, 400 &#x2013; 500 million difference, if you can just explain what is the difference here? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your first question in terms of the quantum of one-off, if you look into the corporate &#x2013; the CIB part, 80% of the actual overall provision is named specific. And I would say at least by definition that is not recurring. But if you take a significantly lower part of it, it will be about a third of that that would be &#x2013; that we would say is non-recurring.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A third about 2.4...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you look into the, of the 2.4, if you look into the overall provision numbers the &#x2013; what is coming out of the &#x2013; if you look at the decomposition of that, the overall contribution from the corporate side in that is about a billion roughly. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The way that works is part of it is model driven by either there are generic provisions that are undertaken and then there is &#x2013; the remainder, about 80% of that, which is name specific. Of the name specific components, you're not going to repeat on that but effectively that part of it is what we would call specific as opposed to one-offs. Yeah?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. My question is on the trading line the strongest that you ever recorded. If you can give us again the &#x2013; an idea what is a recurring tier and what is one-off, particularly if you can quantify the impact from the buyback of Tier 1. I think maybe you said that it was 200 million but also it would be interesting to know about the hard caps in your structured credit portfolio. And how do you see the situation evolving in Q3? From the MIB slide, I see that the revenues from structured credit amount to 543 million &#x2013; is this all related to, is it all booked under trading? And again on also this line if you can give us any idea of what we should expect for Q3? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the trading profit, the buyback of our own bond is more or less 140 million and the average swap on our own shares is more or less 50 million.  So as I was saying we had 190. Then we have in MIB more or less 390 million, 400 million, in Central Eastern Europe 250, you have to consider that the 250 are due to the fact that the loan in ForEx are hedged. So when there is a devaluation of the currency, you have a gain on the trading side -- if the currency is stable, you have net interest margin. So it's something, which is combined with net interest margin and at the corporate center level then we have other small things, 25 million would be the old option on the account that now has been closed. <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>On the MIB side, out of the 543 you have around 270 million is trading related. <mark type="inaudible" /> trading related business, the slide &#x2013; so around 270 is trading related. Of course a lot has to do with the fact that you had mainly you had a contraction in the basis &#x2013; in the basis market and some of the gains have been locked in, we are taking advantage of any liquidity event, to -- as we said before, to reduce risk and lock in gains. But I'm sure if there is any major swings back into what we saw in the first quarter this line would be volatile.  Although as we said before we are de-risking so we would expect less volatility.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, a few questions.  Again on restructured loans, the jump more than 60% Q-on-Q and three times versus year end.  You were mentioning 800 million in just one position, saying there was no coverage there because of <mark type="inaudible" /> if I understand correctly. That's the reason why debt coverage declined from 30% in March to 24%.  And then what are your expectation for moving these restructured loans into different categories as we have seen actually happening from March to June. So what is your view going forward of economics, not only of NPLs and watch list launches but also of restructuring. Then you were mentioninbg that for 2010 you are expecting net interest income and commission to be above 2009.  What about trading because we have seen this big jump -- you have given us a good help to see what is one-off and what is not, but see this year is going to close well in excess of one billion. So what is your view for 2010 having in mind the de-risking and the leverage you were mentioning.</p>
          <p>And given core revenues are up in 2010 what is your comment on cost because it is unclear to me between ForEx, and one-off, and fractural cost cotting, and short term charges versus longer term savings, it is unclear to me if the level we have seen in the third half of this year is something you judge as sustainable in the second half of the year, and so in 2010 we see costs falling in absolute terms or not.</p>
          <p>Finally, I didn't hear much on the capital management except for the effort on reducing risk weighted assets, but nothing about an effort sell a part of your assets.  We have read on the newspaper something about real estate.  What can you tell us regarding this part of your assets or you believe that the market is changing and this makes it easier to dispose of some of the non-core assets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect, sorry. Going over net interest margin for 2010. Clearly it's quite important to understand what would be the evolution of inter freight if the market would be as we hope, blindly positive. In the center, do you see some recovery in the financial market and inter freight. We think that we will see a higher net interest margin in 2010, but as I was saying before we are always &#x2013; and so we have to work on the budget process and we will have it in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>On trading profit is almost impossible to have a view clearly and as Sergio said a portion of this trading profit are also coming from the very low market condition, so there is a closing of the spread that we do not expect we'll let them again next year.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, in terms of structure of cost &#x2013; for sure this is a sustainable level, but we hope that in 2010, we will start to pay again in bonds, in the sense that we do expect that there will be an improvement of the market conditions so that the variable compensation will go up again. Clearly this is something, which is difficult to foresee. In any case as usual are fully self-financed. And as you know with the new compensation system, we charge immediately the bonus and then we pay in the following two years. So, and we will pay only if the results also in the following two years will be achieved. So, we will see a charge and hopefully not results, but we can see some variation in the future.</p>
          <p>On real estate, the market is slightly better. We are in the process of analyzing three different deals as has been said in the previous answer this is what we have in the pipeline. So, now you can raise your question.</p>

Second question is, on the back of some provision that you took at MIB level on your &#x2013; on your portfolio, if possible, you had a figure in terms of overall value at which this &#x2013; your portfolio is on your book.  I mean, at which percent is on your book?</p>
          <p>The third question and I'm sorry if I'm getting back to something that you might have already answered, if I'm not wrong it was around 260 million, the contribution at NII in the first quarter comes from pull-to-par, did you also give us the same figure for the second quarter or something that I'm missing or you may have already mentioned before.</p>
          <p>And last on NII, is kind of strong again in the first quarter there was an item which you quantified in around 270, 300 million of income, which was much more related to trading activities.  Is it possible to make a similar &#x2013; at a similar figure also for second quarter?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So let me tackle that. The IAS 39 Reclassification effect, you are right, was around 2.5, and as I said before, the net effect of second quarter translate into 2.2, 2.233 number, a negative number since inception of the reclassification.  So this is the total as we find today.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Due to the effect of the second quarter.  In respect of the LBO book, we are clearly making provision on a name-by-name basis as I said before. We are not measuring, taking on average of the LBO value of the book because this would not really reflect the quality of the underlying assets.  So I think is &#x2013; it's not a philosophy we'd been running the books from the very beginning, and therefore it's not material, but we are taking impairments as necessary if the performance of the underlying company is not in line with covenants or any other contractual obligations.  In respect of the NII impact, you asked on the trading side. We are around 40 million on &#x2013; of reduction in net interest margins due to movement from between the two lines.</p>

          <p>Sorry, this 40 million is the item relating to the around of 30 million which impacted first quarter.  I mean are we talking about comparable figures?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so.  We're a...Okay let me &#x2013; let's go on with the rest of the answers, this is not. I answered to something else.  So let me go and get the numbers.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll answer the rest of the question right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My last question was the impact of pull-to-par on NII in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it's 70...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 50.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically I can get second quarter was net reduction of 248 million, so 46 is related to trading related interest as I said before and 45 million due to a lower contribution from the reclassified assets.  So the pull-to-par has been adjusted to the different maturities &#x2013; expected maturity profile of the portfolio. So we went from a trading related NII of 259 in the first quarter to 213 in the second quarter.  Okay so we're close to the range.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Davide Serra of Algebris.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  I've three quick questions.  The first one is, on page 22 the 13 basis point in non-recurrent effects in your Core Tier 1 in the second quarter, it says AFS negative forex reserve &#x2013; negative forex effect.  I imagine that in the third quarter, given the stability of currency and of the credit growth, these non-recurrent effects not only are going to disappear, but could actually reverse.  Could you comment on this?</p>
          <p>Second question is, if I well read this slide 22, I think it's a core slide to understand because you generated basically 40 basis points more of core capital just in one quarter, which means more than 20% is sort of cash return on equity, cash-on-cash.  And hence I think just probably by year-end, you're going to reach your 7.5% Core Tier 1 just assuming steady run rate?  If you could comment on this as well, make sure that I understand the slide?</p>
          <p>The third point is on the generic, could you comment on how much generic &#x2013; how much of the provision you've taken in the first half that are not in the quarter but so far this year is due to model i.e., deterioration, expectation, enhanced are genetic in nature versus more specific one-by-one case?  And on this basis, I'm positively surprised by the fact that you managed to keep the coverage ratio flat both for the impaired performing loans. It is an excellent result because the average of European banks is down across the spectrum. With the exception of one bank, all the others have coverage which is down versus the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And I'd like if you could comment on the quality of the collateral that you're getting in terms of both in new non-performing loans and the impaired loans and what's the action plan that you're taking in order to be more proactive once, let's say, the loans get impaired, they will become non-performing in order to collect the collateral because I've seen excellent results from Yapi &amp; Pekau on their own conference call on this issue.  And I just wanted to know if this is best practice going <mark type="inaudible" /> go to account Yapi, it's for or if it's more specific to country?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On capital, there are no recurrent effects relate &#x2013; really pointed out on volatility and technical adjustment, and while the technical adjustment will not come again on FX, negative impact of the forex, it's difficult now to predict that the impact in the third quarter and the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>While you mentioned the organic capital generation is only 29 basis points, I've heard you mentioned 40 basis point and for sure you were referring maybe to the swing, but the contribution now in the second quarter has been only 29 and it will be a function also the development of risk weighted assets in the second half of the year, so it's difficult to predict and if you don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Also as I said before Davide we don't think that we can keep the same pace in terms of &#x2013; the same path, sorry, in terms of risk weighted asset reduction because that's been quite impressive clearly.  And as you <mark type="inaudible" /> you start to work on all important, the easiest positions. So you have to consider that.  But in many case, as I was saying, we consider we'll continue to reduce the risk weighted assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your question on generic versus specifics, I think just to get the name terminology correct and so that you're on the same page, in terms of the model driven versus specific, we take a charge also on the performing loans as you know.  So what that in essence means is that if you take the Group, it's roughly 50/50 split but that decomposes quite differently depending on the division and the nature of the business.</p>
          <p>So, if you take CIB, the 80% of it is specific and 20% of it is what I'd call model driven.  In retail, it's 60% that is model driven and 40% is specific, I call that's specific.  In CEE, it's the other way around where you've 20% that is specific and 80% that is model driven.</p>
          <p>In terms of the coverage ratio overall we've &#x2013; I think it has remained largely, but I think we've &#x2013; I think the answer to your question really lies in looking at the level of sofrenda which we have, which is 1.5 and if you take into account that we have provided 4.2 billion during the entire half of the year from January till now, that's a fairly significant level of conservative provisioning.  Over and above that, we've reserves which are in the balance sheet of 2.8 billion that has been taken.  So, in terms of the underlying conservative to it, I think those are the two specific elements that you'd &#x2013; you may want to consider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you.  And that's exactly the number I would expect because of just and put listening through bank results over the last 10 days.  There is not a single European bank that has taken 60% of the provision in space.  And I think the number is very conservative and gives me comfort basically on the quality of that strategy.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen.  I just have a very quick question between Eastern Europe and I've noticed that you're reducing the staff quite aggressively there in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, and I understand that it's part of restructuring.  I just want to &#x2013; you to go again to your strategy for the region and whether you're committed to the region given that it's probably less profitable than say last year.  And whether you think you're going to see all of the countries, all of the different countries you have currently or you might consider withdrawing from some of them and focus on your core markets?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  First of all, clearly, one thing is to reduce staff and other story is the commitments we have in the sense that in all the countries, there is a strong focus in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.  So clearly there are countries where we have had more significant opportunities like Ukraine and partially get different countries where we had smaller opportunities. But in any case everywhere, we're going through a very significant process in terms of optimization of our presence in the future.</p>
          <p>Having said so, the commitment to the area is quite stronger. We think that the area will continue to be the growth driver for the Group in Western Europe, the bottom line will improve mainly thanks to cost cutting in Central Eastern Europe.  We do expect that when the crisis will be over, the revenue base would be more significant and the efficiency we're assuming today is sensing very, very important in order to have very high profitability in the future.</p>
          <p>Having said so, we'll go through as usually an analysis of all the different countries in terms of risks and opportunities and maybe that during the time we redefine how our operations in some countries, but as I said before, the overall capital committed to the area, will remain the one we have today.</p>

I'm sure that they went to vacation or before they will go afterwards.  So and we will have our third quarter results, the 16th of November, if I remember 14 or so in November. Now I've to check the date.  I don't have it with me but in any case in November but we'll have other meetings in the meanwhile, so the 11th of November.  So many thanks to all of you.  Bye-bye.</p>
