          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, it's with profound pleasure, I welcome you to this Press and Analyst Conference where we will present Nordea's Third Quarter Result. The procedures today will be very much as normal. We will start off with a presentation by the CEO and Group President, Christian Clausen. After that we will have some 10 minutes for questions and after that analysts and investors are kindly requested to move down to <mark type="inaudible" />[:39] to follow with deeper any questions and more detailed questions. Whereas media representatives are welcome to move over to the corner and ask Christian questions one-on-one, so to say.</p>
          <p>As always this press conference is broadcasted also in the other Nordic countries and webcasted. So I would be very happy and grateful if you would just state your name and who you represent when you ask questions. The news this time is that also the analyst conference will be webcasted, so that colleagues to you that are not here can follow that as well.</p>
          <p>So with that little instruction, I am very happy to leave the floor to Christian Clausen, Group President and CEO of Nordea.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning and welcome. I am proud today to present a strong Q3 from Nordea. It's based on very high customer activity. We have a strong inflow of new customers and we have a successful execution. Our growth initiatives are reflected in our numbers.</p>
          <p>As usual the short highlights, as you can see, easy to understand net interest income up, total income up, operating profit up, number of gold customers up significantly, lending volumes are up and net loan losses are down. And the numbers clearly show these trends.</p>
          <p>We actually have a new record level on income, 9% up in the quarter, with the lower loan losses. We also get a very strong operating profit, one of the strongest we have ever had and very much also due of course to the lower loan losses which we see down significantly over last year.</p>
          <p>Net interest income is up 5%. We still see a very strong trend in our customer business. Lending and deposit volumes are up. We see some increase in deposit margins, but in general it is a rather good result, especially thinking about the higher funding cost we are getting like all other banks when we gradually increase the maturity of our wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>So, net interest income holding up well. Net fee and commission is down a little in the quarter, but we have to remember Q3 is normally, seasonally a weaker quarter, because of the summer month. So the income in this area is actually continuing its strong momentum and it's very much due to the savings area which continued upwards with assets under management now at &#x20AC;180 billion, very strong inflow, 8% of assets of inflow in the quarter. Strong performance on institutional business as we can see from the slide but also European fund distribution where we distribute our funds throughout Europe is performing extremely well.</p>
          <p>The fair value result is back on the high level. The customer, the blue one, the customer side is continuously delivering, even here in Q3 where we have typically lower activity, but we see that the income from treasury and other areas are coming back. So this is also back on the high level.</p>
          <p>And the costs are more or less flat. We have a small increase, but if we adjust for the currency effects and our growth initiatives, we actually have the underlying expenses of running the bank down slightly in the quarter and the cost income ratio is now at 51.</p>
          <p>Credit quality is clearly improving. We have for the first time this quarter a clearly positive rating migration in our loan book. This is reflected in the lower loan losses and if we exclude the payments to the Danish guarantee scheme, we are now down to 22 basis points, down from 27 &#x2013; 26 last quarter.</p>
          <p>This is also reflected in our risk-weighted assets. You can actually see that the risk-weighted assets is slightly down mainly due to the rating migration, which is having this positive effect. And combined it means that core Tier 1 capital is going up slightly, and this is very encouraging. It means that our profitability actually to strong enough to cope with the very strong lending growth, which increased risk-weighted assets by 8%, paying out dividends and so on and still increasing the core Tier 1 ratio.</p>
          <p>We still have a strong position in funding and liquidity. It's interesting to see here that we have only slightly increased our short-term funding over the last three years, but clearly increased our liquidity buffer, so our short-term funding in the Group is today lower than our combined liquidity buffer which of course also short. And the long funding has been increased significantly, so we now have 3.7 years maturity of our long wholesale funding.</p>
          <p>And this means that we're very close to our balance between assets and liabilities on behavior of maturities, which is a strong balance sheet, which supports our AA rating and gives a strong position going forward.</p>
          <p>And we have raised long-term funding this year, actually in the first three quarters nearly as much as the whole of last year and the maturities is quite long as you can see 5.6 years. We are opening new funding channels all the time and now we have launched the platforms both in Norway and Finland for covered bonds, which we have not been utilizing previously, but which is of course an important funding source.</p>
          <p>So the outlook is in essence unchanged. We still see a gradual economy &#x2013; gradual recovery of the economy. It is fragile, we see that every day in the papers, but the Nordic markets have improved their outlook during the year, and therefore our outlooks is completely unchanged. We expect cost growth at the same level as last year, somewhat lower risk-adjusted profit and that we see that loan loss situation continues to stabilize, in line with the macroeconomic recovery.</p>
          <p>Let me give some comments to the business development. As I said, macroeconomic recovery is particularly strong in the Nordic area, where we see these solid growth areas &#x2013; growth rates right now. We have modest inflation. We have relatively strong public finances and we have improvements starting to be seen in the labor markets.</p>
          <p>Sweden is, of course, the country first out with the highest growth rate, closely followed by Finland and only Denmark is lagging a little, but now showing growth. Also on the public finances, we have a very strong position compared to the rest of Europe. Denmark is the only country which is closer to the European average, but still, compared to most of Europe, the Nordic area is actually performing well right now.</p>
          <p>And we have a very strong and diversified customer base. If we look at the income split per customer segment, we see that we have a 60-40 corporate/household relationship. But we also see that the core customer segments are the ones that deliver the income, the large and C&amp;P customers here on the corporate side and the gold, private banking and &#x2013; here on the household side. So the non-relationship segments are actually very small, the others &#x2013; and we also see a very strong growth in income in these key relationship segments.</p>
          <p>And this is very much due to our focus on actually working, building this strategy of moving the customers up the segments. We are focused on our 360 degree meetings on our household segment, where we cover all customer needs and this means that we have a strong value proposition which attract new customers. So we see a very strong increase in customers. On average, during the last three years, we have attracted 6% new customers per year and the run rate we had in Q3 was actually 7%.</p>
          <p>So, 150,000 new gold and private banking customers in the top segment is of course a very strong performance and the underlying driver for our income growth. It's also worth noting that the customers are more satisfied and more loyal than ever in these segments, which of course is a good pointer into the future.</p>
          <p>Our growth strategy is the same. We are working on the household segment and the top segment as I said, moving customers up the segments, attracting new customers. On the corporate, we are working to &#x2013; on the two large segments and very much expanding our offering to these on all products, including risk management and other ancillary products.</p>
          <p>In European markets, we are growing successfully, especially in Poland. And then we have our core efficiency initiatives, where we work on making the whole value chain delivery in Nordea more efficient, so the customer get this experience that we can and will deliver.</p>
          <p>We are upgrading our IT infrastructure and the back office processes. And as I specifically mentioned last time, we are replacing some of the old product platforms with new ones, especially with the cards and payments.</p>
          <p>A few comments to each of the segments. The household strategy. It is a very interesting strategy, both from the customer's point of view and from the bank's point of view. It is a strong business proposition. It is a segment with the highest income and the highest growth potential. Customers are more loyal. They're very efficient to serve with these 360 degree meetings and there is very low risk. We have virtually no loan losses in this segment.</p>
          <p>And here we have launched the initiatives future distribution as the most important one. We are now redesigning our whole distribution setup with advice branches, service branches, internet services to do the transactions and call centers, telephone bank, to help the customers. This setup is now running. It's developing well and we can see the first results are very positive.</p>
          <p>We actually have now, as it says here, 39 branches operating in the Nordic countries like this. We are still piloting. We are still learning. We are still improving. But the first signs are very encouraging. Customers are simply more happy with this new setup. We are more efficient.</p>
          <p>We can manage more customer meetings per employee. And the volumes go up quickly in these areas and we see the clear development executing on this strategy over the recent year, lending is up 14, deposits up 9% and the retail funds is up 22%. So we are executing on this growth strategy.</p>
          <p>And other important point is of course new customer acquisition. The new customer acquisition is a program where we make it easy and convenient to become a customer of Nordea, of course, it should be like that, but it seems to work with the 150,000 new customers.</p>
          <p>And on the corporate side, it's more or less the same story. It is the top segment, which has the high income and the high potential. We talk about all products, so this is also very efficient to serve and here it's very much about the relationship. This partnering up with the big corporates is extremely important. We commit our balance sheet, we stand by the customer, but of course then, also we take care of the customer business, and here we talk about prudent risk taking. I will show a slide in a moment showing that we are improving our credit risk profile in our growth and the corporate segments.</p>
          <p>Here the main initiatives is Growth Plan CMB, which is in all four countries specifically in Sweden, where we expand the services to the top segments very much under customer during business from markets which is an essence the risk management, the balance sheet management services and transaction management for customers, which is key these days with all the volatility in rates, and both country rates and interest rates.</p>
          <p>And we see the effect here, income is up 23% year-on-year and we see that the project develops as planned, and with strong momentum and several mandates won. And it is working also, now we work with this in a focused way in nearly four years, and we see the income growth in this period year-on-year is very high. So we are gaining clearly momentum in this area and keeping a very strong momentum also on the corporate side.</p>
          <p>And this thing about the risk profile is clear. We are attracting strong corporates to the bank, so during the recent year we have improved the rating distribution detail rating scales, the weaker ones and the stronger ones, and you can see we have improved the proportion of customers we have in the strong rating classes and decreased the proportion of customers in the weak.</p>
          <p>So while we grow, we attract customers with a higher, better risk profile than our average, which is of course, a strong equation. So the upper segment is a fantastic equation for us. High growth rates, high potential, loyalty, low risk and for the customers it's also a fantastic proposition, because they get the full service of Nordea, they get advisors and therefore, they are also more satisfied and more loyal.</p>
          <p>European markets also continues, mainly in Poland again the same storyline. We have a huge potential, 40 million people in Poland, we have a proven track record now for several years attracting new customers. It is a Nordic model and it's very low risk. It had virtually no loan losses during the crisis in Poland and we are delivering here also. Actually since 2007, we had an income development of 38% even accounting during the crisis, and we see the income growth very solid also in the recent year. Cost income is now down to 39%, so it's obviously a very profitable proposition.</p>
          <p>We have opened four branches in Q3 and now in Q4 we will have a lot of branches coming on stream, close to 40 branches probably will be opened. They are all ready and people have been employed and trained, and that will give us the next important step in the growth rate here.</p>
          <p>So the strategic initiatives are delivering according to our plans, may be even a bit ahead, and they are key in actually delivering our long term ambition. As you know, toppling in seven years was the proposition we put forward to shareholders in 2006. We are more or less on the curve right now maybe slightly below the curve. We had a financial crisis and interest rates are very low, so that is now too surprising, but these initiatives will make us deliver on this &#x2013; on these ambitions.</p>
          <p>So the key message is today, a strong quarter. We have record income, and one of the highest operating profits we ever had, a high customer activity, we get more customers, and the activity level within our customer base is very high. We have a very strong trend in assets under management. We are proud that, we actually now manage &#x20AC;180 billion for our customers which is of course an amazing number, strong inflow of new customers as I said, and a successful execution on our growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. And I think we will now move to questions. And I will be joined by Fredrik and Ari.</p>

          <p>Yes, you all know Fredrik Rystedt, Chief Financial Office and Ari Kaperi, Chief Risk Officer. One over there and then one here.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter Grabe of Handelsbanken. Two questions, firstly regarding impaired loans, they're increase in the quarter, we've seen in other banks they are actually starting to come down. And it's in particular the performing impaired loans are increasing. If you can elaborate a bit about what we should expect going forward in terms of impaired loans and what do you see as the key drivers?</p>
          <p>The second question relates to the Baltics where you're growing the corporate lending market share in the quarter and growing the volumes should we expect volumes are continue to grow in corporate lending in the Baltics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I take these both questions. Impaired loans, yes they were a little bit up in the third quarter, as you saw that all-in-all our credit quality was improving, our rating migration was positive, meaning that the overall quality of our Group was improving.</p>
          <p>Still we have &#x2013; let's say customers who are in problems in the other end of the scale, these weak customers. And what happened now in Q3 actually in Denmark and in Finland there were a handful of what is going to medium size corporate customers where we impaired their loans, made a &#x2013; the small loan loss provision and that makes that the whole lending book impaired for that customer.</p>
          <p>So actually it was few specific customers in Denmark and in the Finland, still performing loans, but we saw that there is need for small loan loss provision. So then that is very natural. This happens every now and then and this we will see also at here in the quarter that there will be fluctuations in the impaired loans. But the &#x2013; of course the long trend, stable trend is that they will come down.</p>
          <p>Then in Baltics actually no, we don't have that type of aggressive strategy even now to go and start to grow our lending book in Baltics. It's also in Baltics we did the same as we do all in Nordic countries and all our market, that we select good strong customers and then we make business with them. But this hasn't changed our overall strategy in Baltics. We are still just kind of cautious here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Magnus Andersson at ABG. First of all, I will like to ask you question about corporate lending market, it seems like you have a slowdown here in Q3, if exclude currency effects, it seems like you have fairly flat quarter-on-quarter pretty much in all countries while you had a very strong growth sequentially in Q2.</p>
          <p>If you could comment on that how much that is seasonal and what you expect to see going forward? Also if there are any major differences between the countries.</p>
          <p>In relation to that also if you could comment on corporate lending margins, now we have a banking sector that is very well capitalized, while at the same time, corporate lending demand seems very low. Is there &#x2013; could we potentially see some margin pressure there?</p>
          <p>And finally just a follow-up on Peter's question on impaired loans, how much of the 6% quarter-on-quarter increase is due to FX effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could say a little about the corporate loans. It's correct that it slowed down in Q3. There are number of arguments for that, but the need &#x2013; the growth we have seen so far this year has mainly been for working capital. And our customers are making a lot of money, so they are become rich on cash and therefore they don't need as much working capital funding as they did, so it has slowed down the demand.</p>
          <p>We also see some seasonality in Q3 which is typically a slower quarter. The underlying customer activity is fairly high. So I think we will see some growth going forward. Customers are active and taking initiatives on back of the good results.</p>
          <p>Maybe Fredrik you will continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you've seen the margin pick up very slightly from last quarter's level and that's has been very, very long trend and of course generally we see a stabilization of margins at this point in time, which can be expected. We have communicated many times that the longer term &#x2013; we're in the longer trend should be still positive on the margin for regulatory reasons. And I don't think it's obvious that those regulators impacts have started to play a major role, yet. But clearly I think at least our expectation is that margin should hold up well, also going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then about this currency impact on impaired loans. Actually it's very small because now we're talking about the increasing Denmark and in Finland, so other than of course reporting currency zero, so that has &#x2013; that doesn't have so much, so big impact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2% to be exact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jan Wolter, Deutsche Bank. A couple of questions. First on the treasury and trading result, interest rate risk. So if we look at the interest rate risk value at risk this quarter, it seems to have come up a bit 90% or so Q-on-Q. And if we look at the balance sheet, you can see that the derivative book is also up quite a lot. Just the reason for that we understand, but what should we expect going forward, are you looking more to have a higher level of &#x2013; taking a high level of interest rate risk going forward or it just this is more a seasonality or one-time event, so that's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I can answer, we had a weak result in treasury of course in Q2 and good result in Q3 and towards the latter part of Q2 we reduced the risk quite significantly. So I think this is the increase that you are referring to. And the RWA risk is mainly within treasury and it's really a normalization, normal variation in the business so it's no particular direction of view so to speak, it's more normalized. The change or the increase in the balance sheet is a different issue. It has really not much to do with the RWA risk, it has simply to do with the movements we have seen in interest</p>
          <p>we have seen in interest rates and FX. So, of course the significant movements in interest risk will either increase or reduce our balance sheet on the derivative side and same goes for FX. So, a normal fluctuations again, so what is important for us is, of course, the net exposure. What is the net exposure including collaterals et cetera and that has really increased very, very little. So the gross balance sheet is more functional, market movements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then a second question is on costs. How does Nordea think about costs here going forward in next year? Do you still see that there is reason to push costs up because you see this very positive development in Nordea in terms of organic growth? But on the other hand maybe we see some slowdown in the &#x2013; or less expectations on overall growth in the market, so what is your view there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me give overall comment and you can comment to the actual cost level Fredrik. But it is important to state that we are not pushing up the cost level. Our underlying cost is actually as you saw on the quarter slightly down and it is not growing a lot, more or less flat even though we have somewhat of inflation in the books, and the reason is we take a lot of efficiency by our projects.</p>
          <p>So the underlying costs are actually not increasing. What we are doing, we're investing in the nine growth initiatives which we launched a significant investments. They are delivering very significant results at the same time. And we will continue in the coming three years on those investments. Now we may take them up and down a little depending on what happens with economic cycle but we are pretty determined to execute on these because these are taking out efficiency. They are improving the foundation of Nordea and they are generating this growth, I have demonstrated with new customers and more business and so on.</p>
          <p>So the underlying cost base is actually coming down or unchanged, and we will I think stick to our view that it should not grow. There we will take out the efficiency, but of course we have to invest in the growth initiative to make the growth happened. When then we move a bit further ahead than this huge number of new customers of course eventually puts some pressure on the costs. So you can say it's a function of the customer activity and the number of customers more than anything else and they're actual initiatives, very clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and I think you said most of it. So you have seen of course the impact from the initiatives in the first three quarters of 50 million. So it is really delivering those efficiency gains and it will in the coming years. That's what we expect it will continue to deliver, so again the underlying cost is going down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it reasonable to see the same sort of cost growth next year, as we have seen so far this year, will you say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's too early. We will come back of course with the forecast for next year, but this is the general direction as Christian outlined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hampus Brod&#xE9;n, Enskilda. I was just wondering, I read somewhere in the material that the growth initiatives have contributed with around 200 million on the income side so far this year. I was just wondering if you could perhaps tell us little bit about how you get to that number? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Then a second more technical question. On the non-client related result and items, the fair value it bounced back quite a lot during the quarter. If you could give us a little flavor on that, and also maybe what your level could be going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can &#x2013; maybe start with the way we track it. We are, for every one of these initiatives we have defined a set of parameters and what we actually expect to happen in terms of income generation and that's also what we have used as the input for calculation of the business cases. So we track every &#x2013; actually every month exactly what the income contribution is from all the initiatives. Of course it's not an exact science. You can always make subjective judgments as to what is the really underlying and what's depending on the initiatives. But we think we are pretty good at tracking these initiatives. So the number that you see approximately 200 just over 200 is a fairly good assumption what they are generating. I think that also goes for the cost structure. So, so far it's really delivering all of these initiatives. Items at fair value, your new question was why has it picked up?</p>

So all of it is pretty much treasury markets. The markets activity is largely unchanged and so is life. So its treasury issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thomas Svendsen at Carnegie. A few details here, you said average funding cost is up. I mean how much further would &#x2013; will average funding costs rise over the next couple of years or so? And also if you can just give us detail, you said that risk-weighted assets under Basel III increased by 10%. What's the impact on the capital base and exactly what items are affected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can. The Basel III the capital base, not sure your question it's little too early of course to say exactly on the capital base because simply the estimate we have at this point in time is that the capital core Tier 1 ratio is going to be approximately affected by 100 basis points, or an order of magnitude which is nearly a risk-weighted assets impact and the capital base impact is pretty small. Of course we don't know all the details on all the Basel III different levels, but on core Tier 1 approximately 100 basis points is what we estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On funding...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reason for the funding costs going up is simply that we have, as I demonstrated, increased the maturity on the funding side. The new regulation will mean that we need more, banks in general need more long funding. We don't know the final decision there which is one of important outstanding issues in the Basel III environment. But the new level of liquidity and long funding is gradually increasing the funding cost when we renew the old funding and increase liquidity profile which we have already done and that will have some full year effects. And from that level it depends on exactly where the parameters will be set for the new regulation, but there is a fairly significant increase in funding cost. We have probably taken a lot of it already. In the numbers you saw that there are some uncertainty on this area going forward. And that will not be concluded until spring next time &#x2013; next year because the parameters has not been set yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then I come to maybe little bit to that as you have seen the issuance volumes both for 2009 and for 2010 have been very, very high. So of course we have gradually replaced a lot of the old funding. So most of the funding we actually have now at the &#x2013; in the long end is pretty much new at higher levels. So that redemption impact is going to be of course much less going forward and then it's a matter of as Christian alluded to the regulatory impact on the absolute long-term funding. But we have a very, very significant level of long-term funding at this point as you can see and very long maturity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean if there a lot of uncertainty under net stable funding ratio, I assume you have some kind of plan on what to reach and what kind of buffer you want against the requirements, so how do you reach it from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But we don't know the requirements yet. If we knew the requirements, it would be somewhat easier but they have not been set and they are under discussions still actually only next week until G20 it will be discussed. So we don't know the new rules and they will not be set until spring. It's a very difficult equation on the funding and liquidity. We have moved into appreciation with the liquidity profile and as I mentioned close to behavioral match funded on the balance sheet which we find is prudent and we are fine there. Now regulation may require somewhat more, we don't know that for sure, but the cost in establishing the level we have are more or less taken in this quarter. There is a bit more to come and renewable funding, <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
          <p>So in essence, you can say we have moved into a position where we want to be and find it prudent banking and with a low risk level, but we don't know the new regulation that is one of the big outstanding issues in banking. How much extra liquidity and funding does the banking sector need for the whole sector that is pretty uncertain.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...euros in the quarter, so it's not major, but it's a good start. And the second question was how much the CBA I think I was just about fixing these things. I hope that question was how much the CBA of the total Basel III impact then it's roughly about half so out of 20 billion in that order of magnitude approximately half of it is CBA related.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="8">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Matti please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Two questions if I may. First, I know you said 8 to 10 million from higher interest rate, just if you could elaborate on regarding hike this week and especially the Central Bank revised the interest rate path. What you are looking at when you estimate or look at net interest income going forward? Have you been looking or are you using the Central Bank's path or have you been using sort of the market's interest rate path which has been significantly lower? And the second is I don't know if you could answer that, and the second is on the liquidity portfolio. You increased that this quarter. What could we expect going forward? Will you continue to increase it and also if we can get some sort of how cost led us to increase this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we typically, but it's obvious, the interest rate development we typically use our own, so to speak and that's not the Central Bank, it's more our own judgment that we make group treasury. So that can from time-to-time deviate, but I think the aggressiveness of the Central Bank is not something that we have maybe used. So we have been a little bit more <mark type="audio gap" />. So it I don't think this last development really changes very much in our own forecast.</p>
          <p>Generally, of course, the assumption that we have is that interest rates will start picking up and continue to do so in Sweden, but we have also said in Q2 at the last occasion, we said that of course the euro prices will most likely prevent the euro rate from going up any time soon at any major degree, it probably will be likely that we'll see an adaptation of the actual market rates to the official 1% rate, but it will take really long time until we see interest rates going up at any great extent. So, no major change on our forecast. Your second question was related to treasury, I guess.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the liquidity portfolio increase; first of all, if you can mention how much of that is FX effect, if you have the lower liquidity in Swedish krona, but also how costly it is to increase the liquidity portfolio and what we could expect on actual size going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's really very good question, one that we actually discussed in the Board yesterday, because I think all banks now are really trying to figure out, what are you actually going to do with the future and coming regulation related to the liquidity buffer, what's the revival period, et cetera and how do you actually measure liquidity risk? And all of that stuff really goes into the size of the liquidity buffer, not only the size, but also the composition of the liquidity buffer.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a little too early to give you all the details on what we will actually do. Our assumption at this point in time is that there is going to be LCR, of course, to some extent, maybe not exactly what has been communicated now. It's a little harsh still on some of the parameters, but we will adapt. So there is no fundamental direction at this point of time to increase the liquidity buffer to any more than you have seen at this <mark type="audio gap" />.</p>
          <p>So this is more normal fluctuations that you see <mark type="audio gap" /> of course it's costly and depending on what kind of style &#x2013; or what kind of composition you have. The more government bonds, the more costly it is of course. LCR is in that perspective fairly costly, because it takes a lot of government bond, 60%, as you know. But there is no direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually &#x2013; in this quarter, the return from the liquidity buffer actually went up a little bit. So we saw an improvement there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A little.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Actually took out the impact from higher interest rates to funding cost. So it has &#x2013; really good &#x2013; it's a good quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so Frida please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So two questions. Firstly, on household mortgage lending margins in Sweden, they appear to be up 8 basis points compared to last quarter. Is that the underlying development, or is there some other factors playing in there? And then secondly, if you can say something about the potential to make Finnish and Norwegian cover bonds?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the household margin pick up in Sweden, it's been consecutive over three months in the quarter. So this is not just one uptick. It is something that we deliberately are driving towards and &#x2013; then of course, you can argue, is it really a margin pick-up? Because what you obviously must take into consideration is the underlying funding cost, and since you have seen here, we have consecutively or &#x2013; for several quarters, we've increased the maturity profile and the long term funding and therefore our average funding cost. The underlying net margins, so to speak, is not really that up . It had a similar increase in the &#x2013; but just measured in terms of STIBOR, it has increased by 8 basis <mark type="inaudible" />. So I think that's &#x2013; we are basically pleased with that development.</p>
          <p>You can argue mortgage lending in general is not the most profitable area of lending in more general terms. They are much more where other areas that are more profitable, and you typically have very long maturities and of course long maturity requirements also &#x2013; so it's not, in that sense, a very profitable area. But of course it's very key for us in our gold customer focus. We &#x2013; that's a core product for the entire customer relationship.</p>
          <p>Then your second question on the covered bonds, we have just started, of course, so the issuance in the Norwegian market is so far very small. The Finnish market, we have not yet started. We are commencing our roadshow. So we will start in the Finnish market very soon.</p>
          <p>So we have good hopes, corresponding to remember the Danish and the Swedish covered bond markets have been active for very, very long period of time. Probably the two most function, well -debt functioning markets &#x2013; covered bond markets in Europe, maybe together with <mark type="inaudible" /> in Germany. So it will take time to develop, but we have high hopes to create additional capacity in the, in Norway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you say something more about what kind of funding you're replacing and the potential impact on funding costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's, you can say it's a combination of &#x2013; it's the normal funding structure of the bank. So we &#x2013; if you take mortgage lending in both Norway and Finland is typically done with the average mix of funding that the bank is actually doing. So a combination of senior short and medium funding. And that, of course, we are replacing with cover [audio break] a clear price advantage from this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There any further &#x2013; yeah, Thomas Johansson.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's talk about corporate lending. I mean this been &#x2013; beginning of this year, seems like most banks were very positive about corporate lending growth. It seems to have come off the past few months and it's rather coming down again, if anything.</p>
          <p>Also on the corporate margins, most banks have been very hopeful for number of years now, several years, that margins will rise. Now it seems like they're, across the board, seem to be falling slightly. Can you just communicate what's going on here, both in terms of volumes and margins?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I would start so that I can also say something here, and then you can continue. Yes, you're right that &#x2013; now in Q3, actually, we also saw that the corporate lending demand was not so high, actually. And what we have seen even earlier is that this kind of real investment type of financing needs for the corporate customers, that has not being very high there. So what has driven the growth now in the beginning of the year has been quite active &#x2013; activity has picked up in the private equity side, for example, that they have been active. And of course, that is driven somewhat the lending up. That it's now little bit &#x2013; it's still there, but it's not so much picking up anymore.</p>
          <p>Then actually what happened also in the beginning of the year that the corporates, they fill in their working capital needs, because the volumes were up. That was little bit also halted in the Q3, so that now probably, this is a signal of some kind of perceived uncertainty in the global economy as well. So that corporate seems to be a little bit now cautious. But still actually, we believe that this type of healthy growth, not fast, but some growth, will come again in the corporate side.</p>
          <p>On the margins, yes, we all understand and we try to take the margins up in the corporate side, but now actually there seems to be quite high competition for these, let's say, good credits and good deals. And actually, this competition, once again, is keeping margins somewhat down. So that we would like to see increased margins, but that seems not to be so well achieved in the current market circumstances.</p>
          <p>And the other reason for margins not to pick up so high in the corporate side is that actually now, we are dealing more and more with the high quality corporate customers, good names, and of course then the prices are little bit lower than in the other type of segments that you can, of course, contemplate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think you've said it all there, maybe one additional thing and that's that maybe six months ago, the belief relating to regulation was a little stronger maybe on the liquidity side. So the need for a lot of long term funding for the banking system as a whole was perceived as pretty much evident. And of course, the confidence among the regulators relating to NSFR, and some other measures, have been little less.</p>
          <p>So lot of confidence on the capital side, a little less on the NSFR side, so most of the banks around tend to believe that NSFR is not going to be there, it may be in some shape and form, it may look different, but it's not going to be there regardless of the &#x2013; if it's going to be there, it's going to come in many years from now, so the adaptation to a longer term funding portfolio has a little, maybe stopped. A lot of people are &#x2013; lot of banks are still deleveraging for capital reasons, but the urge for long term funding has a little stopped temporarily. So of course, the regulatory development we will simply see, but as we communicated also outside, our believe is that margins should &#x2013; would need to go up in the longer perspective, because of the need for the banking system to pick up more long-term funding. So we'll see, we'll see.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I have &#x2013; had question regarding capitalization targets. You are now at 10.4 and with new rules, you would be at roughly 9.5 core Tier 1. Could you give us a feeling for when you would revisit your financial targets in terms of capitalization? Is it already now in the first quarter, or is it further down? And how do you view your dividend policy, given your key numbers on capitalization today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very good question and of course one that we get quite a lot, given the strength of the balance sheet. I think my short answer is, it's too early at this point, because there are a couple of things we just don't know, right? \ I think the treatment of the countercyclical buffers is one, possible surcharges or other things relating to systemically important institutions through the cycle provisioning in IFRS. There are a number of different things that we are still a little uncertain of what the impact will be. Generally, we feel very strong. We think we have a good balance sheet that has really supported us extremely well in the last year and a half throughout this crisis. So it's too early at this point. We can only say that we've got a strong balance sheet and we are eager to have an efficient balance sheet, and of course we will address that as soon as we are able to do that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, firstly regarding the corporate lending margins. Can you say anything about, or quantify somehow, the development relative to your own funding costs, instead of to sort of a reference rate and how those developed in the past few quarters? And give some forward-looking statements in that.</p>
          <p>The second question relates to your internal funding costs transfer model, how the work is developing and if you can explain a bit how that potentially could affect operations if the &#x2013; just hoping that the margins for the branches automatically will go down on the back of that, will that have any impact on profitability and so on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I can do that. First of all the, yeah, it's little difficult because I think, if you look at the margin development, it was really strong at the early part of the crisis. There was an immediate pick up and of course, starting with the very large customers and smaller customers following thereafter. So we had a fairly rapid pick up, but not an extensive loss of &#x2013; or increasing funding cost at the early part. So from a lending perspective, we have picked up, in terms of funding cost, at a later stage, whilst margins have been relatively stable.</p>
          <p>So the direct answer to your question is that, in recent quarters, that equation has been slightly negative. Our funding cost has picked up a little more than the margin cost, not much, but a little bit more, and we've compensated of course to some extent by volumes. So as I alluded to before, we have done a lot of funding. So, therefore, the transition process is to a large extent over. So that's the answer to your first question.</p>
          <p>The second one is a good one. It's very interesting, because we will start implementing a different fund transfer pricing already at the start of 2011. So we will &#x2013; will describe it more when it's been finally settled, so to speak, but largely it takes into account the cost of money for maturity purposes and, of course ,if it is collaterals or covered bond or non-covered bond based lending, so we are pricing internally, basically, the price of time, which we believe is the right thing to do. And we have a similar account approach for deposits, so what's stable in various maturities, we will price also differently.</p>
          <p>So again, a model that we hope is going to be good in creating and understanding internally for the cost structure of our products and of course also drive good behavior, I think.</p>

          <p>Yeah, when it comes to the growth initiatives, if we come back to those. A lot of the investments that have been done to get revenue from growth initiatives, those investments were done relatively recently. Is it therefore reasonable to assume that the effect from growth initiatives on the top line will increase going forward, i.e. the 200 that we've seen so far this year, is that likely to increase going &#x2013; in the coming couple of years, let's say?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it's the start, of course, these are long-term initiatives and we are expecting some long-term impact of those initiatives. So that &#x2013; and they are ramped up so that your assumption is correct. So that naturally we expect let's say &#x2013; higher revenue impact in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Because these are exactly the initiatives we have launched in order to get this long term target fulfilled this doubling the risk , just profit and now with this income growth, which is generated now from these initiatives, we are not there yet, so that definitely. But you can of course be most......</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, I don't think, there is much to add, of course this is a three year program. So all these initiatives are going to increase the revenue generation year-by-year so, so far it's producing what we have asked right there, basically according to plan. And of course we have high hopes for it to continue throughout the years to come.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do we have any further questions? Yes please, Magnus?</p>

          <p>Hi. One detailed question, then, on loan losses in Finland. If I remember correctly, you said in connection with the Q2 report that roughly half of the 55 million was due to one larger provision and now you are at the same level in Q3, is it the same reason or is it more broad based?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>....it is more or less the main explanation is to say that this 50 million roughly 50 million in Finland is because of &#x2013; let's say five or six customers. So that still in Finland our credit book is in &#x2013; that the loan losses are coming from few &#x2013; a very few, this kind of medium size companies.</p>
          <p>Now actually, we don't have a &#x2013; it's a big one as in Q2. So that now it's &#x2013; this 50 is comprised of &#x2013; let's say between five and 10 a smaller ones, but nevertheless they are quite big ones compared in its loan losses where the explanation and the reasons there are totally different.</p>
          <p>So then in Denmark, we don't have this type of medium sized individual loan losses. That's just three more very small corporate, mainly corporate customers, SME type of customers. So that the level of loss &#x2013; loan losses on a quarterly basis in terms of basis points, they have more of this in Denmark and Finland, but the reasons are totally different.</p>

          <p>Okay Thomas, please follow up.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah coming back to regulatory issues, it's an early stage I realize that but, how you reason around hybrids and CoCos and items like that, I mean, the existing hybrids you have outstanding, will you just call them back at first call date and then not just do anything else, and then hardly looking into CoCos and perhaps issuing those in the future instead, because I guess they are all just type of hybrids, they are pretty worthless in the newer regulatory environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they are not worthless in the sense of grandfather in principles, so of course they are going to be used for something. Issuing old type hybrids at this point in time could actually in fact, you could argue with there is a merit to doing that, because you get some sort of assistance from it for several years to come, maybe seven, eight years to come, decreasing degree though, but still you get some benefit from doing issues of old hybrids, and of course the cost of doing that in comparison to new hybrids, significantly less.</p>
          <p>So exactly what we will do and not do is something we will come back to. As related to CoCo, I think it's a really tricky instrument. There is very few that's actually been done as you know, and the experience both from the investor base and the actual issuers is also difficult to interpret. I think generally, if I listen to the investor base and maybe you are more educated than I am, but I think the investor base is reluctant to CoCos for the obvious reason it's either, it's neither or nor so to speak, it's not a equity instrument and it's not a bond. So you can question whether capital like CoCos is really efficient from a funding standpoint.</p>
          <p>Now of course there is likely to be some role for CoCos to be played relating to stress to capital of both &#x2013; may be both going and gone concern within the regulatory framework. We just cannot oversee this at this point of time, of course, and the Swiss are extremely optimistic to the use of CoCos. When we talk to the issuers of it, not very optimistic, and generally the investors are very happy either. So, it's not a home run I think and it's not obviously that we will do something like that we're waiting just as everyone else for the regulatory framework to become little bit more. So still very much opened ground, so to speak for us and what we <mark type="audio gap" /> hybrids and CoCo general comment though to your first question do we go in the first call date. We have never stated that we always go in the first call date. However, we've always done it. I think that's the short answer.</p>

If you like to be more discreet you can go to the left. Thank you very much.</p>
