        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you. Good morning everybody and welcome to Unilever's Quarter Three Results Call.  I'm here this morning again as usual with Jim Lawrence our CFO and James Allison, the Head of Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>Let me first use a few minutes to try to cover what we have achieved so far and obviously the progress we are making.  And then Jim will take over and talk about the specific aspects of our performance in the quarter and then we'll have plenty of time for some Q&amp;As.</p>
          <p>I'll obviously have to start by drawing your attention to the Safe Harbor statement you're well familiar with by now.</p>
          <p>Now, let me remind you that the objectives we've set is to really get back to long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth to build long-term shareholder value.  We will do this with products which make people feel good, look good so they can get more out of life.  That's our passion and increasingly so as we touch the lives of over two billion consumers every day.</p>
          <p>We continue to believe that re-igniting volume growth while steadily improving operating margin is the surest way to create long-term shareholder value.  Although we also realize that it takes a little bit more than a few good sets of quarterly results as I have always been saying.  We are pleased with our progress and certainly the confidence is coming back.</p>
          <p>This is yet another quarter of balanced growth with top line up 3.4% behind 3.6% volume growth.  Underlying operating margins are also up 70 basis points.  And as you have seen, a further strong improvement in working capital which is actually down 17 days in the quarter.  Now this balanced growth comes at a time when we still see very sluggish market conditions.  Employment and consumer confidence are the key drivers of long term market growth and unfortunately unemployment continues to increase in many places and consumer confidence is still low.  In fact we just got the U.S. numbers, you might have seen them in the Financial Times last week, down to an eight months low again.</p>
          <p>With the amount of de-leveraging still to be done in the global economy and stimulus packages running out of steam, I still expect a long protracted recovery and we should plan our business accordingly.  It's very important here that we are careful and certainly not run ahead of ourselves.  Global markets in which we operate show volume growth of about 1 to 2%, with Western Europe and North America basically flat.  Volume growth in the balance of the world is probably around 3% which is lower than the pre-recession levels.  Against this background, our steady improvement in volume growth is encouraging.</p>
          <p>It is broad based across all regions, all categories, as well as major brands.  We are growing volume shares again in 55% of our business, that's up from 35% at the beginning of the year.  And our value share trend is equally improving.</p>
          <p>Now we are achieving this by instilling again a passion for growth and action, but above all, a passion for meeting the needs of the consumers and customers across the world.  We are pleased with our strong brand and category leadership positions.  Although increasingly the emerging countries will be the engine for our growth, we do expect consistent growth from Europe and North America as well.</p>
          <p>You know, I don't like excuses and although we had more shipping days this quarter than average, because of the calendar effects in Europe and although we were pre-shipping against IT systems, which we were transferring especially in North America, the results are what they are.  But I do want to use this opportunity to thank a lot of people.</p>
          <p>The last three months have seen a tremendous amount of challenges with tsunamis, torrential floodings, typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes especially in the Far East, particularly the Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam.  And I'm sure many of you have been following this in the news.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, we did not lose any of our own people, although the damage was extensive.  I'm humbled by the heroic efforts of many of our people to help our consumers regain their lives, customers regain their businesses, and families their existence.  I'm certainly proud to work for an organization that surely understands that the long-term benefit of the countries in which we work and operate is closely linked to the long-term benefit of our business.  And I want to use this opportunity to thank our employees for that.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the four strategic thrusts that underpin our performance improvements over the last nine months.</p>
          <p>I'll give you a couple of examples of where I believe we've made good progress that is encouraging but I will also recognize that we certainly have much more to do.</p>
          <p>Let's first start with the drivers of growth, which is brands and innovation.  They continue to be the key drivers for our long-term success.  We will continue to invest both in brands and in R&amp;D as I've mentioned at the previous calls.  I've said before that our innovations were in many places still too small and fragmented.</p>
          <p>This despite innovation capabilities, which I believe are at par or certainly at par or better than many of our key competitors.  Under the leadership of Vindi Banga and Genevi&#xE8;ve Berger we are increasingly focused on bigger and better innovations and rolling them out faster across the globe.</p>
          <p>Take for example Clear shampoo, that's now in 35 countries. That's twice as many as the beginning of the year.  The Dove minimizer deodorant we talked has now been launched in 37 countries just in the space of nine months.</p>
          <p>White Now, our wonderful new toothpaste, is in 21 markets and the recently launched mouthwash variant is already in 11 countries.  Even in the more fragmented categories like Savory, we have rolled out the Knorr, jelly bouillon from China to a number of countries in Europe.  Not surprisingly that the turnover is increasing.</p>
          <p>As flagged to you, we are also supporting our brands and innovations with advertising and promotional spend, which again despite the lower media rates and efficiencies are up for the second quarter in succession in absolute.  And these heavy launch investments including the many trial activities are also getting reflected in the easing of pricing and Jim will talk about that later.</p>
          <p>Despite the share growth driven by these innovations, building consumption, and encouraging new consumers to use our products, what we call market development will continue to be the biggest source of growth for Unilever in the years to come, especially, obviously in the emerging countries.  The Cif Cream launch in India, the conversion of bar soaps to liquids in Lat Am, the launch of a hygiene range of hand soaps in Turkey and the accelerated uses of shampoos or deodorants in Indonesia are just a few examples.</p>
          <p>And not surprisingly competitors are also increasingly focused on these fast growing emerging markets as well.  We welcome this.  Not only because competition will ultimately benefit the consumer, but because we know that competition helps to accelerate market development and the leading brands, in many cases ours, are well placed to benefit from that.</p>
          <p>With competitive intensity picking up, it is also key that we continue to increase the ability of the organization to react fast.  We have discussed at many occasions the 30-day plans that you are now familiar with.  But lowering our working capital and especially our inventory levels will also contribute to our ability to respond fast in the marketplace and I'm pleased to say that two-thirds of those sales that we are now obviously focused on in running the total organization are showing positive share momentum.</p>
          <p>One of the sales that I've discussed before is the Indian skin cleansing business, where we are under pressure from low priced regional competitors.  Whilst overall volumes are edging up, we are not growing as fast as the market and the results are still not where I want them to be, but we've strengthened the national brands, but also reenergized the local jewels.  We now have clear and well differentiated consumer value propositions across the entire spectrum of price points and we expect from Nitin our CEO and his team to see share progress in the coming quarters.</p>
          <p>It is not rocket science, it really is hard work and focus.  The combination of great brands, well supported innovations, rolled out quickly, and operating across attractive price points are key drivers of the recovery of our volume growth.  At the same time, we are encouraged to see that the equities of our core brands are also being strengthened across the board.  That's absolutely key.  We expect our pace of innovation to further increase during the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>The second <mark type="audio gap" /> thrust is winning in the marketplace especially with our customers and here again good progress.  As Pier Luigi Sigismondi now on Board as Chief Supply Chain Officer, we have rolled out a sharpened supply chain strategy and we are seeing the needle move not only on the customer service, but also on the in store availability.  Some of you will also have the opportunity, I hope to see the customer interfacing center that we have broken Englewood Cliffs in the US under Mike Polk leadership.  And this is instrumental in driving the winning at the point of purchase to higher levels.  Nevertheless, we have still someway to go to get to best-in-class levels. I'm encouraged by that.  I'm encouraged by the improvement opportunities we still have especially in this area to further continue to fuel our growth.  The third area is cash and cost.</p>
          <p>Cash flow continued strongly in the quarter, boosted by continuing strong working capital performance.  Cash flow from operating activities in the first nine months of 2009 is actually &#x20AC;1.6 billion ahead of last year.  As mentioned before, working capital remains an area of focus and we welcome the collaboration obviously with the retailers but also with our suppliers across the whole extended supply chain because this will help us to reduce further the waste, improve our efficiencies, and generally provide better products at better value to our consumers.</p>
          <p>Cost savings continue to be ahead of schedule and we have nearly &#x20AC;1 billion of savings achieved over the first nine months of the year.  This quarter again, we have restructured manufacturing operations in the Czech Republic, France and U.S.  We have also further streamlined R&amp;D and continue to drive efficiencies in our head office.  And we're also beginning to leverage increasingly the global procurement.  At the same time, we are preparing for growth with new plants such as the deodorant plant we're currently building in Mexico and ice cream plant in Russia and another one in North America.  Our capital spend is starting to increase as a result of these initiatives and that's obviously needed to fuel our growth.</p>
          <p>You would expect this in light of the tight control of expenditures that will continue nevertheless.  If you look at the gross margins for a second, we're also pleased to see that the gross margins are up by 290 basis points in the most recent quarter.  This reflects obviously the savings efforts I just talked about as well as lower commodity costs.  Although progress has been good, I believe we're still too complex in many places and there are certainly further opportunities to smartly leverage our scale in the area of raw and packing materials, global procurement, and shared services.  And we've started initiatives in these areas to accelerate.</p>
          <p>Despite the high A&amp;P investments once more, we've been able to fuel the growth and step change underlying operating margins, which are up 70 basis points in the recent quarter, firmly on track towards our target of protecting the margins for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>The final thrust and the most important one is our people and our organization.  As talked before, the new structure put in place under my predecessor, Patrick Cescau is actually to starting to work for us.  The interfaces between brand building and brand development are getting better.  Skill sets are being strengthened, especially in the areas of customer development, R&amp;D, with things like clinicals as well as customer service.  The organization is definitely getting faster and more externally focused.</p>
          <p>Now, we're determined obviously to drive further the external focus.  We still need more consumer and customer-centric approaches from the top to the bottom of the organization.  We will continue to build a stronger performance culture, with a greater bias for action and also we will continue to invest in strengthening the organization and our capabilities to support the growth ambitions we have.  But we also invest at the same time to prepare ourselves for the long-term structural soundness of the business.</p>
          <p>An example of that we saw this quarter was the announcement of the acquisition of the personal care business from Sara Lee, licensing of the P.F. Chang brand in the U.S. and the closure of the purchase of the Baltimor ketchup business in Russia.  Now, Sara Lee will strengthen our competitive positions particularly in skin cleansing and deodorants in Western Europe with brands like Sanex, Radox and Duschdas which are perfectly complementary to our own.  We are in good positions here and obviously we equally have interesting positions behind this acquisition in Singapore, Indonesia and South Africa.</p>
          <p>The integration will be led by Doug Baillie, our President for Europe and we expect to progress on that somewhere around the spring or summer next year.  We've also opened a new major R&amp;D center in Shanghai and at the same time, divested non-strategic businesses such as the oil plantation in the Congo, and the participation we still had in JohnsonDiversey.</p>
          <p>Now, let me now hand over to Jim for a second to go in more detail through the quarterly performance.  Jim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul.  Good morning everybody on the call.  What I'm going to do is focus on the highlights rather than repeating a lot of the detail, which is already in the results announcement and actually you will find further details in the appendices to this presentation.</p>
          <p>So to begin turnover, turnover in the quarter was &#x20AC;10.2 billion, that is down 2.2% against the same period in 2008.  The net effect of acquisitions less disposals reduced turnover by 2.4%, that is more than the total that we were down.  Currency had a further adverse impact of 3.1%.  And that reflects the strength of the euro, which is our reporting currency and based on current levels of exchange. As of today, we expect currently to have an adverse effect on turnover of around minus 2% for the year as a whole.</p>
          <p>Underlying sales growth for the quarter was 3.4%.  Before I look at the drivers of growth in the quarter, may I say just a few words about the development of volume and price and how that will be impacting quarter four.  Volume growth accelerated in the quarter to 3.6% and as Paul has noted that was broad based.  Performance in Western Europe was boosted by an extra trading day and North America benefited from volume brought forward, because of systems implementation, which was about to take effect at the beginning of Q4.  At the Unilever level, these factors benefited that volume by 50 basis points.</p>
          <p>In Q4, we will have two trading days less in Western Europe and we will have the reversal of those Canadian volumes which were pulled forward into Q3.  So we would expect the reported UVG in quarter four to be reduced about 100 basis points and that will obviously distort the reported progress in the real underlying performance of our business.</p>
          <p>Now turning to price, last year we increased prices by an average of 7.2% across the whole of Unilever for the year and by over 9% in the fourth quarter.  This was well above the levels of our competitors, unprecedented and driven by the biggest increase in commodity costs that we have ever seen.</p>
          <p>Now some of those commodities, although, it must be said not others, some have reduced considerably in price and it's natural that consumer prices adjust to reflect this.  In the third quarter, we reduced prices by about 1% sequentially from Q2 into Q4, sorry, from Q2 into Q3 broadly in line with the market and specifically in categories where commodity costs have fallen furthest such as Spreads and Home Care.</p>
          <p>For the year as a whole, we would now expect UPG of about 1.5% with Q4 itself between minus 2 and minus 3%.  And that is the simple consequence of the lapping of last year's price increases and the price adjustments already taken during this year.</p>
          <p>As things stand today, we expect reported underlying price growth to turn positive around the middle of 2010 after the impact of this year's price reductions have been lapped.  Our growth has been underpinned by continued strong innovation backed up by strong advertising and promotional support in all categories and in all regions.  A few of the most recently introduced bigger, better innovations which have been rolled out faster include Sunsilk, which was re-launched in Brazil, Argentina, India, and Turkey with formulations and packaging designs co-created with leading hair experts.</p>
          <p>Vaseline Sheer Infusion hand and body lotions were launched in the U.S. with new glycerin technology, which provides superior moisturization and unmatched skin feel.</p>
          <p>A range of Dove for men skin cleansing and deodorant products have been launched across Italy, France, Spain and Benelux.  The global relaunch of the Catwalk brand with Your Highness Volume collection is the first collaboration between TIGI and Unilever.  New Catwalk inspired by fashion, designed by hairdressers, is the essence of the relaunch.  The Goodness of Margarine campaign has been enhanced by the launch of whisked spreads with a new aerated texture in Latin America as well as Hellmann's double whisked light mayonnaise, which has been launched in America and Europe.</p>
          <p>Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream grew by more than 20% in Europe as we introduced new variants such as Chocolate Macadamia, a flavor with a mission.  We have invested a further 130 basis points on advertising and promotions in quarter three compared to last year.  Compared to last year advertising spend has increased by 14%.  This is at the same time as media rates have fallen, thus increasing media impressions significantly and boosting our share voice.  We will continue to invest strongly behind our brands in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to cash and costs.  Commodity cost benefits are beginning to flow through the P&amp;L and we expect to see tailwinds in the second half of 2009 of around &#x20AC;500 million &#x2013; &#x20AC;500 million better than last year.  This is in line with our previous guidance.  We expect to see commodity cost tailwinds albeit at a much lower level in the first half of 2010 and for commodity cost in total to be up in the second half of next year.  Our savings programs have continued to deliver strongly and now stand at &#x20AC;1 billion for the first nine months of the year, ahead of schedule with 2 to 300 million more savings to come in the final quarter.</p>
          <p>Our restructuring costs were 250 million in quarter three and &#x20AC;610 million year-to-date.  We continue to expect full-year restructuring charges around &#x20AC;1 billion.  Gross margins, up by 290 basis points in the quarter, are now back to where they were before the commodity cost escalation of 2008.</p>
          <p>Overheads were up a 90 basis points in quarter three reflecting the phasing of accruals as well as a low prior year comparator rather than any underlying increase.  For the year as a whole, we expect overheads to be down.  With advertising and promotional expenditure up by 130 basis points, this left underlying operating margin up by 70 basis points.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share before RDIs are up 5% in the quarter, down by 6% in the first nine months with earnings from operational performance in the nine months plus 3% offset by disposal dilution of 3% and a significant swing in the financing costs of pensions.  The latter on its own impacts EPS by minus five percentage basis points in this year.  Cash flow in quarter three was maintained at the very high levels of the previous year with cash from operating profit boosted by continued good working capital management.  As Paul indicated earlier, cash flow from operating activities so far this year now stands at &#x20AC;4.8 billion which is &#x20AC;1.6 billion higher than in the first nine months of last year.</p>
          <p>Our working capital balance was down to 17 days in the quarter, an improvement of 22 days versus the same period last year.  As you can see from the chart, there were particular significant reductions in inventories and in debtors.  It's apparent that service levels have been rising at the same time as the inventory levels have been reducing and we believe that this virtuous circle has some way left to run.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, the gross pension deficit has been reduced to 3.3 billion at the end of September, that's down &#x20AC;400 million from the end of quarter two.  And this is despite a substantial reduction in corporate AA discount rates, which measure our liabilities and reflects the very good asset returns in the quarter.  Local pension deficits of the national plans will have reduced by more because government bond rates used to discount liabilities have been relatively stable in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In quarter four, it is our intention to accelerate contributions to some of our pension funds to have an efficient use of our cash.  This will take overall cash contribution to pension funds up to &#x20AC;1.3 billion in 2009 and that is greater than the one billion which we had previously advised.</p>
          <p>The underlying tax rate was 23% in the third quarter benefiting from favorable resolution of a number of one-off items.  The underlying tax rate for the nine months to the end of September is now 26% and we expect to achieve this level for the year as a whole, which is a small variation from earlier guidance.  Net debt now stands at 6.9 billion, which is down from &#x20AC;8 billion at the beginning of the year thanks largely to the cash flow from operating activities.  And we have today announced an interim dividend to be paid in December of &#x20AC;0.2695 per NV share, representing an increase of 3.7% compared to the interim last year.</p>
          <p>I'd remind you that from 2010 onwards as per previous guidance and as in the release, we will be moving to quarterly dividends.  During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Baltimor as Paul mentioned, the leading ketchup brand in Russia.  And in August, we entered into a licensing agreement to develop a line of frozen Asian style entrees for the United States under the P.F. Chang brand.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, we announced the sale of a remaining stake in the JohnsonDiversey professional cleaning business.  We expect this sale to be completed before the end of the year, delivering disposal profits of around $400 million in the fourth quarter.  At the end of September, again as we mentioned, we announced an agreement to acquire the Personal Care brands of Sara Lee.  The transaction will not complete until various Works Council consultation processes have been observed and regulatory clearance has been given.  This is unlikely to be earlier than mid 2010.  We do expect there to be good opportunities for synergies and that will require additional restructuring in 2010, perhaps in 2011 and that restructuring spending will come over and above our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points of RDIs in 2010.</p>
          <p>With that, I will hand back to Paul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Jim.  Let me just wrap it up briefly and then open it up for everybody.  In summary, I think we are encouraged and I hope you are by the progress we are making, but also we are far from being complacent.  Markets are tough, we know that competition is also getting tougher.  So we will continue to set the bar higher, rest assured of that.</p>
          <p>We will continue to strive for bigger innovations, roll them out faster and step-up support behind our brands.  And we'll also have to work even harder to improve our executions in the market because I believe still there is much to be gained from doing the basics right.</p>
          <p>Let's also not run ahead of our results.  It's a long journey and there will not be any quick fixes.  You've heard from Jim that our quarter four growth numbers will be impacted by the trading days and other one-offs and that pricing will be lower as we come down from the height of the quarter four 2008 levels when underlying price growth was over 9%.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that commodity cost increases and price growth in Unilever were at levels well in excess of our competitive set.  In this context, underlying price growth of minus 2 or 3% in quarter four will leave prices still up 6% versus the previous year.  These factors will take a bit of shine off our organic growth in the final quarter, but rest assured that we will keep our focus on the underlying business performance and on driving profitable volume growth.</p>
          <p>With tight control on our costs and working capital, I am confident that we will deliver again against the priorities which we set for 2009, which if I may remind you will remain restoring volume growth, whilst at the same time protecting cash flow and margins for the full year.  At the same time, I am increasingly certain that we will do this while setting the right course for Unilever for the long-term.</p>
          <p>With this, we'll be happy to take questions.  Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Mr. Polman.  We will now poll for questions from analysts.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.  Please keep your questions to a maximum of two to allow more participants to ask a question.  Our first question is from the line of Celine Pannuti from JPMorgan.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everybody.  Well, my two questions, first you mentioned several times that competition intensity is picking up, can you elaborate a bit more on that in terms of regions or category, and whether that would lead to higher spend on promotion?  That's number one.  Number two, in terms of your cost savings, you clearly delivered well ahead of your expectation, can you give us a bit of a flavor of what sort of savings we should expect post 2009 in terms of initiatives and as well the magnitude of savings?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Celine.  Those are good points.  On the competitive intensity, I mean, you've seen obviously most of the competitors have published results with mixed interpretations. I leave that over to you, but you have also seen everybody announcing that they will continue to accelerate the innovations.  Some of our competitors are saying that it will be 30% up, it will be 35% of our turnover next year, whatever statements they put behind it.  I just want to be sure that we all understand, all of our people as well in Unilever, that in order to win in this environment, the markets continue to be tough, so the pie is not growing as fast as we were in the past, that we need to continue to accelerate with our strategy.  This is a moving effort.</p>
          <p>We do see for example, in the growth markets where we are very well placed with our market positions and the markets where you see the next billion consumers over the next 20 years, not surprisingly it's also getting increasing attention from our competitors.  And as I mentioned in my brief introductory remarks, that's a good thing because the consumers will benefit from that.  And what we see as that competitive intensity increases in these markets, market development actually is much faster.  Take Indonesia now where one of our competitors is introducing deodorants and, or trying to introduce deodorants and one or two other activities.  We are obviously very aggressively defending our business, but not only that, we are actually growing share as we do this and the market development is accelerating.</p>
          <p>We see competitive activity, we are not any more in Laundry in the U.S., but one of our competitors made the announcement that they significantly adjusted prices in that part of the world.  We see the same happening in one or two spots, be it Chile or be it Turkey.  So we deal with that on a very surgical level to stay competitive.  But overall I think you have to be clear and that's why I keep saying, don't run ahead of yourselves, just be, sometimes it's good in the flurry of all this activity and enthusiasm that we see.  Take a step back for a second and markets are not going to grow faster in the current economic environment, competition also wants to get better results than they've produced.  We just need to set the bar and continue to set the bar higher in Unilever as well, if we want to maintain these levels of performance. On the cost side, I'll hand it over to Jim for a second.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Paul.  And Celine thanks for the question because this is one of the four planks of our platform, cost and cash.  And as to cost savings obviously first off we've benefited from the reversal on the commodities.  Commodities were year-on-year worse by 1 billion in the first half and as we said last quarter we expected them to be a positive by about 0.5 billion in the second half and we're beginning to see some of that in the third quarter, although we'll see more in the fourth.</p>
          <p>What we have been able to do ourselves was to deliver about &#x20AC;400 million of cost savings in Q3 and that makes for year-to-date one billion of cost savings and frankly that's ahead of what we were looking for.  And I give you a breakdown, we got about 0.5 billion year-to-date in buying savings.  We got about 200 million in local efficiency and then 300 million from restructuring.  Now that -- the 300 million of restructuring is part of a program which was started some years ago.  And we said that in total our restructuring program would deliver 1.5 billion annual savings by the end of 2010.  Cumulatively, we've achieved 1 billion of that, so we still have 500 million to go between now and the end of 2010.  So you see some of that kick-in in Q4 and then the balance in 2010.  As to the buying savings and efficiencies, we should see them continue in the years ahead.  We certainly don't want to see them go down.  Specifically, for this year, we expect to see savings of about 1.2 to 1.3 billion for the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I just had a little follow-up, I guess, on Celine's question in terms of the competitive environment.  Pricing down 1% in the quarter, it just seems to me that a little bit more than just the rollover impact.  I just wanted to clarify that.  Have you taken, I guess, new list price cuts in Q3?  And then going into Q4 or H2, the guidance seems to be that pricing will be down, I guess, a little bit more than what you said at Q2.  Is that again just a reflection of the competitive environment out there?  And then just secondly on the raw material input cost benefit for the second half, 500 million, can you give us the Q3, Q4 split for that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, again on the raw materials, let me hand it over to Jim.  Coming back to the competitive environment, Alex, and the quarter four prices, let me just go back once more. The main growth that we are seeing and continue to see very clearly is behind our innovations.  We have now 55% of our business growing share and what I look at obviously myself is the volume share and value share and they're all moving in the right direction.  So we are not moving one away from the other.  We stay competitive with our brands and are growing across the line value and volume share and where the biggest drivers of volume are is a direct correlation with all these innovations that we are now having bigger and rolling them out faster.  The second thing is that where we grow and where we adjust the prices we are at the same time improving our gross margins and our bottom line.  So it's a top and bottom line growth.  So it's a good thing I think for our long-term structural competitiveness of the business.</p>
          <p>There are two sales where we and frankly went out of line and I've commented on that before.  If you just take 2008 again, our 9% price increase in 2008, if you really put that on paper next to what all of our competitors did, we just went ahead of ourselves in the last quarter. Now we took that as a bold decision under the assumption that ingredient costs would go up and said it's better to be right priced and then deal with it than the other way around.  But the market came down on cost and we were left exposed.</p>
          <p>The two categories were actually Spreads and Laundry.  On Spreads, in 2008, we have priced up 18% from beginning to end point and the same was true in Laundry.  So we were way ahead of the market in my opinion and we've progressively on Spreads as butter prices came down, that's what you see reflected in the European numbers. We have to become more competitive again and in some sales on Laundry, we had to do the same thing.</p>
          <p>Interestingly on Laundry, we did not have that pressure from branded competitors if you want to on a global level but local or regional competitors.  I have talked about South Africa, India, where our competitor is a local competitor on Laundry, we were under pressure.  And the same was true in Indonesia.  So we have had price adjustments on part of our portfolio in those countries to stay competitive and we will continue to do that.  So on a surgical level we will see that.</p>
          <p>Now, if you had 9% pricing in the last quarter of 2008, and just to carry over a fact of this year, we've adjusted between 2 and 3% as Jim was saying and that will be fully reflected in the last quarter.  I broadly feel that where we are now and I continue to feel that where we are now, our prices are more or less competitive.  But again, it's a sell-by-sell analysis and it's a function of what competition is doing.  So we are up against a moving effort.  I cannot tell you if this is ever done or not, the job is not done.  It is a function of what happens out there.  So I hope that is clear Alex from where we are.  And then we'll move to your second point...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  On gross margins, you said that in the third quarter, you are back on the level when it all started these price hikes in the inputs, yeah, do you also mean or do you also believe you can get it back at an annualized level? It is only one quarter, but are you on pace to get back to let's say the normal gross margin levels before all these price hikes?  And yeah to just to get a clear second question, I mean, in the second quarter you made some price adjustments of around 1%, I believe in Europe to get a better price positioning, that continued if I understood it well, was it about at the same level then around 1%?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  The gross margins obviously, Paul as you have seen, the gross margins have steadily improved, it's not just last quarter, it is actually an improvement over several quarters.  And there is no reason that that will continue, that we have shown an gross margin improvement of 290 basis points in quarter three and it's now up 30 basis points for the year as a whole.  I've said we will at least, we will re-ignite volume growth once more whilst protecting operating margins and cash flow.</p>
          <p>It's very clear that on cash flow we're doing better with the numbers that we are showing you, even ahead of our own expectations.  On operating margins, I want to reiterate, our strategy is to re-ignite volume growth whist protecting operating margins.  Now we will do that by reinvesting A&amp;P again behind our brands.  It is up last quarter, it is up this quarter and it will be up in quarter four.  I have said that consistently.  So that has to come out of gross margin, which by deduction means that gross margins will continue to show improvements.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I have given some sense, Paul, from the answer to Celine's question about cost savings as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because it's a function of -- on our buying savings, we are well on track, our supply chain restructuring.  We see many opportunities, but are pleased with that and obviously what Jim was talking about, the local initiatives.  The main thing for gross margin expansion, it comes back to the model of the virtuous circle that we are trying to create.</p>
          <p>This company probably was right or wrongfully accused for a long time of gross margin erosion and when you get the volume growth back and you work that with discipline, you will see the volume, the gross margins improve over time and that is a guaranteed way of growing top line and bottom line for long term shareholder value creation and that's the model we are trying to create.  Now, I want to very clear and people might not see that yet because we have only had a few quarters under our belt, but it will not be done every quarter and it will not be a fix that you get in the first six or 12 months and be a hero.  We want to have this in a sustainable level long term and that's what we are striving to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, you had a second question?</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On price positioning, I mean.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second quarter there were some additional price cuts to improve your price positioning, from the previous question I understood that that has continued.  But if you look at, for example in Europe, 2% minus, what division can you give between, let's say, price adjustments in itself to get the --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul but that's what we just said to Alex as well, some of that is carryover that you see reflected in these numbers.  And some of that are individual activities that happened in some countries.  For example, my Indian example on personal cleansing, we have local competitors need to be more competitive or in India on the Laundry we had to adjust prices there.  You've also seen that separately in the Indian results we've announced to get our business to grow again.  So, those are surgical interventions.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, where there is now 25% unemployment, we have to be sure that part of our portfolio on the bottom-end stays competitive.  In Europe, it continues to be the key driver there.  It continues to be margarine, where we keep our prices competitive, but interestingly whilst doing that on margarine, we are growing our volume shares now, we're growing our operating margin.  So, the structural thing actually is better reflecting the savings and input cost.  And some of that we have to give to the consumer to stay competitive, it's a very normal thing to do.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning gentlemen.  Two questions, one on buying savings, one on Europe.  On buying savings, given it's now so important to the story, can I just understand how you're defining a buying saving separate from just the underlying fall in commodity prices? It's just a technical question around what do you bank as a buying saving, a genuine buying saving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question is on Europe, clearly what would help is a return to positive margin progression in Europe, the trend in margin compression is obviously getting better in Q3, but you're still negative in Europe.  Can you offer me any sort of narrative of how you expect to see your European margins develop? I'm not looking for basis point guidance here, I'm really looking for a sort of your view on what you think the margin model is in Europe going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, they're fine Paul.  I'll have, we will go in again to the buying for a second, Martin, sorry.  But, let me just take Europe again.  We are very pleased because in Europe, perpetual restructuring does not lead to long-term margin growth.  And our margins in Europe were ahead of the rest of the world because we were frankly managing it more for profit and at best maintenance, if you want to put a brave face on that, than for growth.</p>
          <p>We have definitely said before, there is no reason why we cannot grow in Europe, not every quarter perhaps but we should get Europe back to growth.  I jokingly said Europeans are consumers as well but that had a little bit more of a meaning than just trying to be funny.</p>
          <p>But you see in Western Europe now, we have positive organic growth in quarter three once more.  And looking at competitive results, I think Doug Baillie and his team should be complimented on that.  And obviously, if you look at the growth again it's broad based and it's driven again once more by the innovations that we have.  But, we have made some adjustments to some of the prices to stay competitive.  As I said, once more on the margarine and the Laundry ones would be the ones that stick out more and some of our competitors have referred to that as well.</p>
          <p>But there is no doubt that competitive situations in Europe remain more challenging.  This is not going to be a very fast growth market.  But, I think that there is no reason why Europe should not grow and I think there is no reason why Europe should behind that growth not have continuous margin and margin expansion in line with the rest of the company.</p>
          <p>And even now with the adjustments, I don't have the numbers in front of me right now so quickly but the European margins as you can see are ahead of the other regions by quite something.  So as long as we can deliver the overall margin growth for the company and keep the European margin delivery and progress in line with the overall company over time, I'm happy with that. I will tell you honestly.  But, right now we've said that we have to invest a little bit in Europe to get that growth again.  And it will be a good thing for our shareholders once more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to answer your first question about buying savings we do make a distinction between the market price development of commodity costs, which we've said, was up one billion, and by the way that is measured into euros because most of the commodities are priced in dollars.  So, you have both the dollar change and then you have the translation into euros change which was quite substantial in terms of that negative one billion in the first half.  And then on that basis, it was favorable or will be favorable by 500 million in the back half of 2009, that is the market price of commodities.</p>
          <p>What we attempt to calculate is in terms of our own purchasing, what savings are we making versus those market prices either because we buy more efficiently, because we buy in larger quantities on a global basis.  We've initiated a global purchasing office and instead of buying things at a country basis or a region basis, we buy on a global basis and as well as the savings that come from buying below the market price.  If I've &#x2013; have I gotten that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's right, these are looking at it from my own experience.  These are tough measures that have been put upon the people here in the company for a long time already, nothing to do with this year alone.  So, the savings that are being reported are not opportunity cost savings or any funny things, they are real savings and they give us a significantly stronger structural long-term position.  The beauty of it is that the numbers are fine and help us grow the business and invest back in our products and behind these innovations, but even more beautiful is that we have a long way to go still to be truly competitive.  So, there's a lot more that we need to work on.  Thanks Martin.  We will move to the next.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.  Paul, could I ask you to elaborate a bit more on the concept of the virtuous cycle that you mentioned a few minutes ago in terms of driving both volume as well as bottom line growth? What do you see as the main drivers, and what I'm trying to get is when should we start to see that come through, is it a function of waiting for lower restructuring charges or normalization of the commodity cost effect or what are the main drivers for that virtuous cycle to kick off? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Michael that's important.  The main driver is always going to be innovation and being able to differentiate our products over time.  What I continue to say is if you reduce your volumes which and we can go over and over and over that, not only in our company, but in other companies we can look at it by regions.  When you have reduced your volumes, you get into a perpetual restructuring and you cannot, honestly, you cannot save your way to prosperity.  So what we are trying to do here is this, have the volume grow and you see that happening now for the third quarter in a row and there is no reason why that cannot continue.</p>
          <p>And then instill far more discipline in the company in terms of costs and get these costs out of the system, which will be passed on to the consumer.  So that the fueling of growth again becomes stronger, because you give the consumer better value and then you say where does margin growth come from. How do we increase the bottom line, because also there in Unilever, we have some opportunity there still.  And that's really driven by innovations that are accretive.</p>
          <p>So innovations at higher margins, that's really for me one of the conditions of innovation and by managing our mix, but if you have this volume growth and if you capture with discipline, the efficiencies of the volume growth that you are reinvesting and then give it back to the consumer and strengthen the value equation, you will get into a much better position of continuous growth.  And then the mix and innovations help you with the margin development.  That's basically the model in a nutshell; it needs a little bit more detailed explanation, that's basically the model.  It's very few companies are able to do that. I think within the next two or three years as I've said before, I don't live my life by quarters and we are not going to celebrate every number and make a straight line projection and say it's going to be better because that is silly.</p>
          <p>We are not going to be judged on 90-day basis because it leads to dysfunctional behavior.  That is not good for getting the robustness of the operational model.  I have no problem telling you that quarter four will be less in overall turnover, but the volume component will be healthy.  That's okay with me. What we need to look at on a yearly basis is that we get that overall strength back to this company.  And frankly we haven't had it for the last 10, 15 years.  I'm trying to go back to charge and refresh our own memories to see when we really were doing that.  And as a result you don't build shareholder value.  Now we have some good quarters, but I don't want us to run ahead of ourselves either and that would be silly.  This you need to build on pillars not on quicksand.  And that's what we are trying to do.</p>
          <p>So I hope that answers it, Michael.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly, how much that contributed and how much you'd expect it to contribute over the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the A&amp;P spending will be up again in quarter four.  We have said that.  And then if you look at the total year, it will be up despite having the savings and the efficiencies coming through, because of the world prices of media, if you want to tailing off.  I hope that we would be able to report to you again an increase in A&amp;P levels next year.  So just to be very concrete, I do expect if we're able to &#x2013; if we want to continue to fuel our volume and behind the increased stream of innovations coming up next year, I would expect our A&amp;P levels to increase further next year in the absolute as well and that's what we're planning our business on.</p>
          <p>Our premium brands behind our innovations that we have launched are actually the ones that are growing the fastest, but in order to do that, and to order to get the long-term benefits from that, you need to spend your A&amp;P, so that's where most of that goes and we see the benefits from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the net mix was positive in that third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the net mix as a result of that was positive.  In terms of new brand launches, we haven't quantified that and we don't want to celebrate that either, because it doesn't serve anything to me, but in the last six months alone, we've introduced more new brands in different countries like I said in 20 countries about new brand like a Clear formula or the Stock Pot or our mouthwash in the 10 or 11 countries.  I just picked a few, but I could have picked many other ones.  We've introduced more new brands where we think we have an advantage and now we're in a growth mentality again.</p>
          <p>We've reenergized the company that it's not about defending our business, but growing our business.  So launching more brands than ever, you have to go back again, many years to find that same quantity of launches needs the support to be able to be successful and it cannot be short-term support, it has to be long-term support.  You cannot just turn on and off the A&amp;P tab, to make your profits.  And as a result, there might be quarters like we have seen in the first quarter or second quarter that we compromise our operating margins, but we run it on a 12 months basis.  And on a 12 months basis, we continue to say that we can grow our volume and this is for 2009 whilst protecting our operating margin.  It's a very good thing.</p>

          <p>So let's make this the one last call, we've come to 9 o'clock, one last question.  If you have others we will have the IR team standing by.  But one last question for the conference call please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thanks Jeremy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from the line of Marco Gulpers from ING.  Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry to bother you again on the pricing element.  But, I had a specific question on Central and Eastern Europe which ran into the year more slowly and I was wondering how that is progressing?  The second is, I picked up from the wires that you've been quoted that Sara Lee needs traditional restructuring going forward, maybe you want to comment on that.  And is it too early for you to have a comment on current consensus expectations of about 7 to 8% of sales on synergies and I'm still asking the question?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's fine.  Jim will take the Sara Lee.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will take the second one real quick, since it's me who was quoted.  What I said was that sometime next year we will close Sara Lee and we do expect to see good synergies from that acquisition.  But, we also expect that we will have to have restructuring.  We have not quantified it.  Don't care to quantify it now.  We don't care to quantify what we expect the synergies to be, but we did want to warn that whereas we have been saying 50 to 100 basis points of RDIs in 2010, we will have additional RDIs due to restructuring of Sara Lee.  We expect on the presumption that it's closed in mid 2010 and we'll have to take that on top.  Now, you had the second &#x2013; the first question on Eastern European pricing, Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the Eastern European part, we obviously, we don't have as well a developed business of some of our competitors there.  So it's not for us the most important thing, but we actually have in Russia, we have &#x2013; we continue to have good growth, which we are pleasantly surprised about.  The market is soft in volume, but we are able to still grow with a combination of volume and pricing.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe itself is soft, it was soft last quarter as well, it's soft as well now, and volumes are slightly negative, if I look at that part of the world, but I'm actually in that sense pleased that it's not yet the size of the business that we want it to be.  So amongst part of the worlds that are softest, it would be one of them and then you have individual spots that we haven't talked across some other parts of the world we mentioned briefly India, but broadly that is where we are on Eastern Europe.  And I hope for those people that the economy there is starting to pick up again in the near future, because it's really more of a function of the economy than of any of the competitive sets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So with that, I really appreciate your, the time that you've spent with us this morning and your interest obviously in the continuous progress of the company.  We're very encouraged and we continue to be encouraged by the progress we are making, expect if you like it or not more of the same in quarter four.  We're very pleased with the way that our strategy is rolling out, the strategy of bigger and better innovations obviously rolling them out faster.  I hope you got this, that feeling from our call this morning.  We will continue to step up our support levels behind these innovations.  It's absolutely key.  We have to continue to drive improvements in execution, in the marketplace, in costs, and Jim has given some excellent examples of the opportunities that we will have still.</p>
          <p>I continue to insist on very tight control to cash and working capital linked to compensation of everybody and you've seen the benefits from that.  And there is more to come.  And then obviously if you look at quarter four don't run ahead of yourselves once more.  We have an impact of the trading days.  We have the impacts of the lower pricing with the full-year effect that Jim talked about and I'm reading some analyst reports and I see some of you just being a little bit too euphorious versus what the realities of the market would suggest.  So I'm just in my usual candor and openness between all of us just don't run ahead of yourselves because it doesn't serve anything.  So, we're pleased with the way it's going and continue to appreciate your support and hopefully see you soon either on the road shows or in New Jersey.  Thanks for your time.</p>
