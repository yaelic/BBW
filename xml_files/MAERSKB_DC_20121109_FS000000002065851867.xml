          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk Interim Report Third Quarter 2012. Today, I am pleased to present the Group CEO, Nils S. Andersen, and Group CFO, Trond Westlie. For the first part of this call, all participants will be in listen-only mode. And afterwards there will be a question-and-answer session.</p>
          <p>Speakers, please begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much, and welcome to everybody to this morning call after the third quarter in 2012. And if you just read the forward-looking statements, while I just give a sort of quick rundown on how we see it. We are pleased with the result seen in total, US$933 million, we think, is reflecting a good and healthy development in most businesses.</p>
          <p>We have made a write-down on tankers, which, of course, means that the underlying result is slightly better than that figure. Maersk Line is back in black. We're very pleased with the results of Maersk Line in the third quarter. It's a mix, of course, of continued work on efficiency, as well as a positive rate development and also a rate development on Asia-Europe, where we've seen recently good development during the period.</p>
          <p>We also continued the good notes on Maersk Drilling on the long-term building plan of that business having signed a three-year contract with ConocoPhillips for the second drillship that will come out early 2014, so that now we have five out of the seven large new rigs that we ordered for the last couple of years, maybe on speculation, covered by contracts, great. We still have actually a year to go before even the first one is out on the water. And I think that indicates that we have timed that investment pretty well.</p>
          <p>We keep focus on expanding our activities in the Terminals business, as well. We have, during the quarter, signed an agreement to take over coal controlling shareholding in Global Ports in Russia, the largest port operator &#x2013; or terminal operator in that market. In addition to that, we are on a &#x2013; in growth load in Latin America. We took over the operations of Callao, Lima in Peru last year, expanding and modernizing that facility. And we expect to grow into operation in centers in the early part of 2013. So very good progress here as well.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the oil, we realized that the production figure is slightly less than we had &#x2013; we believed and or expected. The main reason for that is actually that we are delayed in the start-up of the crude on Gryphon, the FPSO in the UK that arrived late to station and came into bad weather and then we had some issues. We're getting right contractors at the right time. So we're struggling a little bit with that, and we hope the start-up would be efficient when it come on-stream, probably early next year.</p>
          <p>But having said that, overall, we're satisfied with the development and feel we are very well on-track to achieve our long-term goal. So with that, I will go through the presentation and I'll take you, if you please, to page number three, which is executing on the group strategy, the hard facts, a little bit more of the same. Maersk Line turned profit making for the year. And Asia-Europe is still the area where we see the most negative development in terms of volume, or the negative development in terms of volume. The other freights are still doing well, and that gives us some hope for a positive development in the global economy sometime soon in 2013.</p>
          <p>Maersk Oil was affected, as I've just said, by a number of factors. Gryphon was the unforeseen part of it. The others were basically in line with expectations.</p>
          <p>APM Terminals continued to improve its margin and grow its volume, irrespective of the new businesses that I just mentioned that are not really in the figures yet. And we're pleased with the development here.</p>
          <p>Maersk Drilling is doing, in the short-term, less well. We had a delayed start-up of one of the big rigs. And, of course, when we are talking day rates like you are today, this gives some major impact, in particular because we needed to do extra maintenance compared to our expectations. And then, as I said, an impairment of $267 million on tankers. We think that brings our values in the tanker segment more closely in line with the definitely not very positive asset valuations we're seeing there.</p>
          <p>And then, we have, if you go to page &#x2013; sorry, just a minute. If you go to the financial highlights on page four, you can &#x2013; this is our standard slide &#x2013; you can see where the good and the less good developments are. Clearly, the progress in the segment, if you compare to last year, is in Maersk Line. The decline in Maersk Oil is actually in line with expectations. It's more or less in line with expectations. We expect the production to bottom out over the coming years and then growing back to growth towards the 400,000 barrels target in 2020.</p>
          <p>Terminal, stable, the volumes in terminals &#x2013; I'll come back to that in a minute &#x2013; are under pressure in Europe and these other markets are compensating basically for that. Drilling, down, for the reason I've just mentioned &#x2013; and the expectation for the group for the year is operated or made more precise according to taste at $3.7 billion, which is approximately $300 million above the result of last year. So, we are satisfied with that.</p>
          <p>Taking you to page five, slide five, Maersk Line. Maersk Line was in the most positive element in the group this quarter with a profit of $500 million, against a loss last year, of course, in this quarter and the fourth quarter. They were very tough in the container business last year. This year, it looks a little bit better, which is also positive, of course, for the rate discussions that we will see &#x2013; that we'll see in the coming months that will cover 2013.</p>
          <p>We see volumes being in flat at 2.1 million FFE, against a quite strong quarter last year. So, that is reasonably satisfactory. The average rate is, of course, significantly above the level last year, which is what drives really the progress in results. And that also means that we've come up with an earnings per FFE, which is now $240 per FFE &#x2013; actually $241 per FFE, against a negative figure last year. So, very good progress, compared to last year and even slightly better result than we expected going into the quarter. So we're very pleased with that.</p>
          <p>We have announced a dry rate increase on November 1. This is part of our efforts to support the ongoing rate stability. And in order to prepare for the future, we've also announced significant rate increases in the reefer area from January 1, which we expect to be giving positive results. And they are reflecting the fact that the reefer business, that everybody thinks should be very profitable and it is, of course, very capital intensive and also quite costly to handle energy consumption-wise and so on, and this has not been reflected in rates. And so we just need to raise them, and what we're seeing at the moment in the market is that our competition sees the same need, to get this business back on track.</p>
          <p>You can &#x2013; on the bottom of the page, you can see the development in the rates. We are now clearly above and have been above for the last six months &#x2013; above the level of 2011. We are not at the 2010 level, clearly, but we are getting a little bit closer and we expect and hope to keep a more stable development from here than we've seen in the last three years.</p>
          <p>Going to page six, Maersk Oil. And, of course, the profit is affected by the 23% reduction in share of production. There is also a one-off charge of $72 million on US tax. Our UK tax, so that is down, compared to last year in the quarter. On the year, we now expect a result above last year. Of course, we should not forget that we have taken income from the Algerian tax settlement that we had in the first quarter this year. So, of course, the real underlying business is reflecting the lower volumes and giving a less strong result than we had last year.</p>
          <p>We are seeing a step-down in the contribution in Denmark or the volumes that we are getting in from Denmark. This is partly because of decline in the production. But the main effect here is actually that we have the Danish North Sea Fund in to take 20% ownership. It doesn't reflect the profitability, but it does reflect the amounts of oil that come to our &#x2013; into our hands.</p>
          <p>We've announced that the Caporolo discovery offshore Angola was made. And we've also closed now the last appraisal well on the Chissonga Field, with a positive result, which means that we expect to hand in a field development plan proposal to the Angolan authorities somewhere during the second half of 2013. So this is quite positive, as well.</p>
          <p>Exploration costs were slightly lower than we had expected. It's not a conscious decision from our side, but the rig market is very tight. And that means that a number of wells, both our owned/operated but also our partners' operated wells are being delayed. So there's a savings so to speak, but in reality a delay here and &#x2013; but we're still very active in the drilling area.</p>
          <p>Going through page seven on APM Terminals, no major developments in the results. Most of what I mentioned at the opening are future-oriented big moves. So APM Terminals continues its good development, in spite of quite tough economic environment, in particular, affecting Asia-Europe volumes. But, of course, the rate stability is much better here than it has traditionally been in the container shipping business. So it's mainly the volume effect. But we're working on the cost side, and we expect these figures to continue to develop in a positive sense over the coming years.</p>
          <p>I mentioned Global Ports in my opening. This is very important. We also opened the Wilhelmshaven container terminal, which is a very large, very efficient world-class terminal and we have a 30% share in this one. And then it's also mentioned here that we expect a &#x2013; expect to begin operations during the first quarter in 2013 in Santos, which will also contribute positive to earnings, we hope, relatively quickly.</p>
          <p>If you take page eight, Maersk Drilling, here the result was negatively affected by the delayed start-up of two rigs. Actually in this quarter, it's mainly one of the large semi-submersibles that has been delayed. That's the main effect, and we are back on operations. So these figures should start to normalize as we go into &#x2013; or as we are in the fourth quarter and going into 2013.</p>
          <p>The order situation is very positive. I mean the rate market is tight, as I mentioned before. In this business area, it helps us. So we have a very high level of utilization and a very good level also for contracting, making sure that we have some predictability in this area.</p>
          <p>We opened a very advanced simulation training center in Svendborg in Denmark to make sure that we can keep our operators on a very high level, with view of safety, onboard, of course, but also safety in what we do underground. So we continue our efforts to make this a real premium rig operator. And so far, the customer seems to trust us that we'll be able to do that.</p>
          <p>Taking you to page nine, the opportunistic core businesses, a little bit of a mixed bag. We have a decline in result in Maersk Supply Service. This is primarily because we had some business out of contract around the world and also that we've seen a disappointing spot market in the UK and, in particular, in the UK North Sea market.</p>
          <p>Maersk Tankers is doing, or losing slightly less than last year in the underlying business. The big loss you saw, or you will see in the figures when you read it is, of course, the write-down &#x2013; significant write-down on impairment of vessels that we've done.</p>
          <p>Damco is more or less in line with last year, continued to do a good job on growing, integrating its acquisitions and we're very confident in the continued positive development of this business.</p>
          <p>And Svitzer, doing better than last year, thanks to tariff increases, in particular in Harbour Towage, and then we've started off the Terminal Towage operation in Angola, which is also helping. So good development in these &#x2013; on some of these not-so-big businesses and then some issues with the spot rates in particular in the supply services in the North Sea.</p>
          <p>And with that, I will hand you over to Trond, who will take you through the consolidated financial information on page 10.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Nils, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Then we're on slide 10, then we'd start on the column to the left on the third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Starting on the revenue line, we have a revenue of $14.6 billion. Comparing to third quarter last year, it's a slight decline of $700 million. Most of that comes out of the effect of the &#x2013; of Maersk Oil reduction in Qatar and Denmark, specifically. There is a slight revenue increase from Maersk Line. And then we have a currency effect in the retail sector that goes on a negative way, and that comprises basically the total of the $700 million of shortage from last year.</p>
          <p>On the EBITDA number, we're delivering $3.344 billion and a depreciation of $1.444 billion. The $1.444 billion, of course, includes the impairment of $267 million from tankers in the third quarter. The gain on sale is primarily Peregrino that was closed in July. Peregrino was a gain of $177 million in total, out of the $108 million and then we deliver then the earnings before interest and tax of $2.141 million, slightly up from last year.</p>
          <p>The financial cost is on the average for the quarters &#x2013; this quarter, as well. And as a result, will deliver a profit before tax of just short of $2 billion, or $1.961 billion. The tax charge this quarter is down to 52%. The reason for that is, of course, that oil and gas has a reduced impact on the profit before tax relative to last year and, as a result, we have a tax charge of $1.28 billion. That leaves us the profit before the period of $933 million.</p>
          <p>Going then to the cash flow, we see that we have a good operational cash flow this quarter of $2.8 billion, almost half of what we have so far throughout the year and a CapEx net of sales proceeds is $678 million. And that is, of course, the net of sales from the Peregrino of $1.250 billion. That, sort of, is netted out in that number.</p>
          <p>Net interest-bearing debt slightly increased, about $14.8 billion. And that means that we actually get with the results of $933 million, we have a return on the invested capital of 8.3%.</p>
          <p>If we then just compare some of the clean numbers out there, the profit for the period is $933 million. If we take the clean number effect of this quarter, the number is $979 million. The earnings per share in US dollars is $197 million and the earnings per share for the third quarter in Danish kroners is DKK1,178.</p>
          <p>Just to spend just a slight more time on this slide here, on the nine-month of 2012 numbers. So far this year, we're delivering profit for the period of $3.073 billion. That, of course, includes some of the one-off effects, specifically the Algerian tax case. But if you take the one-off effects out of that number, the clean number of the first nine months is $1.929 billion. The cash flow for the first nine months is $5.6 billion and the CapEx net of sales proceeds is then $3.6 billion, so a good cash flow.</p>
          <p>And from then, I'm going to page number 11, on the development in net interest-bearing debt. And as you can see, starting off, that's the &#x2013; for the nine-month period, so we're starting off in the beginning of the year of net debt of $15.3 billion. All in all, we are taking it down $500 million to $14.8 billion; EBITDA of $9.5 billion; an increase in working capital of $900 million; taxes paid on $2.4 billion; CapEx on $3.8 billion is, of course, netted with the sales proceeds of $3.2 billion, so the gross effect is $7 billion; financial items, $0.7 billion; and dividend $900 million. The $900 million is the A.P. M&#xF8;ller-Maersk dividend of $750 million and $150 million is minority dividends throughout the year for different subsidiaries in the group. That leaves us at the $14.8 billion at the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Then going to the outlook on page 12, as we have said earlier, we are adjusting the expected result for 2012 to around $3.7 billion. That is including the impairment of the $267 million Maersk Tankers, as we have recognized in the third quarter. Cash flow used for capital expenditures is expected to be lower than 2011, while the cash flow from operating activities is expected to be at the same level as 2011.</p>
          <p>Maersk Line still expects modest positive results in 2012, based on higher average rates in the second half of the year. And we have taken down, slightly, the global demand for seaborne containers. And that is now expected to increase by 3% in 2012.</p>
          <p>Maersk Oil is expecting a result of 2012 above the result for 2011, and that is including the impact of the settlement from the Algerian tax dispute, and that was an income of $900 million. The expected result is based on the share of production of 258,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, that is down from previously 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and we're basing that on an average oil price of $110 a barrel for the remainder of the year. The exploration costs, we are also taking down from around $1 billion to now around $900 million due to some postponements that is postponed into 2013.</p>
          <p>APM Terminals still expects a result for 2012 above 2011 and above market share growth in volume, supported by the portfolio expansions.</p>
          <p>Maersk Drilling expects a result below 2011, mainly due to the delayed start-ups on the two new contracts.</p>
          <p>The total result for all other activities is still expected to be lower, excluding divestment gains and impairments. And that is due to lower expected result in Dansk Supermarked and Maersk Supply Service.</p>
          <p>And, as always, we are subject to considerable uncertainty, not least due to developments in the global economy but also due to freight rates, bunker price, currency elements, among other things. So we have put up a sensitivity table for the remainder of 2012 on this slide.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll give the word back to you, Nils.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So, taking on to slide 13, final remarks, basically saying that we continue with our strategy of prioritizing investments in the four large business units. Maersk Line is not going to invest significant amounts of money in the next years. At least, that's not what we foresee. The main focus in Maersk Line will be on profitability &#x2013; absolute profitability, meaning that we will work hard to get a reasonable rate environment in the industry. We'll work on our cost, and the objective is to be 5% better in terms of EBIT margin than the competition. We have the Capital Market Day also announcing other few things around Maersk Line, including that Maersk Line is supposed to grow with the market, not above the market and only, in so far, as it can grow on its own cash flow going forward.</p>
          <p>Maersk Oil is working on its exploration to get 400,000 barrels a day of production in 2020. We realized that this involves investments and CapEx and so on. But the good news is that we have made a number of finds and feel that we're well-equipped, at least we have the good areas, the good finds to invest in. So we feel very good on way we are &#x2013; as I said earlier, we're going through a phase now where production is bottoming out, and we will expect to come back to growth in the coming years. So, a very exciting business to invest in.</p>
          <p>APM Terminals is going on with its very ambitious expansion investment program. We still feel times are very good for this. We are ahead, in particular, in developing markets, a welcomed investor. And we intend to use that window of opportunity that we have here to build a profitable and solid business.</p>
          <p>In Maersk Drilling, with its seven large drilling rigs on order is, of course, not yet &#x2013; until we got those deliveries starting in 2014 &#x2013; not yet in a position to show figures, reflecting our ambitions during 2013. But given the order situation and the backlog we have of orders here, we think we've timed the investment right and are very optimistic about the long-term development of this business, as well.</p>
          <p>So we remain committed to profitable growth. We also remain committed to being open and in dialogue with our shareholders and, of course, also look to distributing a fair dividend with the objective to increase the absolute level of dividend, and that is the absolute sum in Danish krona that we pay out per share, whenever we feel there is a business &#x2013; the business gives reason and possibilities to sustain such increases in the long-term.</p>
          <p>And with that, thank you for listening. You've been in a listening mode for long. We look forward to receiving your questions and we'll, as usual, do our best to give you answers. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Christopher Combe from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. My first question relates to your final remarks on the $1 billion profitability guidance. So if I understand it correctly, due to backlogs, those targets have pushed back slightly, compared to the Capital Markets Day? And if that's the case, can you give us a bit more detail as to how many of the assets in the order book you see as delayed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We haven't pushed anything back. As far as I'm concerned, we said that we would have APM Terminals on $1 billion in 2016, which is what we're saying again here and drilling within the planning period. So it's around 2018. We don't see any &#x2013; I'm sure there's a risk of delays when the oil sector is heating up in delivery of the drilling rigs. At the moment, we don't see any concrete signs of that. So we expect that rigs we have on order to go into operation, starting from early 2014 and then during 2015. So, they will all be &#x2013; those rigs will all be in operation well before the end of the planning period. Then, of course, we have to see how many we order. And that depends very much on the opportunities to get long-term contracts and how the market develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's very clear. Switching to liners, speaking to forwarders in the recent weeks and looking at the Shanghai indices, it does look like $300 to $400 of the proposed hikes have stuck to Northern Europe. However, uncertainty still seems high. And looking at today's numbers, we see declines in both net and Northern European rates. How defensible do you think the success, thus far, can be? And could it suggest a permanent suspension of the AE9, or potentially sacrificing some more market share to maintain your average rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we improved a quite a bit of market &#x2013; market capacity out. So we definitely feel that we have done our share, having seen good results from it. And now we expect others to behave responsibly, as well. I mean, if you don't &#x2013; if you can't fill in your vessels, of course, it's better to reduce your capacity, you save it &#x2013; at least you save the cost. It's much better other than going out in rate &#x2013; in rating decreases.</p>
          <p>I think, the market has learned something from the price wars of 2009 and 2011. And at the moment, the signs are reasonably good. So we're not na&#xEF;ve and think that &#x2013; and rule out that there'll be new price skirmishes here and there on various roots. But at the moment, we think it looks reasonably okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and very last one &#x2013; if you look forward to 2013, what's sort of your base case assumption for global container demand growth? Is it roughly in line with the current year? Just trying to get some sense of what your underlying assumptions are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>We're not giving any figures out for 2013. I think, the big question mark is really how does it &#x2013; how does the European consumer demand behave really. That is, at the moment, the European markets are quite depressed. We see, of course, shipments to Europe being low, probably also reflecting some reductions in stocks. And we need to see a reverse in that too, to see a return to, say, growth rates that are higher than the 3% we got this year. But we haven't given any figures out for next year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, gentlemen. A couple of questions, first of all, to oil and gas. You have earlier guided that we should expect lower production in 2012 and 2013 and then flattening out, bottoming out in 2014? Looking at your production numbers now and what you have given us, is that still going to be the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't see any negative developments in the mid-to-long term production forecast that we have come out with. We have had an unforeseen &#x2013; or a decline this year that is slightly bigger than we had foreseen, primarily because of the delayed start-up in Gryphon in the UK sector.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then another question just to your earnings &#x2013; now you're guiding on $3.7 billion, including this impairment. That leaves you with only, about what &#x2013; just some $500 million, about $600 million for Q4. And you did clean closer to $1 billion in Q3. What should take down earnings when you look at your forecast for Q4?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Q3 is usually a good quarter in terms of the trade volumes. So, at the end of the year, container volumes tend to slow down a little bit. But it's, of course, also reflecting the fact that we are living in an uncertain environment. We are seeing the oil price probably being a little bit weaker than you could hope for, and then you have the uncertainty on rates in container business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my final question &#x2013; now, you've done an upgrade. And that, of course also include this impairment on cash in effect. Should we be looking for positive free cash flow this year in a group level?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I don't think we should expand more than what we're actually saying in the guiding. And, I guess, it speaks for itself. Generally, we are saying that we want to have, sort of, a balance between the CapEx spending and the operational cash flow, and to be more precise than that is difficult.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. I've got three questions, if I may. First of all, on Maersk Oil, the tax rate in Q3 was 79%, which was quite high. Could you just confirm whether that included any exceptional items, or was the higher tax rate there just a reflection of the 20% stake taken by the Danish North Sea Fund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the effect there is mostly the UK effect, a one-off effect of $72, as a result of the implication of the new tax roll on removal costs in the UK sector. And that is a one-off effect of $72 that's in that. So if you exclude that, you're getting into a normal level for oil and gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then, just speaking on Maersk Oil, could you provide some sense of the extent which profitability there was impacted by the unscheduled maintenance in Denmark at the beginning of September? And also was that maintenance completed by the end of September, or will profitability in Q4 be impacted as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the effect of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:38:16) was basically that &#x2013; it has an effect during the third quarter of approximately...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well it was a minor effect basically, a small effect during the third quarter. It was finished during the third quarter and is now up and running, basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then, just finally on Maersk Line, just on the two main east-west routes of head-haul Asia-Europe and head-haul Trans-Pacific. Could you provide some color on your expectations of volume growth on those trade lanes in the mid-term, by which, I mean maybe the next five years or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a long time. And we expect &#x2013; I think the best answer is probably, to give you some macro feel, we expect the US to be developing relatively well. We think they're back to growth, and with the help of shale oil and shale gas and so on, I think they will have a reasonably good development in the economic in the five-year period.</p>
          <p>Europe is much more difficult to predict, because here we have a lot of structure issues that needs to be attended to. I think it's fair to say that we expect the European issues to be solved during 2013 in terms of this the uncertainty around certain countries and so on. So we expect a model to be found. But that doesn't remove the fact that we have a high level of debt &#x2013; government debt in Europe. And that means that we are set up for period of slow growth.</p>
          <p>We believe that when we hit &#x2013; you can say the decline period that we've seen in 2012, volumes in Asia and Europe really declined starting from June. When we come into that period, I think we will see stabilization and probably a positive development again. But that's totally guesswork; we haven't done our forecast for 2013 yet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Two questions for me on Maersk Oil. First, can you discuss how you think about production decline on your mature fields and what you generally expect to see on an annual basis, perhaps going towards the 2020 target?</p>
          <p>And second, we saw strong production from the UK quarter-over-quarter, excluding the Gryphon FPSO, can you give us a bit more color on expectations at Gryphon and perhaps how we should look at the UK going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we do &#x2013; we actually do see quite a lot of investments from our side in UK in the coming years. It's sort of one of the areas that we really invest in. Golden Eagle is, of course, a major project that we're going in, but we do quite a lot of near field exploration and production expansions, as well. So we actually expect UK to be a growing producer of oil for us over the coming years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And anything on production decline on your mature fields in Denmark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, we've &#x2013; there's an extraordinary drop this year because of the taking in of the North Sea Fund. But having said that, we do expect a decline also in Denmark over the coming years. We expect &#x2013; we're investing then in Norway, of course, where we expect better figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

          <p>Our next question comes from Ms. Penny Butcher from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, miss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions from my side. The first is, you mentioned in the slides, with regards to the volume trends in Maersk Line in the quarter. Obviously, we were I think very aware of the Asia-Europe issues in terms of volumes. But you also mentioned Africa declined and showed a substantial weakness in the quarter. Can you give some explanation behind why that was the case, or is it one-off in nature?</p>
          <p>And the second question from my side is, just recently, you participated in the capital increase at Danske Bank. I just wanted to understand the thought process behind that. Your Investor Day presentations highlighted that your focus of investments was going to be majority on the core four divisions. How does the reinvestment in Danske fit within that portfolio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think your last question is, of course, spot on. On the Capital Market Day, we said at the Capital Market Day that we would support the Danish retail operation, as well as the bank in their plans, but expected both to be self-financing. So at that time, we were not aware of the potential capital increase in Danske Bank.</p>
          <p>We decided to go with it for two reasons. First of all, because we were convinced by the Board of Danske Bank that this was important for the bank to get a good credit rating going forward, also in taking into account the Basel III. We think Danske Bank is now excellently capitalized and hope there'll be no need for further capital injections.</p>
          <p>The other reason was that we wanted to maintain our ownership share. We believe this is, in itself, a good investment. And coming then to Africa, it is true that we have given away some market share in Africa during this quarter. Africa is a core region for us. We're seeing strong growth in profitability on the back of giving away some market share. But we will definitely fight to keep our market share in Africa. And I think also, here we deliver a very, very good service. We have very, very strong organizations in place country-by-country. So we'll be able to support that business very well going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Gianmarco Bonacina from Equita. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Three questions. The first one is a follow-up on the tax rate in Maersk Oil. Basically, excluding the one-off charges due to the tax in the UK, the tax rate was 73%, which was higher than the second quarter, which was below 70%. So can you explain why the tax rate actually increased versus last quarter, considering that you should have a positive impact from the sale of the stake in the Danish consortium?</p>
          <p>The second question is about Gryphon FPSO. If you can confirm when exactly that will come again in production? And also, what could be the contribution in terms of the barrels of oil per day?</p>
          <p>And basically, the last question is recently you announced a small acquisition in UK oil and gas. So, you increased the stake in a field. Was that included in the third quarter, or will that be included in the fourth quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a lot of good questions. We expect Gryphon to go on production &#x2013; starting production at the beginning of next year. But, of course, we had to hook up the wells one at a time, so it will take a time until it's back to full production. And we hope it will get up to the range of 20,000 barrels a day, more or less. So that's the plan for that. I can't tell you whether the additional 30% of &#x2013; in the UK is in actually in the third quarter or not.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It doesn't close during the third quarter, or it's coming into the fourth quarter. And when it comes to the tax rates <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:47:34) we have said earlier that we will come into a period of increasing tax rates due to the fact that we have start-up costs in countries that we do not have the revenue to counter, sort of, the start-up costs.</p>
          <p>So as a result of sort of increasing the activities in countries like Kazakhstan or Kurdistan, Angola, as well as, to some extent, also the US, that means that we are going into the increasing rates as a result of that. So that means that the rates will vary from quarter to quarter, but the standard level as &#x2013; or the guiding as we have given that the coming from the last year's rate of just above the 70%, we are going to see a couple of years of increasing percentage points if you exclude the one-offs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Just again on the Gryphon, because in your report, page 16, you say that Gryphon will start production in Q4 2012. So that's not correct. So it will be next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are in the process of doing the hookup on Gryphon, as we speak. And they are lifting the risers. So the plan is to actually have the first oil, relative to &#x2013; on the upgraded Gryphon before year-end. But it's not going to come any serious production as a result of that. This is very much due to the weather conditions in the North Sea. So there is a risk of postponements, as a result of the weather risk. That actually is just ongoing as we speak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Lars Heindorff from ABG Sundal Collier. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hello, everybody. A couple of questions, as well. Regarding the oil and gas division, just sort of a clarification question here. The increased tax, the decommissioning relief tax, is that a one-off? Is that something that would affect you going forward as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the answer is that it is a one-off because it is a change of rule. So it's an accumulated effect on the historic effects. So it is a one-off. But, of course, that will mean &#x2013; so we won't say that amount again. But, of course, when we are reevaluating the ongoing effect, it will have a rolling effect. But basically, it's a one-off with this kind of amount but the tax rate is then increasing in UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us an idea, an indication about how much?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's not going to be significant. You're not going to register the numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Same question also regarding oil and gas <mark type="ph" /> Qatar indiscernible] (0:50:33) in the third quarter was 34%. You indicated during the Capital Market Day that that will be flattish going forward? I just want to make sure that that's still the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Basically, it will be flattish. But it is, of course, depending on the liftings we actually do every quarter and sort of the balancing of the inventory. So it's not like a straight line <mark type="ph" /> with commas (0:50:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it's also a matter or a result of the investments that we do. So the next &#x2013; you can say the next uplift or the next positive effect from investments on volumes, you will see when we start investing in the field development plan that's for approval now with the &#x2013; with Qatar Petroleum.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Can you give us a timing on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if we &#x2013; as you know, as long as we don't invest, this will decline. And that's what Trond is saying, so we will see this dipping in the coming quarters until we see effects of the investments in the next field development plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, got it. Then regarding the container business, unit cost, down actually quite significantly. You stated that your bunker cost down by 15%. The bunker prices are only down by 1%. Can you give us a bit more flavor on that? I mean, have you slow-steamed more? And have you done other stuff on that in order to lower the unit cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's a &#x2013; there are two effects you have to keep in mind. First of all, we are going to super-slow steaming on backhauls on a number of trades. And that gives us an additional saving. On top of that, you can't compare the unit, the oil price or the bunker price decline <mark type="ph" /> in &#x2013; quarterly (0:52:30) you have to look at the previous quarter, because the consumption of oil is actually three months old oil on average, more or less; this is a rough figure. And we did go through a period early summer this year, if I'm not mistaken, where the bunker price was very low.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last question regarding the rates. One of your key competitors have just recently &#x2013; the other day announced a $600 rate increase for December 15 on Asia-Europe. Now we've seen that the rate increases on November 1 have been sort of I would say reasonably successful. Do you expect to follow along those lines as the MSC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't comment on the statements from MSC  because this is &#x2013; there's so many rate increases going on. And we just have to try to follow our way, which is pushing up rates to a reasonable level. The next big project we have is the reefer. The reefer increase &#x2013; but of course, if the markets allow, yes, we will take further increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, gentlemen. I've got two questions, one following on from the gentleman who talked about bunker. Do you see Q4 bunker expenses broadly similar level to Q3, i.e., will capacity reductions in the fourth quarter offset the autumn spot price increase?</p>
          <p>And secondly, could you give us some idea of the approximate share of your total container volume that is reefer. And finally, could you say a few words on the strategic logic to your investment in Global Ports and your interest in Russia generally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sure. The interest in Russia and Global Ports is very simple, that is the growth markets &#x2013; a growth market, and we don't have any exposure of significance to Russia, which is an important economy with recently good growth prospects. In terms of the bunker prices, the bunker cost going into Q4, we'll expect the work on super-slow steaming to continue. And even if the oil price is keeping up relatively well, what we're seeing is a good development in the crack, which is the spread between bunker and crude oil prices. So we have reasons to be reasonably optimistic for bunker costs in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question. I can't tell you exactly. We have a global market share, I think, on reefer on about 24%, something like that. And the global share on dry is probably around 14%, 15%. So we are higher on reefer than we are on dry.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Finn Bjarke Petersen from Nordea. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. A question to rates in Maersk Line and a question to exploration cost in Maersk Oil. If we take the rate development, if we look at your &#x2013; what you have presented this morning on page 20, it is that your rates are actually de-railing the CCFI index and going up in September. How do you see this develop into the next quarter and next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have actually said that this would happen at the last quarter, because we had a number of contracts coming up for renewals. And we were a little bit behind the developments in spot over the summer simply because we, as you know, have a lot &#x2013; more long-term contracts than the market on average.</p>
          <p>And we continue that effort and we believe that there's a lot of contract renewables over the next quarters that will happen at better rates than the historic ones. So we are reasonably optimistic of maintaining a fair level &#x2013; or fair rate development over the coming months, but more precise than that I can't be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more or less saying beating the market in the next quarters. Is that what you're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I may be hoping it, but I'm not saying it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Finally...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I am saying, though, is that these spot indexes are normally not the best predictor of Maersk Line indexes. We've seen it again and again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but this was the CCFI, which you claim is a good indicator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We claim it's a better indicator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good. Maersk Oil &#x2013; lower exploration cost and lower exploration cost in the rest of the year. And I understand that's roughly $200 million less than the previous guidance. Should we expect the $200 million extra next year? And could you give a flavor of where you have saved cost and where you expect to use in the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't expect to move &#x2013; I mean, we try to balance our exploration levels around the figures we have said at the Capital Market Day. Some years, it will be a little bit higher. Some years, it will be a little bit lower. The effect this year is mainly delays, but we'll probably see then other things being postponed, as well. Because there is a lack of drilling rigs. And it's basically all over the world. We have delays in getting in &#x2013; drillings done in Africa, we have delays in the US. So it's all over the place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's saying, next year, you're still around 100 &#x2013; sorry, $1 billion? <mark type="indiscernible" /> (0:58:59) next year estimates?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just finally, if I could have one final question. You're reducing your production numbers for the year by 7,000. Could you give a split on that change of the guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 2,000, I believe, is coming out of Denmark, the unplanned close-down. And then, we have a &#x2013; really, very, very rough figures. A little less than half of the remaining decline is coming out of higher prices on average in Qatar, giving us lower volumes, and the rest is Gryphon, very roughly.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. Beat Keiser from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Two questions, please. First, can you give us an indication regarding the revenue per move generated in APM Terminals, if you adjust for those divestments of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:00:01) activities you did in the North America over the last couple of quarters, i.e., have you seen some pricing pressure there?</p>
          <p>And then the second question relates to Trans-Pacific. What's your view on the rates and supply and demand, in general, as we see some bigger vessels now being cascaded onto this route? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you detailed figures on the lifting rates in the US terminals, unfortunately. Of course, there's pressure all over the place but we do see good rate stability in the terminal businesses, in general. In terms of the rate forecasting for the US, we don't have any specific forecast for any parts of the future, in particular, not long-term. But as I said before, we expect a reasonably good economic development and that should mean that there will be some room for additional capacity in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a quick follow-up on terminals then. I mean, the trend overall, I think, have you &#x2013; I mean, for example, in Europe, I would think that there was some pressure on the revenue per move. Have you seen that as well, or what's the view of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't &#x2013; I can't comment on that. We haven't seen unusual pressures on rates. We would expect, of course, pressure on rates when the markets are going down. But in general, the terminals have been much more successful in avoiding giving prices concessions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. That's helpful.</p>

          <p>Our next question comes from Mr. William Foggon from Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I just got a couple of questions, first of all, on your average freight rates in Q3. Was there any change in the proportion of your contracts that were on spot, i.e., did any of your long-term contract customers pull out of their contracts and go on to the spot markets? Or do they remain firm on the contracts? And also, how that's expected to continue in Q4? And secondly, just a question on drilling. So you have 100% contracts coverage for Q4. Just to confirm, is there expected to be any maintenance down-time in the remainder of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have very good forecast on, of course, the last quarter. We should know &#x2013; and we also have very good contract coverage next year. I can't tell you whether there's any planned maintenance taking place on smaller rigs, but I'm not aware of anything on the bigger ones in the last quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on Maersk Line, the proportion of your customers on contract versus spot, did any of your major customers pull out of contracts, trying to take advantage of lower spot rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, it's not been a very big problem, because the spot rates have been, in general, above the contract rates. So we haven't seen any changes to that. And I also have to say that we're getting much better managing contracts. So we don't get that situation as often, although it's difficult, completely, to avoid. But people who have previously broken contracts with us, of course, we have also readjusted contracts with them, when we saw the spot rates were significantly above the levels seen in the contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's interesting that contract rates are still below spot rates...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...during Q3.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll have a last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our last question comes from Mr. Dan Togo from Handelsbanken. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. One final question here from me. On the backhaul Asia-Europe, you are cutting back capacity, you are slow-steaming and you are still increasing the volumes here. Utilization must be improving. What about rates? Are you getting a fair compensation above cost here or &#x2013; and are rates increasing here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have seen improved rates compared to where we were a year ago. Backhaul rates have been one of the areas that we have adjusted upwards in the industry. Of course, the rates are still relatively low, reflecting the fact that you have excess capacity and also the kinds of commodities that we're transporting, which is a lot of waste paper and scrap metal, one of the reasons why the customers also don't mind that we are super-slow steaming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But where are the &#x2013; can you give us some &#x2013; where are the rates relative to front-haul rates vis-&#xE0;-vis last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't give you the exact figure on that, Dan. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So that concludes this conference call. Thank you very much for listening in. As I said in the opening, we are reasonably pleased with the third quarter result. We're also pleased that we're able to slightly upgrade and give a more precise forecast for the year. And, of course, we'll work now very hard on all the four key businesses to get in line with our long-term plan and continue to expand within this window of opportunity that we see both on the oil and drilling and the terminals business. So we see a very exciting business opportunities at the moment, a lot of hard work and probably a relatively slow global recovery. But we feel really well-placed to take advantage of the opportunities. So, thank you, once again, for listening in. And we look forward to talking to you when we come with the full year results in February. Have a good day.</p>
