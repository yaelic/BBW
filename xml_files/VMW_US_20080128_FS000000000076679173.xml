With me on this call are Diane Greene, VMware's President and CEO, and Mark Peek, VMware's CFO. Both Mark and Diane will present prepared remarks and afterwards, we will open up the lines to take your questions. Additionally, we will be presenting slides today. A webcast of these slides can be viewed at our investor relations webpage on vmware.com.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that statements made in today's discussion that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements subject to the Safe Harbor provisions under Federal Securities Laws. These statements are based on current expectations as of the date of this call and are subject to uncertainties and changes in condition, significance, value and effect as well as other risks detailed in documents filed with the SEC, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2007, that may cause the actual results to differ materially from those set forth in our statements.</p>
          <p>In addition, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of VMware's performance, should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, measures of VMware's financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. You can find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures in our earnings releases for the period ended September 30, and December 31, 2007 and in the webcast slides available on the Investor Relations page of our website.

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm very happy to share our financial results from the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2007. I will also be providing our financial outlook for 2008.</p>
          <p>This is another strong quarter for VMware, as we successfully closed the year in which we grew revenues 88%, delivered non-GAAP operating margins within our target range, and entered 2008 with a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, worldwide revenue for the company was $412 million growing 80% over the fourth quarter of 2006. Revenue consisted of 69% license and 31% services. License revenue was $284 million, an increase of 75% compared to Q4 2006. License revenue growth was primarily driven by sales of our third generation Virtualization software suite, VMware Infrastructure 3.</p>
          <p>GAAP operating income was $76 million, an increase of 109% from the same period last year. Diluted GAAP EPS was $0.19 compared to $0.09 for the same period a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $108 million, which represents 72% growth from the same period a year ago. Calculated on a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS was $0.26 compared to $0.15 for Q4 2006. Total revenue for 2007 was $1.33 billion, up 88% from 2006. The revenue mix consisted of 68% license and 32% services.</p>
          <p>GAAP operating income for the year was $235 million, an increase of 95% from 2006. Diluted GAAP EPS for 2007 was $0.61 compared to $0.26 for 2006. Non-GAAP operating income in 2007 was $338 million, which represents 77% growth from 2006. Calculated on a non-GAAP basis, diluted EPS grew 95% to $0.82 a share compared to $0.42 in 2006.</p>
          <p>For 2007, license revenue was $905 million, an increase of 84% compared to 2006. From 2005 to 2006, license revenue grew 71%. Service revenue consisting of support, subscription and professional services was $421 million, an increase of 98% from 2006.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter services revenue was $128 million, an increase of 90% compared to Q4 2006. Total U.S. revenue for 2007 grew 84% from a year ago to $721 million and international revenue increased 94% to $605 million. For 2007, U.S. revenue represented 54% of total revenue. U.S. revenues for Q4 grew 67% from a year ago to $215 million and international revenue grew 96% to $197 million. U.S. revenue represented 52% of total revenue in Q4. We saw strength in all international markets as we continued to invest globally in sales, marketing, and product support.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, all of our sales are in U.S. dollars, and so our growth rates reflects no benefit from currency translation.</p>
          <p>The Q4 dollar value of license orders on transactions of less than $50,000 was 58% of the dollar value of total license orders. This compares to 65% in Q4 of last year. Increasingly, customers see the value in standardizing on our VI3 solution architecture throughout their organizations. We see that customers have had an increasing interest in Enterprise License Agreements with a typical service contract length of three years.</p>
          <p>We view our solid long-term relationship with our customers as being healthy for the business. Although, our overall transaction size is increasing, we continue to be a high-volume transaction business as evidenced by the nearly 60% of our license order dollar value resulting from transactions under $50,000.</p>
          <p>In connection with the segment disclosure in our annual audited financial statements, we are providing a breakout of 2007 license revenue into two product categories: Virtualization Platform Products and Virtual Infrastructure Management and Automation. Virtualization Platform Products include our ESX Server hypervisor, VMware Workstation and other foundational products that are used to build virtualization solutions. The ESX hypervisor provides the core virtualization functionality and the enabling capabilities for our Virtual Infrastructure Management and Automation products.</p>
          <p>Virtual Infrastructure Management and Automation products include products such as VMotion, VirtualCenter, High Availability, Distributed Resource Management, and Online Backup that leverage the unique benefits of our virtualization platforms to automate tasks such as resource management, availability, mobility, security, and desktop management.</p>
          <p>In 2007, Platform Products represented 38% of license revenue, compared to 57% of license revenue in 2006. For 2007, Infrastructure Management and Automation products represented 62% of license revenue, an increase from 43% in license revenue in 2006. We believe this trend clearly demonstrates that our customers increasingly value the ongoing operational benefits and return on investment they receive from our infrastructure automation and management products.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn to the details on the rest of the income statement. We, of course, report under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, however, we view our non-GAAP operating income as the key profitability measure of our financial performance. As a reminder in calculating our non-GAAP operating income, we make three adjustments to operating income calculated under GAAP, two that increase operating profit and one that generally decreases our non-GAAP results.</p>
          <p>First, we exclude charges for stock-based compensation calculated under FAS 123R. Second, we exclude the amortization of purchased intangibles and any write-offs associated with in-process research and development of acquisitions. Today, most of our purchased intangibles are the result of the required accounting on our financial statements of EMC's acquisition of VMware in 2004.</p>
          <p>Finally, we adjust for the net effect of FAS86 capitalized software development. Here, we subtract the amortization of capitalized software or adding back any capitalized software costs during the period. This adjustment can be either an increase or a decrease to GAAP operating income in any given quarter.</p>
          <p>As Mike mentioned earlier, the non-GAAP information being shared with you today should be considered in conjunction with our GAAP operating results, which are available in our earnings release and on our website.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $108 million or 26% of revenues, compared to $63 million in Q4 of 2006 or 27% of revenues. That's a year-over-year increase of 72%. For a company of VMware's size with growth rates of these levels, operating margins are going to have some level of volatility, because we're continuously investing in the long-term opportunity, we caution you to not read too much into incremental increases or decreases in our non-GAAP operating margin.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost and expense lines on a non-GAAP basis, the year-over-year comparisons are less meaningful and so the following comparisons are sequential for Q3 2007 as a percentage of revenue. Total non-GAAP cost of revenues was $49 million, or 12% of revenues consistent as a percentage of revenue to Q3 2007. Non-GAAP research and development was $93 million or 23% of revenues, a modest increase in percentage terms from Q3. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were 129 million, or 31% of revenue a modest decrease as a percentage of revenue from Q3. And non-GAAP G&amp;A increased to 33 million or 8% of revenue also a modest decrease as a percentage of revenue from Q3 2007. Moving forward, we will continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth.</p>
          <p>In closing 2007, we adjusted our annual tax rate to 9% for GAAP, and 14% for non-GAAP. This adjustment benefited diluted EPS for both GAAP and non-GAAP by $0.01 during Q4.</p>
          <p>Now, let's turn to the balance sheet and our cash flow statement. Our cash balance as of December 31 increased by nearly $100 million from Q3 to $1.2 billion. Long-term debt remained at $450 million. As of December 31, 2007, deferred revenue was $553 million, a year-over-year increase of 80% compared to December 31, 2006 and a $126 million sequential increase from Q3. One of the factors driving this growth is the continued trend of customers purchasing multi-year contracts for our service and subscription offerings. During the quarter, the average support contracts signed was approximately 25 months. Deferred revenue includes approximately $54 million of deferred license revenue. We recognized revenue and deferred revenue from our x86 system vendor partners in arrears when they make binding royalty reports to us. The OEMs typically report one to two months in arrears.</p>
          <p>As a result, license revenue and deferred services revenue from the November, December timeframe, will be recognized in Q1 of 2008. Q4 reflects revenue and deferred revenue reported during the quarter from OEM bookings in August and September, like last quarter there is some sequential increase expected, which will benefit Q1 2008.</p>
          <p>Our GAAP operating cash flows were $164 million for the quarter compared to 125 million of operating cash flows for Q4 of 2006. For 2007, our GAAP operating cash flows were $552 million compared to $280 million in 2006. On a non-GAAP basis, we historically adjusted for the EMC related balance sheet accounts. We did that because of the relatively large swings in the size of our intercompany balances with EMC prior to becoming a public company. We are now regularly clearing these intercompany accounts.</p>
          <p>On a non-GAAP basis, we reduced our GAAP operating cash flows by subtracting amounts capitalized under FAS 86 because these are classified in our GAAP cash flow statements as investing activity. On a non-GAAP basis, our operating cash flows were 149 million for the quarter compared to 121 million for Q4 of 2006. Because cash flows can vary based on the timing of the payments for working capital items, we believe it is more meaningful to look at cash flows over a longer time horizon.</p>
          <p>In 2007, our non-GAAP operating cash flows were $504 million compared to $247 million for 2006, an increase of 104%. On a fully diluted basis, weighted average shares outstanding for Q4 were 403 million. These share counts are calculated using the treasury stock method. Based on this method, the Q1 '08 share count could change as additional equity compensation is issued to new employees or if there are significant changes in our stock prices.</p>
          <p>I will now provide you with our financial outlook for 2008. Last quarter, we provided you with guidance on our non-GAAP operating margins and certain other items including share count to calculate EPS and stock-based compensation. We have decided to continue to provide this form of guidance as well as revenue and tax rate guidance for the full year 2008. I would like to remind you that our guidance constitutes forward-looking statements under the Federal Securities Laws and reflects VMware's expectations as of the date of this conference call.</p>
          <p>Actual results may differ materially from those projected, due to a number of factors including the factors referenced in our press release and in the slides available on our website accompanying this call, as well as the other risk factors detailed in our filings with Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent periodic report on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30th, 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenue for 2008 is expected to grow approximately 50% compared to 2007. Our expectation for revenue growth considers a number of factors; the increasing size of our revenue base, an increasing number of competing companies marketing their intent to introduce virtualization products, and our continued strategy to make VMware technologies the new platform for datacenter virtualization through broad proliferation. It is also important to remember that all of our sales are U.S. dollar denominated and our expected growth rate does not reflect any benefit from currency translation.</p>
          <p>Consistent with 2007, our non-GAAP operating margins for 2008 is expected to remain in the mid-20s percent range, after taking into account, our adjustments to GAAP operating income previously mentioned and which would have similar propositional effect.</p>
          <p>For Q1 2008, our non-GAAP operating margin is likely to be sequentially lower than in the fourth quarter. This is consistent with the seasonal sequential decline we experienced in the first quarter of 2007. The Q1 2008 fully diluted share count is anticipated to be approximately 400 million shares. Approximately 3.5 million of our employee shares will become eligible to trade during Q1, that should also be the case in each of Q3 and Q4, well approximately 11 million shares will become available in Q2, due to vesting of options granted at the time of the IPO.</p>
          <p>Stock-based compensation expense for 2008 is anticipated to be between 170 million and $200 million. For Q1 2008, stock-based compensation is expected to be approximately $40 million. Our GAAP tax rate for 2008 is expected to be between 17 and 19%. Our tax rate reflects the repeal of the U.S. R&amp;D credit, which had a benefit of approximately 4 points in 2007.</p>
          <p>Adjustments we would typically make to a non-GAAP tax rate would include stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and FAS86 capitalization representing approximately 1 to 2 percentage points.</p>
          <p>With that, I will turn it over to Diane Greene.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. And let me also welcome you to today's conference call. VMware's fourth quarter and full year were outstanding, and the company continues to execute well on our considerable opportunities. We grew revenues 80% year-over-year in Q4. We grew annual revenue 88% to 1.3 billion and we exited Q4 with the run rate of 1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>We are pleased with our growth overall and internationally. It was especially strong in Eastern Europe, Japan, and China. From the desktop to the datacenter, we are delivering value to our customers through new and exciting products and services from VMware as well as those from our large ecosystem of partners.</p>
          <p>We are seeing strong customer adoption on many fronts. Virtualization is becoming increasingly strategic to our customers and the virtual datacenter is proving to be a better way to run their businesses. Customers around the world are standardizing on VMware virtualization to reduce capital and operating expenses, ensure business continuity, strengthen security and go green.</p>
          <p>Customers are also investing more in VMware. 70% of our 20 largest deals in Q4 were from customers who have been with us for longer than three years. Today, more than 85% of VMware Infrastructure customers are running production level environments on VMware. And more than 50% are running enterprise applications on VMware. These transactions are part of a larger trend of VMware becoming the trusted infrastructure for running businesses more efficiently and cost effectively. We now have more than 100,000 enterprise customers and the number of VMware Infrastructure customers roughly doubled in 2007.</p>
          <p>Now, I'd like to talk about how we are growing the business through investments in partners, people, and products. We have substantially increased our focus on the distribution channel and our support for it. We added nearly 4,000 new channel partners in Q4, many of them with a commercial and SMB focus. Through a frictionless on-boarding process, we are now at nearly 10,000 channel partners. We are also in the process of rolling out some new and rewarding channel-friendly programs.</p>
          <p>More than 100 technology partners were added to our co-development programs in Q4 bringing the total number now to more than 400. These relationships add significant value to our platform and make the benefits of virtualization for our customers go much further.</p>
          <p>In December, we announced a comprehensive support agreement with SAP. They will fully support Windows and Linux-based SAP solutions running on VMware ESX Server in production environments. This adds to support from other leading vendors such as IBM Software. Internally, we added over 500 people in Q4. We ended the year with more than 5,000 people, all are focused on leveraging our expertise and doing everything we can as a team to extend our industry impact and leadership.</p>
          <p>I am also pleased to report that three new executives joined VMware in Q4, bringing us invaluable experience and talent in product development, marketing, and IT. We also closed the acquisition of Syan in Q4, and just announced Foedus and Thinstall. These acquisitions give us important new capabilities in terms of virtual infrastructure development, application virtualization, and VDI professional services best practices for our channel partners.</p>
          <p>Our products continue to receive accolades across all categories. VMware's product received more than 30 awards for excellence in 2007 and in year-end roundups. There is one publication's award in particular that I think says a tremendous amount about the breadth and depth of VMware. Redmond Magazine gave VMware four number one award recognitions. VMware's ESX Server or hypervisor was named number one in reliability. The mainframe was number two. VMware Workstation, our desktop product was rated number one for usability and manageability. VMware Fusion, our Mac won the "Biggest 'Wow' in an IT Product". And finally, VMware was named the number one overall breakout technology.</p>
          <p>VMware clearly has stellar product development, and our growth is fueling this valuable core competence. We are focused on developing high value products for our customers that also enhance the offerings of our partners. VMware's view of virtualization is broad. We are now delivering all of the building blocks for a complete virtual datacenter. One that will automatically and transparently map applications to whatever harbor resources they need and from any locations.</p>
          <p>VMware is continuing to aggressively get our products out into the market both free and revenue generating, and we're making the necessary investments in training our customer facing teams and partners to be successful selling them. Today is actually the start of VMware's annual sales kick-off, where our sales team now several thousand strong will get trained on new products and go-to-market programs, so that together with our partner channels they can make the most of the opportunities for VMware solutions.</p>
          <p>In February, we will host the first large scale European virtualization conference, VMworld Europe in Cannes, France. We expect more than 4,000 customers and partners across Europe to get hands on experience with our solutions. VMware is seeding the market with award-winning free products. VMware's Server was downloaded nearly 2.2 million times in 2007. And the VMware Player was downloaded upwards of 1.8 million times. Separately, in its first five months on the market, our Fusion virtualization product for the Mac sold more than 200,000 copies and it achieved 46% retail market share in Q4 according to MPT data.</p>
          <p>VMware's embedded hypervisor ESX 3i was shipped to the OEMs at the end of the year. Servers containing 3i are set to ship in Q1 and Q2. The embedded approach makes virtualization plug and play for our customers. For our partners and for VMware, it will accelerate adoption of ESX partitioning and provisioning functionality and make it easier for customers to upgrade to the automation management and business continuity features of our full virtualization solutions. VMware has unique advanced features that customers want, and APIs that integrate well with our third party management functionality.</p>
          <p>VMware is building upon our third generation ESX hypervisor with new products from us and from our partners to offer highly differentiated solutions for customers. Our hypervisor is number one in terms of reliability, interoperability, scalability and functionality; and every product built on it augments this differentiation. Let me elaborate on each of these.</p>
          <p>As an example of reliability, VMware has large pharmaceuticals customers that has run production environments virtualized for several years now. They have an instance of VMware ESX Server that has run continuously for 1140 consecutive days without a single reboot needed. It was finally brought down recently, when the physical server was recommissioned.</p>
          <p>The small 32 megabyte footprint of ESX 3i reduces security risks and VMware offers a dynamic patch management capability. ESX, particularly 3i, is also utterly simple to install and bring up. The VMware ESX's interoperability is the result of a huge investment that VMware has made in labs. ESX is tested and certified for roughly 250 different types of servers, more than 260 different types of storage arrays, more than 60 different operating systems, and more than 700 virtual appliances.</p>
          <p>Our differentiation does not stop at the hypervisor. We enable our customers to dynamically allocate resources and to migrate workloads across a pool of server, storage, and network devices. Our suites of management and automation software increase the productivity of IT administrators, by automatically controlling VM sprawl and enabling business users to self provision capacity on demand in the datacenter.</p>
          <p>Our suites of business continuity and availability software bring unprecedented simplicity to the task of delivering high service levels, for mission-critical software applications. Technical differentiation is critical for us, but what truly matters is what our customers are putting into dollars and cents. Our customers tell us that VMware products allow them to support two to three times the number of application workloads per administrator, and they do this using four to ten times less datacenter capacity, than would be required in a non-VMware environment.</p>
          <p>For 2008, the VMware product roadmap is strong. First, the recently launched VMware Infrastructure 3.5 and ESX 3i gets us off to a great start. They deliver advanced features like live migration of storage, distributed power management, and automated patch management. Over the course of the year, we will continue to broaden and deepen our end-to-end virtualization based solutions, in areas that include both desktop and the datacenter. You may have already seen one example of these solutions in the recent beta of our Stage Manager product, it streamlines and accelerates the process of staging applications into production. We have also shipped the beta of Site Recovery Manager, and Advanced Solutions for automating the configuring, testing, and deployment of disaster recovery for production workloads. We are also about to ship a major rev to our Virtual Desktop Infrastructure Suite, VDI, with our Virtual Desktop Manager product. In 2008, you'll see more solutions from us and our partners around business continuity, desktop management, and security, as well as a preview of a new and major release of VMware's flagship Infrastructure Suite. Our customer value proposition is growing dramatically, VMware products allow both critical and mundane error-prone tests to be automated and optimized, bringing IT people to address more sophisticated problems without having to worry about inevitable human error. Automation is the next stage for virtualized infrastructure. Much like going from our written ledger to an electronic spreadsheet, VMware is taking our customers, and leading our competitors to a new era, where IT infrastructure is much simpler to manage, much leaner on resource and maintenance requirements, much greener, and much, much more virtual.</p>
          <p>Our vision of self-managing IT infrastructure is gaining momentum. It's very exciting for the company to see our customers benefiting and our partners building around it. We are looking forward to a most successful -- our most successful year yet. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Mark, regarding deferred revenue component that you mentioned that lag. If you look at the impact for Q1, can you just walk through what type of sequential improvement you would expect in Q1? I know you are not giving guidance for Q1, but just help us better understand from a modeling perspective what happens there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Brent. The question is really around our -- the recognition of our OEM revenue, which we do in arrears, and so we have a one to two months lag depending on the OEM partner as to when it will be recognized. And with the fourth quarter, we believe that this number was greater than what it was in the third quarter, so we will have some uplift in the first quarter. As you look at the year going forward, we've guided to approximately 50% revenue growth, and as you think about the calendarization and the scale of our business, you would expect that that growth will be higher in the early quarters than it will be in the later quarters.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks. We &#x2013; I understand the pressure you're under to sort of give guidance, and I think it actually helps to tighten the dispersion of estimates out there. I am just curious Mark, Diane, how you can give guidance, revenue guidance for the year when things are just changing so quickly that you have six-month sales quarters rather than annual? I am just, I mean, maybe you can sort of -- does that tell us something about your confidence in guidance, or I don't know if you can comment on that, please?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And John, as we're planning the business, we look at trends. We certainly take a fresh look every six months as we determine sales quotas, but we do have to plan the business on a longer-term time horizon, and like any kind of estimates, the confidence we have in the -- in early quarters is greater than it is in the later quarters, and our thought process around providing guidance ties back to a couple of things. One, is that EMC provides consolidated guidance; they own 85% of the company, and so they're providing guidance on an annual basis. And so, it doesn't necessarily make sense that we wouldn't provide some kind of guidance on our own. And as we look ahead, it was just important we thought to help give some indication of where we thought the business was going, and the 50% guidance is largely based on the scale of our business.</p>

The tax is payable to EMC, it's something that was a lot greater than, the impact in cash was greater than we thought it would be, at least our model this quarter. Is there any way where you can help us to model that, are you going to continue try to pay down that balance?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We are filing a consolidated return in the U.S. with EMC and, as a result, as the quarters go on we true up that estimate, but our intent is to pay down those balances as they come due and to do them each quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Couple of questions please. It looked like in the fourth quarter that your U.S. revenue growth was considerably slower than your international revenue growth by about 30 percentage points. Up until this quarter the growth rates had been rather in line. Can you talk about what you might be seeing in the U.S. in, or what you saw in the U.S. in the fourth quarter? Was it any incremental weakness that is economic, or are you just that much bigger in the U.S. and your opportunities are more limited? Can you comment on that? And I have a follow-up please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think, it's a combination of factors. One is that we are larger in the U.S. and the initial release of VI3 there was more of an interest and uptake in the U.S. and so the -- it's a more difficult comp in the U.S. on our overall growth rates. And secondly, I'd point to the overall strengths that we experienced internationally in Europe and in APAC. We're very pleased with the results internationally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But do you think there was actually something in terms of linearity of demand in the quarter that you were experiencing because you had some pretty tough VI3 comps last quarter, still had very strong growth in the U.S., but you had this big divergence in growth this quarter. Can you give us a little more color on whether you saw any linearity over the course of the quarter in terms of strengthening or weakening in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The quarter was actually relatively consistent. Our, we do have a higher volume of sales and bookings at -- in the back month of the quarter in particular. But, we didn't see any particular weakening of U.S. in any particular periods throughout the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, can you comment a little bit about next year. Obviously, services revenue, you have 500 million in deferred revenue; you talked about a two-year average life. So, you can have a lot of that revenue that's in the bag for 2008; services revenue by its very nature should decelerate much more modestly. So, are you really talking about implied in your guidance, services revenue growth that's obviously considerably above that 75 or 80% in license revenue growth that's considerably below that which maybe is 35%, and is that how we should be thinking about, and it certainly does feel like a pretty dramatic deceleration in license growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, Toni, I think that, as you look at the trend over &#x2013; over time, this quarter, license growth 75%, services growth 90%, and a reminder that -- there was -- as we pointed out during the third quarter, there were some anomalies in the growth rates due to Q3 of 2006. If you look at our deferred -- our current deferred revenue as of the end of the year, it would imply that about 18 to 19% of our total guided revenue about 50% growth will roll through on -- and most of that would be services -- in the services line. And so you would expect that next year as we look at the full year and look at the splits between services and licenses growth that services growth will become a bigger portion of the overall revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And your belief on that deceleration in license revenue. So, the implicit in that is license is going to grow slower, again you're going to look -- you are going to have a deceleration from, I think in the 70s, correct me if I'm wrong, this year to likely something in the 30s just by that math that you've outlined, and again your belief is that principle reason is scale rather than anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Our principle reason around revenue growth rate to 50% is scale, and we are not providing a breakout between services and revenue on that guidance.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello, everyone. Can you speak to your expectations for 2008 between platforms and the automation group? You're breaking out the revenues on a reported basis, but at least qualitatively how should we be thinking about the growth rates of those two product offerings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you saw the fairly dramatic change in the percentage of revenue that came from automation versus platforms, we expect both to grow, they are typically part of bundled suites. What we are seeing however is that our customers are very much valuing the infrastructure management and the automation products, and we would expect that that will continue to grow as a percentage of overall revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now. We've seen a steady shifting of revenue into the full fleets over and above the hypervisor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you probably expect the growth rates then to be much higher, materially higher in automation and management tools that have been on platforms for 2008?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that if you, it's somewhat of a question since we're bundling the products together and so what customers are actually buying is a suite of products, and so it's really a condition of how the individual pricing of the products is broken down. But since the mix is going to shift you would expect the growth rates to be somewhat different as well.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had a couple questions about the large deal activity and the impact on deferred revenue. You noted in your prepared comments that you saw strength in enterprise license agreements and we saw the percentage of deals over 50,000 increase. Could you talk a little bit about how those ELAs are actually flowing through deferred revenue and flowing to the numbers? And secondly along that line, it looked as if the percentage of deferred license revenue actually declined on a sequential and a year-on-year basis, and I was wondering why that would have been in the context of the very strong large deal activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First, let me address the ELAs. We break out orders under $50,000 from a license perspective, and the one thing to &#x2013; that I just want to make sure I clarify is that the orders in excess of $50,000 are not all ELAs; in fact a large majority of the orders that are above 50,000 are in fact not ELAs, but sales of individual suites of products. The way that the revenue is recognized on the ELAs in most cases is that we recognize the license revenue upfront, and then the portion that is related to services, the subscription, is over a three-year period of time, and so it will end up in the balance sheet as either current or non-current depending on when we ship the actual license.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the second part of the question. Deferred as a percentage of &#x2013; a deferred license revenue as a percentage of total deferred looked like it was down a little bit on a year-on-year basis and sequentially. Is there any reason that would have been in the fourth quarter in particular, or is that just an anomaly that we'll expect to see sort of head back in the other direction in Q1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the deferred license revenue, it's &#x2013; first of all, it's not tied to the ELAs at all. And so, it really has very little to do with the size of the transaction, but it's more tied to the marketing promotions that we're doing in any particular quarter, and typically we'll ship most of that revenue in the following quarter. And so this quarter, we ran a promotion near the end of the quarter related to our VI Starter Kit. And so from quarter to quarter there will be some variability in our license &#x2013; deferred license revenue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much. Just wanted to clarify the percentage of license revenues that are coming from arrears revenue recognition, maybe Mark, if you could quantify what percentage of the license revenues are actually coming from OEM, that could help us better understand how much of that indeed is being impacted by this arrears flow through from Q4 into Q1? I have a follow-up question, as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Kash, we're not breaking out revenue by any of our particular channels. The &#x2013; as we've stated in the past, what we saw in the third quarter is that there was a shift in the percentage in the channel that was from OEM relative to the rest of the partner channel. And that had a modest impact on the Q3 result as you saw, and that carried forward into the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, but the trend line is that, that OEMs are definitely getting to be a larger percentage of your license revenues; therefore this lumpiness probably is &#x2013; it becomes more and more exaggerated if the OEMs are becoming larger as a percentage of license revenues, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to the extent. Yes, to the extent that, that grows.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then the second comment on the growth rate, license revenue growth rate: If the services revenue growth rate even slowed down a little bit, and we're talking significant deceleration in license revenue. And I am wondering just given the growth rate of the company over the last three years, if you were to look at it, 80 to 90% all of a sudden dropping down to 30, 40%. That doesn't add up to me. Maybe if you could help us understand if it's largely due to conservatism, that's completely understandable. But just drop that deceleration on us in the face of what has been pretty solid growth for past three years, it just doesn't seem to add up. Maybe we're missing something. If you can clarify, both you and Diane, that would be great. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think. So, Kash, I think that your question is around the growth rates of license versus services for 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In a relative sense, license revenue growth rate expectation for '08 relative to where it has been in '07, '06, '05. Understandably a lot of this is due to scale, but the magnitude of the deceleration that you are talking about; it just doesn't jive with people's expectations. And I am wondering, if it's just plain old conservatism with macros and other things that are related to forecasting revenues for a company with limited public history, or there is something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's &#x2013; our revenue guidance is largely based on scale and largely based on providing guidance for the entire year. And with the conditions that I called out in the prepared remarks, as well. We're &#x2013; as we look ahead to 2008, we are very bullish on the company and where it's headed, and the demand for our products. And so the splits between license and services, and how that will change over time is really entirely due to scale.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Just a follow-up on the deceleration in the growth rate into '08. Is there anything from an economic perspective that might be cautioning your view, because even if you take sort of the Q4 number in license revenue and flow it through the quarters, it just seems that a drop-off into maybe the high 30s or 40% ranges is fairly extreme given what you have talked about previously in the market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jason, in planning the business, and one of the earlier questions was on six-month versus annual guidance, as we look forward into 2008 we are certainly trying to plan the business in a way that allows us to sustain the investments that we are making. And there is nothing that we are taking from a perspective of forecasting the economy or where it will go other than what we've seen over the last six months in looking at demand. But again the 50% growth rate that we are forecasting is largely a function of us becoming a very large software company. Through September 30th of 2007, it was the first time that we hit the $1 billion run rate on a trailing 12 month basis, and so when you look at approximately 50% growth for 2008 that's essentially doubling the size of the company in five quarters.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe just a follow-up on the services side. As you sort of embark on this next leg of your story, can you maybe talk about the role of your services organization to try and drive both direct license sales, as well as, maybe training partners and things of that nature? What it &#x2013; what role will that play, in terms of, helping increase the growth rate down the road?</p>

So, it helps drive our sales through the channel. And so we invest a lot in training and in developing services for them, and certainly we are increasing our partnerships with people like the system integrators, where for larger scale deals that will certainly drive sales.</p>

          <p>Thank you. I have two questions if I could. Could you talk about how you think deferred revs will grow in '08? And related to that is how you think the cash flows will grow in '08? And if you are unwilling to give numbers, I would like to get some context related to the revenue growth targets that you've put out, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our deferred revenue, we continue to expect to grow at &#x2013; we had a healthy rate. If you look at just the sequential growth in external bookings looking at revenue versus the change in deferred revenue in Q4 over Q3, we grew at 46%. And as we said, we grew deferred revenue for the year at 80%. The continued trend that we have seen in individuals or in corporations signing up for multi-year subscription agreement is going to continue to increase deferred revenue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so just to be more specific, you anticipate that deferred revenues will grow faster than revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then how about any commentary on the cash flow, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cash flows. Well, certainly cash flows will be enhanced by increases in deferred revenue and multi-year SnS, but we are not going to provide a cash flow forecast with working capital items and CapEx items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So &#x2013; yes. Just coming back to the &#x2013; really the same issue that we have heard several times, it's a model out of 50% year-over-year growth number for this coming fiscal year, either the business decelerates very rapidly in the next couple of quarters or over the course of the year down to say 30, 40%. So, I understand the scale commentary, but represent most of your market as of today, are you saying that you think your end market is decelerating down to a 30, 40% growth rate by the end of '08 on a year-over-year basis? Or is something else happening like for example, with share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. What we are doing with approximately 50% growth for 2008 is to give you an indication of where, we think we are headed, and this &#x2013; the overall size of the company, and that it's largely scale. If you take that in concert with our operating margin guidance, it will help you to paint a little bit of a picture with respect to how we are viewings the upcoming couple of quarters. And then we will have better visibility as the year goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the operating margin guidance for mid-20s is, that's consistent with the guidance you've given in the past. I am correct, right? That hasn't changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct. What I am suggesting is that if you look at the exit rates on our operating expenses for the fourth quarter, it will help you consider what our operating expenses will be for the first part of 2008 as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I understand that. But on the top line, how do you recommend that will get you to 50% year-over-year, I assume that, it's not falling off a cliff, so we are going to have to decelerate the revenue down to 30, 40% year-over-year growth by the end of '08. Is that the appropriate approach?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the approach would &#x2013; you just going to have to take your own approach as to how you look at our guidance. But with the mid-20s operating margins in those investments, you would certainly expect higher growth rates in the early quarters than the back quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do you feel any pressure with respect to your guidance to contemplate the perception impact it might have on your parent company's core growth rates, if you guided higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We have been building our guidance independently of EMC.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks. I guess, my question would be along the lines of your ELAs, and you guys have had a pretty big focus on driving ELA adoption in the enterprises that you sell to. And maybe you could talk about for 2008, would you expect that to be a continued focus, an emphasis in your sales group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With ELAs, most of our customers don't just jump into an ELA. They have had a repeated history of buying products from us on a PO basis, and so it's largely dependent upon customer demand. But certainly as we develop relationships with our customers, both our sales force and customers have an interest in ELAs. And so, I would expect that we will continue to market and develop the ELA program. And that it provide &#x2013; we think, it's very healthy for the company, because it does provide a long-term buy-in, and a broader proliferation of our products across to our customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we do also see that when a customer buys an ELA, they tend to deploy much more broadly. And what we see when our customer deploys broadly is they get accelerating benefits from &#x2013; on their ROI, and so we do encourage our customers to do this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. If I could have one quick follow-you. Are you &#x2013; is your CapEx &#x2013; are you expecting your CapEx needs to be lower this year, some of the build out you did in '07?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Although, we are not providing CapEx guidance. I will say that we are not &#x2013; we are continuing to expect to invest. And as we add people and as we continue to expand internationally, we will still see the need to invest in capital. And so, I wouldn't expect significant free cash flow benefit from lower CapEx in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>We'll take our last question from Phil Rueppel, Wachovia Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. A couple things, one on the pipe, on the desktop opportunity. I know, you have mentioned that there's little revenues that will be realized. Are you going to continue to ramp investment and what can we expect to see from a cost perspective, as associated with the desktop? Is the partner channel going to be expanded with a special channel or are we just going to continue to see organic investments in R&amp;D and sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the desktop opportunity, we are certainly ramping investment. I mean, we do have large deals that we are doing there and we are increasing the number of deals we are doing there. So, we can ramp the investment, and as you probably noticed that we are also broadening our definition of the desktop opportunity with our acquisition of the application virtualization company, Thinstall. In terms of channel, we are finding a lot of tremendous synergies with our existing channels for the desktop opportunity. We are ramping our ability to educate people and that was why we purchased Foedus, which specializes in services around the desktop opportunity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And finally on pricing, I know you have mentioned that you haven't really seen any change in pricing. Built into your guidance for '08, are you expecting any additional price pressure when you do have competition from say Microsoft in the second half? Or do you think the new releases and sort of your product position will enable you to &#x2013; are you forecasting, the ability to maintain ASPs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do think that we can maintain our prices. We entered the year with the 3.5 announcement, which brought several &#x2013; three major new areas of functionality, and at the same price point, and we anticipate continuing that over the course of the year.</p>

VMware starts 2008 with over 100,000 customers, 500 technology and consulting partners, and nearly 10,000 go-to-market partners, more than 5,000 employees. As others begin to enter the market, VMware and our partners are continuing to broaden and deepen our highly reliable end-to-end virtualization solutions. Our vision for the virtual datacenter is today delivering tremendous value to our customers, and our product pipeline for 2008 promises to deliver much more. Thank you again. I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>
