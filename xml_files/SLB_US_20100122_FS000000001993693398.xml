          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Schlumberger limited earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President, Investor Relations, Mr. Malcolm Theobald. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you Rachelle. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full year 2009 results conference call.</p>
          <p>Joining me for today's call are Andrew Gould, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Simon Ayat Chief Financial Officer. Prior to Andrew's overview of the results and his comments on the outlook, Simon will first review the quarter's financial results. After the prepared statements, we will welcome your questions.</p>
          <p>Before we begin with the opening remarks I would like to remind the participants that some of the information in today's call may include forward-looking statements as well as non-GAAP financial measures. A detailed disclaimer and other important information are included in the FAQ document which is valuable on our website or upon request.</p>
          <p>And now, I'll turn the call over to Simon.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter income was $0.67 per share. This is up $0.02 sequentially and down $0.36 cents compared to the same quarter of last year excluding the $0.08 of charges we took in a Q4 of last year.</p>
          <p>Turning to the business segments, Oilfield Services fourth quarter revenue increased 4% sequentially while WesternGeco revenue increased 19%. Roughly 1/3 of the sequential increase in OFS is attributable to the traditional year end surge in product sales. Oilfield Services pre-tax operating income of $1 billion decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter. Oilfield Services margins declined by 157 basis points sequentially to 19.5% as improvements in the Middle East and Asia was more than offset by declines in North America, Latin America and Europe/CIS/Africa. Overall international margins in OFS were 23.4%.</p>
          <p>By area, Oilfield Services sequential pre-tax operating margins highlights were as follows. North America declined by 129 basis points to 2.1% as increased activity in the U.S. land and Gulf of Mexico GeoMarkets were insufficient to increase the impact of less favorable revenue mix in Canada and lower activity in the Alaska GeoMarket. Latin America decreased by 254 basis points, to 15.8%, primarily as a result of the reduced activity and the less favorable revenue mix in the Mexico/Central America GeoMarket. Europe/CIS/Africa margin was 21.6%, 208 basis points lower, principally due to lower activity in Russia as a result of year end customer budgetary constraints. Finally, Middle East Asia margin improved by 66 basis points to 32.4% primarily due to the positive impact of a more favorable mix of deepwater and exploration related activity and year end software sales.</p>
          <p>At WesternGeco pre-tax income of $115 million reflected an increase in pre-tax margins of 776 basis points to 20.9%. This increase was largely attributable to year end multiclient sales partially offset by the impact of the lower pricing and project delays in marine.</p>
          <p>Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 17.6%. This was lower than last quarter primarily due to more favorable geographic earnings mix. As we have previously mentioned, and as you saw this quarter, the ETR is very sensitive to the geographic earnings mix and as such we may continue to experience volatility on quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>Net debt was $126 million at the end of the quarter as compared to 660 million at the end of Q3 and $1.1 billion at the end of last year. This improvement was driven by strong cash flows from operations. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion of cash and investments on hand. In addition $2.8 billion of committed debt facilities with commercial banks remained unused and were available at the end of December. This compares to short-term debt of only $1.1 billion, which as a reminder includes 321 million of convertible debentures which we expect to be converted to equity by the end of second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Significant liquidity events during the quarter included $500 million of stock repurchases, $676 million of CapEx, and 231 million of pension funding.</p>
          <p>We re-started our stock buyback program during the quarter and bought back 7.8 million shares at an average price of $63.91. Our Q4 buyback activities served to offset the vast majority of the dilution caused by our stock based compensation programs during all of 2009.</p>
          <p>Oilfield Services CapEx is expected to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2010, as compared to $1.9 billion in 2009. WesternGeco CapEx is expected to approach $300 million as compared to 460 million in 2008.</p>
          <p>In summary, our balance sheet remains very strong and will continue to provide us with a tremendous amount of financial flexibility. And now I turn the conference over to Andrew.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Simon. Good morning, everybody.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter revenue increased sequentially in North America, Latin America, and Middle East/Asia areas, as offshore revenue quality improved with increasing deepwater rig count while software and product sales saw the usual fourth quarter strength. Europe/CIS/Africa area, revenue was flat with the previous quarter as stronger offshore activity and year end software and product sales in the area were not sufficient to offset the seasonal decline in Russia.</p>
          <p>Amongst the technologies, sequential growth was driven by increased deepwater and exploration related activity, leading to demand for Wireline, Testing Services and Drilling and Measurements technologies, while growth was also recorded on land in North America, primarily from increased well services activity. WesternGeco achieved highly satisfactory fourth quarter multiclient revenues due largely to wide-azimuth survey sales in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the areas in more detail. In North America, where revenue increased sequentially by 6%, the U.S. Land GeoMarket grew on increased drilling activity. This, however, was offset by lower pricing for well services technologies.</p>
          <p>The U.S. Gulf of Mexico GeoMarket, revenue was up marginally due to improved shelf activity and the beginning of a build-up in the deepwater, but these positive effects were hampered by down time associated with Hurricane Ida, as well as some pricing pressure. Canada revenue was flat with the previous quarter, but of lower quality, while Alaska revenue fell sequentially due to a slowdown in activity resulting from operator budget constraints.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, revenue grew 5% sequentially, and in the Peru/Colombia/Ecuador GeoMarket, revenue increased primarily on greater demand for Drilling and Measurement's Wireline and Testing services, with this demand resulting from increased drilling activity. Higher SIS software sales and artificial lift products also contributed to the growth.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, revenue was higher was from increased offshore exploration activity as well as from the software sales and completions product sales. The Venezuela/Trinidad &amp; Tobago GeoMarket recorded growth primarily from Integrated Project Management (IPM) activity, while activity in Argentina/Bolivia/Chile was higher due to increased activity and SIS software sales. These increases, however, were partially offset by a decrease in Mexico/Central America, where revenue declined as a result of reduced activity.</p>
          <p>Revenue in the Europe/CIS/Africa area was flat with the previous quarter. In Nigeria and Gulf of Guinea, revenue grew as a result of strong Testing Services product sales and an increase in exploration activity that led to greater demand for Wireline Services. In West and Southern Africa, revenue increased on high demand for Drilling and Measurement Services.</p>
          <p>The North Sea GeoMarket also recorded growth, primarily as a result of increased well services stimulation activity, while the Libya GeoMarket revenue increased due to higher deepwater testing services and Wireline exploration activity. These increases were, however, partly offset by the lower revenue in Russia, as a result of client budgeting constraints and seasonal weather effects, which mainly affected IPM activity. Revenue was also lower in North Africa on reduced testing product sales, and in the Caspian GeoMarket, on the completion of drilling campaigns.</p>
          <p>In the Middle East and Asia, sequential revenue growth of 7% was driven by an increase in deepwater and exploration related activities that led to strong demand for Wireline Services. Seasonal artificial lift and SIS software product sales also contributed to growth.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, sequential revenue growth at WesternGeco was led by multiclient through strong year end sales of wide-azimuth surveys in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Land revenue also grew due to increased activity in the Middle East and North Africa. But overall, these increases were somewhat offset by a significant decrease in marine as a result of weaker pricing, project start-up delays, and vessel transits.</p>
          <p>Our outlook for 2010 remains largely dependent on the prospects for the general economy. At the end of the third quarter, we indicated that we were encouraged that signs were emerging that demand for oil and gas would begin to increase. Consensus forecasts now predict that oil demand in 2010 will increase, particularly in the developing world, for the first time since 2007.</p>
          <p>As a result, we feel that oil prices are likely to be sustained at current levels, and that as our customers' confidence grows, exploration and production budgets will increase. We feel that considerable leverage to increase investment exists in offshore markets in Russia as well as in certain emerging investment opportunities such as Iraq. These events will be dependent on continued increases in economic growth in the second half of the year beyond the current government stimulus packages.</p>
          <p>For natural gas activity we remain a great deal more cautious. Despite signs of some recovery in industrial demand and recent cold weather, we consider that worldwide markets remain generally oversupplied. Increased flows of LNG together with additional capacity being added in 2010 as well as a general uncertainty over the decline rates of unconventional gas production have the potential to limit the current increase in North American gas drilling rig count.</p>
          <p>We anticipate that 2010 will be a better year for multiclient seismic and improved activity for land seismic, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. While marine activity will be reasonably robust, pricing improvements will be limited due to continued new capacity additions.</p>
          <p>Longer term, we remain increasingly confident that considerably increased spending will be necessary to maintain sufficient reserves in production of hydrocarbons to meet the world's need. Our technology portfolio and worldwide infrastructure mean we're strongly positioned to capture growth opportunities as our customers begin to increase their investment.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand the call back to Malcolm.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" />. Our first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andrew I'll kick off with Iraq. You have been very cautious in your commentary on Iraq all along. This is the first time we hear you highlighting Iraq as a significant area of opportunity in the way you do now. Can you sort of discuss through what it is that's changed with respect, I presume, to timing and magnitude and relative to your previous thoughts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the change relative to my previous thinking is the results of the second round and the time constraints that have been put on the operators to reach the initial plateau production. If that timetable is adhered to, then it implies a huge amount of service activity over the next two or three years.</p>
          <p>Now you know I have to have my normal caveats. They are that the election takes place with a satisfactory political result and that some form of oil lure is put into place because I still don't think our customers will make major, major commitments until that happens. But currently given what they have signed, it would seem that there is going to be a considerable increase in activity in Iraq. I don't think it will have a material effect on results in 2010, but it may, we may well start to see the ramp-up in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you talk a little bit about how you see Schlumberger being positioned, what are the big obstacles, competitive advantages that you would have in Iraq?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not going to do that over a phone line where all my competitors are listening, Ole, but we have a very robust plan in place. We have inherited relationships from the past in Iraq. We have everything necessary to operate legally from the past. And the signs are very encouraging that the offering we have is going to be competitive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one brief follow-up, Andrew. You mentioned exploration. You mentioned development. Any change in your customer inquiry levels with respect to kind of the next 12 to 18 months compared to the previous 12 to 18 months? Are we going to have an exploration recovery or is it going to be drilling? In terms of your product offering of not only seismic but everything else from open hope wireline...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it will be both, but, you know, the ratio of new deepwater rigs and the places where they are going, means there will be a lot of &#x2013; quite a lot of exploration and appraisal, so beyond this year if commodity prices hold where they are, I think we'll see a recovery in exploration.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next comes from the line of Dan Pickering of Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Andrew, your capital spending for 2010 is fairly significant uptick. How much impact do you think that's going to have on 2010 or is this really more of a 2011...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, we're counting outside the normal replacement CapEx and some IPM projects and stuff like that. We are counting that in 2008 we had eight deepwater new builds come into our market, 23 in 2009 and 35 in 2010. Now, you know that they don't all come on the 1st of January so you probably have to chop those numbers in half...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>M'hmm.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...in any one year. But what it does mean is there is still significant deepwater CapEx that's going to come through in 2010. And as you rightly point out a lot of that will be only revenue generating in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I think about &#x2013; just, you know, your commentary is, I guess a little bit cautious. Your actions are more aggressive. I'm thinking about, you know, as we look out to 2011, and I realize that's still a year away. But you know, I look back at '08 and see $27 billion revenue number. We're clearly lower than that in '09. We'll be lower than that in '10 but is that in the gun sites for '11 given everything you are see and the amount of money you're spending and the way the market plays out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well actually, Dan, that depends entirely on North America. You know, I have no doubt we'll have a significant upswing overseas but don't forget the significant drop in our revenue is in North America compared to the 27 billion you are talking about. North America and seismic, put it that way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think I used my two questions. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from the line of Alan Laws, BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Alan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a question on the gas side, actually. You definitely appear more confident in the oil fundamentals than gas and you mentioned natural gas in the note and your comments. That's really a challenge but that wasn't really clearly a North American comment is what I read into it. How important to global for the upstream activity do you think an uptick in gas related activity is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not counting on any big uptick in gas related activity in the next couple of years outside North America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know the big Qatari projects that will come on, the Yemen project has come on. There are other projects that are coming on. So, yes, you will see a few big gas developments in Asia probably. But we're not counting on a big increase in gas because as I said earlier, worldwide, the gas market is substantially oversupplied at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So to follow up then is...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only &#x2013; sorry. Can I just qualify that Alan?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are domestic gas plays that people are doing to substitute energy sources, particularly in the Middle East, so in Saudi, Kuwait, Oman, places like that &#x2013; Abu Dhabi &#x2013; there is gas activity, but it is local. It is not for export, it's for substitute power sources within the country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, this is in relation to what you answered to Dan's question there. Does this modestly or highly contain the potential upside of &#x2013; or maybe just maybe the pace of what looks like the beginning of another up-cycle here?</p>
          <p>You mentioned that North America was going to limit your ability to get to those numbers that Dan had laid out. Is this a bigger deal, or just sort of a smaller deal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What? Sorry. Which?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>International gas activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think it is. I think it is a smaller dealer than the two factors I mentioned to Dan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's where I was going to go after.</p>
          <p>I have one follow-up, I think. How does international gas activity rank in terms of oil service intensity versus oil, or even domestic natural gas activity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the sources of gas are becoming so diverse that's a very difficult question to qualify.</p>
          <p>For example, most of the Middle East gas is highly toxic. It has very high H2S fractions. A lot of it has high CO2 content, and therefore, these are fairly high cost operations. They're fairly service intensive, and they imply specialized equipment and a lot of measurement to establish what the gas stream consists of. And then you go to other places like the Northwest Shelf in Australia, where it is really nice, clean gas, and they're less intensive.</p>
          <p>But overall, I would say in the development phase, there is not a great deal of difference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's perfect. Thanks. I'll turn it back.</p>

          <p>Andrew, I was wondering if you would be able to give us some color on some of the pricing trends that are evolving, both in North America and international. And what kind of impact that would have on either margin improvement or margin degradation as we move out into 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. So as I said in my script, U.S. Land revenues were up, but we did not feel any pricing traction in U.S. Land until December. So it didn't affect the quarter really.</p>
          <p>We &#x2013; the pricing traction we have in U.S. Land, particularly in pressure pumping, is in the more complex operations where, frankly, if we don't get price increases, we lose money because we're tearing our equipment to pieces. And they are individual contracts, and in no way could we today impose a blanket price on our pressure pumping price list.</p>
          <p>So that trend has continued through the beginning of the year, that we have been able to get good price increases on specific operations.</p>
          <p>Overseas, I would say that we're still feeling some effect from the pricing concessions we made in 2009, but that currently, I would say prices in offshore markets are in the process of flattening. And I've always said since the beginning of this that the overseas cycle was 18 months, and it would probably bottom in the second half of &#x2013; in the second &#x2013; at the end of the second quarter of 2010. And I would still stick to that story, Kurt.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if oil prices are maintained, if offshore activity recovers somewhat, there will be a little bit more pricing traction in the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">

          <p>Exactly.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My follow-up for you, Andrew, is obviously a lot of noise coming in through Mexico toward the tail end of the year. And it appears that they are now in process of signing new, incentive-based type of contracts.</p>
          <p>Could you give us some perspective on what those new contracts may mean for opportunities for service companies in Mexico? And given the production declines that Mexico is experiencing, what kind of mix of business do you see happening next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the only incentive contracts I've heard talked about are for production in Chicontepec. I haven't heard of any others.</p>
          <p>The PEMEX activity we think will swing back more towards the south. And we think that a lot more of it will actually be directly controlled by PEMEX rather than IPM.</p>
          <p>Obviously, with the huge amount of equipment that flowed into Mexico when they were ramping up Chicontepec, and the subsequent decrease in activity in Chicontepec &#x2013; which is going to happen throughout the year &#x2013; it hasn't really happened yet &#x2013; there is going to be a lot of surplus equipment in Mexico. Which will either, hopefully, I don't know, flow back to North America or decrease pricing in Mexico, and probably a bit of both.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, good morning. Andrew, I'm struck by the fact, on the one hand, that we are &#x2013; I think for good reasons &#x2013; relatively subdued on global gas development prospects over the next few years, if I understood you correctly. And yet you juxtapose that outlook with the Exxon purchase of XTO, increasing IOC participation and fervor with regard to shales. How do you recognize those two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, please don't ask me to comment on Rex's strategy, Bill. But I think that the IOCs have generally realized that there are lots of criteria to judge where you invest. One is stable political environment, large domestic market, and new resource. And I think the IOCs have realized that there is a substantial new resource in North America, and the technology for that resource has been developed in North America, and therefore they are now investing in it. It seems very logical to me.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we would say that Russia was able to sustain its domestic production in 2009 through the addition of new fields in Eastern Siberia, notably Vankor. But at the same time, production in Western Siberia decreased fairly dramatically and they are going to have to spend a lot more in Russia, in Western Siberia, if they want to sustain the production level in 2010.</p>
          <p>That's why we're feeling fairly optimistic on Russia, coupled with the fact that it will be another good year for us in Sakhalin, and there are still quite a few new projects in Eastern Siberia.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have a quick question on WesternGeco. One of your competitors talked about not having available capacity through the first half of 2010. What are you seeing in terms of your forward visibility on the contract side? And could we get &#x2013; could the market get back into balance in the back half of '10, as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think if we &#x2013; so you have to remember that we have converted some recording boats to source boats right? So our actual fleet size for recording is down. Total fleet size is the same, but recording boats are down. We have quite &#x2013; some very large multiclient programs in the Gulf of Mexico, which are very well funded. And the rest of our capacity through the half year, I think, is largely booked up.</p>
          <p>But it is not yet &#x2013; the bidding situation is not robust for us to convert those source vessels back to recording vessels. I think it is highly unlikely, given the amount of capacity, that still has to hit the market, that the supply/demand will come back into balance in 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Andrew, I would like to come back to the natural gas topic again, and specifically, your comment about the uncertainty surrounding decline rates.</p>
          <p>That seems to be fairly significant. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? This is a topic most people, I think, have said these unconventional resources are steeply declining production profiles. You seem to be raising a question about that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. I think &#x2013; I don't disagree that they are steeply declining production profiles, but I don't think we know yet, because of the backlog of gas behind pipe that has not been stimulated and completed. Because of the actual huge increase in the profile of unconventional gas, that we really, really know how much it is going to decline in 2010.</p>
          <p>And you know, actually I saw a very good paper from a rival firm, Geoff, recently...</p>

          <p>I think the only joker in the pack this year is that, in 2009, a lot of people predicted that more LNG would come to the U.S., and it didn't.</p>
          <p>With the amount of new capacity that Qatar put on last year and Qatar is putting on this year plus Yemen plus a couple of others, it has to go somewhere.</p>

          <p>We are yet to understand the actual rate that will be applicable during Q1. However, we in Schlumberger looked at our currency exposures very closely, and this is not going to have an impact on the revaluation of the balance sheet.</p>
          <p>Going forward, if the official rate will &#x2013; the devaluation will take place, it will reduce our revenue, because of the local currency portion will obviously be less in the corresponding dollars.

        <plist>
          <p>I have sort of a three part follow-up on Iraq. Number one, of the, let's say, 7 to 11 projects that seem like they could go forward, do you see most of these going IPM?</p>
          <p>Secondly, how do you see the likely profitability of the work in Iraq versus other countries in the region? And thirdly, do you think that there will be issues surrounding the capacity of the oil service industry to service all these projects if they all seem to want to come in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I can answer the third part first. If they all want to come in the second part of the year, yes.</p>
          <p>And if I can answer the first one then, yes, I do think that they are largely going to be IPM type projects because largely because there is very little infrastructure on the ground, particularly rigs. And therefore, the capacity to do IPM and to put rigs on the ground is going to be extremely, a determining factor in the first year or so. What was the second part? Jim? I'm sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree. Second question or follow-up, Andrew, back to the U.S. what is the magnitude of the increase or, in the rig related recovery before you would begin to see pricing improvement for conventional bread and butter work for pressure pumping, directional and wireline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think wireline is almost there. Directional, has never been affected as much as wireline or pressure pumping because, you know, as you know, the horizontal count has grown so much that I think there is issues, no pricing issues with directional equipment.</p>
          <p>Pressure pumping, I don't really know but I think it is considerably higher than where we are today. I think one of two things are going to happen. Either all these, either the rig count will increase or, and I suspect this is more likely, all these massive fracs are going to tear up so much equipment that the market will come into balance through equipment disappearing more rapidly than it usually does.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I could again just sneak a last question and it is sort of a strategic question, is looking at the international land business, Andrew, do you see an increased amount of that business going IPM in the future? If so will it be a significant increase? And what are the implications for margin and profitability if indeed that is the case?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me put it this way. Despite the drop in Mexico, Schlumberger's IPM revenues will increase in 2010 largely due to Russia and the Middle East. And the profitability will vary in function of the type of project that you are doing. And it will never be anything like offshore. But it will be perfectly satisfactory.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, question gist back on international margins here specifically Middle East/Asia. We saw an improvement here versus third quarter. I'm just curious how much confidence do you have right now given some ever your prior comments that margins have troughed in your Middle East/Asian region? I guess as a follow-up if we look at Europe/CIS/West Africa down 200 bips but you talked about Russia being the culprit there and we know that weather was a problem, should we assume you recover those 200 basis points in the first quarter in that region?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think we recover it in the first quarter because we don't get the Sakhalin activity back until the second and third quarter and the ramp-up will only happen towards the end of first quarter. So I very much doubt we'll get back the 200 and actually, you know, there will be other, for example, Libya is not going to be so strong because the exploration success in Libya has been very low. So we'll see a lot of exploration programs winding down.</p>
          <p>I think you have to go back to what I said on an earlier comment, Bill, that I've always said that the cycling in the Eastern Hemisphere would sort of trough towards the middle of this year. And our margins will be lumpy depending on the revenue mix. I mean, you know, the improvement in MEA. Middle East/Asia this quarter was just as we said, due to exploration, wireline testing and very strong software sales. So I think you have to assume they are going to be lumpy for a couple more quarters.</p>

One follow-up, specifically the declines on Mexico and I know it was addressed earlier, kind of your broad thoughts there, but how much of that was due specifically to Chicontepec slowdowns or how much of that was really due to activity declines in areas like the Burgos that we know one of your competitors mentioned during the fourth quarter or was it a bit of both?</p>

          <p>I think there is a &#x2013; I think PEMEX are re-looking at everything. You know gas prices got to a point where it was probably cheaper for Mexico to buy rather than drill in Burgos. I think that, you know, we &#x2013; we will &#x2013; activity will be decent, but it is not going to &#x2013; there is so much equipment in Mexico, it is not going to do us a lot of good.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning. A couple of unrelated questions, please. First, can you just give us a little more color on what happened in the fourth quarter in Canada? I think it's a surprise to see flat revenue, so a little bit more on that mix commentary, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We had a very, very strong Q3 because we had an extremely profitable campaign for one of the operators. So you know, we just, that was a one-time campaign and it didn't repeat in Q4. So we probably should say that the margins in Q4 were stronger than were sustainable without that extremely profitable piece of work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure I &#x2013; I'm sorry I didn't get that. The margins in Q4 were higher...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The reasons the margins in Canada declined in Q4 was nothing to do with the level of activity. It was to do with the type of activity because in Q3 we had an extremely profitable campaign for one operator which increased the margins which did not repeat itself in Q4.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. Understand. So this is &#x2013; let me make sure I'm clear on it. Did you &#x2013; you moved a fair amount of equipment out of Canada at some point as part of cost reduction efforts. Has equipment moved back in or are you equipped to kind of take advantage of winter drilling seasons in more general sense?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>I guess I'm curious what you read into that relative to customers and managing discretionary spending in '09 if anything? Was it a positive, did you take it as a positive sign that they were going to proceed sort of as normal or...?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't read anything into artificial lift or completions except perhaps some restocking after, you know, having pared down their inventories in late 2008 early 2009. Software sales I think the purse strings were freed up a bit, you know. So maybe, particularly in software, they were &#x2013; they did an excellent job and we probably had a really, really strong fourth quarter in software, relative to other fourth quarters, I mean.</p>

          <p>Well they do but not at the basis of 35. If we get 20 of them in Q4, if you calculate that in rig months it doesn't correspond to anything like 35 for a full year. So you really only get the effect in the full year, which will be 2011.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Let's come back to the pressure pumping just for a second. We have been hearing that very recently of course pricing has been improving as you mentioned. Is that due to equipment wearing out, which you addressed, or is it people shortages, having trouble getting people back in the system? And how does that evolve over the next quarter or two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it's both &#x2013; I think actually in some of the more complex plays it is availability. It's certainly the tearing up of equipment. And people a little bit. Yes.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing, beginning to see increases in product cost again. But I think that the underlying reason for the price increases at this point in time is the fear of how available equipment is going to be over the next three or four months. Beyond that, you know, pricing traction or the state of the pressure pumping industry beyond that really depends at what point the rig count plateaus.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Andrew. Just on the theme of pressure pumping again. What you have seen in the U.S. is that not only in the shale plays rig count has been going up but also the number of frac stages have been going up. Can you see a scenario where even if you have a flattish rig count but fracs just continue to go up thereby driving demand for pressure pumping equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No there is absolutely no doubt that every time they increase the size of the, or the number of stages, that increases the size of the frac fleet that's necessary. It's another factor that's going to absorb equipment. But I come back to what I said on the last question. It really depends to where the horizontal rig count goes. The flip side of what you are saying is these wells have very high PIs which means that they can turn around production quite quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then on the related question in other markets there was recently a shale gas initiative signed in China. When do you see that translating into maybe activity increases in China? And do you see a role of Western service companies in that development?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean in China there are a number of shale gas projects that are being discussed. And yes, we see a role for Western service companies in design of the fracs and execution of the fracs in China. Yes.</p>

I mean, is it fair to say at this point that based on your last commentary the pricing trends are, pricing and margin trends are relatively stable in that part of the world, you know, for even, you know, even if there is a little bit of a dip that that's about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah it would depend greatly on how much exploration there really is in every quarter and how much testing there is in the quarter. So it can &#x2013; it will vary in function with software sales, Kevin, but it will also vary in function of the revenue mix, you know, so they will still be a little lumpy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But lumpy but, you know...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think, I'm not probably going to regret this a great deal, but I don't think we'll see a major decline in the Middle East from this point forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yeah that's really what I was looking for. And then one other. You were citing the offshore deepwater rigs coming on at a pretty good increase in CapEx. Can you say that, you know, you already have placements at your traditional, you know, share for upper end equipment for the deepwater rigs that are coming on, particularly the wireline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They have &#x2013; I'm extremely satisfied with our market share on the new build deepwater rigs.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay that's good enough for me. Thanks, that's it for me.</p>

          <p>And a follow-up question from the line of Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Andrew just to be clear, can you discuss kind of the impact of international pricing versus the impact of international volume when it comes to when you see your margins dropping as opposed to the pricing dropping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry; I don't understand, Ole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things that drive margins, right? It's...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean, but what was the question? Was it activity or pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes it was &#x2013; I think you highlighted you expect pricing to trough in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>At least internationally...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...but pricing and margins are not necessarily always the same thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think we would say the same thing for margins. I've always said that. Right? Middle of 2010 and, you know, when I gave the number of deepwater rigs you know that the effect is going to be in the second half of the year not the first half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for clarifying that. And of course now we get the impact of the ones that were delivered last year, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we get a better &#x2013; it is much better than in 2009. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And when it comes to Brazil presalt and the potential to take some of that technology across to West Africa, could you comment a little about how you see technology trends in West Africa, particularly on some of the more complex wells that have been drilled in Brazil?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that, you know, the plate theory that says there should be a presalt in West Africa as there is in Brazil is gaining popularity. I think we need &#x2013; we need a few wells. And we probably need &#x2013; no, we need a few big exploration wells to find out whether or not people are going to consider that as a play. I'm not a geologist at that level. And you know, when you look at the suspect, the people who are going to drill those wells, you have to think they are going to be testing that theory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our advantage in West Africa is that we own the multiclient library for Angola. It is quite old. But given the prospects that &#x2013; the different prospects that people are going to start to look at, we can do a lot of reprocessing to make it attractive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how do you view your opportunity set in West Africa with your position there relative to the competitiveness of the Brazilian market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's much &#x2013; well actually I don't, I have no complaints about our position in Brazil. But I think that our overall competitive position in West Africa is probably stronger, which is a matter of infrastructure, logistics and presence, and the time we have been there.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the final question comes from the line of Dan Pickering, Tudor Pickering Holt please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for the follow-up opportunity. Even with higher spending next year, Andrew, big free cash, no net debt. Talk to us about how you think about cash, your comfort levels around letting cash build, your urgency to do acquisitions. Roll that all together for us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we still, you know, are actively pursuing opportunities in acquisitions, Dan. That's not necessarily a reason to build cash. We will keep the share creep from happening which means anything we issue for employee stock will get bought back and we agreed at the board meeting yesterday that we would review the dividend in the second half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would assume a review of the dividend is not for a lower dividend but a higher dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have never lowered.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have always said, Dan, we would never lower our dividend. We would have never put it at a level where we have to cut it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's helpful. And then when you think about dividends generally, I assume you are talking recurring, ongoing quarterly dividends not special or one-time dividends?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No ongoing quarterly. I'm not a great believer, personally, in special dividends.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, fantastic. And then just to sort of put a point around the nearer term I think what I heard you saying in your discussion around seasonality, etcetera is that our expectation should be that Q1 earnings should be slightly lower because of the seasonality and we should see an international trough in Q2 on margins and maybe some strength in the second half relative to the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you should assume that in Q1, you know, seasonality plus the absence of very strong software sales in Q4 will, you know, affect the results. And also don't forget the absence of multiclient in Q1. That will make a big difference. That, you know, Q2 will be the one where we're all holding our breath to see what happens in the second half of the year. So I've been avoiding trying to say it. But it is another year in two halves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>M'hmm. M'hmm. And then as we look to '11, obviously the &#x2013; Wall Street has a big expectations ramp in terms of estimates. Do you care to comment on those.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is way too early to say but I think that if oil prices remain where they are and the economic recovery stays on track, then, yes, there will be a considerable increase in exploration and production spending in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
