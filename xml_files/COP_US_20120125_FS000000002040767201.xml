        <plist>
          <p>Great. Good morning. Welcome to ConocoPhillips's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We appreciate your interest in our company. I'm joined today by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President of Finance and our CFO. This morning we'll provide a summary of our key financial and operating results for the fourth quarter as well as our outlook for 2012. As in the past, you can find our presentation material on the Investor Relations section of ConocoPhillips's website.</p>
          <p>Please take a look at the Safe Harbor Statement that we have on the bottom of this slide. It's a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this presentation and during the question-and-answer session. And actual results may be materially different from what's presented today, and factors that could cause those actual results to differ are included here as well as in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff Sheets to take you through our fourth quarter results. Jeff?</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayton. I'll start with an overview of our fourth quarter which is on Slide 2. During the quarter our earnings adjusted for special items were $2.7 billion or $2.02 a share. That's up from $1.9 billion or $1.32 a share in the fourth quarter of last year. Our annualized return on capital employed was 13%. We generated cash from operations of $5.8 billion, which is $4.39 per share.</p>
          <p>In E&amp;P our production of 1.6 million BOE per day was higher than the prior quarter and slightly above our expectations. In R&amp;M our global refining capacity utilization rate was 94%. We made significant progress on our asset disposition program with the sale of the Colonial Seaway Crude and Seaway Products pipelines for $2.4 billion in proceeds during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Our repurchase of 46 million shares this quarter represented 3% of our shares outstanding. And we ended the year with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>
          <p>So I'll turn the Slide 3 and talk about those earnings in more detail. <mark type="audio gap" /> Reported earnings for the quarter were $3.4 billion which included $723 million of special items. Special items included $1.5 billion in net gains from asset sales largely resulting from the pipeline dispositions I just mentioned. We also had $649 million of impairments. The large impairments include $395 million related to our investment in the Naryanmarneftegaz joint venture in Russia and $190 million for certain conventional natural gas (2:44) properties in Canada.</p>
          <p>Other special items in Q4 included $101 million in settlement and other costs related to the Bohai Bay incident and $25 million related to our repositioning efforts. So taking these special items into account, adjusted earnings were $2.7 billion, which is about $750 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2010. Our E&amp;P segment improved by around $500 million, primarily due to stronger crude oil and LNG prices offset by higher taxes. R&amp;M's fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $200 million were basically unchanged from a year ago. And combined our other segments contributed about $250 million to the increase in earnings this quarter. And we'll go through more detail on that on some subsequent slides.</p>
          <p>So let's go to Slide 4 and look at our 2011 full-year earnings. So full-year 2011 adjusted earnings were $12 billion, which were more than $3 billion improved from 2010. All of our business segments generated better financial results in 2011 than in 2010. So excluding the LUKOIL segment, for which we stopped recording equity earnings in the fourth quarter of 2010 and which had $1.25 billion of earnings in Q4 of 2010, our adjusted earnings increased by $4.6 billion from 2010 to 2011.</p>
          <p>So next we'll go through some detail on our segment earnings and we'll start with the production levels in upstream business, which are highlighted on Slide 5. Fourth quarter production was 1.6 million BOE per day. That's down 8% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. If you exclude the impact of dispositions and the suspension of our operations in China and Libya, production was down 1% over this time period.</p>
          <p>Asset dispositions reduced production by about 30,000 BOE per day. 14,000 BOE per day or so of that was from North America natural gas production. In Libya production was down 43,000 BOE per day compared to the same period last year. Production in Libya started again in late November and continues to ramp up and current production levels are around 20,000 BOE per day.</p>
          <p>In Russia we continue to have difficulties with the reservoir in the YK Field and our production was down 23,000 BOE per day in that area. In Bohai Bay our production was 38,000 BOE per day lower than a year ago. ConocoPhillips continued the depressurization plan for the field and continues to work with our co-venture and regulatory agencies related to Bohai Bay. So excluding these items I just discussed, increases in production from exploitation <mark type="audio gap" /> drilling, well performance and production from major projects offset decreases associated with decline and down time.</p>
          <p>So some things kind of compared to the (5:40) same period last year, fourth quarter production highlights included a 44,000 BOE per day increase in production from our Lower 48 liquids-rich shale plays: the Eagle Ford and the Barnett; 32,000 BOE per day increase from Qatargas 3 project and a 13,000 BOE per day associated with new wells at our SCCL joint venture from the Christina Lake Phase C ramp-up.</p>
          <p>So we'll see similar drivers when we look at our full-year production numbers on Slide 6. For the full-year 2011 production was 1.62 million BOE per day which was down 8% from 2010. Excluding the impacts of dispositions and Libya and China, production was down 2% or about 30,000 BOE per day. Asset dispositions for the year reduced production by 48,000 BOE per day, 17,000 BOE per day of which was North American natural gas production. Libya production was down 39,000 BOE per day and production out of Russia was down 23,000 BOE per day compared to the same period last year. And the full year impact of reduced production at Bohai Bay was 15,000 BOE per day. Like the fourth quarter numbers, 2011 project and drilling performance highlights included significant increases at QG3 and at our North American unconventional plays. And these increases largely offset the declines in the rest of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>So now I'll turn to E&amp;P earnings which is on Slide 7. Adjusted E&amp;P earnings for the quarter were $2.3 billion, which is 27% higher than the fourth quarter of last year. This increase was primarily driven by higher crude and NGL prices and these prices drove both our U.S. and our international adjusted earnings higher. Our earnings in the fourth quarter reflected a $3.50 Henry Hub natural gas price.</p>
          <p>In addition to price impact, lower DD&amp;A and favorable FX impacts increased earnings this quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. Adjusted earnings were negatively impacted this quarter verse us a year ago by lower sales volumes and higher costs. Costs were higher primarily due to the U.K. tax law change and the fact that the QG3 project was fully online.</p>
          <p>So next I'll move to Slide 8 and talk about some of our E&amp;P unit metrics. Our cash and income per BOE metrics were better than a year ago and better than the third quarter. For the year, income per BOE was $15.72 which was improved over $10.56 in 2010. Full year cash margins increased from $23.22 to $27.46 in 2011. This improvement largely reflects the increase in commodity prices but there's also a small margin enhancement related to changes in our production mix and we'll continue to focus on improving margins by shifting our portfolio to higher margin production as we go forward.</p>
          <p>Next let's look at R&amp;M earnings on Slide 9. R&amp;M adjusted earnings of $200 million were basically flat with the fourth quarter of last year. So R&amp;M is offsetting impacts to earnings this quarter. Refining margins were lower. That was offset by lower cost and higher volumes and higher marketing margins. And with the exception of the mid-continent area, the refining market environment in the fourth quarter was generally worse than the market we saw in the fourth quarter of 2010. This quarter, our refining margins benefited by approximately $180 million related to the impact of liquidating inventory associated with the portfolio changes we made during 2011.</p>
          <p>As compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 our volumes were a benefit to earnings as global utilization rates were 94%. And costs related to turnarounds were $90 million pre-tax during the fourth quarter which is $117 million less than the same period a year earlier. And utility costs were also lower primarily as a result of lower natural gas prices. So if you look at the full year 2011, R&amp;M generated $2.6 billion in adjusted earnings and $4.1 billion in operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>So we'll look at the R&amp;M unit metrics on Slide 10. The per-barrel metrics for Refining and Marketing were similar to a year ago and down significantly from the third quarter of this year. The fourth quarter income per BOE was $0.70 and the cash contribution was $1.50. For the year, income margins of $2.29 per BOE were improved over 2011 margins of $1.10 per BOE.</p>
          <p>We continue to look for ways to improve our margins through processing more advantaged crudes and increasing our clean product yield. An example of this is the Wood River refinery where at current market prices we expect about a $4.00 per barrel uplift in Wood River's margins as a result of the CORE project start-up in November of this year.</p>
          <p>We'll take a look at the results of our other operating segments on Slide 11. Adjusted earnings increased in both our Chemicals and our Midstream segments. Chemicals earnings of $156 million improved primarily result of higher volumes from international projects. 2011 earnings in this segment were $745 million, up from $498 million in 2010. Midstream earnings increased $27 million up to $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improvements in NGL prices. 2011 Midstream earnings for the year were $458 million up from $306 million in 2010. Adjusted corporate expenses were $154 million this quarter. This was lower than expected due to favorable foreign exchange impacts, higher capitalized interest, and lower interest expense.</p>
          <p>So now we'll move to talk about cash flow on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, we generated $5.8 billion in cash from operations, which includes $1 billion decrease in working capital. Also during the quarter, we closed several asset dispositions resulting in proceeds of $2.7 billion.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we funded a $4 billion capital program, $3.5 billion of which was directed towards E&amp;P. We also paid $4 billion in shareholder distributions split between $3.1 billion in share repurchases and $900 million in dividends. This quarter we also reduced debt by $527 million through the retirement of some notes that matured. And we ended the year with $5.8 billion in cash and $600 million in short-term investments. So that's looking at our fourth quarter cash flow.</p>
          <p>What we'll do on Slide 13 is look at our full year sources and uses of cash. So if you look at all of 2011 we generated $24 billion between cash from operations, asset dispositions and the sale of our LUKOIL shares and we reduced our cash and short-term investment position by $4 billion. The cash from operations number of $19.6 billion in 2011 was $2.6 billion higher than the cash from operations in 2010. So the cash from operations funded a capital program of $14 billion as well as our dividend of $3.6 billion. Our asset dispositions of $4.8 billion in 2011 included $1.2 billion from sale of our remaining interest in LUKOIL. And these proceeds along with cash from our previous asset sales largely funded the $11 billion share repurchase program. And during the year we also reduced debt by $969 million.</p>
          <p>So we'll turn to Slide 14 and look at our capital structure. At the end of 2011 our equity was down $3 billion compared to the end of 2010, largely as a result of our share repurchase program. Our debt balance was $22.6 billion, which was down $1 billion from the end of 2010. So that left our debt-to-capital ratio at 26% for the year.</p>
          <p>So next we'll move to Slide 15 and talk about some capital efficiency metrics. 2011 return on capital employed is 14%, which is up from the 2010 ROCE number of 10%. And our cash returned in 2011 was 23% versus 20% in 2010. The year-over-year improvements in ROCE were primarily driven by increased improved liquids prices and stronger refining margins as well as lower capital employed as a result of our share repurchase program. So looking at ROCEs on a segment level, E&amp;P ROCE improved from 12% to 16% while R&amp;M ROCE improved from 5% to 13%. The Chemicals segment had a 2011 ROCE of 29%, which is up from 22% last year and Midstream was 57% in 2011 up from 34% in 2010.</p>
          <p>So that completes the review of our fourth quarter 2011 results. And I'd like to next move and talk about &#x2013; give you update on our 2010 through 2012 repositioning efforts.</p>
          <p>So in late 2009 we laid out plans to reposition ConocoPhillips. We've made significant progress in these initiatives and plan to largely finish those in 2012. We've made changes to our portfolio in the past two years with $10.7 billion in asset sales and $9.5 billion of proceeds from our sale of our 20% interest in LUKOIL. Additionally, we've reduced the refining capacity by about 500,000 barrels per day since the end of 2009. And we expect to continue an asset sales program of $5 billion to $10 billion during 2012.</p>
          <p>We continue to progress our plans to create two leading energy companies. And we updated the Phillips 66 Form 10 in January and the distribution of the Phillips 66 shares and the completion of that transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2012, possibly as early as May.</p>
          <p>Another key part of our three-year plan is enhancing returns. As I just discussed, our returns improved significantly over this time period and we continue to focus our capital on higher margin production to help drive margins and returns higher.</p>
          <p>We've also focused on improving our financial flexibility and we've reduced debt by $6 billion over the last two years. The company's in good financial position today with debt-to-cap at 26% and cash and short-term investments of $6 billion. And we've grown shareholder distributions with $15 billion in share repurchases in 2010 and 2011 with an additional $5 billion to $10 billion planned for 2012 as we continue to execute the asset sales program. And we remain committed to maintaining a competitive dividend that increases annually.</p>
          <p>So we've outlined our plans. You can turn to Slide 17 and see some impact that has on some of our per share metrics. If you look at Slide 17 you see our reserves per share increased 12% from 2010 to 2011, went from 5.7 BOE per share in 2010 to 6.4 BOE per share in 2011. And our production per share when you adjust for the impact of the events in Libya increased 5% from 2010 to 2011, and we expect that, that will increase this year by another 3% to 5%.</p>
          <p>So I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before we open up the line to questions, some guidance for 2012 starting with our R&amp;M business. We expect turnaround activity to be about $450 million pre-tax, with about 40% of that activity occurring in the first quarter of 2012. And global refining capacity utilization is expected to be in the low 90s in 2012. In E&amp;P, we expect 2012 production to be about 1.6 million BOE per day excluding the impact of any additional asset sales. And the guidance we would give around the impact of additional asset sales is that could reduce production by 50,000 BOE per day to 100,000 BOE per day, and this production guidance assumes that we have some restoration of our production in Libya and Bohai Bay.</p>
          <p>As we announced earlier this week we had 2011 organic reserve replacement of 120%. Of the organic reserves we added last year, less than 10% were from natural gas in Lower 48 and Canada. We'll report our F&amp;D costs when we file our 10-K in late February, but we expect those to be in the $15 per BOE to $20 per BOE range. As we previously indicated our capital budget for 2012 is $15.5 billion and 90% of this will be directed towards E&amp;P. We expect our 2012 exploration expense to be around $1.2 billion, and I'll make a few comments about our progress in developing our exploration portfolio in some core areas.</p>
          <p>First, in Australia, we have plans to commence a five to seven well appraisal program around the Poseidon discovery later this quarter. In Angola we've officially received our operating licenses for blocks 36 and 37, and we've committed to a seismic program that's going begin this quarter. In the Gulf of Mexico, we participated in the recent deepwater lease sale where ConocoPhillips was a successful bidder representing an expenditure of about $157 million net for 75 blocs in the Paleogene play. And we continue to pursue high-quality liquids rich unconventional opportunities. In 2011 we added 500,000 acres in North America shale plays in areas that included the Avalon, the Wolf Camp, the Niobrara in the Lower 48 and the Duvernay and the Canol in Canada. In the Caspians, we expect to spud the Nursultan well later this quarter.</p>
          <p>So now I'll shift to our progress in growing our liquids rich Shale business in North America. That's the Eagle Ford, the Bakkan, the Permian, and the Cardium plays. First at Eagle Ford, we are currently running 16 rigs in the play. We expect to maintain a 16 rig account average and drill about 180 wells in 2012. Production in late December was around 50,000 BOE per day, and we continue to see some impacts from curtailments related to infrastructure constraints as a result of higher well volumes and increasing liquid content and just our ongoing development activity. We would anticipate that average production from Eagle Ford should grow to around 100,000 BOE per day by the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>In the Permian and the Bakken we were running a total of 10 rigs and expect to increase the supply as much as 50% during 2012. Fourth quarter production at the Permian and Bakken averaged 50,000 BOE per day and 18,000 BOE per day respectively. The Permian activities are focused around the Avalon, the Wolfberry and the Wolf Camp and we're using both horizontal and vertical drilling techniques there.</p>
          <p>So in addition to our efforts on shale, we're progressing major projects globally. During the quarter, the APLNG joint venture announced two sales agreements that complete the marketing of APLNG's second train with the sanctioning of this train construction expected during the first quarter of 2012. In conjunction with this LNG sale to Sinopec, the joint venture partners also agreed to terms which will allow Sinopec to raise their equity interest in the project from 15% to 25%.</p>
          <p>In the North Sea the development of our Jasmine fields underway with start-up expected later this year. We expect peak production rates of around 34,000 BOE per day in 2013 from that development. Our Ekofisk South and Eldfisk 2 projects continue to progress, and production from both these projects are expected in 2013 and 2014 respectively. The Wood River core project started operations in mid November and this is resulting in a 5% increase in the clean product yield at that refinery.</p>
          <p>Our Chemicals joint venture plans to build a world-scale 1.5 million metric ton per year ethylene cracker and two 500,000 metric ton per year polyethylene units near its existing Cedar Valley facility or near a site near the Sweeny facility in Old Ocean, Texas. And the estimated project completion date for these will be 2017. And our Midstream joint venture has several growth projects underway. These include developments in Niobrara, Permian, Eagle Ford and the Granite Wash plays along with logistic opportunities in the mid-continent area.</p>
          <p>And finally, a couple items from the corporate perspective. 2012 DD&amp;A is estimated to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of this year. And corporate expenses in 2012 are expected to be around $1 billion on an annual basis excluding any one-time impacts related to the repositioning efforts.</p>
          <p>So that concludes the prepared remarks. So we're ready to open up the line for questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And at this time we have a question from Arjun Murti from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. A couple of domestic production questions. You've had a very good sequential growth in your Lower 48 liquids production. Looks like throughout this year 10,000 barrels to 14,000 barrels a day quarter-on-quarter growth. Jeff, you mentioned that some of that is working through the backlog so there's still a little bit of a backlog. How can we think about these numbers over the course of 2012? You've got a big ramp-up in the Eagle Ford coming, you mentioned the Permian and the Bakken. Are these the types of sequential growth rates that are doable in your Lower 48 liquids business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so maybe just talk about Eagle Ford. So as we mentioned we said Eagle Ford is going from we think 50,000 BOE per day a day to around 100,000 BOE per day at the end of 2012. We probably have around 10,000 BOE per day but that's held back because of the infrastructure constraints.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that number used to be like a 30,000 BOE per day kind of number, if I'm remembering correctly in terms of backlog of production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It comes and goes. So as we've commented, as Eagle Ford continues to ramp up, we'll be probably working with infrastructure constraints on through this year and on into 2013 I think. And once we get beyond the 2013 we feel like the infrastructure constraints will be largely behind it. So if you just looked at Eagle Ford and the Bakken and the Permian, maybe those, our fourth quarter production from those areas was around 116,000 BOE per day. And that was right at 50,000 BOE per day out of Eagle Ford, about 18,000 BOE per day out of the Bakken and 50,000 BOE per day out of the Permian. We see it over time that those are going to grow to where they get to be in the 2013 to 2015 time period over 250,000 BOE per day to maybe 275,000 BOE per day. And it's going to just increase fairly steadily over that time period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Conversely on the gas side obviously very low gas price too.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about where your gas count was in 2011 or where it ended the year whatever metric you have? Where it's going in 2012 and then what you think that means in terms of what happens to your Lower 48 gas volumes in 2012. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, if you look at gas drilling, it's in the few hundreds of millions of dollars of our capital program that is addressed towards gas drilling. Even that level of expenditure given the more recent developments of natural gas pricing is something that we're looking pretty closely at.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know Arjun just kind of covered natural gas but I had the question, in the past I know during weak gas pricing periods we've seen Conoco shut end production. I was curious if we were going to hear something on that front this morning. Is that in the cards here near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. Let me talk about gas production. So our fourth quarter natural gas production in Canada in the Lower 48 was around 2.5 BCF a day, so about 400 MBOE per day, maybe a little more, 400 MBOE per day, 410 MBOE per day. So as we look across that portfolio, there's probably two thirds of it, where the economics are really driven by liquids production and not natural gas prices. So kind of off the top there's a portion of our portfolio, which it's just not going to make sense to shut in. Then if you look at &#x2013; so maybe one and a half out of two and a half BCF of natural gas is really associated with liquids production.</p>
          <p>Looking at say the remaining BCF a day, some of that we operate, some of that we don't operate and we have partners on the lot of that production as well and partners have different views about shut ins with most &#x2013; I think partners generally not wanting to shut in natural gas and lose the cash flow associated with that. So we are looking at the portion of our production that we can kind of control that decision entirely on and think that we will have some shut ins of natural gas going forward. And it's going be on the order of 100 million cubic feet a day or something like 15,000 BOE per day to 20,000 BOE per day going forward. We'll continue to watch that as the year goes on; we see how natural gas markets develop.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. The last question I had for you I was curious if you had update on Venezuela. Obviously one of your peers has had I guess less-than-favorable arbitration result recently. I'm curious if you have any comments you can make?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you're referring to the Exxon ruling that got in their ICC arbitration. So we chose not to pursue ICC arbitration and instead chose to pursue ICSID arbitration, which is the World Bank process. We've been through that hearing. We are awaiting a ruling on that, which we expect will occur, could occur early this year even. But we can't really be certain of the timing of that. And we still feel very good about the case we have there.</p>
          <p>Again, like we've said on previous calls, what the initial ruling will be about will probably not result in a number, but will result in kind of the parameters around which the number will be calculated. And then we'll have a period where that will be done and there will be a period where appeals can also happen. So we're still at least two or three years away from having something that we can collect.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Just a quick question going back to you gave some numbers on the unconventional volumes in the U.S. And in the Bakken you said you're doing what is it about 15,000 barrels a day right now, of equivalent production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, about 18,000 BOE per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>18,000 BOE per day. Okay. And then Permian you're doing around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Around 50,000 BOE per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>15,000 BOE per day? Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>50,000 BOE per day. Five zero. 50,000 BOE per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, okay. Got you. Five zero. Okay. That makes sense. And then if you could just contrast the Bakken to the Eagle Ford for a second here. Because in the Eagle Ford you guys are running 16 rigs, you're doing 50,000 barrels a day going to 100,000 barrels a day. In the Bakken you're going from 10 to 15 rigs and you're only doing about 18,000 barrels a day. Are the economics that much better in Eagle Ford for you than in the Bakken or is there some sort of ramp up period or well backlog that we're waiting for in the Bakken to come online?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both of those things, Faisel. The economics are better for us in the Eagle Ford than they are in the Bakken. So that will have priority as we think about where we're allocating our capital. We hold our leases in the Bakken on a long-term basis and don't need to do drilling there in order to maintain our acreage position. So we're taking a very measured approach there. We don't want to get ahead of infrastructure in the Bakken. So you'll see us continue to ramp up our activities there. They're good, strong return projects, but it's not as strong as what we have in the Eagle Ford.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one question on the asset sale program you've announced the Colonial sale, you announced the COA sale, are there logistics assets that you guys are looking to divest of or are we still expected from here on out for most of the asset sales to be on the Upstream side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of things. I don't know if I missed this in your prepared remarks, Jeff, but what is the current status of Bohai Bay? Are you back onstream? Are you allowed to bring it back up and what is the production level if you can help us out, first of all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So production levels were down about- I think we said 33,000 a day in the fourth quarter from our previous level, which was kind of our 45,000/50,000 level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About 15,000 to 20,000 barrels a day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In the fourth quarter. So we are working through a process of getting a revised field operating and development plan approved. We're working that with the relevant agencies in China. We hope to proceed with that as soon as we can, but we can't really give you guidance on exactly when that's going to occur.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Clayton, the numbers are currently about 15,000 barrels a day to 20,000 barrels a day? Is that still a good run rate as we look forward for now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think we would see that actually &#x2013; it will vary during 2012. It could potentially be lower in the first quarter and then improve as the year goes on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's as good as anything that we can give you right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thanks. I hate to pound on the issue of shutting in gas production, but if I may just get some clarification there. So you're suggesting you could maybe shut in about 100 million a day. Is that operated or are there third party production that you might have an interest in as well that might change that further? A little bit of clarity on that would be appreciated, Jeff, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's just looking at the things that we operate where we largely control the decision. I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And that don't have any liquids production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That don't have significant liquids production.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That don't have any kind of operational concerns that you have to work through with shutting in. I think this will be a subject that gets discussed quite a bit between partners, all throughout the industry as we go forward, and that could change if we have persistent low natural gas prices. But our kind of immediate guidance is that it looks like the numbers we said something on the order of 15,000 BOE to 20,000 BOE per day or around...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And my final one if I can squeeze one more in is just a very quick update please on the infrastructure in the Eagle Ford. I mean, clearly the ramp up has continued to go very, very strong. So are you managing to keep up with that? And I'll leave it at that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there are a couple things that have happened in the fourth quarter. So take away capacity has increased significantly in the fourth quarter over the third. There's additional trucks. There's a new condensate pipeline station, which came online in late September. As Jeff mentioned we have some production curtailment due to infrastructure constraints as a result of well volumes. But we're going to work with several companies to increase off take capacity in the near and long term, and get transportation commitments set up for condensate and also increase or invest in increasing gas gathering and processing capacity.</p>

          <p>Clayton, could we just talk about the splits? I know you've been fairly specific about this, but I just wanted to reconfirm the dates for the intended split. And I had a question, which you may not frankly be able to answer but of the cash from operations you talked about in 2011, I think it was $19.6 billion, could you separate the upstream and downstream components of that? And perhaps spin forward your latest thoughts on &#x2013; versus whether or not it's a 2011 cash flow or whatever else you assume mid cycle cash flow will be, how the upstream and downstream companies in your latest thinking will be spending money and growing. You mentioned a major Chemicals project in your prepared remarks, for example. Any further just updates on the split process would be great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Well, downstream there's probably $1 billion or so of capital that goes into the R&amp;M business as far as just keeping our refineries safe and making sure that we're doing the right things around our Refining business. The excess cash flow coming out of Phillips 66, we're talking internally about where that goes right now, whether that's into Chemicals or Midstream ventures. Those are probably more likely candidates for the free cash flow that comes out of the business. But we'll be able to provide you with more of our thinking about that before the spin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Before May you'll be coming back with a more specific set of go-forward assumptions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the plan &#x2013; we're not going to have an &#x2013; the typical Analyst Meeting that we have in March, we've decided not to have. But we do plan on meeting with you and with others in the financial community about what our plans are both at Phillips 66 and with ConocoPhillips. I think both Ryan and Greg will be available to the Street. And we haven't scheduled that but think about a March or April timeframe when we'll be out there and be able to fill you in a little bit more on what our thinking is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one, I guess the main issue in my mind Clayton, Jeff, is the buy-back. Can you remind us what happens with the buy-back once we split how that works going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So when we talked about asset sales of $5 billion to $10 billion that's going to &#x2013; it's pretty heavily weighted to the upstream side of the business going forward. We said the share repurchases will generally kind of track along with that, which says that we are continuing to buy shares, currently, not at the same rates we were buying them last year but we're &#x2013; so you'll see first quarter that there will be some buy-backs that occur, actually in the first quarter. Then the pace of buy-backs will depend upon the pace of our asset sales program and that really goes for ConocoPhillips both before and after the split of the downstream company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the downstream company, as Clayton mentioned, we'll be out before the split talking more about how we're going be allocating cash in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the thinking, at least right now, around use of cash in Phillips 66 post split, I would say we have prioritized the first couple billion or so towards debt reduction versus share repurchase. But those decisions have yet to be made.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. I think you've given me enough pieces to fit it again together. Very finally Clayton, on the asset sales, within Phillips 66, is there any update on I think it was Alliance and Trainer that were publicly known to be out there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I don't think we have any updates. I think data rooms are open. I think indicative bids are &#x2013; the deadline is coming up and we'll take a look at what comes in and then make our decisions going forward. We don't have anything to add from what we've already talked about earlier on Trainer or Alliance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Good morning. Couple things if I could. Did the endeavor sale of the U.K. assets close in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's still yet to close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Did not close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Did not close, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Anything going on with respect to the Vietnam sale? Been a lot of talk in the trades about bids that you've received yet haven't heard much of anything in terms of discussions coming to a conclusion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll give you the same answer we've been giving you on asset sales. We're working through a lot of different processes and it's not helpful to us to try to have a lot of information out until we get kind of to a finishing point on those. So I'm afraid there's not much to update you on there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of the Eagle Ford production numbers, Jeff and Clayton, that you talk about, still running about 70% liquids? And do you expect, as the numbers build, to maintain that kind of liquids ratio?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think we see more like 75% liquids. Yeah that is our expectation going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You think you'll hold it at that level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, of course, Mark, I think the classification for the liquids there, is it retrograde condensate, is the term that's used internally to describe those liquids.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure what you mean by that Clayton?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As opposed to NGL you mean?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there is NGL component but it's primarily condensate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a high value liquid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay. All right. And in terms of the LIFO item, if I can call it that, in the fourth quarter, can I assume that's entirely U.S., that it's after tax figure and that it's included in your recorded and published refining margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is. It's all U.S. and it is after tax and it is included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one final one for me. Been a fair amount of talk, this isn't really asset sales oriented, but I've seen a fair amount of talk that you may be seeking partners either for your Eagle Ford activities and/or your Canadian oil sands outside of the partnerships with Cenovus. Can you comment on the veracity of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we intend to pursue Eagle Ford as 100% development going forward. So I hadn't heard that one but we can tell you that there's nothing behind that. We are investigating options for our oil sands properties outside of the Foster Creek-Christina Lake joint venture. We think there's quite a bit of interest in properties like that. So we'll do some things to find out how the market would value those and make our decisions going forward based on what we find out. But we would intend to maintain interest in the properties outside of SCCL. It's just a question as to whether there would be value to bringing in a partner to develop this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Jeff, that would include Surmont?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it would include Surmont.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Final one for me. Excluding the WRB partnership, give me a rough idea of the WTI reference priced crude that you ran in the fourth quarter, taking the partnership out of the equation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is fourth quarter WTI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fourth quarter WTI reference ex-WRB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ex-Borger and Wood River is going be &#x2013; I think it's going to be around 200,000 barrels a day, but let us check our numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Including those two, it's somewhere between 450,000 barrels per day and 500,000 barrels per day. So I just have to back out what Borger and Wood River represent.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, that's pretty much 100% on those two, isn't it? If WTI reference if you include WCS' WTI reference crude?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we have half of Borger and half of Wood River so that's what? That's 350,000 barrels per day or 250,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Something like that. The math seems to work.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's 200,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day, something like that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Several quick questions. Jeff, you say $180 million on the inventory gain. Pre-tax number, should we just assume 35% tax rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably a good assumption, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the Bohai Bay, the press release talking about a settlement with compensation fund, if that's settled all the losses it out there or that there's other things that are still pending we should be aware?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the settlement is for the fisheries that were potentially impacted by the spill, which is the primary issue that we were dealing with. So that is probably about all we can say at that point. We don't know if there will be other things beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How about from the regulator? I think they have fined you guys some small amount. I presume that based on the Chinese norm that that's really not a major potential fine that we should expect from the regulator, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Paul, what we can really say at this point is that we think that the settlement we just announced last night is an important step forward and resolves kind of the most pressing issues that were out there and we're just going to need to move forward with the process with the authorities there. There's not a lot else we can comment on at this point in time.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. And, Jeff, looking at your financial statement you have about $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion of the deferred tax cash contribution in 2011. Is that all contributed from the IDC deduction in the U.S.? Or does that relate to other things also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. It really doesn't &#x2013; it's primarily related to just timing differences between tax depreciation and financial depreciation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's not related to IDC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>IDC could be a small portion of that number but it's not a big number for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a small portion. And once that you spin off, is the treatment for the IDC deduction is going to change? Currently you are deducting, what, 50% or 75%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, I'd have to get back to you. We don't &#x2013; it's not a very high percentage of that number because of the category that we fall in. It's different rules for different size...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Producers. And then even going forward it's a complex set of rules upon that will determine which category you follow, you fall into, and we could be still considered an integrated by some of those measures even going forward because we have things like fractionation capacity and some of our processing up on the North Slope. So it's not as clear-cut, it's just kind of saying that we move from one category to another.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. So you currently based on your best guesses that you may not change that much for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure that we see it's a significant change for us. That's correct.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be great. Final one. The APLNG, the Sinopec the interest increase to 25%. Last time when they opt-in that write-down, should we assume that as a result that the carrying cost for you guys is already now at a level the increase in the interest in here is not going to change your carrying value?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we'll be working that as we go forward. It depends some on exactly when the whole transaction ends up closing. We will have an additional write down on APLNG when that transaction closes. It won't be the same magnitude of what we had before, and right now we'd say that's in the neighborhood of $100 million.</p>

          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very good. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Weiss with Argus Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Phil.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple quick questions. The North America acreage acquisition that you mentioned, any color on how much or where those were?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're kind of reluctant to just give kind of exactly what was where, but it's in the areas we mentioned, which were the Duvernay, the Canol, Avalon, Wolf Camp, Niobrara, and some other areas. It was probably two thirds Canadian, a third Lower 48 acreage and then it was all targeting plays, which we believe are liquids rich plays and not gas plays.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There were some public disclosures on the UT license round at Wolf Camp, but we haven't given a lot of detail yet because we're not finished buying.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The exploration expense, any dry hole charges you can identify in the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's see. I think we've got that. So we had what, $141 million dry hole expense in E&amp;P for the quarter? I think that's the number, but we can get back to you on that one, Phil. I don't know where those were but obviously it was higher in the fourth quarter than it was the rest of the year, but we can come back and let you know where those dry hole expenses took place.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then last one there's just something I'm a little bit confused about. When I looked at the financial statement information that you gave it showed impairments in the fourth quarter of $304 million. But then when you have the special items, the impairments were like $695 and I didn't understand why that was?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So are you looking at Page 3 on the special items page on the supplement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the question is what, E&amp;P impairments or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if I look at the consolidated income statement it shows impairments of $304 million. And then if you look at Page 3 just for international E&amp;P impairments it's $585 million and for U.S. it's $44 million. So that's $629 million. And I think the total number when you did your whole reconciliation was $695 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me come back to you on that one. I'll give you call this afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm not sure...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure why we put in that $304 million number on the face of the income statement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's all I have thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. It's Iain Reid actually from Jefferies over in London. Sorry about that.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Unfortunately, no. My phone &#x2013; she's a lot better looking than me though. Just a couple questions please. Firstly on your oil sands...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's not saying very much actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's not saying very much actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Just on your oil sands disposal, can you say why at Surmont you're looking to reduce your interest in rather than the SCCL joint venture? Is it just because of the fact it's a joint venture and it's tied up with the refining? Or is there a kind of specific reason why it's so much on the other assets rather than that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we look at the Surmont project and our remaining assets and complying with the SCCL and thinking of the size of oil sands in our portfolio and also the values that people attribute to properties that are kind of out in the marketplace right now, and think it makes sense to just find out what value the market would ascribe to that. It's most straightforward to do that on the Surmont project. But it's not just Surmont, it's the Thornbury, Clyden and Saleski acreage that we have as well that we would consider doing something with as a package.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And SCCL I think we would probably look at as more of a part of our portfolio and good economics and something that's going to generate growth for us over a longer period of time and good returns. I think most people look at SCCL as probably the premiere oil sands assets. And so it could be that TCS and Surmont won't be able to generate the types of returns that SCCL can.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Clayton. I wonder whether your thoughts have changed or progressed in terms of LNG exports now you've seen these deals signed up in the Gulf Coast by the <mark type="ph" /> Shanea (60:55) facilities, which they intend to build. Is that something now, which you might look at again or put more emphasis on given the still substantial amounts of U.S. gas which you're producing or will be producing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's something we are going to continue to study. It's really not just thinking about it from the perspective of Lower 48 natural gas production, but as we think about to what long-term alternatives are for Canadian gas production. And importantly as we think about what alternatives could be for development of the North Slope gas in Alaska. Those are all things that we'll be investigating whether liquefaction and export of natural gas makes sense going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks, Jeff. And then last one. Just coming back to this $180 million of inventory liquidation, can we assume that, that is all associated with the shutdown of Trainer and the associated tankage and pipes, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A large part of it was Trainer. Things we had inventory in the Seaway Products Pipeline, for example. We sold some terminals during the year that had inventory as well. So Trainer was the largest single component of that, but it wasn't all related to Trainer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this wasn't kind of an inventory price adjustment, this was a real liquidation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>An exit from that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right. Thanks very much, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we reduced our inventories kind of across the system by about 10 million barrels during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for your help.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey. Good afternoon, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Evan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot to be covered here, so just a couple questions here on the quarter. Just a follow-up on the last question on inventory liquidation, I mean is there any quantification on what is coming back? What is year-end related that we should see back in 1Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of building inventory?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably not. You're saying what our inventory levels will return to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. If there was anything &#x2013; I know there's some that's inventory liquidation, but if some was into taking inventories down into year-end if something would come back in 1Q and offset?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I mean we have inventories related to our system and then we have some inventories that we take on as kind of more of a systems optimization trading type operations. We'll bring some of those back on in the first quarter. But I don't think we have a number that we can give you as guidance right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the change in the corporate charge, $151 million, I mean can you de-construct that a little bit just so, again, to understand better what's recurring? I presume the forex element would be a nonrecurring change?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, forex is nonrecurring change. And you can see in our supplemental information that, that was $45 million to $50 million of that difference. We changed the &#x2013; in our comments you probably picked up we were saying corporate costs we would say going forward are more of a $1 billion dollar per year run rate and we're $250 million a quarter. I think our previous guidance was more like $275 million a quarter. So just interest costs lower being the driver of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Capitalized interest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; yeah, capitalized interest was a little bit higher than we initially anticipated it was going to be. I'd say those were the major drivers of it. So forex is a big part of that, which is going to be changed from quarter-to-quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Angola block payment was that included in 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it was a first quarter 2012 item.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then you mentioned Chevron Phillips you guys were conducting the study for the 3 billion ton Gulf Coast I think cracker. What are the key dates in 2012 on that project? I mean when will we have any more specifics on the costs and FID dates, timing, et cetera?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I'm not sure exactly when we go to FID on it. Well, to answer your question I guess we'll give you more information on that in late March, early April, when we come out and start talking about the sources of growth for Phillips 66.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. And just lastly, just to follow-up on the buyback. I mean does your buyback guidance in 2012 contemplate the $5.8 billion distribution related to the leveraging on Phillips 66? Because that would impact the kind of timing of available cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the intent to use Phillips 66 back for debt reduction primarily, is it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so primarily. So we're talking about...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I got you. It's at a Conoco level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so we'll have roughly $6 billion of proceeds come in from the distribution as we've contemplated it now. And we've targeted taking our ConocoPhillips debt level down to around $18 billion. We ended the year at $22.5 billion. So we're going to use about $4.5 billion of that to reduce debt. So it will be some that goes into the cash from that distribution.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the thinking on share repurchases really, Evan, think about share repurchase being funded by asset sales. That's what's going to fund that activity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And based upon at least the bid dates you're hopeful that the two refining asset sales could be received prior to distribution?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think that we would give you that impression.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There'll be things to work through on refinery sales, which will probably take those posts</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Appreciate it guys.</p>
