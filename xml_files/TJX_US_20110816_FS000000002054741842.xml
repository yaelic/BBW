      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Joining me and Sherry on the call are Ernie Herrman and Jeff Naylor. Let me begin by saying that I'm very pleased with our second quarter results as our 23% adjusted EPS growth significantly exceeded our original guidance. This also marks the sixth consecutive year of second quarter EPS increases of 20% or greater.</p>
          <p>Our 4% overall comp sales increase was also ahead of plan, representing the sixth consecutive year that comp store sales have grown 3% or higher in the second quarter. It is very important to note that we continue to achieve these strong results year after year in both good economic times and weak ones, which speaks to the consistency of our business model and our ability to stay in top and bottom line growth to all types of cycles. Customer traffic continue to be up over significant increases last year which tells us that our value continues to be as important as ever to consumers.</p>
          <p>Before I begin, let me turn the call over to Jeff to recap the second quarter results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Carol. Good morning, everyone. So I'm just going to run through the numbers here. Net sales reached $5.5 billion for the quarter, that's an 8% increase over last year, and second quarter consolidated comp stores sales were up 4%. Diluted earnings per share were $0.90. That compares with last year's reported $0.74 per share. However, last year's results included a benefit of $0.01 per share from an item impacting comparability. So if we exclude that benefit, diluted EPS in the second quarter was up 23% over last year's adjusted $0.73.</p>
          <p>This year's results include a $0.03 benefit from foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to mark-to-market adjustments on our inventory related hedges. So excluding this impact, the underlying growth would be slightly lower than the numbers imply, but still very strong. As a remainder, our guidance contemplated this impact.</p>
          <p>Consolidated free tax profit margin for the quarter was 10.2%, that's above our original guidance and up 60 basis points on an adjusted basis over the prior year. The increase was driven by improved gross profit margin, partially offset by very slight deleverage in SG&amp;A expense, which had been expected, currently contributed 10 basis points of the increase.</p>
          <p>The gross profit margin improved 70 basis points versus last year, primarily due to buying an occupancy expense leverage as well as the positive impact in mark-to-marked adjustments on our inventory-related hedges. Merchandise margins were flat for the company against large increases the past three years, but merchandise markets were actually up approximately 10 to 20 basis points in our North American business.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expense was up 10 basis points over prior year, which was better than we had guided on our first quarter call with the increase entirely due to higher advertising expense. Now, you may recall that we expected SG&amp;A to deleverage in the first half of the year, primarily due to the timing of certain expense items as we absorbed certain costs from A.J. Wright and our other businesses as well as deleverage from Europe. At that time, we said that these factors would moderate as move through the year, which is exactly what we saw in the second quarter. We continue to expect SG&amp;A rates to be up very slightly for the year on a 2% to 3% planned comp.</p>
          <p>As for the inventories, at the end of the second quarter consolidated inventory on a per store basis including the warehouses increased 16%, up 15% on a constant currency basis, an adverse of the 13% decrease last year. As we've discussed on prior calls, nearly been talking about all spring, this increase is primarily to due to our having selectively taken advantage of much larger quantities of end of season branded pack-away product compared with very low quantities in the prior year. And this pack-away product doesn't start flowing to the stores until the third quarter.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that the overall increase is purely a timing issue as our forward purchase commitments for the back half are significantly lower than at this time last year. Additionally, the increase in inventory is all in our distributions centers. Our store inventories remain down versus prior year and are turning more quickly. Therefore, we feel like we're in an excellent position to capitalize on the opportunities we're currently seeing and believe we will continue to see in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In terms of share distribution, we retired 5.9 million shares, buying back $311 million worth of TJX stock during the quarter. Year to date, we have retired 13.1 million shares buying back $673 million of stock. We continue to anticipate buying back approximately $1.2 billion worth of TJX stock this year.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn the call back to Carol. I'll provide details about our third quarter guidance and recap our guidance for the full year at the end of the call.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeff. Now moving to the key points, there are two major things that I want to highlight. First, our strong second quarter and our ability to post EPS gains of 20% plus for six consecutive years reflects the consistency of TJX. Second, we have many exciting opportunities to the back half 2011 and beyond.</p>
          <p>Beginning with consistency, our strong top and bottom line results in the second quarter are yet another example of how the flexibility of the TJX business model succeeds regardless of the strength of the economy. To recap our divisional results, in the U.S., we are very pleased with Marmaxx and HomeGoods' continued excellent performance. Once again this quarter, both of these divisions have strong comp and bottom line performance on top of very challenging comparisons last year.</p>
          <p>At Marmaxx, comp sales increased 5% over 3% increase last year and on top of the 4% increase a year before that. Segment profit margin was 13.1%, up 50 basis points over last year's very strong performance.</p>
          <p>Marmaxx continue to excel through great execution, continuing to show gains in customer traffic. We have great confidence in the ability of our largest division to continue to grow successfully. Importantly, we will continue to evaluate the potential number of Marmaxx stores given the strong performance of our new stores and our ability to trade across a wider income demographic.</p>
          <p>At HomeGoods, comps increased 3% over last year's very strong 8% increase and on top of a 9% increase two years ago. Segment profit increased 7% with segment profit margins down slightly due to the increased advertising investment as well as certain costs associated with the A.J. Wright store conversion.</p>
          <p>At HomeGoods, our success is also a testament to division's sharp execution. If you've been in a HomeGoods lately, you know that the store looks terrific with fresh and exciting assortment from around the globe.</p>
          <p>TJX Canada's second quarter results were disappointing. Comps decreased 3% versus a 6% increase last year. Profits delevered on the negative comp although much less than we would have expected due to the strong inventory management and expense control. We believe that we could have better execution particularly in women's, and the kids' &#x2013; and the children's business both of which performed poorly.</p>
          <p>Importantly, our team in Canada is extremely focused on these issues, which we believe will be fixed in the back half. Further our store inventories and forward commitments are well below last year's level.</p>
          <p>While still early, we are very pleased with Marshalls in Canada. Customer response has been overwhelmingly good and the impact on nearby Winners stores has been much less than we had expected. We're especially pleased with how Marshalls' dominant footwear assortment is differentiating the Marshalls plan from Winners.</p>
          <p>Moving to TJX Europe, we have done a significant amount of work in this business and are weary of specificity in terms of our progress exiting the first half. So, the quarter comps were flat, which was in line with our expectation and segment profit was $7 million at the high-end of our expectation including a moderate currency benefit. Some merchandise categories are performing well and we continue to work on improving others.</p>
          <p>We feel good about our inventory turns and liquidity, which positions us very well to pursue the plentiful buying opportunities in the European marketplace. We're also pleased with both the quality and quantity of the merchandise and the brands that we are seeing there. As we exit the first half, our comparisons in Europe become much easier and we continue to expect greater improvement in the second half, which is when TJX Europe typically earns the majority of its profit.</p>
          <p>We are also confident that we understand our missteps in Europe over the last year and have the plans in place to get this business back on track. By slowing store growth in Europe this year, we're giving our team time to refocus on the core off-price fundamentals that help build TJX Europe into a successful business. Importantly, the team is more seasoned and is now a year smarter, and we are focused on buying more country-specific goods.</p>
          <p>Fundamentally, we continue to have a very strong business model in Europe. Europeans love quality, they love fashion and they certainly love value. The vendor marketplace is very receptive and full of opportunities. We're the only major off-price retailer in Europe, and long-term, the retail landscape there holds vast opportunities for our business.</p>
          <p>I'm sure you're all curious as to how the recent unrest in the UK has impacted our business. We did have a few days of business interruption, but I'm relieved to say that we're back on track and operating normally since this past weekend.</p>
          <p>Now to our opportunities for the back half of the year, first, let me say that while our comparisons become easier, we continue to plan conservatively especially in the current environment, as Jeff will detail in a moment. At the same time, we are always motivated to surpass our goal. Here are some of the many opportunities that do get us excited.</p>
          <p>First, I feel very good about our inventories entering the back half. Our inventories are up again. It's a timing issue due to high quality branded pack-away we've been carrying all spring. Our forward commitments to the fall selling season are significantly lower than at this time last year. This puts us in a great position to chase buying opportunities in a marketplace that is quite plentiful right now. I believe that our best brand penetration gets even stronger every year and we will be offering both brands and fashion at tremendous value.</p>
          <p>Second, I have never been more excited about our back half marketing. I love our marketing plans and ideas, and I'm confident that these efforts will continue to drive customer traffic. While we're increasing our advertising expense slightly this year, we are gaining much higher penetration. We're deploying what would have been A.J. Wright ad dollars to other divisions and also doing a much better job of leveraging our spending across the company. I believe our marketing campaigns are stronger than ever, and you'll be seeing a lot of us in the back half, including on television in Europe.</p>
          <p>Third, our investments to upgrade the shopping experience continue to pay dividends. We're seeing sales lift in our newly remodeled stores comparable to when we began the program. We're on track to complete about 370 store remodels across the company this year. In terms of Marmaxx, by year end, we expect we will have upgraded two thirds of its stores as we began the program three years ago.</p>
          <p>We believe that the enhanced marketing combined with our improved shopping environment and experience will help us increase our customer base and our market penetration. We still have tremendous opportunities in front of us. While we improve each year, our data tells us that there is still 75% of U.S. shoppers who have not visited a T.J. Maxx or a Marshalls in the past 12 months.</p>
          <p>Fourth, in terms of the macro environment, we see the economic volatility and confusion around costs and sourcing as a positive for our business. Historically, uncertainty in the marketplace has benefited us as it creates very favorable off-price buying opportunity. Value continues to be more important than ever and the key for us to maintaining our pricing distance from traditional retailers. We have enormous flexibility in terms of merchandise categories, zigging and zagging in many ways.</p>
          <p>We're very good at shifting categories and I believe that we can respond faster to pricing and fashion trends than just about any other retailer. So, regardless of whether other retailers raise their prices or absorb rising costs, our flexibility should allow us to buy into current trend, take advantage of the opportunity and drive merchandise margin.</p>
          <p>We are planning our average ticket to be slightly up in the back half, which should only enhance the value we are offering compared to other retailers whom we believe have generally planned price increases. As always, we will remain focused on maintaining our value gap with traditional retailers.</p>
          <p>It's interesting to note that our average basket has been trending up, primarily due to the number of items customers are buying per basket. If this continues, it bodes well for the fall selling season and beyond. Tremendous value is our mission, and we believe that we are in a great position to keep bringing consumers through our doors and keep them coming back.</p>
          <p>Finally, we have many category initiatives underway across the company for the back half. As usual it will be extremely defaulted to the holidays and believe our customers will be very happy and more wowed than ever this year.</p>
          <p>Before closing, I want to cover a couple of other key points. First, while still very early, the economics of our converted A.J. Wright stores are essentially in line with our expectations and we remain confident in the short and long-term economic benefit to our business. Additionally, the cost to close and consolidate this division was much less than we had originally estimated.</p>
          <p>The important things to remember here is that consolidating A.J. Wright has given up the opportunity to grow the Marmaxx base more than we had believed we could in the past. We are learning more about this customer demographic and really are just getting started to scratch the surface in terms of what Marmaxx can do in a more moderate demographic market.</p>
          <p>Second, our continued cost reduction initiatives are another reason for our confidence in our margin sustainability short and long term. We remain on track with our plans to reduce cost by approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2011, which help protect our profit margin and offset other cost increases.</p>
          <p>Third, we continue to make significant investment to support the growth of our businesses. We remain focused on hiring and developing the best talent, which is key to growing our business, investing and infrastructure both to supply chain and systems and building an eCommerce team for the future.</p>
          <p>So summing up, we're confident about our opportunities for the second half of 2011 and beyond. Our strong top and bottom line growth in second quarter achieved on top of years of profitable growth clearly demonstrates the consistency of this business in both recession and recovery. We have excellent opportunities for the back half of the year when our comparisons become easier and our marketing really kicks in. At TJX Europe, we are where we thought we'd at this point and are beginning to see progress, and we are looking for greater improvement in the second half.</p>
          <p>We'll see the volatility in the macro environment and confusion around sourcing and pricing is playing to our strength, and we will use our flexibility to take full advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace. Our customer traffic increases clearly tell us that value remains the top priority in consumers mind and further this business is levered to carry our financial return. Our strong operations generate enormous amounts of cash and after reinvesting in our business, our management team is focused on returning excess cash to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And finally, the thing I love most about our business is the flexibility of our model. At the end of the day, we're on our execution game, have every confidence that we will continue to grow and succeed.</p>
          <p>So now, I'll turn it back Jeff who will go through guidance, before we open it up for Q&amp;A.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I'd like to cover two items before I get to guidance. First, I'd like to speak to the impact of currency on our Canadian and European divisions' second quarter results, which are available on tables we posted on our website but that we want to call out on this call given the pretty significant movement in currency rates during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For TJX Canada, we reported $92 million in segment profit compared with $82 million in the prior year and a 40 basis point improvement in segment profit margin. Now, if you exclude the benefit of currency, segment profits actually decline slightly by about $3 million and segment profit margin was down 70 basis points. That said, this is a very strong performance on a 80% comp store sales decline and much better than we would have expected and reflects very strong inventory and expense management.</p>
          <p>For TJX Europe, we reported $7 million in segment profit for the quarter compared with $2 million last year and a segment profit margin improvement of 70 basis points. Now, if we exclude the benefit, currency segment profit declined very slightly by about $3 million to $5 million so Europe was still profitable on a &#x2013; excluding the currency impact. And segment profit margin declined 70 basis points on the flat comp. That said, we are encouraged that Europe posted a profit for the quarter in our efforts to improve the performance at this division and, again, I would note that that was a flat comp for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Second item I want to cover before getting into guidance is to briefly recap the A.J. Wright consolidation, which is now essentially complete. Through the end of the quarter, all 90 stores had been converted, 74 to Marmaxx and 16 HomeGoods. It's important to note that these conversions began in mid March and ended in early June. So, while it's still very early to assess their performance thus far, it's going as we expected.</p>
          <p>In terms of the cost to close the A.J. Wright division and convert the 90 stores, we came in significantly below our original estimates. First to close the A.J. Wright business, we had originally estimated the after tax cost would be $150 million to $170 million or $0.38 to $0.43 per share of which $40 million to $50 million was cash. The actual after tax costs came in at $117 million or $0.29 per share with an after tax cash cost of approximately $20 million, well below our original estimates.</p>
          <p>Second, the cost of converting the 90 stores to Marmaxx and HomeGoods banners, which represents cost incurred during the go dark period as well as the cost to rebrand and re-open the stores, reduced EPS by $0.03 in the first quarter and that was at the low end of our original $0.03 to $0.04 estimates.</p>
          <p>Finally, in terms of the benefits, we remain confident that the converted stores will, on a run-rate basis, generate $25 million to $35 million of after tax profit, which is in line with our original estimates. Approximately $15 million to $20 million or $0.04 to $0.05 per share of this is incremental to what we're earning with A.J. Wright, so the economics of this action are very positive. We continue to expect that approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per share of this benefit will be realized in the current year and this is reflected in the guidance.</p>
          <p>It's also important to reiterate that it's still early. Generally the economics we're seeing from the conversion are in line with our expectations but frankly we need more time to properly read the impact. And of course, the larger benefit is going to come from the incremental profit of opening stores previously earmarked for A.J. Wright division as Marmaxx stores, as we go forward. So, that's a quick recap on A.J. Wright.</p>
          <p>Now on the guidance, as you can see from today's release, we have provided fiscal 2012 guidance on both a GAAP basis and on adjusted basis which excludes the impact of the A.J. Wright consolidation as well as the impact of a non-operating item in fiscal 2011. Details of our adjusted guidance along with the related reconciliations to GAAP financial information can be found in a table in the investor section of our website and I encourage you to refer to these at your leisure, and I'll speak to the adjusted numbers in my remarks today.</p>
          <p>So, for the full year, we are raising our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to $3.89 to $3.97, which represents 11% to 14% increase over the adjusted $3.49 in fiscal 2011. This guidance is now based on a 2% to 3% comp store sales increase and adjusted pre-tax margins in the 10.6% to 10.7% range which is flat to up 10 basis points over the adjusted fiscal 2011 pre-tax margin of 10.6%.</p>
          <p>The $0.04 increase at the high-end of the guidance range is entirely due to the second quarter exceeding our original expectations and we've left the back-half guidance unchanged. As a reminder for the back-half, we continue to expect EPS at $2.22 to $2.30, up 13% to 17% over the adjusted $1.97 in the prior year.</p>
          <p>I should note that this guidance is based on comp store sales growth in the 1% to 2% range and pre-tax profit margins up 20 to 40 basis points over last year's adjusted 11.0%. So that's the full year and the back half. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.07, a 12% to 16% increase over our diluted earnings per share of $0.92 last year.</p>
          <p>We're assuming third quarter sales of approximately $5.8 billion to $5.9 billion with a comp sales increase of 2% to 3% on both the consolidated basis and at the Marmaxx group. At the monthly comps, for the month of August, which as a reminder was the strongest month of the third quarter last year, we're planning comps to increase 1% to 2% on a consolidated basis and approximately 2% to 3% at the Marmaxx Group.</p>
          <p>In each of September and October, we expect comps to increase 2% to 3% on both the consolidated basis and at Marmaxx. The pre-tax profit margin is planned in the range of 11.1% to 11.3%, which is up 30 to 50 basis points versus 10.8% last year. We're planning our third quarter gross profits margin in the range of 27.8% to 28.0% up 30 to 50 basis points over prior year. We expect SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales to be in the range of 16.5% to 16.6% flat to up 10 basis points over last year.</p>
          <p>For modeling purposes, we're planning a tax rate of 38.1% up 50 basis points over last year, net interest expense in the $10 million range and weighted average shares of approximately 385 million. Our full year guidance implies fourth quarter EPS in the range of $1.19 to $1.23 compared with adjusted EPS of $1.05 last year. Once again, this excludes the A.J. Wright segment from last year's results, which is again detailed on our website.</p>
          <p>This fourth quarter high level guidance we're providing today assumes a 1% to 2% comp sales increase in the quarter. We will provide detailed fourth quarter guidance on our third quarter conference call. Finally, our guidance for the remainder of the year assumes that currency exchange rates will remain unchanged from current levels.</p>
          <p>So we'll now open the call up for questions. We ask you please limit your question to one per person and to keep the call in schedule, we do appreciate your cooperation with that one question limit which we hope you honor.</p>
          <p>So, thanks. And Alon, we'll turn it back to you now for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And our first question today is from Evren Kopelman.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. Good morning. I had an industry-level question. What do you think is driving the larger quantities of the branded and the season products out there? And is it more concentrated in certain categories and brands, or is it more broad-based? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I don't think today is that much different than any other day. There's plenty of goods out there and there always is, so we don't see a big difference. We're targeting the categories that we believe are really going to drive the business. So, we're always &#x2013; there's always a plentiful marketplace and we are keeping our guys home and we do see a lot of opportunity. But I think it's going to be a strong back half, but we're always seeing that. It's not a big change from the past.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Tunick.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Congrats. Just question on the gross margin, just wanted to make sure we had it right. So, did you say that merchandise margins were flat and the rest was occupancy leverage? And then just trying to understand, as you think about gross margins going forward, sort of which divisions have the best opportunity to improve inventory turns and where you think that could go from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Brian, for the second quarter, our gross margins were flat and then in the America businesses, they were slightly up. In terms of going forward, in terms of opportunities for gross margin <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:13)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, I think it depends. So I think Brian's question was probably talking sort of beyond this. When you look at the balance of this year, we would have merchandise margins again up slightly with most of the opportunity coming from Europe who had a 370 basis point decline in the gross profit margin &#x2013; in the merchandise margin last year, Brian. So I think there's a big opportunity to make up ground there, and all the other businesses we've planned essentially flat in the back half.</p>
          <p>And I think as we look out beyond that, we think there's continued opportunities for margin improvement. It, I think, comes from investing in supply chain and systems that'll allow us to turn our inventories faster, get the right inventory to the right stores. But I would tell you, we have not put any gross margin improvement in our long range model as we look at the three-year model that we share at investor conferences and talk about in our one-on-one marketing meetings. There's really no gross margin further improvement baked in there. That said, we think there is opportunity to turn our inventories faster and to drive further improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And one more, if I...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to take some improvement in supply chain and some investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just one more on the gross margin again, I mean, one of your competitor talks about pack-away inventory having higher gross margin, but obviously having distribution cost associated with it. How does your pack-away flow through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a significantly lower level. I think what you're referring to is that &#x2013; the competitor you're referring to when they have inventory increases, there's cost that get capitalized in the inventory. As inventories get reduced, those costs flow through. For us, pack-away is such a lower percentage of our business that it doesn't really register on our P&amp;Ls.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Brian, we're under &#x2013; we're always under 10%, so it really doesn't have a major effect on our business either way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Sure thing. Good luck for the back half. Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Adrianne Shapira.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Congratulations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, just help us think about if things do slow, it does seem as if TJX is better positioned to capitalize on it this time versus last time given your ramped up marketing initiative and also the fact that two-thirds of the store base has been remodeled over the past three years. Just help us think about how do you think that manifests itself in terms of share gains or profitability.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Adrianne, I think we're planning our business appropriately, conservatively. We're looking at three &#x2013; two, three and four-year comps. Having said that, I sort of alluded to I'm pretty excited about our marketing plans. And as our stores continue to get remodeled, I think the customer experience is better and better. But it just keeps coming back to how we execute. And as we just keep raising the bar on the level and on the fashion and the value of our product, that's how we're going to build our business and that's what we believe in. So, our long-term goal is to get to be a $40 billion company and I think that's the way we do it. It's detailed vigilance and constantly upgrading our mix and getting better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So then just the follow-on is that the fact that the back half comp guidance of 1% to 2% unchanged despite the fact that the ramped up marketing, even the pack-away is starting to be unleashed in the third quarter, how should we think about that guidance in the context of some pretty exciting stuff hitting in the back half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Again, it really comes back to being prudent in terms of the way we plan our business. And two, just looking at the three and four-year comp history, and again coming back to just planning our business and hopefully beating it. And that's our goal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I think, Adrianne, we looked at the comp stacks. I think if you look on a two-year basis, you would say it's a very, very conservative plan. If you look on a three and a four-year basis, you would say that the numbers we have into the back half really line up with those trends. So, it really depends on are you &#x2013; does the business behave on more of a two-year basis, or does it behave more in a three to four-year basis? We're going to find out. But we think the prudent way to look at it is that &#x2013; look at that three-year comp stack and plan it that way. And if you look and you do the numbers, you'll see that you have Q3 and Q4 really line up with the Q1 and Q2 trends.</p>
          <p>I said if you look on a two-year basis, you'd say there's opportunity. Again, we'll find out. We're well positioned for it. We're very, very flexible. You heard Carol <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:47) the level of commitment, forward inventory commitments this year is less than it was last year. So, we've got a lot of open-to-buy and flexibility to chase, which is exiting.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry about that. Very nice quarter. My question is on new store productivity which looks like it's surged here in the second quarter and we're just trying to parse through it and understand what the contribution was from those new A.J. Wright stores coming in. It looks like relative to the old A.J. Wright store volumes, even a modest Marmaxx plan would put those store volumes up 10% or 20% relative to the legacy volumes. Is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah, I think we're not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>74 stores, Kimberly. Let's start with that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a relatively small piece obviously of the overall estate. And for that reason, we're not &#x2013; there's been a lot of interest that the investing public has had in the store economics for the stores, looking at average sales and contribution margins, et cetera. I guess all I can say is that we're pleased with what we are seeing. We don't really want to break out the economics for these stores separately given that it's relatively a small piece of the overall estate. But we think there's clearly an opportunity there. That's why we took the Marmaxx store potential up to 2,300 to 2,400.</p>
          <p>We have seen productivity in all of our new stores, not just the A.J. Wright stores. It's interesting that over the last several years, our stores have consistently beat the pro forma models that we have and been at or slightly under the level of cannibalization we projected. So, we've had a very successful new store program. I think that's what you're seeing, but again, we open a lot of new stores. I don't want to get into sort of just isolating this small segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Kimberly, I think the key is we keep learning and we keep increasing the Marmaxx count. So, today, we're very comfortably at 2,300 to 2,400 stores which again is very different from a year ago and hopefully will exist until a year from now and we'll see more opportunity. But we're pretty excited about the Marmaxx change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That makes great sense, Carol. And my clarification was just &#x2013; I think I heard you correctly. You said in the second quarter with the 4% comp, traffic was up and the average value of the transaction was up as well driven by higher units per transaction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, ticket's been running flattish and you're planning for a slight uptick in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ticket was up slightly in the quarter, Kimberly, but the units per transaction were a bigger driver of the basket.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Jeffrey Black.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, thanks and congrats, good quarter. Carol, can you talk about home? On a two-year basis, it looks like HomeGoods came off a little bit to end the quarter. What's going on there in terms of traffic and anything to note there in terms of ticket and/or promotional activity that would have accounted for the margin? I think you discussed some A.J. Wright noise in that margin. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean HomeGoods business is very, very strong. Their traffic is up and their inventory is very, very lean. And if you look at the profitability, it's basically 100% the combination of A.J. and a slight uptick in advertizing. So, we feel very, very good about HomeGoods in the back half. We're planning it, I think, appropriately. If you look at again a three and four, even a two-year comp comparison, we're up against very, very aggressive numbers. But I'm loving the mix and I feel very, very good about this business in the back half, so the myth in terms of getting the margin to LY and better with strictly those two issues, very solid business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff, I just wanted to be clear here though on the facts. So, HomeGoods in the first quarter it was a 6% on a 15% on a minus 1% if you look over three. So that's a 20% three-year and in the second quarter was 3% on an 8% on a 9% which is the same &#x2013; it's the identical trend if you're looking on a three-year basis. And then you as we look at the back half, we're guiding you at 2% to 3% on top of a 2%, on top of a 15%, which is that same 20% three-year stack. So, the way we look at we think that trend is entirely consistent in the back half which we saw in the second quarter, which is entirely consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we are planning segment profits flat, slightly up for HomeGoods in the back half.</p>

          <p>Hello. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just a question on TJX Europe, you made some nice sequential improvement in that business. Can you just touch upon the geographical performance there?

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. Thanks and congratulations on another great quarter. One clarification and one question, if I may. First on the $50 million to $75 million in cost reductions, how much have you realized so far or how much are you planning on realizing in the back half? And then I was wondering, Carol, if you could talk a little bit about Canada, what you're seeing there. You said that Marshalls &#x2013; I forget your wording, but basically it's doing well. So, could you talk about maybe what you're seeing Marshalls versus Winners maybe some of the trends in Canada? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of our cost reduction, we're very much on track to the total year. We're actually looking at what are our initiatives for the next year and trying to put that together because we still think there's opportunity and we're going to keep doing it very single year. So, we're very much on track for the year. And in terms of Canada, I'm going to have Ernie talk to that. We were both up there recently and we're pretty excited about Marshalls and a couple of areas that he may want to talk about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jennifer, I think Marshalls, we tried to &#x2013; again this is something we just started a little while ago, so we don't want to be too specific. We're bullish on the initial results. It looks good. So, we're feeling that I guess way to sum it up as for an initial launch business the way we opened it, it was a few stores then another couple, we're happy with the way it's going.</p>
          <p>In terms of Winners overall, how does that compare, I think Carol mentioned a little bit earlier, we had a couple of execution issues really centered on the ladies and kids businesses. And I think over the last few months we're really happy with some of the content shifts we've seen there. I would tell you that I think we're a little shy in some of the fashion items that we could have been into a little bit better way in those areas, but we're really feeling better about it. Carol was just up there recently. We've been seeing some categories turning again better than they were in the past, so we're pretty feeling better about where we're heading with the Winners business, but we want to give a little time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Are those two separate teams for the Marshalls in Canada and Winners?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's actually a bit of a &#x2013; I guess you would call it a hybrid. So the teams are in some ways the same teams and sometimes we have some focusing being done on one or the other. Primarily, they're the same team, but we do as with every business have specific differentiation categories that we go after. So, a little bit earlier I think we discussed our shoe business is pretty strong in Marshalls, so &#x2013; again we have some focus on shoes in Marshalls that's a little bit different than shoes in Winners, albeit most of the team is the same team.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Somewhat similar to the way we do Marshalls and Maxx.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just a question on &#x2013; Jeff, just a question on Europe, I think last quarter you gave some indication on kind of what your internal plan was on comps for the back half of the year. I was wondering if you could update that. And also just kind of related to that, as you talk about the Internet in Europe, it looks like you've been running that, I don't know exactly for how long, but if you talk about it, if you're seeing any contribution yet from that to the overall business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think as you look at the assumptions for Europe for the back half, it's pretty, it's largely unchanged. We had &#x2013; we're still planning at 2% to 4% comp on top of a minus 4%. So that hasn't changed. In terms of the profit margin, the reported profit margin would be 6.9% to 7.4% in the back half, but that would include a currency impact. And if you back out the currency impact, it would be of 7.4% to 7.9%, sort of a 50 basis point impact there from currency, so adjusted for currency 7.4% to 7.9%. So it's really largely unchanged. I think the thing we would say is as you think about the conservatism or aggressiveness of it...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we've got a 2% to 4% on top of a minus 4%, so on a two-year stack basis, that's flat to down 2%. That same two-year stack for June and July ran down 3%, and for Q2, it ran down 4%. So there's slight improvement that's baked in to the comp expectations. And on the bottom line, we had a 370 basis point gross margin hit in Europe last year and we're assuming we get back a little bit less than half of that this year, so I think we're being appropriately prudent. And I think as it relates to the Internet, not in the mode that &#x2013; that's not a big contribution and it's not a big hit. We're really in the mode of testing, of learning, experimenting, and learning what we can. So it's not a big operation at this point. But it's also not having a negative impact on profits.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll try not to kill you with my questions, as I normally do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Question, Stacy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I guess the sort of big question is what are you seeing in pricing to you from vendors? Does it seem more or less favorable? What are you seeing in pricing to your customers? Are you taking any pricing whether it's through mix or otherwise? And I did hear the discussion with Kimberly. And what are you seeing in the industry? And then I guess on the T.K. I wanted to just follow up and ask &#x2013; I guess, I thought I'd see a better margin this quarter because I thought you cleared the inventory. And so I'm wondering what &#x2013; just help me understand that a little bit better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Europe, first of all Europe was very much where we thought it would be, and we're going to continue to see progress so we're not surprised. As a matter of fact, going forward from where we went from first quarter to second quarter on a flat comp, we're pretty comfortable. I think we're on our way to seeing better turns and on our way to start comping in a positive tone which will read extremely well. We're also planning the back half, yes, vast improvement against a year ago certainly, but we're sort of trying to take it halfway and build. We still believe that it's going to continue to build and accelerate and be a very, very strong business for us. So, we're just again planning it conservatively.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing, Stacy, we are &#x2013; again, we're in a mode of keeping our guidance back. There are a lot of goods out there. There's tremendous value that we think we can bring to the customer. When evident volatility &#x2013; and it seems like every single year there's something else going on. I think everybody knows about the cotton prices. The numbers are crazy. They accelerated beyond belief and now, I think they're something like 50% less than they were when this all started to hike up. So, it's going to be very, very interesting. We love our value and what we did be it cotton, cashmere, we think we are a tremendous value to our customer and we're sticking to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we think we are going to have an exciting back half. But when things are all over the place, we love it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one last follow-up and I promise that's it, the August number that you gave, the comp guidance, looks lighter than I would have thought for the three-year even, if my math is correct. Is that conservative of &#x2013; you know what I'm saying, conservativism or has there been a slowdown at all in August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Stacy, what we did is we strategically are keeping our inventory, our in-store inventory very, very lean. Our clearance is way below last year, returning faster than last year. We're going to start to flow our pack-aways not currently, but very shortly and we're in great position going forward. But we are keeping our inventories very lean starting the season, and I think it's going to bode very well for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, guys.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is from Daniel Hofkin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. I guess just a follow-up on that, aside from inventory being lean, have you seen any change in the purchasing patterns of customers aside from what you're doing internally? And then I guess a little more detail would be helpful on what has enabled you to continue to improve the merchandise margins in the U.S.? Is it mix? Is it some of the inventory management initiatives you talked about earlier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, the merchandise margins, we are continuing to reduce our in-store inventory. At the end of the year, we will probably be flat in total in total inventory. Pack-aways will probably be equivalent to last year or slightly up. But we've talked about it a lot. We are investing in our supply chain and a lot of our cost initiatives are we're doing so that we can reinvest that money. We're very, very far from really shipping the right goods to the right store at the right time. We still do quite a bit manually.</p>
          <p>So, this is going to be a year-over-year process. It's probably going to take us two to three years to get where we want it to be. But our intent is to reduce our in-store inventory each year slightly quickening the turn. So it's a combination of that and obviously the buying environment, and that changes all the time. So all of that allows us to feel like we can sustain and hopefully increase our margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Dan, I think in terms of August, our guidance at this point in time would reflect obviously our guidance based on what we're seeing with our business. As Carol mentioned, we are managing inventories very conservatively in store and trying to turn them so that we start to see them leaner and to put ourselves in a position to chase in terms of having lower level of forward commitment. So that's how we're thinking about in managing the business. The other call out I would give you is August is the most challenging comparison versus &#x2013; comparatively easier as we move through September and October in the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, I would just like to jump in on one thing. On the goods, some of these things become numbers discussions on the inventory levels. But I think the other thing that's been happening is the buyers have been doing an overall good job, getting the right goods at the right value. As Carol mentioned before, value's been like key at top of mind. So obviously turn has to be a function of the customer voting. They like the goods that are out there. So even if the inventories are lean and they didn't like the goods, you wouldn't see the turns that we've been seeing. So, I have to give our merchants actually a fair amount of credit on really executing to good mixes. So I just, I'd throw that in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, that's helpful. I mean, I guess just to paraphrase, it sounds like maybe there's a little bit of inherent conservatism built in as well not just in terms of how you're managing the inventory but also what the offtake might be, maybe partly because of the prior year comparison in August, but maybe also because of the environment. Is that fair to say?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We expect we'll end the year with $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, which is &#x2013; that's the number that we gave you at the beginning of the year and that's the number where we still feel very comfortable with.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks very much, guys. And I guess just, one, a bookkeeping question is to follow up and also the second &#x2013; maybe we will dig a little bit more on the eCommerce. So first on bookkeeping, just profitability operating margin and comp by division, your expectations? If you could detail the guidance a little bit more, that'll be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You want the back half guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the back half, I'll just take it by division. So Marmaxx at the back half is a 1% to 2% comp store increase. On that, we have segment profit margin that's essentially flat. HomeGoods, a 2% to 3% comp increase, segment profit margin anywhere from down 10 to plus 20 basis points. So for both Marmaxx and HomeGoods, really the segment profit lines up with what we expected with the comp range.</p>
          <p>TJX Canada, we're 0% to 1% on the comp. The segment &#x2013; the margin we would report is 70 to 80 basis points down. Excluding FX, it's down 160 to 170 basis points. That's year-to-date, we're down 120 basis points, so there's a little bit more baked in, but we're up against very strong comparisons in Canada, so we're being little bit conservative on those numbers.</p>
          <p>TJX Europe we have a 2% to 4% comp and we have segment profit margin up 220 to 270 basis points on a reported basis. If you strip out foreign exchange, it's up 270 to 320 basis points. And again as a reminder we had a 370 basis point reduction in our merchandise margin last year, and we're assuming that we get a little bit less than half of that back plus leverage on a fourth comp at the high end. So, that's how you kind of &#x2013; the numbers kind of work there.</p>
          <p>And for the total company, we've got for the back half, I've already given you the EPS numbers. We've got 11 &#x2013; on sales, we've got $12.3 billion to $12.5 billion here and we've got a pre-tax margin that's up 20 to 40 basis points. And that's primarily driven by the gross profit margin. G&amp;A's planned flat to 10 basis points of leverage, the balance of that 20 to 40 basis point improvement on the bottom line is gross profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In terms of e-Commerce, we are &#x2013; we have no set date. We want to do it right &#x2013; I'll say that a few times. We want to make money. We are absolutely hiring top talent and getting them involved in our business and that's part of our bench and part of our costs that we are setting aside. Our intention is to really maximize both the brick and mortar and the Internet business and e-Commerce to the future. So, we're feeling pretty good about it. And again, we're not ready to say when our date is, but we're building the team and our intent is to do it right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other part of that, the Internet channel as a marketing or relationship building, obviously there's some of that going on. Is there opportunity to accelerate that or invest into it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are doing a lot of &#x2013; again in the back half, we're shifting a lot of dollars to social networking. I think we're being very smart on how we're handling our marketing dollars and we're learning a lot about that. So, the marriage again between the future of where we see the internet and our business is going to be a combination of various things that we're doing to drive both parties. So, we're pretty excited about it.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Great quarter, guys. Just one clarification on inventory, the total &#x2013; the per store number now that's up 16%, do you envision that coming down over the course of the rest of the year as you move the pack-away into stores or will that stay up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that will be coming down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at the end of the year, we think on a per store basis, flat to slightly up. It really depends on the quantity of the pack-away that we have at year end which is somewhat difficult to predict and really depends upon the environment we see as we close out the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, we don't think pack-away is more than 10%, but there is &#x2013; we'll see. It could be 5%. It could be 10%. That will be the difference in the year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the volatility of the environment right now we think is a wildcard.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, to Jeff's point, as we get to the year-end, based on what happens with everything around us, those pack-away numbers are a little bit unpredictable. But when they &#x2013; if they do end up there, it's a good thing because it's buys that we felt were the right branded value.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, guys. Could you just tell us what the merchandise margin change was by division in the second quarter? And I also just wanted to make sure I heard you properly earlier on, did you say that you expected in the back half merch margin to be flat at all divisions except T.K. you expected up? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We said &#x2013; as a company, it's planned flat to up in the back half. Clearly we should get a big lift in Europe so that would say that essentially our other divisions in aggregate are planned essentially flat off.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of the second quarter, I think we've already broken it up pretty well. We've got merchandise margin for the quarter that was flat and we said it's up roughly 10 basis points &#x2013; in the 10 to 20 basis point range for our North American businesses. So, I think that's all the guidance we really want to provide at this point in time.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's all excluding the mark-to-market. So, the mark-to-market &#x2013; so if you look at the gross profit margin, we've got buying an occupancy leverage, you got the mark-to-market. And then excluding the mark-to-market, the merchandise markets were full &#x2013; the pure merchandise margin was flat.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. But specifically in the U.S., were we up in the U.S. and down in Canada? Is that how we should look at it?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you're up in both &#x2013; we were actually up in both places. We're up slightly in Canada, which again speaks to the way we manage the inventory. They manage the inventories very lean up there, the commitment...</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On a negative 3% comp, to have a &#x2013; again, it just speaks to the flexibility of our model and how we can, as Carol said, zig and zag and respond to opportunities and stay flexible. So, not unlike what happened in the fourth quarter of 2008 where you had Armageddon and our merchandise margins were flat.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. And most of my questions have been asked. Just a final point though on the European pressure in the merch margin which I know you expect to improve. Is that business structure done a different way because of number of vendors or types of vendors that would keep its merch margin below Marmaxx over the long-term?</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Carol, interested in your comment regarding your pricing plan for the back half of the year. So are you going into the fall with lower initial markup due to the fact that you're keeping your AUR up only slightly or are you just buying better which is allowing you to maintain your initial mark-on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, our mark-on is pretty much &#x2013; pretty flat, pretty similar to where we planned it. And we see opportunity in markdowns. So we'll see how the back half goes. But you got to remember that we're far from being bought up in back half. So we got a long way to go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And your marketing spend for the back half of the year, is it planned to be up as a percent to total sales?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's flat in terms of percent, slightly up in dollars, but much, much greater penetration. We have a completely different &#x2013; not completely but a different strategy from last year, so you're going to see us a lot more on TV and we're pretty excited about it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a question about Europe and Canada, Europe struggled for about a year, Canada just for about six months and you had indicated your confidence in Canada for the second half. What's the difference between the two in terms of why such confidence in such a short-term on Canada versus how long it took for Europe? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ernie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the primary difference is, and we talked about this before, in Europe we grew probably too fast, all right. In Canada, we did not, so Canada is more of a short-term execution issue where we, I'd say, took our eyes off the ball really in a couple of areas. In Europe, again some of the infrastructure, I'd call it, was strained with the quick growth, so it takes a little bit longer to come out of that type of situation. I'd say at a high level, those are the &#x2013; that's really the key difference between the two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what we've been talking about as we've been &#x2013; that's what we've been talking about in meeting with investors. It really is a function of kind of outgrowing the ability of the organization to support the growth, to support the business and whereas in Canada, that hasn't been the case. We've got a real experienced team up there and we're confident that we'll come back more quickly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and we &#x2013; and I think we talked about little earlier in Canada, again, we've already seen a little bit life in two of the areas that were actually a bit of a struggle for us fairly recently, so I think a quicker turn than we even experienced out of Europe where some of the things did not happen as quickly. Although there now, again, we're seeing some improvements in categories that in Europe were slow prior. So we're feeling good also in Europe and we're also looking at the availability of what's happening with key branded goods over there and that's looking pretty good for us going forward. But very different issues that started the problems or the execution issues, and so different ways of coming out of it.</p>
