        <plist>
          <p>So good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and to those watching our webcast. It's my pleasure to welcome you to this afternoon for our second quarter analyst conference. The earnings release, the Flashlight and all other documents were published at 7 a.m. CET this morning. You can download these files from our website.</p>
          <p>This afternoon's presentation is now online and the conference is being webcast via the IR website. I would like also refer you to our Safe Harbor statement on page two of the presentation. Our President and CEO, Peter L&#xF6;scher; and our CFO, Joe Kaeser, are here this afternoon to present the Q2 results.</p>
          <p>After presentation we will have a Q&amp;A session where Peter and Joe will answer your questions. So with that I would like to hand over to Peter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very. Good afternoon to everybody, another solid quarter and robust operating performance. I will start off going through the highlights of the quarter, Joe will follow with the financial details, and I will close with the guidance for the full year before we take your questions.</p>
          <p>First our order picture, year-on-year orders slipped 14%, impacted mostly by further market contraction in the long-cycle activities in Industry and Energy. However, the comparison with the last quarters &#x2013; with the last year's quarter is actually tough due to some very large orders, which happened in the second quarter 2009; I just remind you a large order in mobility, large orders in fossil.</p>
          <p>Compared to the drop in orders total sector revenues were slightly down by 4% versus last year, but up sequentially against Q1. This shows how hard we are pushing to convert our backlog. The stabilization of our business is led by the recovery in our short cycle divisions and growth in emerging markets. Profits were stronger, up 16% versus prior year and every sector is in the target margin range. Again, here the diligent backlog conversion is key as is the rigorous control on costs across the company. The stronger earnings combined with rigorous discipline to CapEx and working capital management is reflected in our strong cash flow figures.</p>
          <p>Driven by the market demand we adjust our resource base further. We have announced workforce adjustments in our Industry Solutions, Right Technologies and Siemens IT divisions. Our strong execution and stabilizing end markets leads us to a favorable assessment of continuing profit development. Therefore, we are increasing our profit guidance for the year, which I will touch upon later.</p>
          <p>Let's first look at the figures. I have already laid out the orders and revenue highlights. Book-to-bill was close to one with 0.98, despite being below one we feel that in the context to the market environment this is a very solid result. When looking at our sales funnel, the order situation across the company is showing stabilization. All sectors contributed to the excellent total sector profit of 2.1 billion and the margin of 12.3%.</p>
          <p>The sectors benefited from &#x20AC;118 million positive effect due to the curtailment of the U.S. pension plans that were partially offset by 125 million in restructuring charges mainly in Fossil and Industry Solutions. Lower cost below the sectors help to raise net income by 48% to 1.5 billion and basic earnings per share was &#x20AC;1.70.</p>
          <p>Turning next to our order backlog, it continues to be a source of stability and strength; end of the quarter it stood at a very solid &#x20AC;84 billion, slightly up from 83 billion at the end of the first quarter, mainly due to currency changes. To demonstrate a few highlights of the quarter, Industry recorded a &#x20AC;450 million order to supply components to Chinese inter-city trains, underlying our strategy in the region.</p>
          <p>In Energy, we won a 435-megawatt combined cycle power plant in the Netherlands and our technological leadership in high efficient gas turbines was a crucial factor in winning this order. Meanwhile, we continue our global flow of orders in our renewable division with, for example, an order for 60 onshore turbines in Canada.</p>
          <p>With this, the order backlog at renewables is at an excellent level of &#x20AC;7 billion at the end of the quarter. And in healthcare, we were able to book our largest single order in the Middle East, US$69 million imaging equipment order for around 100 hospitals in Iraq to rebuild healthcare services. This included an attractive 5-year service contract.</p>
          <p>Let's take a closer look at the sector performance in the quarter starting with Industry. The Industry sector was the first sector to be affected by the downturn. It is now showing the first signs of a stable recovery. Unfortunately, we still see low investment activity in the late-cycle businesses, such as at metals, Technologies and Industry Solutions.</p>
          <p>But there's clearly a traction in the recovery of our short-cycle businesses that goes beyond restocking, especially in emerging markets. An excellent example of the turnaround was Industry Automation, which not only benefited from a disciplined cost management, but also strong demand from the emerging markets.</p>
          <p>We continue to see support at our short-cycle businesses and Industry Automation is turning, which is also backed up by recent actually today &#x2013; by today's VDMA data of sequentially plus 21% and showing a marked turnaround in machinery orders. But we also have to bear in mind that a year ago we were talking about the decline of minus &#x2013; of over minus 40%, so there's obviously a base effect as well.</p>
          <p>OSRAM continues to benefit from the combined effects of strong demand for LEDs, which in Q2 accounts for 18% of OSRAM sales, and the seasonal strength of lighting during the first half. Also the demand from automotive customers showed an impressive rebound. The margin of mobility at 8% is an excellent result and puts us in a very good position compared to our peers.</p>
          <p>In addition, the sales funnel remains strong as we have recently seen by the 1 billion frame contract for 200 regional passenger trains ordered by the Austrian Federal Railways. Building Technologies was able to show order growth driven by strong demand from emerging countries, more than offsetting continued weakness, especially in the non-residential U.S. market.</p>
          <p>However, profitability at BT was held back by supplier-related product warranty charge that was somewhat compensated by the pension gain.</p>
          <p>As already mentioned, the Industry Solutions end markets in the process industries remain challenging. A disappointment was the 63 million charge due to a U.S. project with a local partner. We have taken immediate action to mitigate these risks and believe the situation is under control. In addition, we've booked 38 million charges for capacity adjustments in Industry Solutions. We will see more of that in the coming quarters in IS and Drive Technologies.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to Energy, orders were lower year-over-year, partly due to the lumpy order inflow from renewables. In addition, we continue to operate in an environment that can best be described, as we have already said since several quarters, as a Mexican stand-off.</p>
          <p>Following the drop off in industrial production, the utility companies still have excess generation capacity and therefore requesting lower prices. The suppliers, on the other hand, still have a full order book and know that the utilities will need to upgrade their facilities. Now it will depend on who will blink first.</p>
          <p>That said, the order book still stands at &#x20AC;50 billion in Energy alone, and delivered a solid almost one book-to-bill ratio with 0.98, and despite the weakness in orders revenue continued to hold up, down just 4%, and the sector produced excellent margins, thanks to our, to an order backlog with healthy margins, good project execution and disciplined cost control. Within the Fossil division, we took decisions to improve the operating structure by shifting gas turbine production from Hamilton, Canada to Charlotte, North Carolina, which resulted in a 59 million charge for severance and relocation efforts.</p>
          <p>Despite this charge, all divisions reported margins well within their target range, helped by strong product mix, including services, particularly in fossil power generation and oil and gas. Renewables has reported all-time-high revenues in Q2 and profitability has rebounced from Q1. Orders were down year-on-year due to large off-shore orders last year, but based on our active sales funnel in on and offshore, we expect the book-to-bill ratio well above 1 in the second half.</p>
          <p>In transmission and distribution, profits were solid but we still see pricing pressure, mainly in the transformer and medium-voltage area. However, we are seeing early signs of a market recovery as distribution was able to show a positive order intake for the first time in more than a year.</p>
          <p>A clear positive for the health care sector was the final passage of the U.S. healthcare reform. After many months of uncertainty, we welcome the clarity that this has on our business and our customers and are looking to move on actively growing our sales going forward also in the United States.</p>
          <p>Overall sector orders were up 1%. However, this is due to the large particle therapy order in the previous year period, and excluding this effect, orders were up 6%, imaging and IT were able to report an 8% order growth driven by Asia, which was up 27% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Margins were helped by a 79 million positive pension effect for the healthcare sector and favorable currency hedging, especially at imaging and IT. Imaging and IT continues to lead the divisions in profitability, with a strong service business, positive product mix and tight cost control.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics saw an improved revenue growth of 5% organically, driven by growth in Asia and the Americas. Higher sales dropped through to the bottom line and underlying profits were supported by tight cost management, which led to an underlying margin of 17.7%.</p>
          <p>Now I think it's important to turn to topics which actually drive sales and innovation. I would like to show here on this chart three examples of key innovations for the futures. I have selected three examples here. On the left hand side you can see an example from OSRAM; we are now supplying the OD8 as the first volume vehicle to have all LED forward lighting. Not only does this save energy but it also improves driver safety with clear free driving.</p>
          <p>In the middle you see, you have an example of renewable. We are pioneering here as well new technologies. Here is our 3-megawatt gearless turbine with a 101-meter rotor diameter. The gearless construction means 50% fewer parts and fewer rotating parts leads to lower maintenance costs and increased availability for our customers. This is a great example of collaboration between Industry and Energy. The innovative generator comes from our large drives unit.</p>
          <p>In healthcare, on the right hand side, we have introduced at the last RSNA the next generation of MIs, the MAGNETOM Aera and Skyra, and these scanners are at the forefront in imaging technology and orders are flowing in. Its dramatically improved speed and image quality opens up new applications for MR, for example in cardiology. These are just a few examples of our innovation leadership. We will drive growth through a steady stream of innovation.</p>
          <p>And with this I would like to hand over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. A very warm welcome to all of you to Canary Wharf. We really do appreciate you coming in those turbulent macroeconomic times and listen to us as a humble industrial company in Germany. So that's actually good.</p>
          <p>And let me start with our financial cockpit on a corporate level. As you know we've rolled out a few financial targets for our company to be achieved in the 2010, which is now, so we are just about to finish also the goal line for our 2010 program. If I may draw your attention to the upper left part here on profitability, Peter said it already, all these sectors are within our target margin, and if our market assumptions prevail, there is also a good chance that we see the sectors to stay within that range by year end.</p>
          <p>Second topic on the upper right is the cash conversion rate, we are still a very strong believer that the reported earnings also need to come in as cash at some point and especially given from our strong performance, relatively strong performance, in fiscal Q1, we are actually very satisfied with our cash conversion rate in fiscal Q2, which is 0.84, so getting reasonably close to our target, which says 1 minus growth rate.</p>
          <p>As far as capital structure is concerned, it is on the lower left, that's probably one of the few areas where we failed to make good on what our targets were. But in all honesty, that's not necessarily concerns me very much because a solid capital structure these days definitely helps the company coming through difficult times in terms of market volatility and financial markets.</p>
          <p>So, as you know, we measure our capital structure as industrial net debt over EBITDA, supposed to be between 0.8 and 1.0 and we unintendedly reached that goal in fiscal 2009 and now we are back at 0.35, which is probably a little more comfortable than we were planning for &#x2013; but there is nothing wrong with that. So we will be also in 2010 most likely below the 0.8 to 1.0. But then again we do not believe this is major problem and we can help it quickly if we wanted to.</p>
          <p>As far as the capital efficiency is concerned, which for us is one of the most meaningful numbers that we manage the company with, and that's the return on capital employed. Our target margin has been 14 to 16%, and if you look at the return on capital employed numbers quarter-by-quarter, especially also 2009 and 2008, where we were reasonably charged with the transformation cost.</p>
          <p>Now in 2010 it begins to pay off. We've been showing solid capital efficiency rates at about 15%. Now I would not suggest that this 15% is going to stay for all year 2010, but we will be disappointed if we are far below the target range in capital efficiency.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn your attention to why we believe we've been making progress in most aspects we have been looking into and we have been active on. In terms of working capital and CapEx management, the working capital turns, which you see on the left side of that chart, it's just about the levels of what we had last year in the same quarter, so we're turning out working capital as to our definition, which is also displayed on our internet, 8.1 times on an annualized base, and that's pretty much what we have also seen in Q2.</p>
          <p>We have sourced some critical key components a little more than we probably would have done in normal times because we do see some squeezing on semiconductor components, electrical components, environments that we do not want to take the risk that we are shy of more than 4.5% of the bill of materials and not being able to deliver what is being needed in our markets. So that may slightly effect our performance improvements going forward. But an area of 8.5 to 8.8 for the whole year is definitely something which we believe is reasonably well achievable.</p>
          <p>As far as CapEx spending is concerned, we've probably as you know been one of the first ones to put the brakes on that one, following our organic order growth, which obviously is a key milestone on how to manage CapEx. You see our CapEx rate, which we define as CapEx divided by depreciation, pretty much follows the organic order intake graphs in this particular aspect blue follows red.</p>
          <p>And we've been pretty low with 58% in fiscal Q2; that does not mean that we are not investing into our business any more, it just means that we have already ordered most of our equipment which is being needed for 2011 based on the lead times, and we do expect the CapEx rate to be a little below or maybe at the lower range of our target range of 95 to 115 going forward.</p>
          <p>Now on the free cash flow, as already mentioned,  we do feel comfortable with our free cash flow in Q2, especially given the Q1 performance. If you compare the seasonality of the free cash flow development over time, it's been obviously pretty seasonal here, and if we look at the current graph on 2010, there is obviously still seasonality, but we've managed to make it less volatile in the first half of fiscal 2010.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, the question is, will we still have seasonality for the second half and how much would that be? That mostly depends on how we do in our environment of prepayments and billings in excess. I mentioned few quarters ago already that we see some trend, which in a way was alarming, because after many, many quarters so far steep increase of customer prepayments and increase of billing in excess, which means financing by our customers more or less, you see that on the blue graph here, blue curve.</p>
          <p>We saw some reasonably steep change in trend from fiscal Q1 2009 all the way till Q4 2009, the last two quarters it seems that we have some pick-up again, but that has been related mostly to billings in excess. So we still do believe with our working hypothesis that the long-cycle business, the late-cycle business, still continue to slide in order intake. We would actually expect that these positive seasonality on free cash flow for the second half of our fiscal year will be less steep than it used to be in prior years.</p>
          <p>Now so far it probably was more easy to digest matters, probably going through the more crucial point of your attention, if I'm not completely mistaken, and that is the development what we call below the total sector line, which has actually been reasonably favorable for two quarters in a row, much more favorable than the overall real situation in the company exists. We do have seen those positive developments now also in Q2, however, that's been materially impacted by non-sustainable positive one-offs, and I'll came to that while we go through the items.</p>
          <p>On the left hand side you see how the items have develop in Q2 from total sector profit of 2.1 &#x2013; 38 million all the way down to a solid 1.5 net income from continued operations. The equity investments, predominantly NSN, remain a challenge. They've been reasonably positive because we have not yet materially received the impact of the already announced restructuring plans of NSN. As you know, we have an agreement with the managing shareholder that they will do the financial guidance, as they also consolidate the numbers in the books, and there has been an announcement in January on material restructuring, has not come through yet, is expected to be of material impact in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>The positive here on NSN is definitely that they are back in the market. They have proven a good standing on fourth generation network competitiveness, they've won a series of good orders on LTE. However, as far as profitability is concerned, we still expect improvements to come forward.</p>
          <p>SIS with minus 10 already shows the expected weakness, but as you know we have announced a significant structural items to bring the IT and software competency back to the company, which we believe is important. Also not only for SIS, but also for vertical units in the company, and actions and strategies are on their way.</p>
          <p>But also in SIS obviously is the 4,200 job cuts, which we have announced last quarter, will take their toll in fiscal Q2 in terms of restructuring in the second half of 2010 &#x2013; in terms of restructuring. We would expect the restructuring to come earliest in fiscal Q4, but we will book it as it arrives. That means when all the requirements of IFRS are being met that means also that there is an agreement with the workers council on how to deal with the matter going forward.</p>
          <p>So you might also recall that we have announced a carve-out of the SIS and make it a separate company, being able to follow all the particular aspects of an IT company that also will be associated with a material number of carve-out costs in the second half of 2010 to make it a standalone dedicated company of its own.</p>
          <p>SFS has had another extraordinary quarter, almost 100 million of profit, similar number we've seen already in Q1. I mean this is a financial company and it has not had to deal with all the adverse impacts of this sector and I do not expect that to happen also in fiscal &#x2013; in the second half of 2010. However, I would not expect SFS to be at the same level as what we have seen in the first half of 2010, which was exceptional.</p>
          <p>The next item is the so-called centrally managed portfolio assets, predominantly our pick and place business, which we have taken out of the drive technology division and fix it up to create value, and there is not really a material change to our estimate, which we have given in our guidance in December. We do see clearer of what needs to be done. We do see that the market also has recovered somewhat, so there is potentially an upside to what we have given in December. However, it's too early to call, so therefore just bear with the estimate we have given in that particular item.</p>
          <p>Corporate items and pensions were very favorably impacted by positive one-offs, which were related to the settlements with the insurance on D&amp;O and also the recovery of money related to the compliance aspects of the company, and that altogether amounted to an amount of about 130 million in Q2, which obviously is not going to be back in the second half in 2010. So that definitely contributed to a very favorable corporate item aspect.</p>
          <p>Going forward, if you put about a &#x20AC;400 million into your quarterly model, you're probably going to be on the safe side, okay. Pension, obviously it's harder to call because that depends mostly on the interest rate development, which can serve as a discount factor for the future obligations, so that could go either way. That's also true by the way for the so-called asset retirement obligation, which we have for several years to come, that also could go either way, so we have not put any price tag on that matter, neither to the positive nor to the negative.</p>
          <p>Accessory was quite a decent result with 107 million, that mostly stems from the fact that we have sold an asset, bigger asset in Munich, which contributed about 80 million to the bottom line; so also a positive one-off. As you know, we always make clear we are trying to dissolve of the assets and then leased them back for the time being to make sure that even long-term fixed cost assets eventually became a more variable component to adjust to needs if they came.</p>
          <p>Corporate Treasury and other items, again about 100 million run rate a quarter is probably something to be comfortable with going forward. So all in all if I may summarize what we expect for the second half of 2010, there is no reason to be overly optimistic on those items. We are working harder and we are making progress in many aspects, so there is little downside to what I said, and there is also from today's point of view there are limited upside, or too early to tell on those particular aspects.</p>
          <p>And with that, ladies and gentlemen, I will give it back to Peter to summarize and comment on the guidance which we have given as a company. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe. Let me just summarize once more the economic picture as we see today. There is without any doubt that we see early-cycle businesses coming back. We have leading indicators who are pointing towards a positive direction. And we also have to bear in mind that that's a stark reminder these days that we are still living in a volatile environment and plus as a major industrial company. It's also very important that we remind ourselves that last year we didn't just see a decrease in global GDP, but more importantly we saw a reduction in the industrial global GDP by minus 9%.</p>
          <p>So we are living in a world despite positive factors, and the VDMA's is a great example of this, with the reporting their plus 21% quarter-on-quarter of low capacity utilization in many of our key end markets, which currently are at the level of roughly 70-plus percent. And the reinvestment level is somewhere between 80 plus, before actually our customers decide on new investments. But without any doubt, we also have clearly a better visibility than we use to have a couple of months ago. And against this backdrop we have moved up, and I think it was not any surprise to you, our guidance for 2010 and our profit expectation. We clearly want to actually achieve at least an operating profit at the sector level and surpassing the profit that we have seen last year.</p>
          <p>We see organic growth being down in the mid-to-single digit range due to in part the stabilizing effect of our strong order backlogs, so no change. And thanks to the improved business situation in our markets, we also expect correspondingly to raise our target for income from continuing operations after tax in the same proportion as we anticipate that the sector profit would move up.</p>
          <p>And with this I would like to open it up for any type of questions that you may have. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's start with James Stettler.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Can you talk a bit about restructuring charges for the rest of the year, what areas and what amounts? And in terms of second half of the year, can you also talk a bit about how you see pricing development versus the original target, and indeed what kind of raw material headwind we should expect in the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. James, let me start with the restructuring cost that is not really a change to our estimate. We expect about a 500 million roughly on the total sector environment, and that comes in many of the sectors, and about 500 million roughly below the sector, which obviously is predominantly in the SIS environment. But then again we consider the restructuring when we have agreements on the already announced areas, and everything also of course will depend on market conditions. We have seen some signs of improvement in the market, so we closely follow the situation, so about 500 above and 500 below. No change in our estimate so far. And if there was that level of restructuring it would likely be mostly Q4 rather than in the maturity in Q3.</p>
          <p>Now on the pricing, I mean, that probably your question went two ways, first, is the pricing from our suppliers and commodities and the like, and secondly of course also on the top line. You may have realized when we published our guidance and the papers, the footnotes you know in the fine print on what is meant and what is not considered in a guidance, it was lacking the sentence that the -we still expect some rough time on guidance and some downside on the pricing; that one has gone away. So we feel reasonably comfortable about not having any additional pricing pressure going forward.</p>
          <p>Also to a material extent our assumption that currency and lack of capacity of fulfillment utilization would trigger additional capacity pressure has also gone away. That in part also made us raise the guidance for 2010. So there's been quite a  disciplined pricing environment in Industry, except parts of Industrial Solutions in particular the metals environment, which has become very price sensitive. Definitely has not been led by us, but obviously we need to consider market conditions.</p>
          <p>There is also some weakness, some pocket of weakness in the sale &#x2013; in the order funnel of Fossil, in part also on on-shore wind. And, as Peter has already mentioned, also positive bookings in parts of <mark type="inaudible" />. But still there is no irrational exuberance at this point in time from the competitive environment, so we feel reasonably positive about the pricing going forward.</p>
          <p>On the commodity method, I mean, of course this is not always subject to demand only, but also on who is short and who is long and who has got the power of negotiation. And if you look into, for example, in the iron ore environment there has been quite an increase in aggressiveness on how the partners interact with each other. We've hedged everywhere we were able to hedge, okay. In Q1 already in Q2, so in terms of commodities, which have market pricing and which we are able and in a position to secure, we have done it.</p>
          <p>But that doesn't necessarily mean that there would not be upward pressure on some commodity environments if and when they go up further.</p>

          <p>So next Peter Reilly, Deutsche Bank</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Three questions please, starting with workflow and solutions and especially with hearing aids, the performance here seems to be deteriorating according to the press you decided not to exit the business. One of the lessons I think from the whole mobile phone issue is that if you are in a business where the value is shrinking it's better to exit sooner rather than later. So can you give us an update on your thinking there?</p>
          <p>Secondly in Fossil Power, another very good margin performance and you mentioned the strength of service. You've mentioned in the past the margin, the backlog being very high quality. How durable is this higher margin performance in Fossil Power? Are we seeing a new level of profitability based on change mix or is that something that's going to fade as we go through the year?</p>
          <p>Then lastly on OSRAM, a very encouraging growth rate and you mentioned LEDs are now 18%. The margin slipped slightly from the very strong first quarter. I'm just wondering what the impact of the rising LED proportion does to the margin of OSRAM, whether it's an inherently higher or lower margin business, given that that part of the OSRAM seems to be growing very strongly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. If I start with the hearing aids business, I mean, A, we have made the decision that we continue to manage this business. This continues to be a good business, excellent margin performance and we just put a new manager, a new CEO, in place who knows the industry and the business extremely well, and we are confident and comfortable that we will continue to drive value in this business.</p>
          <p>On Fossil and on the exit quite frankly, we have received some bids, we have received values but we have come to the conclusion that actually we ourselves are able to drive the value equation better versus what we have seen what third parties were willing to offer us at this moment, and this is why we continue to drive it ourselves.</p>
          <p>On fossil power, as I said earlier in my presentation, and I said it already a couple of quarters ago, this is a classic Mexican stand-off. We continue to have a very solid and strong order backlog and order book. I mean, out of the 50 billion what we seen in Energy we're 25 billion in fossil. The quality, the price quality is good in there, and so we feel quite comfortable.</p>
          <p>But, nevertheless, I mean there is no question that the pricing expectations of our customers are coming down, rightfully so I would say and, therefore, as Joe has highlighted, we are continuing to drive supply chain measures, productivity measures to really make sure that we are able to be competitive from a pricing perspective, but also continue to keep the margin quality what we've seen in this business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Also one more on Fossil Power on the backlog with Energy, we not only have good pricing quality there's also good margin quality, so you can expect the current backlog to be just about at, if not slightly above, the current gross margin achievement, so it is as mostly in that particular business, it's all about execution.</p>
          <p>We also have a decent change in the mix between solution and products. In fossil, the product content has gone up from about 30 to 38, which is a positive for the merchant, but adds some balance to capital efficiency, as you will know, of course, the model is a bit different in terms of customer pre-payments. So it's all about the balance, but it's reasonably well contained in the backlog.  We could talk about pricing and more heated debate between supplier and customer that leads to the order funnel rather than to the backlog itself.</p>
          <p>On the topic of solution you may recall that just about a year ago almost, we said that there's got to be some structural realignment of the division. You may have heard the news this morning that we have actually said that there will be news here soon. It's not going to be spectacular, or in our financial language not going to be material, so don't expect wonders or something coming out big any time soon, we just want to make sure that our partners that we negotiate, like in this case the workers council, are the first ones to hear it and to discuss it and then we'll follow the path.</p>
          <p>On OSRAM, I mean, we are very satisfied with the margins and all shareholders, we all think Q2, Q1 was very positive. You see those types of positive developments, those massive drops in margins, if factors are being filled again, there's restocking impact which you will also see internally. You don't want to see it unfortunately, we've seen it about a year ago &#x2013; I think was also if I'm not mistaken in Q3 and Q4 2009, your revenues drop and then all of the sudden there is also some accounting impact here on that matter, we've seen the same thing now coming back. But a long story short, we are really satisfied with Q2. LED obviously drive margins at the LED business in within OSRAM is accretive to the margins, not necessarily accretive to capital efficiency but at the current level it's accretive to both. So therefore we're actually very pleased and we do expect the LED boom to continue for a few quarters.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Andreas Willi, JPMorgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Three hopefully short questions please, the first one a clarification on the restructuring below the sector line, you said 500 million. Does that include what you said earlier on real estate and does that include pick and place as well or not? Second question on minority interest, the minority expense in the P&amp;L dropped quite a bit. We've seen the same at  ABB. Does that mean joint venture where you have the majority but still it's the minority interest in China, in India a lot less profitable than they use to be? And third question on NSN, there was talk a while back whether the shareholder loans need to converted. What's the cash position in NSN and kind of the financial outlook there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andreas. Restructuring clarification below the line that includes that assumption that 500 million assumption you are going to see under that number, it's a four or five  number for you to get some orientation what to expect. That includes SIS, it includes the centrally managed portfolio, which is the pick and place, and it also would include real estate if there was any. If we talk about restructuring, we talk about severance, okay. So there is around about 100 million price tag, which we have considered in our guidance for the real estate improvement program, which gives us a 250 million savings already in 2012 and then obviously up to 400 in a few years later, so that would be part of it. But that's not restructuring in terms of severance, or how we called restructuring, but this would be actually capacity adjustments because we put probably consolidate floor pace in order to get the savings later on.</p>
          <p>On the minority interest, that's not a systematic development, so if there was any volatility to the good or to the bad that would just reflect the temporary development for a quarter, but for the trend, okay.</p>
          <p>On NSN, we did convert major parts of the shareholder loan, we actually converted the first tranche, which was a total &#x20AC;1 billion, 500 million each for the shareholders into equity, and we converted it actually into a sort of equity, which one could call preferred equity in a sense. So that means there is going to be some preferential interest dividend to it. And the second part of the shareholder loan, which is about 500 means 250 each is still with NSN and the shareholders and it is placed and priced at market conditions.</p>
          <p>As far as the cash position in NSN concerned, please bear with me the agreement is that Nokia actually goes into the details of its fully consolidated assets. But if I had to answer it, I would probably say all the covenants which are necessary for the cap loans are being secured.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Martin Prozesky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I've got two questions please. Could you talk a bit about the supply chain program, you didn't mention it today's presentation yet. Are you happy with the progress? I mean, gross margin was up I think 260 basis points on Q2 '09. Just could you give us a sense of how far you are in the program and how much further you expect to go there?</p>
          <p>The second one is again on Energy, more specifically on the U.S. and the consolidation of the Canadian facility into the States. What is your expectation for the outfit for mix within the U.S.? And given that the climate change bill that was expected to be passed this week didn't go through, are you still expecting a big gas build-out, wind build-out or how do you expect the U.S. energy markets developing in kind of broad terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So let me start with the energy mix question in U.S. first. A; number one, there is no question that the current administration, the President is very committed to this and as we all know this is, at the end of the day, a process which has to go through the House and the Senate. I'm quite hopeful that at the end of the day we will have a bill coming through. The current gas prices would indicate that actually and we see it in terms of demand.</p>
          <p>The customer demand that there is a strong interest in terms of high-efficient gas turbines and this was one of the reasons actually why we moved our 60-hertz facility from Canada to the U.S. to really be able to fully participate in this very important growth market. On wind, we continue to see actually very good activity. Great example, yesterday it was actually announced that the first off-shore wind project in United States got approval, the Cape Wind project. And for the Cape Wind project actually Siemens is the partner who will supply the turbines for this first, and I think this would be an opening of the off-shore wind market in United States as well.</p>
          <p>So we are quite hopeful in terms of that we see renewables going forward, gas will obviously  be there and so, at the end of the day, it will be a mix, and I would anticipate we will have a version of an energy bill and climate bill coming through at the end of the day. How it will look like, this is what we don't know yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And the other thing is, I mean we have everything customers want to build. So if it's about steam then we have steam, if it's gas, we have gas. We've got renewables. So we can actually do everything our customers want in the U.S. and that's a positive. Maybe I can comment a little bit on the supply chain management. Obviously, it goes without saying that we aren't very satisfied with the results we have been able to achieve. Now with the in the last 12 months some market conditions were more favorable for buyers They turned a little more challenging obviously because commodities and pricing it's getting a little tighter, but that if you only go by numbers and go by tangible facts, let me just give you a few numbers maybe for the first half of 2010 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2009.</p>
          <p>Let's take a look at the P&amp;L then comparison P&amp;L first half 2009 P&amp;L first half 2010, revenues went from 38.6 billion, down to 35.6. That's a 3 billion drop in revenues. By the same token we were able to keep the gross margin from 10.6 to 10.6 lost about 40 million, which is nothing. Obviously, improving gross margin in percentage. So that means that somehow we were able to compensate for all the costs, for all the revenue drops and the lost gross margin in our cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>And that's not just only reducing a few drops or going into short-time work, which obviously has proven to be a very effective tool to save costs, but it would also be there if we are being need it again.</p>
          <p>But we've able to fully compensate, a drop of 3 billion in the cost of goods sold and that to a very good extent has been contributed by supply chain in any respect. So that's a real positive. So we were able to keep the gross margin in absolute terms and then take all the improvements on the bottom line out of our very effective SG&amp;A program and also in some parts saving in other costs like R&amp;D and then of course also through the drop in consultancy costs when we were done with our clean-up in several areas. So that actually should truly suggest that it is some tangible, meaningful way of understanding that this had quite a decent impact from supply chain.</p>
          <p>Now on the SG&amp;A maybe one remark because it's just there. You see now SG&amp;A has been steady at 2.5 billion in Q2, which is another massive drop year-on-year; we also had 2.5 in our Q1, already that makes 5. We have not changed our view that life goes on, that this company is supposed to grow, enter into new markets, explore new growth opportunities. So we still remain of the opinion that SG&amp;A around about should be at the same levels of fiscal 2009 in the current fiscal year. So that's an important assumption to have.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to, at the risk flogging a dead horse, just ask a few more questions about this Mexican stand-off idea. Is what you're saying that basically if you were to lower prices by a material amount orders in the power generation market, and I'm particularly interested in Europe, would automatically come through because people in principal are desperate for slots.</p>
          <p>Or is what you're politely saying that at the moment you're just negotiating and having general discussions with your old customers and that we're going to wait and see what happens? How price critical is it at the moment in terms of getting new orders? I guess, a related question to that is if we don't see a resumption of the order inflow for let's say three or four quarters, or the Mexican stand-off persists, is your confidence in the gross margin in backlog is such that there is no way we would ever test the bottom end of the margin range, the 11 to 15%?</p>
          <p>And the final question, which is a strategic question I guess for Peter, you've made some interesting acquisitions in solar thermal in the current year with Solel, etcetera. I wondered if you had any view at all on PV photovoltaic assets given how distressed they are and whether there may be an opportunity for Siemens there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben, first of all, it's great to see you back. I'll start with the second one ,with the CSP acquisition. We have clearly decided for ourselves that we would like to enter a field and a technology where we believe we have a real chance to drive great clarity in a meaningful way as an industrial company so that we can really leverage industrial competency what we have on top of the components, being it receivers, converters, solar field and so on so forth. So where we really can bring to bear the engineering quality as an integrator in this industry, and that's the reason why we have actually picked CSP and we strongly believe we have made a good choice there.</p>
          <p>The PV at the end of the day will be very much high capacity, would be capacity game, will be very capital intensive. We are not an early, we would be a late-comer to the business and maybe there is a reason why some PV assets are what you consider at the different price point today than they used to have a couple of months or years ago. So that's not really a primary focus for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And, Ben, I mean as you know, with your comment to distressed assets, obviously it's such a statement be a chance of acquisitions. You can shift that asset within the assets. So, therefore, I mean, what Peter said, there is nothing to add on that matter.</p>
          <p>On the fossil, predominant in the fossil environment, that's the one area where we have large projects under review in the sales funnel. As far as the backlog is concerned there is no reason to worry about the current gross margin, which is in the backlog; we just need to execute well, not flawless but well, and then we'll be able to keep that margin for a while and also make it from the backlog into the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>And I believe that the division has proven for several quarters in a row now, actually since this Q2, 2008 that we are able to execute well, if I run a lot and done a good job there.</p>
          <p>So backlog should be okay. It's a matter of execution. On the sales funnel discussion, I mean the positive is that no one is really desperate, neither competitors, nor us, nor our customers. We have a situation of uncertainty. We have seen a massive growth in capacity over the last two, three years, some of the power plants are not even finished yet, so they will be coming on line at some point and that is of worry for our customers. And if they want to do something they would want to see some decent price motivation.</p>
          <p>We, on the other hand, we've got time, we need to see what we can do for our customers because we want to continue working together. By the same token obviously we also need to act in the best interest of our shareholders. By the same token, we also do see increases in commodity pricing. We do see increasing in purchase parts related to that industry. And we don't want to be cheated and we do not want to cheat anyone, so we need to find a decent solution with our customers as a partner to make a meaningful contribution and then I'm sure we'll find a solution. It's about design to cost, it is about agreements and how we can do business together. So I would not overly concerned about the fact that there has been some, we've seen some weakness here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael Hagmann, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, if I may, unfortunately one coming back to energy. I was just wondering in the last downturn, you've benefited strongly from very generous agreements on terminations. Would it be the same this downturn, so if there are cancellations, will you equally benefit from cancellation fees and how would that also apply to deferrals?</p>
          <p>And then second question is on the stimulus packages, coming back to what ABB was saying a couple of days ago, that they seem to be struggling a bit, particularly in China, but also talking about the U.S. with the fact that these stimulus packages are meant to help the domestic suppliers and not really international companies. So if ABB is treated not necessarily as a local company in either China or the U.S., how do people look at Siemens and do you think you're suffering, will be suffering from the same problem?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, we have announced that actually almost a year ago I think that we anticipate to benefit in the range within a next three years of 15 billion. We have so far have an order intake, I'm talking about order intake the last three the next three years, so far we have reached 3 billion. This is pretty much when you look into this quarter alone there was 1 billion more, so this was 1 out of 3 coming out of this quarter. And if you looking to this spread, you see it a pretty much with I would say with our Industry business and spread well out between China, U.S. and Brazil. And one of the benefits what we have, and I think this is a clear differentiator of Siemens versus all the other competitors, is that we are really a multi-local company in 190 countries around the world, so we have a great build-out in this markets.</p>
          <p>We have considered this a great local company and there is not a best &#x2013; a better signal than two days ago I was with President Obama, who has visited one of our sites, the wind blade manufacturing plant in Madison, Ohio (sic) [Fort Madison, IA], and he has chosen Siemens to talk about this energy agenda and what it means in terms of how to fill the clean tech reindustrialization agenda for United States, and how Siemens is actually a showcase in this area. So there is a clear differentiation of how we have already a well built out local infrastructure and, therefore, I think we are clearly able to participate in a different way than many other companies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, on the cancellation fees and potential earnings from that. I think you just recently had such a case &#x2013; I think it was Q1 if I am not mistaken, when there was a cancellation on a coal-fired steam plant, which can, you know, eventually we got compensated for our efforts but this is not we are in for, we are in for doing business. So we are not in for collecting cancellation fees. So even though it depends on the contract if something goes wrong from the customer's side, but  this would not be a material matter us in our earnings considerations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is more like, if there are massive cancellations, is it going to hurt your bottom line or is &#x2013; are you covered enough in order to compensate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said it depends on the contract, usually contracts are of such type, if someone does not make good on the obligation the other one will be compensated for the damage in general, but it always depends on what the agreements are. But then again there are no real signs, which would make us feel concerned about potential major cancellations.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Colin Campbell at SocGen.  Can you just help me a little bit on healthcare growth rates, clearly you've now seen there's a 6% order improvement in the quarter in healthcare. How will that impact revenue growth in the second half, and what is the longer term ambition in terms of revenue growth in healthcare? Do we need further acquisitions again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Colin, I think first of all it was very important that we have now the healthcare bill out of the way and we clearly see that certainty is coming back and this has obviously had an immediate positive impact of our business in the United States. So we have also a positive order growth coming in, and the United States from an overall global perspective, is a very, very important market because it's not just from a growth perspective, but also from a profitability perspective. So this is a great sign and I think we see clearly a positive market environment going forward, and obviously this will have an impact on our global business positively.</p>
          <p>Europe continues to be, I would say, very cost conscious, no change. We see growth coming out of Asia, and Asian markets and Japan is also, as we speak, in a low-growth mode. So if you look back I think you will see a slightly different growth pattern going forward, but it will, in my opinion, not come back to the historic growth levels probably soon what we used to see 10 years ago or 5 years ago.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's James at Redburn Partners. Three financial questions, if I could. Firstly on price, last year, or at the beginning of this year, you talked about 2% price headwinds. Now you're talking about a lower price headwind. Are you talking about a third of that haven't come off because of the currency issue? So are we talking minus 1.3%, is that the new guidance? And if so could you say what the first half pricing has been, whether it's been above or below that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, currency. I think you said a couple of times that you're running your hedging this year at 1.5 and next year you've taken hedges out of 1.3 to 1.35. Could you give us a PBT quantification for what that is year-on-year? Is that 0.5 billion, 750 million?  To me, it seems like a big number.</p>
          <p>And thirdly you talked about 3 billion of cost reduction. Could you say what's real and structure and permanent within that? Obviously, some of it is going to what is structural and permanent within that.  Obviously, a lot of it is going to come back as raw materials come back and revenues come back, but how much of that is going to be permanent?</p>

          <p>First of all, very good questions. And if I knew the answer on those three going forward, we would probably be in a very good shape. So let me maybe try it, on the first, it would be  precise because we said it's going to be about &#x20AC;2 billion when we talked about our working hypothesis for this famous 6 to 6.5. We said that we are expecting about 2 billion and on price decline year-on-year, in revenues, okay. If we talk about price decline we'll just talk year-on-year revenues not our order intake, not sales.. And we said it's about 2 billion and , as I said,  there is a certain portion around about one-third for a potential impact of unutilized capacity versus currency and the likes and third party competitors trying to take advantage of that.</p>
          <p>That part has gone away to a significant part. So the pricing, price decline year-on-year would be less than 2 billion, okay. Percentage-wise by sectors, because we have the numbers, but I'm not sure it's wise to make them public because every customer who's got less price concession than the average could come back and say by the way where is my fair share. So therefore favorable impact because of a disciplined competitive environment and the 2 billion are going to be material realistic because of that one-third. When it is fixed, it's not that easy to say as you know because we hedge usually every project hedged by the time we take the order intake and then it's being basically locked in.</p>
          <p>For the non-project business the kind of the products type environment, the book-and-bill environment, we usually hedge about three quarters rolling. Due to the fact that we saw some comforting exchange rates between the euro and the greenback at levels of 132 &#x2013; 33ish around, we actually basically completed our hedging our net currency position for 2010.</p>
          <p>So we are locked in for this one and we also secured a material part of our expected net currency position for 2011 already at that four-part number. So I'm not going to speculate on whether it's going to go down or somewhere else. We believe that 132 is a very decent exchange rate for our net currency position based on the greenback, which is by far our biggest one.</p>
          <p>So in many ways we'll see average hedging conditions for 2011 probably in that ballpark. By the same token also we need to take into consideration that the long-term projects, which have been hedged at some point will also materialize into revenues, so it's hard to tell what the average, the average number will be for 2011 or 2010 yet.</p>
          <p>As far as impact, material impacts, are concerned, we had the single most material impact we had on healthcare for the first half of our fiscal 2010 was actually very favorable, I would probably see about 100 million year-to-date on positive year-on-year impact, okay, year-on-year impact. And that will go away for the second half of the year. So there will be little to no material impact from the hedging in healthcare in the second half 2009 as compared to second half 2010 because that will average off now.</p>
          <p>So going forward, if everything comes the way we expect it to be, that could actually, the first half of 2011 could be a little less favorable because then you see the last six months development was 140, 150, and then the second half of 2011 could actually get us some relief again on those impacts. So all in all, it's not really material to any big numbers of the company. But we try to lock in as much as we could at levels between 130 and 135, okay.</p>

          <p>And the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, yeah, well, that was of course the best question of all. I mean, of course in supply chain we took some advantage of more favorable conditions in a massive downturn. But there is an equal high activity in the supply chain environment, could not just negotiate based on strengths and weakness, but also make meaningful projects together with the suppliers in terms of design win projects. And make sure that both partners get their fair share of benefit. So there is structural improvements definitely there, the percentage is probably a little asking for too much. But there is also structural improvement in the cost of goods sold.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next, Simon Smith, please</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I had two questions. The first was about the bridge of profitability and your guidance for the year. I mean obviously you've had some very strong profitability in the first half of the year. Your guidance implies a very sharp decline into the second half of the year, of which clearly there must me elements that you're calculating that are not organic. I was wondering if you could give us any help with the factors that you're looking at between first and second half.</p>
          <p>And my second question is about competition, particularly competition coming from emerging markets. We've seen in a number of your end markets, emerging market players are asserting themselves more aggressively in this downturn. I just wondered if you could give us an insight into the dynamics that you're seeing there. Is that a situation that's stabilized or are you seeing any intensification of competition there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, Simon, I'll start with the first one, the bridge of profitability, because I do remember I owe you that. I kind of was cutting you off a little bit last time end of merger demystery day. I did expect you to raise that question again, and of course it's a fair question, because if nothing else people would say, okay 4.3 or 4.4 times 2 and everything else you need to explain. I mean, we realize that.</p>
          <p>When I explained the SG&amp;A, for example, earlier I said that in the first quarter we had 2.5, in the second quarter we had 2.5. So that means we're at about 5 billion now. To that also would be 10. I also, however, said and guided that we still do expect life to go on, growing  further capacity in 2010. And so we do expect SG&amp;A to be just about the levels of last year, last year's level at 10.9, okay. So that probably already eases a lot of the difference on the basic math. The other one is we have to say that in the first half it did have very favorable product mix matters and it always results from the fact and if high gross margin businesses like OSRAM, like Industrial Automation go up steeply, they have drops of 65, 70% to the bottom line. And assuming that not every of the cost of goods sold savings are structural in nature, but also based with the volume, you can see that then costs are trailing a little bit.</p>
          <p>The other topic is on R&amp;D. We've also been &#x2013; if you look at the R&amp;D, it's easy to look at in the P&amp;L. R&amp;D also has been way below of our expectations. Now we obviously, I'm the last one who pushes the organization to spend money on R&amp;D because we obviously are aware of the fact that innovation is output related, not input related. There is a certain correlation to it, so careful to also expect the OpEx, SG&amp;A and R&amp;D to go up at levels of last year.</p>
          <p>That's what we have in our considerations, and considering also the product mix impact in the first half from a no load space to a some load space in the second half, that's probably already the majority of the explanation, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Next please, Olivier. Sorry, go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The emerging market competitors...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the emerging market competitors, you really have to go into division and business-by-business. We have highlighted several times that we do see emerging market competitors now going from global to regional actually quite fast. If you look into, for example, companies like Rotem in rail, a Korean company who is actually going from being basically only seeing in emerging markets now showing up in Eastern Europe, for example.</p>
          <p>We see clearly in other parts of our business a strong local competition. For this reason we have started what we have highlighted a couple of quarters ago, what we call a smart initiative that we actually continue to build out a program which we support actually from headquarter, but is really a locally driven program where we really build product portfolios which are completely dedicated and tailored towards emerging market requirements.</p>
          <p>So they are engineered there, they are -- the supply chain is there, they are manufactured there, they are headquartered there and they have the global responsibility for this product line out of the emerging markets to really take advantage of exactly the same type of environment that our competitors have. And this is how we actually complement our high-end product portfolio in the emerging market as well. I think it will be critical and this is why we have actually started this that we really -- we've just have a major focus right now around India, Brazil and, of course, China.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Three questions, please. First I want to come back on the SG&amp;A comment you made. Can you be a bit more specific about what's driving the sequential increase H2 versus H1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What is that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>SG&amp;A, is IT spending, consulting coming back that you cannot cut too long or you're building presence in emerging market. Just explain to us what's happening. Secondly, on the diagnostic business, growth has come back a little bit but, in all fairness, it remains below your peer group and below your goal of 7 to 8% which you had for that division diagnostic.</p>
          <p>So when do you expect that division to return to your objective or is there something that is more structural. Can you just explain to us a bit? And lastly, on the extending maybe the photovoltaic question, on the M&amp;A front, how does Siemens think about the portfolio and the opportunities in the M&amp;A market, is this a way for you to improve your net debt to EBITDA? What's going to happen? Can you help us a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'll start with the diagnostic first. Olivier, I would like to disagree with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are probably below. I mean when you talk about peer group, I think when you look into other diagnostic companies, our growth currently is not so different. There is one company who is really a significantly different in growth path, but when you then compare growth versus operating margins of this company versus ours, you see a different mix. So we clearly have focused on trying to keep a profitable growth, but we are not &#x2013; I don't believe that we are significantly below peer group. There's a clear market leader who has different strategy in this context. We have put several measures in place to really drive growth, and I think this quarter is a good one, where we obviously have a solid equipment placement then from this drive revenue out of the consumables and we have a clear focus on key priority markets.</p>
          <p>So the team is executing to take advantage of it. But at the end of the day it's a certain balance what we will see in the business, and we should not expect that this business it is less impacted by the crisis compared to other businesses, but I think the industry is currently not at the trend level where you can talk about the 7% growth path for the industry. So I assume that the overall growth is probably somewhere industry-wide between let's say mid-single-digit and this is what this business should do going forward, but at the end of the day the important thing is that we drive profitable growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Olivier, at the SG&amp;A front and I myself am trying to give you some &#x2013; and the audience, some flavor of where the assumptions are on SG&amp;A. I mean, obviously we do have a series of projects, of course, we want to make sure that the SG&amp;A levels stay at similar areas as we have it today, so we have first launched two massive funding program, it's called 1HR, the finance funding project that it will provide significant savings going forward, make sure that the G&amp;A level remains at the decent numbers. We too want to invest in to go-to-market approaches. Obviously, if the market and the market growth do not allow significant order revenue growth we need to go after the shares of market.</p>
          <p>And that does not suggest that we're going to go after the markets was surprising, but at the service. And get the presence of service at the customer site. So there is predominantly go-to-market actions we want to do and it's on our discretion, so we decide whether or not we want to invest, so we are not being forced by costs cutting back because they were not sustainable. We decide if we want to spend money, we make that decision based on a decent business plan and the return on our investments.</p>
          <p>Photovoltaic and the M&amp;A front, I mean, obviously, we look at matters that would be only prudent, but this is about strategy and our experience has been to talk about strategy only once you're done and this is how we want keep it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Martin, proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Martin Wilkie from Deutsche Bank with two questions. Firstly, on Drive Technologies. You talk about capacity reductions are still need to happen, but you've obviously seen good double-digit order growth this quarter. And maybe if you could just let us know what's happening within that presumably very strong growth in early cycle. What's happening to those later-cycle parts of dry technologies? And secondly, just going back to pricing, you mentioned that you are comfortable there is no additional price pressure. And one of your biggest competitors in T&amp;D obviously very recently said they did see sequential deterioration in transformers specifically, but power products generally, and is that something you think has bottomed out and do you sense there's stability in pricing in T&amp;D? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the drive technology, I mean you're absolutely right. There are two worlds within drive technology, it's the early-cycle part that's one of motion control and the like that has seen some recovery and also a decent drop into the bottom line; and there is the other world which is more long cycle, think about parts of energy, large drives and the like. And that definitely has not yet seen the bottom yet in terms of bookings or bookings growth.</p>
          <p>And, you know, it's like in real life, if a storm passes then you don't go back and then continue as you who would before the storm, you need to clean up and take care of the dimensions which you have left. And that also means that you probably have to deepen some structure because of the geographic split of the new markets have to become different. And that's why there is always something to look at and to improve and this is what we been referring to. No real big spectacular topic, okay.</p>
          <p>On the pricing matter, it really is important. We've been referring to our assumptions and our working hypothesis to our guidance, which we gave in December. Many of you may recall that we've been talking about pockets of weakness in T&amp;D at a time where many others did not really at least tell about it. So it hasn't changed. We are just saying that we do not see further deterioration as to what we have been assuming. But as far as T&amp;D is concerned, we've put a great deal of what we have been seeing happening into our assumptions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And do we say pricing has stabilized or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All we are saying is that the concern of potentially higher fluctuation, which would affect our guidance to the negative, has gone away, all right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let's take the last question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid another guidance-related question. Just to avoid me becoming overly optimistic below your total sectors, could you just give a bit of clarity on the corporate items and corporate treasury and why are you looking for that combined run rate to run at sort of 500 million per quarter when it's been running at about 300 million per quarter, taking out the one-offs, for awhile now? What are the key kind of moving parts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said, there have been a series of positive one-offs, the dominant being in the second quarter, a few also in the first one, and the page number 14 of your handout has been meant to give you some insight what was our expectations are for the second half of the fiscal year. And that's probably pretty much more than what average companies give in disclosure and I would not feel comfortable to walk through every line item and every account our company has.</p>
          <p>So the guidance has been designed in a way not to disappoint investors going forward. And we work quarter-after-quarter and there are upsides and downsides and some are in our hands, which are our area of influence, and others are in hands of our customers and the competitors and we'll work it through quarter-after-quarter. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>With that I would like to close the Q&amp;A. I also would like to refer to you the financial calendar, which is for the next three months, and you'll find on slide 18 in the package. So ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your attendance.</p>
