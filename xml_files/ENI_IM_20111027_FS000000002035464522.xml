          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Eni SpA 2011 Third Quarter Results Conference Call hosted by Alessandro Bernini, Chief Financial Officer. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'm now handing you over to your host to begin today's conference call. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our Third Quarter Results Conference Call. The third quarter of '11 was characterized by significant progress on our strategic dollars. In particular the situation in Libya is evolving positively. The Abu-Attifel oil field was restarted, and we have reopened the GreenStream pipeline on October 13. Our initial volumes are small, but we expect to ramp this up over the next two months and into the first quarter of '12, along with the restart of the large Bahr Essalam offshore gas field expected before year-end.</p>
          <p>Overall, the recovery of our activities in Libya have enabled us to greatly reduce our estimate for the negative impact of the crisis on full-year production. We have also continued to deliver excellent exploration results of which our recent discovery in Mozambique is the standout example, both in terms of size and because it opens up a new frontier for us in East Africa.</p>
          <p>We have made good progress on our development projects, in particular taking the FID for the Samburskoye field in the Yamal Peninsula, putting us on track for startup in '12.</p>
          <p>Just to give you an update on gas renegotiations, our discussion with Sonatrach has been positive, and we are close to reaching a mutually satisfactory conclusion. Our discussions with Gazprom are progressing, and we have seen evidence of an increasingly constructive dialogue. While it is difficult to be deterministic about the timing of a deal, we remain confident about the outcome.</p>
          <p>But now let me give you a detailed overview of our Q3 results. In the third quarter of '11 the macroenvironment was mainly positive. The Brent price average $113 a barrel, up 48% compared to the third quarter of '10. Meanwhile the average European refining margin Brent/Ural was $2.9 per barrel, still weak compared to historical levels, but showing an 18% increase year-on-year. The euro-dollar exchange rate moved unfavorably compared to the corresponding period of last year, with the euro appreciating around 10% versus the dollar.</p>
          <p>Moving to our results, adjusted operating profit in the third quarter amounted to &#x20AC;4.6 billion, up 12% year-over-year. This result is due to the improved performances of the Exploration and Production, Engineering and Construction, and the Refining Marketing businesses partially offset by the lower contribution of the Gas &amp; Power division, which doesn't reflect any benefits from gas contract renegotiations, and the negative result of the Petrochemical business.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net profit for the third quarter was &#x20AC;1.8 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Notwithstanding a higher adjusted tax rate, up by almost 7 percentage points to 57.6%. The recent upward revision of the so-called Robin Tax decreased net profit by &#x20AC;130 million in the third quarter, of which 80 million pertaining to the first half of '11.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of '11, Eni's Hydrocarbon production amounted to 1,473,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease of about 14% compared to Q3 '10. Lower production was mainly due to the ongoing instability in Libya, which reduced production by approximately 200,000 BOE per day. Furthermore, PSA and PSA entitlements were negatively affected by the sharp increase in the oil price, with an estimated impact of 37,000 BOE per day. The increase in the oil price, however, boosted the division's adjusted operating profit, which amounted to over &#x20AC;3.9 billion, up 19% compared to the third quarter of last year. This positive result comes in spite of the negative impact of the USD depreciation, amounted to around &#x20AC;200 million in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In Gas &amp; Power, overall gas volumes sold, including consolidating and associated companies, totaled at 17.3 bcm, roughly in line with last year. However, adjusted operating profit decreased by 20% compared to the same period of '10 due to the sharply lower results delivered by the Marketing business. It's worth reminding you that the results do not include any benefits from the renegotiation of our long-term supply contracts, although these will be retroactive once agreements are finalized.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power adjusted pro forma EBITDA for the third quarter of '11 was &#x20AC;550 million compared to &#x20AC;675 million in the third quarter of last year. International Transportation results showed a 4% decrease while the regulated businesses generated &#x20AC;388 million, up 5% off gross to the corresponding period of last year. The increase is mainly due to higher returns of new investments and efficiency actions, as well as the positive impact on the Distribution business of the new tariff regime settled by the Authority for Electricity and Gas.</p>
          <p>Adjusted pro forma <mark type="indiscernible" /> (07:23) the Marketing Power business was negatively impacted by increasing competitive pressure in Italy and Europe, as well as unfavorable climate and the tsunami affects. Furthermore, the ongoing situation in Libya reduced the volumes to shippers and affected margins, owing to the substitution of the recently renegotiated Libyan gas with other sources of supply not yet renegotiated. These negatives were partially offset by the positive outcome of recent difficult renegotiations of a long-term supply contract with the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>Turning now to R&amp;M in the third quarter of '11, the division reported an adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;26 million versus &#x20AC;14 million in the same period of last year. The Refining business has greatly improved the results due to a better ratio of prices of the main distillates to the cost of the crude feed stock and the widening of spreads of gasoline and gas oil compared to fuel oil. These positives were partially offset by rising oil linked to cost for plant utilities. Marketing activities posted a positive result, although lower than in Q3 of '10 due to the climbing fuel consumption, a different mix of volume sold, and increased expenses related to promotional initiatives.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of '11 the Petrochemical business reported an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;80 million compared to a profit of &#x20AC;31 million in the third quarter of last year. The result was negatively impacted by falling profit margins with the cracker margin severely hit by higher supply costs of oil based feed stock, which were not fully recovered in sales prices on end markets, as well as a substantial decrease in demand.</p>
          <p>Saipem delivered adjusted operating profit of &#x20AC;333 million, up 5% versus Q3 of '10, mainly driven by higher results in onshore construction and offshore drilling operations. Other activities and Corporate showed an aggregate loss of &#x20AC;146 million compared to a loss of &#x20AC;93 million reported in the third quarter of '10.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was &#x20AC;11.2 billion in the first nine months of '11. Proceeds from divestments amounted to &#x20AC;334 million, including small non-strategic upstream assets and the sale of gas distribution activities in Brazil. The cash inflows were used to partially fund cash outflows relating to capital expenditure of &#x20AC;9.5 billion and dividend payments of &#x20AC;4.1 billion, which included the payment of the interim dividend of '11 made in the last week of September. Net financial debt as of the end of September amounted to &#x20AC;28.3 billion, and the ratio of net borrowings to total equity stood at 0.49%. The net debt at the end of September doesn't include the cash-in from the unknowns, the disposal of the international pipelines, nor the investment of the acquisition of Nuon Energy and an additional stake in Elgin/Franklin, which we expect by year-end. Assuming the Netherlands Brent price of $111 per barrel for the full year '11 and the benefit associated with the ongoing renegotiation of gas supply contracts, the debt-to-equity ratio expected at end of '11 will be lower than in 2010.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention, and now together with Claudio Descalzi and Domenico Dispenza, I would be happy to answer any question you may have.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question comes from Mr. Alejandro Demichelis from Merrill Lynch. Mr. Demichelis, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. The first question is on the Mamba South discovery. Maybe you can talk to us, how do you see that going forward? And also in terms of size of Mamba North, should we assume that that is going to be of a similar size? And then as a follow-up, maybe you can tell us what you're thinking in terms of how you think about unitization, and potential development of this field?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mamba, we plan to drill additional four wells. As we said, the next well will be Mamba North. We think the Mamba North will not have the same dimension of Mamba South. Mamba South is a bigger discovery, and more than what we expected, but we feel that by the end of the 2012 we can increase these resources. I cannot talk now about unitization, because we didn't talk to Anadarko yet, but I think that part of the field has to unitized, and part of the structure are not in, are not <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:46) Anadarko block. So, and that's not the case for all the blocks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the deeper discovery does not overlap with Anadarko? Or do you think that the upper zone does not overlap?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We talked about in general. I think that unitization, as you know, is a very sensitive issue, and I don't think that it's very wise to talk and disclose anything about unitization before talking with Anadarko, with the government. So I prefer don't talk about unitization now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are still drilling the well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question is from Mr. Nitin Sharma from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question, sir.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions for you, if I may. First one on Gas Marketing business. This is the second consecutive quarter where you've reported operating loss for this business, and the reason clearly is the ongoing negotiations with Gazprom and Sonatrach. Could you please quantify what sort of financial impact culmination of these negotiations would have? And if possible, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:03) I know you've guided towards an early resolution, but would that mean by end of Q4? And the second one is in relation to the guidance that you've given on production year-over-year 10% decline. Now that guidance was based on additional volumes from resumption in Libya. My question is what level of production are you assuming in Q4 from Libya? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Oil &amp; Gas, well they're quite <mark type="ph" /> big (15:34) amounts on last one, because we closed the fund's long haul contract, supply contract. We closed that, I would say, in a quite, quite a good way, meaning that we've <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:48) contract. What remains still to be the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (15:51) of these two main contracts, vis-a-vis <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:00) Gazprom contract.  On the sum of the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (00:00) I could say that I think that we are doing quite well, that should do well, I would say. So I expect that at the conclusion, maybe, should be written this year.</p>
          <p>For Gas &amp; Oil disclosure, if the market factor the same, we think that we are still negotiating with them <mark type="ph" /> their progress (16:18) , but we are not yet at a stage which we could consider closing the plant here. I cannot, of course, comment on the other impacts of those negotiations, but I could remind you that we've had and confirm today that it will be considered a part of call today, the impact of the Libyan situation that we've been <mark type="indiscernible" /> (16:42) the result should be if the negotiation will be complete in one week to what respect the final report will be broadly in line with results over last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Libya the expected average contribution of Libya production in Q4 is about 120,000 barrels a day, and the impact, if they shut down in Libya for the full year 2011, is roughly 190,000 barrels per day.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Jon Rigby from UBS. Please, sir, proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Two questions. One on gas again, can you &#x2013; are you able to estimate or give us some sort of estimates of what you think the absence well not just the absence, Libya was, A, on your Gas &amp; Power business, i.e. the absence of that cheaper gas, and also I think you mentioned in the second quarter that it also had a negative impact on both your Refining and your Petrochemicals businesses with the absence of the optimized feed stock. Are you able to give us some sort of economic, some calculation on the economic effect there? And can you just confirm that the discovery that you're talking about in Angola, Lira, if that's, potentially a third hole on 15/06. Is that correct? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the record we'll just say that we estimate it can go over, around the 300 millions a year, oil impact of the lack of Libyan gas on this year. Of course, looking to remove their <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:30) , gas is still <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:33) GreenStream and we should expect the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:34) future, and it would be more opportunistic for the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (18:44) Lira, as far as the affect of Libya on the other businesses, Refinery and Marketing and Petrochemical, let me say that the effect on the results of those business lines is negligible, is limited to a few million euros, and we confirm with the estimate that we have already provided in the first months of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Lira and Angola, we confirmed that this is a very good discovery. It is mainly gas and condensate. We need an additional one or two wells to define and appreciate clearly the dimension of the discovery that this one is very big in terms of gas. I feel that that can become a third hub, but more on the LNG side. And with some good production on condensate, but I think that we will be able to be more clear about these projects, I think, in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, so would that be something that would naturally fit into your Angola LNG II project that you have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lira, for sure, as you know we have a joint venture with Sonangol Gas for a second possible LNG. We have already made some good discoveries with Sonangol. We discovered about 2 to 2.5 <mark type="indiscernible" /> (20:23) , and that would be an additional gas, and for sure with Lira, and with what we discovered, we can already have a possibility to develop a fourth LNG or an additional claim. But as I told you, this issue is also connecting to the joint venture that we have in the Block 15/06. So we cannot extrapolate more and elaborate more on this subject.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could I just ask about where we're at on Iraq in terms of production levels? Because I don't really understand if we're still ramping up or whether investment levels have slowed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Iraq now, the average production now is about 240,000 to 245,000 barrels per day. So we reduced the average production in Iraq, the gross production, and the reason that we're separating the first half is because there is some bottlenecking sorry, in the contract. So we are not able, we have not been able to award all the contracts we forecasted in 2011. So for that reason, the production is going down. We think that is just a temporary situation. We are in transition phase, and we are confident that we can restart the ramp up, the production ramp up in 2012.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just some follow-up questions from what we've talked about before. Just on Mozambique, is it possible just to give us any rough estimates of what you think recovery factors would be for the discovery? Secondly just on Libya, is it right to assume that you'd just see a ramp up in the condensate alongside the gas? And then just lastly, you are a little bit light in terms of the run rate on CapEx. Again, would it be right to assume that there's just a simple rollover in the CapEx into 2012, and we should assume a higher number for 2012? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Recovery factor for Mozambique, as I said, we are still drilling this well. Already we have some core, and so we know the tally, I think that's for, and the physics for this kind of environment the average could be between 65% and 85% or 90% of recovery factor. So that is the average that we have in our statistics. But as I said, that is a broad range, because we are really still in the early stage.</p>
          <p>For Libya, yes. Increasing the gas production, we are going to increase, also, the condensate. And third for the CapEx, I don't think that we'll have a strong increase in our CapEx in 2012, because it's just a question of commissioning and some additional maintenance problem that &#x2013; it's more an OpEx than CapEx.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next question comes from Miss Lucy Haskins from Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Could I ask, it's a nice turnaround in the Refining and Marketing business. How much would you see if that had just been a normal seasonal pattern in terms of the driving season <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:58)  And how much is, actually, the self-help measures starting to see you through? And then perhaps on the flip side, Chemicals, perhaps it was a little lighter than we might have expected for the quarter. What's the underlying challenges there? And again, what can you do to address those issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. You are right. The positive result in the quarter of the Refinery business must be considered a, sort of, temporary positive effect, unfortunately, because in the quarter in particular the refining margin in the Mediterranean has expressed some improvement, but at the end of the quarter, and already in October, the result has slightly worsened. So it can be considered only a temporary positive effect. On the other side, what is for sure will be maintained also over the next period is the efficiency that we are for sure in control, a lot of our initiatives that partially have been already completed and partially are still ongoing. So we are dedicating a lot of our efforts to the efficiency process, and to these initiatives, we have been already successful in obtaining significant cost savings in the Refinery business.</p>
          <p>Then, as for as the Marketing business is concerned, for sure you know the summer season is quite important for this type of business, in Italy in particular, and effectively the margins that we have realized in the period relates to this seasonal affect. So in the coming quarters, we expect to be able to maintain more or less the same positive result in the Marketing business, even if associated to lower volumes, whilst in the Refining we are a little bit negative for the future.</p>
          <p>In Petrochemical, Petrochemical business in particular, you know that we are engaged in the production of a different line of products. Some of them are maintain, in particular the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (27:33)  are maintaining a very good result, whilst much of the production of our petrochemical system is, unfortunately, there is a significant decrease in the demand. And accordingly the volumes of the production has decreased significantly during the quarter. And we are also, for this segment, a little bit negative also for the last quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>However, also in the Chemical business, so you know that we have allowance for a number of initiatives, one in which is the conversion of our Porto Torres industrial site into a sort, into a production of green products, but, of course, the production and benefit will come on stream only in coming years, because the development will require at least one year or two during the first level of production.</p>

          <p>Yes. Hi, afternoon. Thank you. Could I just get some confirmation or level of detail on the gas price that Gazprom has committed to the purchasing your volumes from Samburskoye field? And at which point in 2012 should that field start up? Is it the first half or the second half? And secondly, just on Libya, I'm just curious if you have actually restarted any oil wells yet? I'm just curious if they're coming back online in line with your expectations? And that's focused on the oil wells. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So for Samburskoye the third half is forecast for the first half of 2012. The gas price is a mixture. It's mixed in gas, the domestic price and export and within that they can convert for 2016, because there is an annual increase.</p>
          <p>For Libya, yes, we start one big oil field, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (29:58) and by the third week of November we will restart Bouri, that is an oil offshore field.</p>

          <p>Hi, gentlemen. Claudio, could you update us on the status of cash again in terms of how far along the project plan are you now? And, maybe, also give us some information about what the well flow rates have been, where you've been testing them. And perhaps, also what you think the final CapEx might be for the whole project? And if possible, any updates on any progress on Phase 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The progress on <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:00) the Phase 2 cash, again, commercial production, we reached 96.4%. That is in the progress update mid October. So we're absolutely, we are ahead of our schedule. That is the third month that we are ahead of schedule, and we think that we can reach 98% by the end of this year. So we are still on track, ahead of our schedule, to reach the production in 2012.</p>
          <p>From a production point of view, I think there is no problem. The well has been tested, not now, before, and we drill 22 &#x2013; 21 wells. We have to drill 40 wells for the experimental phase. The drilling is ongoing, but is continuing after the first production, and each well is &#x2013; absolutely has a production, certain enough to reach the first production, that is 70,000 barrels per day with a buildup on the first tier to reach, at the end of 2013, beginning 2014, 370,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>For cost, the right cost, the balance of the right cost is something that we are discussing. The project is not finished. I think that in term of CapEx, the right CapEx for the development, we are not very far from our target. That is what I can say at the moment.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on Phase 2, anything moved on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Phase 2, is under the Phase 2 is not our direct responsibility. Still under study, because we needed &#x2013; we stopped, suspended for a while because we needed to optimize costs. I think that once we will have reached the first production, the <mark type="ph" /> KCPE (33:17) for the first phase, we'll think about the second phase. But for sure the first phase has a lot of investment and lots of synergy on the Phase 2. So I don't have any doubt about the Phase 2. I cannot tell you now exactly the date, but I think that there is no doubt about the Phase 2.</p>
