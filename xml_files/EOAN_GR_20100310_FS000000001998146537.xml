        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the full-year 2009 results of the E.ON Group. Along the usual lines, Wulf Bernotat, our CEO, will summarize the main financials before giving you an update on some key strategic parameters. And thereafter, Marcus Schenck, our CFO, will outline the financials in greater detail. All corresponding documents are posted on our website.</p>
          <p>And with that, over to Wulf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the presentation of E.ON's 2009 results. Earlier than most, we indicated to you that the economic crisis will have pronounced consequences also for the utility sector. We adjusted our business accordingly and are now able to present a robust set of results.</p>
          <p>In line with the outlook that we provided in November, adjusted EBITDA is up 1% year-on-year, adjusted EBIT is down just 2% and adjusted net income is down 5%. Cash provided by operating activities improved considerably to 9.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our new markets achieved a strong result and offset the pressure on the earnings of Pan-European Gas. The adjusted EBIT of all other market units together did not change much year-on-year. Marcus Schenck will present the details in a moment.</p>
          <p>We propose to pay out a dividend of &#x20AC;1.50 per share. Therefore, despite the decline of adjusted net income, we are able to keep the proposed dividend at the same level as last year. This increases the payout ratio from 51 to 54%. It once again confirms our commitment to an attractive shareholder remuneration while keeping a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The outlook for 2010 is for adjusted EBIT to increase by between zero and 3% year-on-year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in line with 2009. This outlook incorporates the portfolio streamlining measures that we have already been implemented, as well as the four stakes taken out of the Th&#xFC;ga transaction.</p>
          <p>Once we deduct around &#x20AC;1 million of adjusted EBIT foregone due to disposals, the 2010 outlook is therefore close to the &#x20AC;11 billion target that we set last year. Regarding the further communication process, I look forward to seeing many of you during the combined handover roadshow with Johannes Teyssen in mid April.</p>
          <p>During summer time, Johannes will then present his views on the Group's strategy going forward, including new targets reaching beyond 2010.</p>
          <p>Today, I would like to focus my presentation on the following issues. First, I will discuss key recent developments, primarily the economic crisis, and activities within our Gas business. Second, I will update you on the progress we have made within our performance improvement program, our selective investment policy and the portfolio streamlining measures. And finally, as this is my last conference call as CEO of E.ON, I will review some of the key steps E.ON has taken since I started in May 2003.</p>
          <p>I will start with the consequences of the economic crisis. In 2009, E.ON saw a contraction of demand of five and 4% year-on-year respectively for electricity and for gas. This decline was especially marked in the industrial and commercial segment where we lost between nine and 10 of demand, both for electricity and for gas.</p>
          <p>Since the second half of 2009, however, the rate of decline in the demand for power and gas has decreased.</p>
          <p>In December, demand growth even turned positive for the first time since more than a year. Electricity demand in Germany was up 0.7% year-on-year, while gas demand in the six main European countries grew by 4%.</p>
          <p>Gas demand in January and February was also very strong, up 16% according to preliminary estimates of E.ON Ruhrgas. The cold winter certainly played a role. But the economic recovery is also becoming visible.</p>
          <p>Overall the economic crisis impacted our adjusted EBIT by around &#x20AC;500 million. Of this amount, roughly one-third each due to the reselling of contracted volumes, lost margin from lower volumes and due to an increase of bad debts.</p>
          <p>In addition, we need to consider the indirect implications on key commodity markets. Within a few months, we moved from tight to oversupplied markets in most European countries. As a consequence, power and spot gas prices, as well as dark and spark spreads, have decreased.</p>
          <p>Our prudent hedging strategy in power generation has shielded us to a large extent from these price declines. Even in 2010, we expect prices achieved in power generation to be higher than last year.</p>
          <p>Let me now update you on some key developments impacting our Gas business.</p>
          <p>Pan-European Gas, and especially Supply and Sales generated record earnings in the years between 2006 and 2008.</p>
          <p>In 2009, Pan-European Gas, similar to the entire gas industry, has been affected by three developments. The contraction of demand due to the economic crisis, the boom of unconventional gas in North America, and the development of LNG export and import capacities. Combined, those have led to an oversupply situation on the European gas market.</p>
          <p>As a result, European spot prices have decoupled from oil prices, and as a consequence from the price of the oil indexed long-term contracts as well.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the spot market has become more liquid, making it a more credible sourcing option than in the past. A few months both margins and volumes in Supply and Sales have come under considerable pressure.</p>
          <p>Our diversified portfolio of long-term contracts nevertheless remains the backbone of our gas sourcing. Given their long-term nature, various risk sharing elements ensure that those contract allow to react to changing circumstances following one basic principle, the producer bears the price risks, the buyer the volume risks. This is best reflected in the renegotiation clauses allowing both parties to periodically revise pricing conditions and other contract terms.</p>
          <p>As explained during the nine month results, we have already triggered such renegotiations with a majority of the producers last year. Our objective was to reduce the oil exposure in our overall supply portfolio. We have now reached final agreements with some of them and are finalizing those with all the others.</p>
          <p>The main results of these renegotiations is that the spot gas element in our overall supply portfolio has almost doubled. In addition, various technical adjustments will reduce the pricing of the oil index portion. Furthermore, the producers have also agreed to increase volume flexibility. Therefore, I can say that our long term contracts have demonstrated their flexibility in a period of rapid changes. The majority of the renegotiated agreements will become effective on January 2010. The combined effects of the renegotiations will thus already lead to a significant reduction of our gas procurement costs this year.</p>
          <p>We will now carefully monitor the developments on the markets. Should the current situation persist, then further renegotiations with a more pronounced emphasis on the overall pricing level will be necessary. However, gas sourcing is only one side of the equation, the other side being the sales contracts. Every year roughly half of our sales volumes are renewed. Most of the contracts that will come up for renewal this year were concluded in a much more favorable situation in 2008.</p>
          <p>In summary, we therefore expect that the adjusted EBIT of Supply and Sales will remain under pressure both in 2010 and in 2011. The Pan-European Gas business however is more than Supply and Sales. We're strongly developing our upstream and our storage activities. The acquisition of 25% in Yuzhno Russkoye last year and the development of Skarv-Idun in 2011 will bring us close to our target of producing 10 bcm of equity gas per year.</p>
          <p>In storage, capacity additions and more efficient marketing of our assets have and will continue to improve earnings. Therefore, our upstream and storage activities are expected to contribute to the majority of the adjusted EBIT of Pan-European Gas by 2012.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I will now outline the progress achieved with respect to our key strategic priorities.</p>
          <p>First, we are dedicated to improve operational performance. The PerformtoWin initiative is our flagship project in this respect. Its objective is to improve adjusted EBIT by &#x20AC;1.5 billion per year by 2011.</p>
          <p>We took the necessary time last year to prepare this project's implementation. Each of the measures was carefully validated before being handed over to the line managers in charge of execution. Today, the implementation is running smoothly and progresses rapidly.</p>
          <p>We had previously indicated that PerformtoWin would contribute two to &#x20AC;400 million to adjusted EBIT in 2009. In fact, we have already achieved around &#x20AC;600 million of performance improvements in 2009 as a result of the faster than expected implementation.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight a few examples of those projects that contributed most to this result. In the UK, the Clean Utility program aimed at reducing costs in the retail business was a major driver for the return to profit of that segment. At Pan-European Gas, our efforts to optimize utilization of storage and transport assets helped to offset earnings pressure in supply and sales. Central Europe, service and overhead costs were reduced substantially. And finally, across the Group, various opportunities to reduce procurement spend were implemented.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we stick to our timetable of delivering 800 million to 1 billon of improvement to adjusted EBIT in 2010 from this project. Not surprisingly, we are targeting to reach the upper end of that range after our strong results in 2009. The second pillar of our strategy is the prioritization of investments.</p>
          <p>We had planned to make some &#x20AC;10 billion of cash effective investments in 2009. However, the outcome is about one billion lower as we postponed some projects. We also participated in &#x20AC;2.8 billion of asset swaps made up of the 2.3 billion for Yuzhno Russkoye and the remainder for the asset swap with GDF SUEZ.</p>
          <p>For the period 2010 to 2012, we plan to invest &#x20AC;24 billion. The key priorities remain the same as before. Complete the pipeline of conventional new build projects, in addition to growth in renewables as well as in upstream gas. Overall with the exception of the 1billion of investments that had been moved to 2010, we are making only minor changes compared to our previous plan.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we plan to invest &#x20AC;6 billion. And we regard this figure as consistent with expected cash from operating activities, dividend payments and our leveraged target. This year a particularly large amount will be spent on the construction of conventional power plants.</p>
          <p>We plan to commission five to six CCGTs in Europe with an overall capacity of at least 3,800 megawatt. In Russia we will bring the 400 megawatt Shaturskaya CCGT into operation. And in the U.S. we will start Trimble County 2, a 750 megawatt coal-fired power plant of which we own 75%.</p>
          <p>In addition, we continue the expansion of our renewables business. In Europe, we will commission the Offshore Windparks Robin Rigg and the Rodsand 2, and in the U.S. the Onshore Windpark Papalote 2.</p>
          <p>The large investments of the previous years will increasingly pay off and contribute more significantly to adjusted EBIT in the years to come. To conclude our strategic priorities, let me turn to the streamlining of our portfolio. We had three objectives. The first one was to fulfill the commitments that we had made to the EU Commission to divest five gigawatt of generation capacity in Germany as well as our power transmission network.</p>
          <p>We closed the asset swap with GDF SUEZ in November, the asset swap with EDF and EnBW in December, and the sale of the Mehrum plant to Stadtwerke Hannover in January.</p>
          <p>The sale of transpower to TenneT was closed in February. We are confident to fulfill the commitment with regards to the remaining 265 megawatt of generation capacity within an adequate timeframe.</p>
          <p>The second objective is to simplify and focus the Group on the assets and activities where we can add the most value. Each and every asset of the Group will be reviewed in this respect. The swap of 2.9% of Gazprom stock for 25% in Yuzhno Russkoye will leverage our exploration and production business and bring us close to our target of producing 10 bcm of equity gas.</p>
          <p>In the course of the portfolio review, we concluded that the future development potential of Thuega within the E.ON Group is limited, and therefore decided to exit this business. The sale of the largest part of Thuega was completed in December last year and we plan to divest the remaining four stakes during the course of this year.</p>
          <p>Our third objective is to generate more than &#x20AC;10 billion of cash proceeds by the end of 2010. With the transactions completed in January and February, we have already obtained around 6 billion and are well on track to reach our overall objective.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, as this is my last conference call as CEO of E.ON, I would now like to use the opportunity to review some of the key development that the Group has taken during my tenure.</p>
          <p>When I joined as CEO, we were still experiencing the impact of the first stages of the liberalization of electricity and gas markets. Latent overcapacity in many power markets led to a collapse of power prices and margins in 2000 and 2001. From there on, power prices were rising, but from a very low base.</p>
          <p>E.ON had just carried out two transforming acquisitions, Powergen in mid 2002 and Ruhrgas in early 2003. What had been a conglomerate with a strong power business in Germany was rapidly becoming a leading international electricity and gas company.</p>
          <p>After these acquisitions, my first priority was to achieve a much tighter integration of the whole Group. Next to business integration, the integration of different cultures present across the Group was a key task for me. This is why we initiated the OneE.ON project, which is still ongoing.</p>
          <p>To further sharpen the profile of the Group towards electricity and gas, another priority was to complete the divestments of the non-core businesses. By 2006 we were ready to enter into a new phase. The European Commission was pushing an active agenda of European integration.</p>
          <p>The launch of the European Emissions Trading Scheme in 2005 triggered a movement towards convergence between the various European power markets. The EU and many European countries were providing attractive support for renewable energy, and many power and gas markets had started to tighten.</p>
          <p>All this opened new opportunities for E.ON. With the creation of the new unit E.ON Energy Trading, for example, we oriented our business model towards this increasing integration of the European markets.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we entered or expanded our presence in the Italian, French and Spanish markets. We participated in the privatization of OGK-4 in Russia, and thus acquired a first major position outside the mature markets of Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>And finally, the creation of our Climate and Renewables business within the general context to develop a cleaner generation business will have a lasting effect on the E.ON Group.</p>
          <p>After this strong expansion phase, we realized early the need for more focus on performance and streamlining from within the Group. The economic crisis that started in late 2008 and the accompanying pressure on prices only increased our conviction in this respect.</p>
          <p>The developments I just described on a strategic level are also clearly visible in our results. Adjusted EBIT has grown from 6.2 billion to 9.6 since 2003, altogether an increase of 55% or 8% per year on average.</p>
          <p>The capital employed has risen more slowly, 35% from 62 billion to &#x20AC;84 billion. As a result, return on capital employed has risen from 9.9 to 11.7 providing an attractive 2.6% spread above WACC. The recent decline in ROCE is largely due to our significant investments. We are, therefore, already planting the seeds for a profitable development in the years to come.</p>
          <p>We have always paid attention to the needs for long-term value creation. Since I started on May 1, 2003, the share price has almost doubled, which is an average annual growth of 10%. Furthermore, E.ON outperformed both the utilities sector as well as the German benchmark DAX.</p>
          <p>The dividend has grown by 14% a year on average from &#x20AC;0.67 per share to &#x20AC;1.50. Now, and one should not forget that we paid out a &#x20AC;2.8 billion special dividend in 2006 and bought &#x20AC;6.5 billion of our own shares in 2007 and 2008 as part of our policy to optimize E.ON's capital structure and therefore to reduce our cost of capital.</p>
          <p>To conclude, we have continuously tried to improve our performance and adapted to changing environments. Without doubt, the sector environment has become more difficult lately. However, with our expansion in new markets, our organic investments, we have planted the seeds for E.ON's next development phase. Already this year, the new markets had a substantial contribution to the Group's performance.</p>
          <p>I would like to finish by saying that I enjoyed the constant dialog with investors and analysts. The knowledgeable outsider views that you have on E.ON, its competitors and the whole sector is not always something easy to get from inside channels only. Interaction with the financial community has often helped me in keeping things in perspective.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now, I'd like to hand over to Marcus.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Wulf. Dear analysts and investors, 2009 was definitely a tricky year for our industry and for E.ON. Our results came out as targeted by us, but the economic crisis and in particular the gas market developments had a more severe impact than we had expected initially.</p>
          <p>We found measures to compensate for that so that our two main reporting metrics are in line with our outlook. With adjusted EBIT down 2% we are just at prior year level. And actually, if you adjust for pure translation effects, EBIT is basically flat.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income, down 5% is in line with the communicated range. Positive are the cash relevant metrics. Operating cash flow increases to now &#x20AC;9 billion. Economic net debt and our debt factor are slightly improved.</p>
          <p>Before jumping into the individual markets, you will let me give you an overview on the main items affecting EBIT on chart number two.</p>
          <p>First on the positives. New markets adding 800 million relative to 2008, which is a mixture of growth, first-time consolidation and two one-off effects.</p>
          <p>PerformtoWin is giving us 600 million. Here we are ahead of schedule. In particular, reducing marketing and professional services spend, selling excess gas storage and cost cutting in the UK retail business have been the main contributors.</p>
          <p>Power price effects were positive. Here we record 400 million on the outright power side, which is partly offset by 150 million lower spreads.</p>
          <p>On the negatives, 800 million we see as price and volume effect in Pan-European Gas. 500 million cost we incurred from the economic crisis. We have some volume losses, predominantly in Nordic, but those were planned. In particular, the outages of Oskarshamn 3 and Ringhals. And we have the aforementioned 150 million translation losses at the EBIT level.</p>
          <p>When you compare this with our expectations stated 12 months ago, we have the biggest delta under gas developments, which came even worse than anticipated. A higher crisis impact and actually some decline in the spread position, which I believe is partially also caused by the crisis. This is mostly compensated by higher efficiency improvement and, relative to our own prognosis, also better grid results.</p>
          <p>On chart three, which again is also just an overview, this allows me to highlight basically one item, and that is the impact from our organic investments. We have higher depreciation, particularly in Central Europe, and Climate and Renewables, where a lot of the CapEx resides. Hence, whilst EBIT is slightly down on a Group level, we see a slight improvement on the EBITDA side, which is up 1%.</p>
          <p>Let me on page four now start with Central Europe's regulated business. Here we see a 200 million improvement over the 2008 result, mainly because of the successful filing of the hardship case for the German TSO and better than expected distribution grid results due to good efficiently scores of our own networks.</p>
          <p>In the non-regulated business we have two consolidation effects. A positive one with the full-year consolidation of the French business SNET, and a negative one with 170 million Euro lost due to the disposal of power capacity. This latter effect is partially offset within results at the E.ON Energy trading level.</p>
          <p>On the operational side we have higher transfer prices to E.ON Energy Trading, cost cutting and a better gas retail result, which are more than offsetting lower power retail margins and the crisis effect.</p>
          <p>Let me now talk about the most challenging market unit of 2009. Basically all Pan-European Gas businesses are stable with the exception of the Gas Wholesale business. The regulated business is slightly up. The sub-segment Other is slightly down due to the deconsolidation of the Q4 results from Thuega, and also our Storage result is stable.</p>
          <p>In Gas Wholesale we suffered in particular from the loss of 78 terawatt hours translating into roughly 190 million EBIT decline. And we do see margin reductions due to price pressure, while in total 470 million, which includes a negative 90 million storage evaluation effect. You may remember that in Q4 of 2008 we reduced gas from storage, which had been bought at lower prices. Such effect could not be repeated in 2009.</p>
          <p>Noteworthy in this context is that within E.ON Energy Trading we have a positive effect of around 200 million from the short-term management of our gas oil position.</p>
          <p>On the Upstream side we benefit from Yuzhno Russkoye by almost 100 million, but realized lower prices in UK and Norway.</p>
          <p>Chart six shows you the volume effect in the Ruhrgas portfolio. 22 terawatt hours are lost due to the crisis. 28 we assigned to the increased competition in Germany. And the remainder is &#x2013; half of that is volume that is transferred to Energy Trading, and the other half is actually reduced international sales. Those losses were mainly incurred in the first half of 2009, as you can see on the chart.</p>
          <p>In Hungary we lost another 13 terawatt hours.</p>
          <p>As far as our minimum take obligation is concerned, we have a total prepayment, or we expect a total prepayment, of 190 million Euros for approximately 9 terawatt hours. Such payment has not yet been made given not all documents are yet signed. We plan to make up for those volumes in the coming years.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to the UK. Here adjusted EBIT is down 30%. Actually, on chart 25 in the backup, and you're familiar with that, we explain why in local currency and corrected for internal profit transfer to Energy Trading, UK actually outperformed the 2008 numbers.</p>
          <p>Given we have explained this now several times, so will only highlight that we continue to see an improvement in our retail results which by now is positive based on efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>We also do expect the 2010 numbers to be positive in retail, although not all efficiency improvements will yet have materialized in 2010.</p>
          <p>The total negative translation effects on EBIT from this market unit are 77 million Euros. This was clearly worse than expected. We are, however, to a large extent hedged at the net income level given our pound debt position.</p>
          <p>Over to Nordic on page eight. In Nordic the story has some similarities with our UK business.</p>
          <p>Reported result is down 31%. However, we have two extraordinary effects and translation losses that disturb the picture of the operational performance.</p>
          <p>We have a significant reduction in volumes in 2009 compared to the year before. 4 terawatt hours of hydro capacity have been transferred to Statkraft at the beginning of 2009. Another 5.5 terawatt hours are lower volumes on the nuclear side, which relate to the shutdown period for the upgrade of Oskarshamn 3 and to the planned revision of Ringhals.</p>
          <p>Translation losses in Nordic amount to 55 million. That together with the 77 million translation losses in the UK, we look at currency impact of about minus 1.5% on Group EBIT level. I just wanted to highlight that, because I believe it's a different quality of earning reduction than operational issues.</p>
          <p>Let me move to the U.S.. There's not a lot to add to chart number nine. The U.S. business more or less as always is stable. As flagged throughout the first quarter, the strong momentum of Q1 and Q2 has faded mainly due to the timing of fuel and gas cost recoveries.</p>
          <p>Over to chart number 10, E.ON Energy Trading is up almost 50% despite a lower result from prop trading. Corrected for the profit transfer from the UK, which is around 250 million, in particular in 2009, Energy Trading's optimization result is up almost 100 million compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight in this context that EET, and I think I mentioned that before in the context of Pan-European Gas, generated about 200 million additional gross margin on our gas oil position. In the past, such results would have shown as part of Pan-European Gas.</p>
          <p>On hedging, we continue to pursue basically our normal strategy. And the details you can see in the backup in terms of where our specific hedging levels are, so no need for me to highlight those on this call.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 11, in our New Markets units we record a significant increase in adjusted EBIT.</p>
          <p>Climate and Renewables are up, but less than expected, given the partial exposure to the U.S. merchant market we still have. Going forward, we will no longer invest into similar positions unless they come with long term PPAs.</p>
          <p>The cash situation, by the way, looks clearly better, given the first cash grants have been received.</p>
          <p>Russia is behind plan, despite ongoing cost measures. Here we are suffering from low wholesale prices.</p>
          <p>The increase in Spain and Italy is mainly a function of full versus half year consolidation. And in the case of Italy, we have a 210 million positive effect from the renegotiation of long-term power contracts that we have successfully renegotiated in Q2 of 2009. This concludes the EBIT review per market unit.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to the items below the EBIT line on page 12.</p>
          <p>Interest result is down 340 million, and there are two reasons. The average financial indebtedness is up. Don't forget, during the course of 2008 we only gradually increased our indebtedness. And we continue to replace commercial paper with longer data financing in 2009.</p>
          <p>For 2010 we expect a slight further decline, given lower commercial paper volumes for the full-year 2010 versus full-year 2009, and actually also lower construction period interest.</p>
          <p>Net book gains, here in 2009 we record 2.4 billion from our 5 gigawatt asset swaps and sales, and 1.8 billion related to the swap of gas from shares. In 2008, just as a reminder, we had about 1.1 billion related to the Statkraft asset swap.</p>
          <p>Other non-operating earnings increased mainly because of the 3.3 billion mark-to-market increase in the derivative valuation. In addition, you will recall 2008 was burdened by 3.3 billion impairment charges.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 13. My only comment on this page is that the 2008 tax rate was substantially higher because of the tax treatment, or actually lack thereof, of the goodwill impairment charges. As a reference point, we do expect our tax rate normally to fall into a range of between 25 and 27%.</p>
          <p>Chart 14 gives you the technical explanation for the adjusted net income. Main reason for the higher percentage decline of adjusted net income when compared to adjusted EBIT, are basically base effects. Net income is lower, and lower than EBIT and the weaker interest result.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to the operating cash flow at Group level. On page 15, you can see that operating cash flow is up 30%. And let me talk you through the main effects here.</p>
          <p>EBITDA, as mentioned before, is up 140 million. Relative to 2008, the 2009 EBITDA is burdened by a number of non-cash items such as higher provisions, in particular on the HR side. These effects amount to 350 million.</p>
          <p>With the Italian power contract in 2009 and the non-cash effective valuation of CO2 certificates in Spain and Italy in 2008, we need to eliminate a further 430 million that were pure valuation effect when you compare the two years.</p>
          <p>Interest payments were up. The EU fine in the MEGAL case is an exceptional item with negative impact on operating cash flow in 2009. And now basically all the other effects of working capital improvements. This was a special emphasis for us in 2009.</p>
          <p>The context of the Group-wide effort to reduce working capital, we achieved substantial improvements. Some of those admittedly, and we estimate this to be around 40%, are price related. Pan-European Gas and part of the UK improvement in particular, but most of the improvements do represent operational improvements.</p>
          <p>In the case of Energy Trading, we did not repeat physical year end purchase of CO2 certificates for 800 million as we did in 2008.</p>
          <p>Let me now move to another metric on page 16, which we would like to report also going forward, funds from operations.</p>
          <p>FFO, defined as operating cash flow before working capital changes, provide the measure for the Company's sustainable cash flow generation. We expect the rating agencies to adjust for two additional items of special nature. There is on the one hand the roughly 550 million EU fine in the MEGAL case paid in October 2009. And then we have 480 million tax payments that relate to the period '97 until 2003. Both items have extraordinary characteristics, or relate to totally different time periods than our 2009 operating cash flow.</p>
          <p>Over to investments. Economically, we reduced investments in 2009 relative to 2008 by 50%. With 12 billion, this is however still a very high level. During 2009 we managed to reduce or postpone spend by around 1 billion compared to our investment target for the year. As Wulf highlighted to you, for the coming three years, we plan to invest &#x20AC;24 billion with 10 this year, eight in 2011 and then six in 2012.</p>
          <p>We consider five to &#x20AC;6 billion in normal run rate that allows for some growth. As we have been stating throughout the year 2009, our focus clearly is the execution of the existing project pipeline without adding new ones.</p>
          <p>Over to chart 18. Our economic net debt was slightly reduced to &#x20AC;44.7 billion. Together with the mild increase in EBITDA, we managed to reduce our debt factor to 3.3 times. It is our clear target to take it down to three times or even below.</p>
          <p>There is one technical detail you should be aware of when analyzing this chart. We moved 1.7 billion of financial assets that so far were recorded on balance sheet into our German CTA. This led to a reduction of the non-current securities on the one hand, and to provision for pension on the other hand by the same amount of &#x20AC;1.7 billion, i.e. it was economic net debt neutral.</p>
          <p>Pension provisions increased by 1 billion due to low &#x2013; &#x20AC;1 billion due to lower interest rates.</p>
          <p>Chart 19 reconciles the development of the economic net debt, starting with the 2008 number. It is basically self-explanatory. Please be mindful of three issues. First, investment obviously only considers the cash relevant part, i.e. it adjusts for the non-cash asset swap for Yuzhno Russkoye, hence to 9.2 billion. But the expense does not yet include the proceeds from the TSO sale, which closed in February of 2010. And the change in pension provision is the aforementioned 1 billion. Again, you do not find the increase immediately on chart 18 because the 1 billion increase is netted against the 1.7 billion additional off-balance sheet funding in our German CTA.</p>
          <p>With the following chart 20, we want to give you some guidance on our interest rate policy. Let me start with a few basic beliefs. Our business is based on very long term assets, and it's not short term cyclical. Funding at variable rates, therefore, does not provide a natural hedge for business risk. Hence we should allocate risk capital to our commodity business and not to interest rates.</p>
          <p>As of December 2009, we had an average interest rate on gross debt of 4.5%, 88% of financial liabilities with fixed rates and an average duration of almost seven years.</p>
          <p>Now to the topic of the 2010 outlook. We expect adjusted EBIT to increase by nil to 3% over the 2009 level. This takes into account the adjustment of 1 billion relative to our previous 11 billion 2010 target for portfolio measures we initiated in 2009, including the sale of the remaining Thuega assets.</p>
          <p>As always, we provide you with a range to account for uncertainties in the business projection.</p>
          <p>Let me just highlight that to adjust the inherent growth, please be mindful of the fact that when you compare 2010 with 2009, really 10% of EBIT has been disposed. Still we do see a slight increase, zero to 3% for 2010.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net income is targeted to come out in line with the 2009 level. This is slightly more conservative than our EBIT projection, due to the foreseeable increase in interest expense and a slightly higher assumed tax rate. For sake of clarity, as was the case in the past, we translate in line with minus three to plus 3%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide we highlight a few major items to be considered in the context of our guidance. The impact from disposals is in total around 1 billion, of which about 100 million already materialized in 2009. Again, this assumes also the sale of the remaining Th&#xFC;ga assets in 2010.</p>
          <p>PerformtoWin targets to add another 400 million of savings in addition to what was already achieved in 2009.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before, our outright power position will provide an upside of 700 million over the 2009 levels. In this context, let me also highlight the specific power price assumptions for 2010, given our hedge position, are actually fairly meaningless for our business.</p>
          <p>There will of course be further up and down sides which we expect to more or less be balanced. Clearly, we continue to see highest uncertainty in our gas wholesale position. On the other hand the impact from the economic crisis, including currency effects, might come out better compared to 2009.</p>
          <p>Let me finally comment on some of our reporting segments. Central Europe, we expect to be in line with 2009. Here additional capacity, some transfer price effects and an assumed lower impact from the crisis offset the disposal impacts. Pan-European Gas will come down. We sold Thuega and in 2010 this has a negative effect of around 300 million. Gastransport will come down by around 200 million due to regulation. Yuzhno Russkoye will be included for the full year, which gives us an upside of around 100 to 150 million based on today's market prices relative to 2009.</p>
          <p>The supply and sales business will continue to be under pressure. A chief price reduction will be needed to manage the results in this business. UK will improve based on the efficiency measures and slightly better grid tariffs. In Nordic, and I believe I mentioned that before, we will benefit from a volume increase on the nuclear side.</p>
          <p>Our Energy Trading result will improve in 2010. The lion's share of the locked in outright power effect for the full year resides with Energy Trading.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks and now we are ready to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Thank you very much. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Bobby Chada from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Mr. Chada.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Bobby Chada from Morgan Stanley. I just had two questions, if I may. The first is on working capital. Just to clarify slide 15 and some of the comments that you made. Should we assume that effectively all of this improvement is sustainable in 2010 and beyond? It doesn't appear that any of it is likely to reverse back, so I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the UK business, you made some positive comments about retail margins. I wondered if you could just give a sort of qualitative feel for where you think retail margins are relative to your through cycle aspirations in 2009 and in 2010 after your recent tariff cuts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Bobby. On working capital when you add it all up I believe it's roughly 3.5 billion. And, as I highlighted, of that there are price effects which are maybe around 40% of that number. So obviously, those can reverse depending on where prices go. We could also see another positive impact in case prices go further down but that's sort of the less plannable number. The remainder is truly an operational improvement which we do expect to have a lasting impact.</p>
          <p>On UK, the retail business, as you've been following, we managed to kind of turn into a profitable situation starting in Q3 with a mildly positive result in Q4. We do expect further improvements in 2010. But given we are still in the middle of the project of implementing efficiency measures, on <mark type="inaudible" /> basis, 2010 will not yet be the sustainable level and we are hence targeting in 2010 further improvements when you compare '11 with '10.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Chris Rogers from ICAP. Please go ahead, Mr. Rogers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. Two questions. Firstly, you provide as usual your charts at the beginning of Dr. Bernotat's discussions about the gas price. Previously you've talked about having a conviction that recoupling will occur. Do you still think that that will be the case and, if so, over what sort of time period do you think that will occur?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in the charts you put a squiggly line next to the numbers for PerformtoWin. Does that suggest that you potentially can go beyond &#x20AC;1.5 billion or is that just to indicate it may be &#x2013; it could be plus or minus 100 million, so it's just a rounding thing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the first one was on our view on the gas market and the development and the chances for a recoupling. Well, it's of course a difficult one quite honestly because nobody knows what the market developments will be, especially what the demand side will be in the future and that depends to a large extent, as everybody knows, on the overall economic recovery of major economies, especially the German one.</p>
          <p>And you can see from many statistics &#x2013; I've seen recently in the German Industry Association that for Europe, and also including Germany, there is an expectation that the economies will grow by between 1.5, 1.6 to 2% this year. So that will have an impact. Will it be enough to lead to this recoupling? That obviously depends on the supply side. We will see those additional volumes in the form of LNG moving towards Europe or not. Our view is that we will have a rather difficult market going forward for one to two years at least.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On PerformtoWin I'm not exactly sure which dotted line you are referring to, Chris.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In Dr. Bernotat's slides. I think just to check it's on, yeah, on slide six, you have &#x2013; where you have 1,500. You have a small line next to it. So it's approximately 1,500. Is that kind of plus or minus 100 million, or is that because you haven't yet finalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the more correct interpretation, but let me maybe say the following. We're obviously pleased with the progress which we could make in 2009 and, as stated here, we came out better than expected at the beginning of the year. Admittedly some of that was also necessary to make up for the developments on the gas side. As we highlighted a few months ago, we also have rolled out the project now into the New Markets unit. And I believe we mentioned back then that we are now even more certain that we will meet the 1.5 billion target. I would like to leave it with that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. My question is on the gas business. The &#x2013; you talked about the share of spot having doubled. Could you give us a feel for what portion of the gas supply is now based on spot prices and whether or not your outlook for the year 2010 is actually reflecting a negative gas supply margin or whether or not that number is still positive? And finally, the prepayment that you've mentioned, Dr. Schenck, for 2009, is that &#x2013; can we take that figure as what you'd expect also for 2010 or are you expecting the prepayments to increase?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. First of all, Deborah, it's not Dr. Schenck.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Professor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the prepayments, I believe I was reminded that I probably misquoted the prepayment number. The number we expect, just for sake of clarity, is 120 million, 120. Sascha reminded me that apparently I mentioned 119, which was incorrect. So it's 120. That is the number that relates to volumes for 2009. And that is for both Hungary and the Ruhrgas portfolio. Obviously, we do not have a &#x2013; we do not expect that number to dramatically increase in 2010. As we mentioned before, there's flexibility we have in the contracts, so we also do not expect the material prepayment figure for the current year. As far as the spot share is concerned, given we are still in final negotiations, we don't really want to hand out a specific number. Clearly still, the lion's share of the contracted volume will be linked to the oil price. We are- when we say double, we go sort of into the high teens with the spot share that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and on the outlook, is that reflecting a negative supply margin already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I missed that one. No, for 2010, we are not assuming a negative sales and supply margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Lueder Schumacher from UniCredit. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Two questions. One is also on your outlook. I just wondered if you could perhaps quantify the likely impact of Oskarshamn 3. Not only the absence of the outage, i.e. the higher nuclear volumes because of the absence of the outage, but also the benefit you stand to get from the capacity upgrade, so there should be sort of a double impact that should be quite positive. The second question is on power prices. Forward curve is now roughly where it was 12 months ago when the economic situation was somewhat different than it is now. What is your view of why that is the case, and, even more importantly, what is going to move the curve out of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think I missed the second part. On the first question, Oskarshamn, the upgrade gives us 1 terawatt hours more. When you look &#x2013; when you then compare '10 with '09, we have, in total, around 6 terawatt hours more in terms of production. And then take off that, roughly half is hedged and the other half is not. And with that, I think you can do the math almost yourself, what it gives you as additional.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And on the second question was really referring to the German forward curve, which is not exactly at very ambitious levels at the moment. Some could say quite depressed. Why do you think that is the case? Are you not seeing the industrial or manufacturing demand picking up beyond the first few months? Would we need to see some more confidence there to see the curve lifting up, or is all that's required that the containment in the coal forwards holds? What's going to improve the situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, when you look at what happened in the last 10 weeks, then I would say the two main events we saw was that the gas forward curve, albeit it is not a terribly liquid curve, came down and at the same time, we saw the power prices drop. So maybe there is some connection between those two events. Now what is going to drive this up? You've mentioned it yourself. One item clearly is more evidence of power demand picking up. It was mentioned that we are seeing first signs of recovery. Actually, we started to see those in November. But I think there is more confidence now required that that is really sustainable, and we're not going to see another drop back in the coming months. And that's what I think will leave us most likely with another few months of uncertainty. Once we're through with the first half of the year and we actually have seen, and this is not speculative, an increase in demand, our assessment would be that that should then also start to have a positive impact on the forward curve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, very simply on the Gas business. In the third quarter you gave kindly an indication on the EBIT contribution from gas storage. Would you be prepared to do that for the full year as well? And secondly, linking into the last question from Lueder as well, in terms of the market development overall and with the capacity you bring to the market, which others bring to the market on the electricity side, do you think that there's no need for any mothballing or taking some capacity out of the market given that from the demand level we have seen in 2008, it will take quite a while, as you said yourself, to get back to these levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First on the Storage, Storage is a fairly stable business per year typically giving us some 350 to 450 million, and in that range is also the 2010 &#x2013; sorry, the 2009 result. As far as the situation in the power market is concerned, I don't know. Wulf, do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the second one, on the capacity side, well we have seen recently the update of the dena study, which is the German Energy Agency. And this study, which was an update of the first version, concluded that we will see &#x2013; still see a supply gap, a capacity gap, coming, emerging as from 2015. And that means there are apparently so many projects that have been postponed or have been canceled that the ones that are under construction like some of ours are just enough to make up for the retirement of old capacity. And we are not planning to mothball our units.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so as you said, 2015, but that's nearly five years or four years away. What is the rationale in saying there is no need to do anything between now and then? Is it too costly or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the time we will see a supply gap emerging. That means there's no reserve capacity left in the system and that means up till that time, we see a rather balanced situation. No oversupply and no undersupply either. So it's a gradual development which goes hand in hand with the retirement of some of the units. So I don't see, or we don't see in the market a situation of oversupply and therefore pressure on our prices.</p>

          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Peter Wirtz from WestLB. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. I have two question also. The first one is on the political situation in Germany. So in terms of the discussion with the government regarding the nuclear issue, is there anything which &#x2013; what could we expect to happen before October? So for example, in terms of passing on some of the nuclear capacity from older to newer power stations or anything other what we should have in mind?</p>
          <p>And the second question regarding your guidance for 2010 in terms of EBIT, between zero and plus 3%. So there's a delta of 300 million. Is this mainly coupled with the question marks regarding the prolonged strength of German nuclear power stations and the gas business, or are there other issues which you should have in mind here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, let me start with the first one on the situation of the potential extension of the life of German nuclear stations. The government is committed to resolve that issue within the framework of the planned energy program, which has to be worked out between now and October. And it was just confirmed over the weekend by Chancellor Merkel that that is the plan and that we will see no decision long before that date. So, I'm sure that we will have a solution because that was confirmed by her. And in principle, that could include all nuclear stations, all existing ones. So there is no talk about one or two have to be closed as a symbol.</p>
          <p>And the issue you addressed with the, let's say, specifically two stations owned by RWE and EnBW, Biblis A and Neckarwestheim, there, there is an expectation in government circles that that issue should be resolved by the industry itself. So, there is no government decision that can be expected short-term. But there is an expectation that the industry will solve it and there are some talks underway to find out whether there is a solution possible here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Peter, on your second question. I think- we are a roughly 10 billion EBIT company, and we provide a target with a certainty of &#x2013; an uncertainty of 300 million, which I would say in the context of a 10 billion number is a fairly narrow range. Now whilst we have a reasonably well-plannable business, not exactly everything is known on January 1 for how the full year is going to develop. So, there will always be some uncertainty. And we are providing that range just to highlight, yes, there are some things that may turn out better, may turn out worse than we currently anticipate.</p>
          <p>And you saw it last year. I mean, we had a much bigger decline in the gas business and also a higher impact from the crisis. We were pushing the businesses to accelerate PerformtoWin to make up for that. But still there's always going to be some one or two percentage points up or down. Take the translation losses in 2009. We didn't plan exactly for the weak &#x2013; for the degree of weakening in the pound and the Swedish Kroner. But there will always be this uncertainty. And that is the reason why we are providing a range.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's not linked to the nuclear issue. I mean, on this one in particular, but as far as at least the one power plant or the two power plants is concerned, they have stated what their assumptions are in terms of when these will come back and we have no other views on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. The next question comes from Mr. Per Lekander from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have three questions. The first one on CapEx mid-term, you're talking about six billion. Is this a trough number or is that something which you think could be ongoing and if so how do you see that consistent with your three times net debt to EBITDA and 50 to 60% payout ratio? To me you will de-gear significantly if that's the level.</p>
          <p>And second, on the gas business, just to be a bit clear here. You have previously said that you, in 2008, made something like 900 million on the wholesale import business into Germany and that it would go down to 100, and perhaps that you could do like half the 2008 number in a mid-term perspective. Is that something you still think is possible?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on CO2, can you tell us a bit on what you're seeing on the CO2 market because power demand is down five, 6% and emissions are down more. I think I saw 8.7% for Germany, and gas prices are very, very low, to me. That should bode for a very significant downsize on CO2 prices. Is that something you fear for?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Per, welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question, I highlighted that a normal run rate for us would be five to six billion on the CapEx side allowing for some growth. And just rough numbers, maintenance CapEx in our case will be at around 1.5 plus something. And then replacement CapEx is probably around two, 2.5, so there's some growth embedded in that.</p>
          <p>Your analysis is right. Mid-term, if we stick to the five to six billion, that will, given where the dividend is today, will lead to some de-gearing. Given where I said I would not necessarily mind that. And I think we also need to be aware of the fact that going forward there will likely be other businesses that will develop where we then want to be positioned to also take our share in that. With that, don't misinterpret what I'm saying. I'm not referring to M&amp;A. But I think also organically, a number of things are developing in our business that we need to be mindful of.</p>
          <p>On the second question, which I understand to be around what is a sustainable supply and sales margin. I think we said before there is &#x2013; and now we can debate whether you should add 50 million to that or deduct it or what not, but a number at around 300 million is, over the cycle, what we would consider to be a normal profitability in that business excluding the storage results.</p>
          <p>On CO2, look, we can always speculate around why is the market where it is and why isn't it moving the way some rationale would suggest. We do not see exactly a major downside in the CO2 prices, nor do we actually see a major risk that it will suddenly increase. We expect it to be basically fairly stable as we move forward, in particular because banking will allow us to move the certificates also into the next &#x2013; or beyond the next two period. But we have no specific view as to a severe downside in that commodity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last point, on the banking aspect, is that something you're doing in terms of intentionally of banking into phase III in order to make it more smooth, the movement into not getting any free allowances?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't want to comment on specific positions we take in the market. My main statement would be we predominantly look at CO2 the same way we look at when we think about coal, i.e., when we sell dark spreads we sell power and at the same time hedge the coal and the CO2 lag. That's how we think about it. We're not a prop trader, at least not a major prop trader in CO2.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Which basically, if you now take a view, I think CO2 is very cheap, let's go for it and buy it large time, that is prop trading.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Next question comes from Vincent De Blic from Cazenove. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Three questions. Two on Gas, one on Trading. First on Gas. You mentioned sales up 16% in January and February. I was wondering whether you could be a bit more precise about the impact from the weather and what do you think can be an underlying growth more linked to any recovery? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second one, on upstream you seem quite pleased about the earnings outlook. Could you maybe quantify a bit the potential trajectory in 2011 &#x2013; 2012 <mark type="inaudible" /> to see more details on the pricing of the Skarv-Idun output if possible? And the third question is probably more for Marcus. Is it possible to have a rough breakdown of the Energy Trading EBIT by division? I mean trying to understand what the difference is between the active prices and transfer prices mean on a divisional basis for Trading? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the last question first, no we're not providing that. And key reason for that quite frankly is the reasons why we have bundled our Trading activities is because we are increasingly commingling those portfolios, because we look at it really from a European perspective. And it's not that we have simply moved the UK traders in one room and then rented a room in the same building where all the German traders are sitting. There is more inter-activity and books can no longer be exactly allocated to the original origin. And hence, we're not saying, hey, this is the EBIT contribution that stems from the CE portfolio and that's the one that stems from the UK portfolio.</p>
          <p>The only item I could highlight was that on the gas oil position, 200 million is roughly the result that was achieved in 2009, which in a way mentally one can add to the sales and supply business of Ruhrgas. That's on your third question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a rule of thumb, is it good to understand that the achieved price lags the transfer price, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you're very difficult to understand. Achieved price lags the transfer price?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As a rule of thumb is it &#x2013; as far as the transfer price with the &#x2013; before the actual output is sold and therefore the active price will be lagging it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is exactly correct. That is a function of our transfer price. In T minus three years, T being the delivery date of the physical power, we transfer throughout the year the entire volume and then price it. And obviously when all the volume has been handed over, not all &#x2013; from the producing market unit to Energy Trading, not all the volume has yet been sold into the market and hence you're absolutely right. The achieved price will always lag the transfer price. And that can go both ways. That's one of the reasons why in 2010 you were seeing a very strong result in Energy Trading and likely in 2011 it will go the other direction. So I believe that was your third question.</p>
          <p>On the second question, the Gas upstream result, in 2011 we will see a full year Yuzhno Russkoye and we will see for, I believe, the second half of the year also Skarv-Idun. Or only the fourth quarter of 2011 Skarv-Idun starts producing. And in 2012, both these fields will be available for the full year. So you will see an increase from '10 to '11 and then a further very significant increase from '11 until '12. The reason being that Skarv-Idun will reach platform production very, very early on and in the beginning you have a lot of oil. So the oil share is higher than the gas share in the beginning and hence the profitability in the first years of Skarv-Idun is going to be very high. Does that answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the gas share will be marketed on what price basis?</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have. Not for this year but that our IR team can provide you with that. But for last year remember that, starting in October, that weather adjusted the gas sales volumes increased by 6% until the end of the year. So that means that this is a sign of an economic recovery, of a demand pick up in the industry. But that's the figure for last year but for this year we probably have to provide you with some more details.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one relates to your assets under construction. How much value is included in your balance sheet and net debt of assets under construction? I remember a figure of nearly &#x20AC;10 billion you mentioned at the last analyst conference. Could you give us an update on that? And specifically, also, how much earnings contribution out of that you expect from newly commissioned power plants in 2010 because I'm missing a hint of that in your full year outlook?</p>
          <p>Second question, just very shortly, you mentioned that you have a little bit more flexibility in your long term procurement contracts now, especially related to higher share of spot price and also a little bit more flexibility in terms of volumes. Could you please indicate whether that is for 2010 and '11 only, or whether that is really a sustainable change in your existing long term contracts? And whether that higher spot share will also remain once we have again a recoupling of spot and long-term contract prices? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Assets under construction, what's the exact number in the balance sheet? Before I just guess it, I think we mentioned 10 in October. So my assessment would be it's around 11.5 by now, but we would confirm that. But that's where I would estimate it to be. On the impact of new stations for 2010, when you look into the details the one that will be added is, in particular, Irsching 5 with 430 megawatt. It's in France, Emile Huchet with 860 megawatts. Both these being CCGTs, and then I believe Malzenice might also make it to the finish line at year end with another 430 megawatt <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>What the exact impact of those for the year 2010 is, honestly I don't think it's going to be very significant. It's a number I estimate to be below 100 million. The reason being that this is very much back end loaded i.e. it's more at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just asked because in the slide seven of Dr. Bernotat's presentation there is the total amount of almost 4 gigawatt CCGTs in Europe and also the other plants in Russia and U.S. Midwest. So that has only an earnings impact of approximately 100 million.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, yes. Benjamin Leyre from Exane. First question regarding credit agencies, do you think they will be patient enough to wait one or two years for you to decrease net debt over EBITDA ratio? And related to this, you mention in your annual report the possibility of a capital increase. Is it an option that you're seriously considering today? And the second question on Russia, what do you expect will be the precise rules of capacity payment in Russia and when do you think these rules will be implemented? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. No, capital increase is not exactly what we plan for. It's mentioned as a conceptual instrument in our report. But nothing like that is on our agenda. As far as the rating agencies is concerned, we are in close and constant dialogue with them, they are aware of our plans. We, I believe, clearly made some very strong &#x2013; we made strong proof of our commitments by having completed six of the targeted 10 billion of disposals in 2009. We have a strong commitment to do the rest, that is known by the agencies and hence I have no reason to believe that they're going to change their view on our company.</p>
          <p>As far as Russia is concerned, rules for the market, clearly what is right now being discussed, or not discussed, is, what is needed is the final prices for the capacity market for new power plants and existing power plants. There are draft numbers that exist. I think the intention is within the next two months, that I believe was put in that to finalize this.</p>
          <p>Now a personal remark, we've seen some delays there in the past so don't nail us on the two months. I can only quote what the Russian government has said, publicly said. So we do expect with the mid of this year to have absolute clarity on what the exact prices in the capacity market will be.</p>

Does this have any impact on the projection concerning the contribution of the new build capacities have to the Group EBIT or EBITDA number in 2015, which has been said to be additional 1.2 billion in terms of EBIT and &#x20AC;1.8 billion in terms of EBITDA. So is there any impact to be expected from that side? And the second question concerning the guidance 2010. You said that there's &#x2013; that you had a good start in the year due to the cold weather condition. Is this already reflected in your guidance?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first question no impact because on the Capital Market day we were referring to the projects that are either already under construction or in a very advanced project phase. So no changes to that resulting from this CapEx plan that we highlighted today. As far as 2010 is concerned, the good &#x2013; obviously we do reflect all information we have to date in our guidance for the full year, so including what we saw on the gas side in January and February.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions. One is on the guidance for 2010 in Central Europe. What are your assumptions on volumes of generation with coal and nuclear that you have included in the 2010 guidance? And the second question is if you could tell me what was the EBIT of Transmission and Ruhrgas in 2009? And a thought &#x2013; I think you just said an ongoing EBIT for Ruhrgas would &#x20AC;300 million. Maybe I just misunderstood. And in the midterm, so what do you mean by mid-term? Is it going to be &#x20AC;300 million up to 2011 or 2020? I don't know. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last one Alberto, the 300 million I quoted was the &#x2013; over the cycle the results, the annual results that the Supply and Sales business should achieve. So not all of Ruhrgas. Excluding Storage okay? So that's point one. Then on the Gas Transportation results in 2009, it's around 400 million.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question. The next question comes from Ingo Becker from Kepler Capital Markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I've got two questions. The first on your pretty narrow guidance of nil to 3%. Can you say whether relative to last year your own internal visibility on your full year results at this time of the year has increased? And my second question is on the disposed, or the to be disposed of EBIT this year which you said is 0.9 billion and I understand including the remainder of Thuega 1 billion. You have said before that you would dispose of 5.8 billion in net debt. I guess that figure including Thuega probably is around, I don't know, 6 billion. And the question here is, is that very similar or equal to the economic net debt that you will be disposing of or will that be significantly different from that figure? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, the disposal number, the 0.9 we are mentioning in the 2010 guidance, maybe I am misinterpreting what you said. This is not additional EBIT we are selling. That is the exact same number we've been talking about now for months. And the only thing that basically we add in our guidance is the assumption that we will manage to also sell the remaining position in those Thuega assets that we have retained so far. So that takes you from 900 million to 1 billion roughly.</p>
          <p>The impact on the economic net debt is similar. So the 6 billion is also roughly the &#x2013; you saw that on the &#x2013; one of the slides that I was mentioning. That's basically here &#x2013; equity values are more or less enterprise values. Okay.</p>
          <p>Then on the &#x2013; on your first question whether we have more visibility on 2010 than we had on 2009. I mean, honestly, I could realistically only answer that question in 12 months, because we don't know what exactly is going to happen during the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>As you will remember when we exactly one year ago highlighted that our sector would be impacted by the economic crisis, everyone, the nice people were laughing at us, and others were screaming at us because no one believed that that could be the case.</p>
          <p>I think the year has proven that none of the utilities is immune to what's happening in the rest of the real economy. Now as we mentioned before, we have a sense, but obviously no certainty, that we've seen the worst months of the economic crisis. So in that sense I would say we may be having slightly more visibility than was the case 12 months ago.</p>
          <p>The only other item that I think maybe has more uncertainty today than what we thought was the case 12 months ago is the Gas Wholesale business where we had certainly not expected 12 months ago what was going to happen during 2009.</p>
          <p>This opening between the prices under the long term contracts and the spot prices, we had not anticipated that on March 10, 2009. We have more &#x2013; we definitely have visibility on this today and there's admittedly some uncertainty as to how quickly will that go away. So that's the one area where I would say there is maybe more uncertainty today than 12 months ago. But other than that, we feel more comfortable with the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just one brief question on the renegotiation of the gas contracts. You said that some had already been finalized in terms of the renegotiation. Could you give us the percentage of your long term contract portfolio by volume that has actually already been finalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The three major partners are in that order Gazprom, Gazterra. They together represent roughly 70% to 75% of the portfolio. Bear with me a second, I can also give you the detailed numbers. In 2009 we sourced from Russia, so that is basically exclusively Gazprom, we do source 27%. The number is similar for Norway. And then from Holland, we do source roughly 15%. So the total number is then 65, if I am not mistaken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All of those have been finalized in terms of the changes to the contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not all of those. Three have been finalized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what percentage of the total portfolio has been finalized?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>90% of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And there are in total &#x2013; so the entire portfolio there's about 80% that are under renegotiation. Of that 80%, some 65% to 70 percentage points are related to the three parties Gazprom, Statoil and Gazterra. And of those three, and these are various contracts, around 90% are finalized.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Kuplent. [Credit Suisse] Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hi it's Chris from Credit Suisse. I've got a question on your disposal program. The 4 billion that you've got left to go to meet your 10 billion target, does that mean you still plan to get there during 2010, because earlier on I think you said you think you've got time, another 12 to 24 months to get your debt factor below 3.</p>
          <p>And a follow-on to that is how big of a difference do you think it would make to your cost of debt if you didn't sell any more assets from here?</p>
          <p>And another question I've got for Dr. Bernotat, if I may. You've shown us a quite impressive dividend growth chart with double digit average growth rates, and I wonder what you can say &#x2013; how much dividend growth your successor you think is likely to provide us over his tenure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with the last one, which of course is something you can only guess and I am really unable to do so. I only think that the business environment may be tougher going forward generally speaking, and those figures which we achieved during my tenure are probably a bit difficult to match in terms of growth. But this is speculation, so I should rather not speculate. He will do his best.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Chris on your two questions, I interpret the second part of your second what if we were downgraded would be the impact on our interest costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I highlighted the &#x2013; on this chart on our interest rate policy what our exact position is. So in reality, the impact today would not be significant. Having said that, this is absolutely not what we are targeting. On your very first question, yes we do indeed contemplate to achieve our 10 billion disposal target until the end of this year. So as you rightfully mentioned, another four to go.</p>
          <p>That will not necessarily yet take us below three times leverage. Just poor numbers taking operating cash flow, take the 2009 number of nine add four of 4 billion of proceeds from disposals, knock off 10 billion CapEx and 3 billion in dividends and so far economic net debt has not yet changed. So we will look at a 12 to 24 month period to take it to three times or below.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as the first question was concerned I was actually just wondering whether you could comment on your 4.5% average cost of debt in a sort of theoretical world, being one or two notches lower down on the credit rating. What do you think that would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an irrelevant question for us. In today's environment we would probably not incur such a significant increase in costs. The &#x2013; our spreads might widen by some 20, 30 bps but not more. But again the real impact on our interest cost would be much lower because we have &#x2013; we have basically locked in fixed rates for quite a long time period.</p>
          <p>But I really want to make sure that any of my statements are never being misinterpreted. It is our clear target to maintain our rating and we are doing what is necessary to fix that. And no, capital increase is not part of that.</p>
