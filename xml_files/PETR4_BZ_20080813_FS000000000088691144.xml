          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Petrobras conference call to discuss the second quarter 2008 results. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>Today with us we have Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa, CFO and IR Officer and his staff. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Theodore Helms, Investor Relations Executive Manager of Petrobras, who has some additional comments. Please go ahead Mr. Helms.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss second quarter 2008 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that can be accessed at the site, www.petrobras.com.br/ir/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the slide two. We my make forward-looking statements, which are identified by the use of the words, will, expect and similar that are based on the belief and assumptions of Petrobras's management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras's results prepared in accordance with Brazilian GAAP. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations Officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to be here with you and have this opportunity to talk about the second quarter results.</p>
          <p>Let me begin by quickly highlighting our record income for the period. Net income totaled R$8.8 billion for the second quarter, an increase of 20% from the prior period. EBITDA increased by 31% from the first quarter of 2008 to reach  R$18.1 billion. Higher price, increasing production and cost discipline all contributed to the record earnings.</p>
          <p>The cash flow generated continues to be the foundation for integrated books in accordance with our long-term business plan. We are reviewing the plan, which we expect to complete in October. At that time, we'll share with you our expectations for the future.</p>
          <p>Let's now go to slide three to look at the national oil and natural gas production. Oil production in Brazil grew by 2% mainly from the continuing hand back of P-52 and P-54. And the completion of new wells in the Alba corridor <mark type="inaudible" />. Production from the new systems and wells more than offset natural decline from a <mark type="inaudible" />. For the reminder of the year, P-52 and P-54 will continue to provide most of the production goals, as they achieved their peak capacity of 108,000 barrels per day.</p>
          <p>For the rest of the year we have clean water platform coming onstream P-51 and P-53 and FPSO Cidade de Vit&#xF3;ria, adding a new total of new capacity production of 460,000 barrels of oil per day. Natural gas contributed substantially to the production growth, increasing 6% during the quarter.  This additional production was mainly in non-associated gas from the Manati fields in the Espirito Santa Basin, and associated gas from the new production system in Campos Basin.</p>
          <p>It is worth mentioning that later this year we expect to begin producing from Lagosta, Canapu and</p>
          <p>Camarupim fields,  adding some additional 10 million cubic meters, equivalent to 60,000 barrels of oil per day. For the rest of the year, as you know we have a target of 1.95 million barrels of oil produced in Brazil, with a range of plus or minus 2.5%. We expect to meet the bottom range of these targets, as stagnants in the entire supply chain is causing delays in some of our day-to-day activities. So when the unexpected occurs which inevitably happens, solutions can be reached from the delay because of the lack of spare capacity in the industry. These delays in turn can reduce our average production for the year relative to our projected goal.</p>
          <p>Let's go to slide four please, and look at the new drilling rigs. Our average production is also temporarily hampered by an insufficient number of drilling rigs to do all the exploration, operation and development and maintenance we would like. Fortunately our fleet will be increasing substantially in the near future. In 2009 and 2010, we will be adding 16 deep water drilling rigs to our existing inventory. Many of these rigs we ordered as far back as 2005, anticipating our increasing demand. You can also see in the table that we are contracting 12 additional new rigs that are scheduled for delivery in 2012. And we are planning to order an additional 28 rigs to be built in Brazil, with delivery between 2013 and 2017.</p>
          <p>We are now in process of developing the building terms for these new builds. In addition to the drilling rigs we are also expanding our fleets of leased supply vessels to 146 to meet our growing needs. Let's see the slide five please. These are good moments to briefly discuss some of the processes that we are employing to increase the supply of equipment to develop our reserves. We have many challenges if we are to meet our targets, including equipments, human resources and cost inflation. We are addressing these challenges using a number of ways, such as long-term contracts, spend utilization of equipment and training program for those Petrobras employees in the supply chain.</p>
          <p>We also recognized the need of increase in capacity to manufacture equipment for the offshore oil industry. Since the field has become one of the primary sources of demand for deep water equipment and services we are encouraging all our partners in the supply chain to add needed capacity in Brazil.</p>
          <p>We strongly believe that there are advantages to doing so, ranging from reduced risk and efficiency  to social and corporate responsibility as we help to create an industrial base that contributes to the wellbeing of the Brazilian society.</p>
          <p>We believe we can accomplish builds in our aim that it is competitive with respect to the quality, timing and pricing. It is worth noting that national content has always been a criterion for the awarding of  new upstream exploration blocks in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In the most recent round, <mark type="inaudible" /> builders agreed to Brazilian content between 6 and 7% of their development costs. Slide six, please.</p>
          <p>With the completion of Guara and Jupiter, wells <mark type="inaudible" />, we will have completed at the time the minimal exploratory program of the exploration range for all the COGS reoperating samples without <mark type="inaudible" />. There will not be any additional exploration while drilling  built in the <mark type="inaudible" /> related to the program, with the exception of wells BM-S-22, operated by Exxon.</p>
          <p>For the remainder of the year and before starting the appraisal content, we will continue evaluation the drilling results obtained thus far, and we will reenter our job RJS-646 in Tupi in preparation for the extended <mark type="inaudible" />  test scheduled for the first quarter of next year.</p>
          <p>For complete in the yarra, we will also obtain additional high-resolution seismic data. While we have completed the exploration phase of the Santo  <mark type="inaudible" /> platform, we continue to explore the Santos Basin. We are currently leading RJS-655 Taqualeen,  block BM-S-45. And we will build Santa Catalina 13 and 14 grows to where we announced a find of light oil in June.</p>
          <p>When the well being drilled in Jupiter is completed, the grid will move to check da moinya in the eastern margin to drill for the first time in a promising new frontier. We continue to manage the most important information we will get over the next 12 to 18 months will be the results of this extended tests at Tupi.  These will give us a much better sense of the productivity of the pre-salt carbonate reservoir.</p>
          <p>I should also mention that at the last executive board meeting, the unload project for Tupi was approved  and we can now begin executing the contract that will lead to the production in December 2010. It is worth nothing that when BSS 102A in the pre-salt in the Espirito de Santos is completed and connected to the P-34 platform and we will begin producing shortly. This well, despite being more than 600 kilometers from the Santos pre-salt, is expected to provide valuable information due to the reliability of carbonate reservoir and the quality of volume.</p>
          <p>Slide seven, please. Downstream. We will see later in the presentation that the prime sediment earnings were especially affected by the increase within the international price of oil and oil products. Operating therefore mostly however, was quite positive <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazilian refineries increased by 3% as a result of lower programmed maintenance, greater reliability and a higher charge of imported light oil.</p>
          <p>To contend  with too much light oil, and minimize our output of pure oil. As a result of this action, capacity utilization rose from 90 to 93%, although the percentage of the matched crude decreased to 77%. It is also worth nothing that in June, rah duke en refinery upgrade was completed. And we will start seeing the benefit of that upgrade beginning in the third quarter. When full operational, the coker will reduce our output of fuel oil by 22,000 barrels per day by increasing the output of  <mark type="inaudible" /> coke, representing substantial margin improvement. Next year, we will have a similar coker being completed at Pet tree back.</p>
          <p>As you can see sales volume of oil products increased by 3%. Most of the increase is concentrated in diesel, which grew by 8% in the first half of the year as compared to a year earlier. In contrast, <mark type="inaudible" /> sales declined by 1% during the first half of the year. I expect on our sales offset the growth of the <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Slide eight. Gas &amp; power operational performance. Our operations of our Gas &amp; Energy segment also continues to improve. As we will see, when we discussed results the segment results. Our Gas &amp; Energy segment required a percent of operating and net income in this quarter. It is the result of a number of factors. Among them, higher volume of gas available for sale, higher margin from renegotiated sales contract to the distributors, completion of additional infrastructure to clear the gas, <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Some of these improvements are reflected in the slide 8, where as you can see gas-fired thermoelectric power is growing share of the electricity needs in Brazil. Giving Brazil's growth prospect and the higher cost of yield then less power. We don't see the need for gas-fired thermoelectric power diminishing. So, as we continue to add natural gas supply to regular fixed phase of LNG, the mass gas production and the completion of our natural gas infrastructure, we believe the segment we will continue to improve. Let's see the lifting costs in slide nine please.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the lifting costs slows by just over the $1 per barrel while rents increased by $24 during the same period. We just tried to minimize lifting cost, but it is more than half of such cost in material and third party services. Some correlation to the price of oil is inevitable. Given this cost environment, we are evaluating all of our standard operation prices to see how we can reduce costs. It also worth noting that lifting cost expressed in dollars are adversely affected by the real's trends.  As evidenced, increases in lifting cost in reais has been much more constrained.</p>
          <p>High oil price had also lapsed to a significant increase in our production factors. I gave the introduction P-52 and P-54 is subject to the highest bracket of the special <mark type="inaudible" /> tax.</p>
          <p>Slide 10, please. Average realization price of oil products. Each quarter we disclose the price of the baskets of Brazilian products priced at United States Gulf Coast  levels. Net adjusted for quality and transportation, we then track these against our actual sales in Brazil.</p>
          <p>As you can see even though we increased price for diesel by 15% and gasoline by 10% at <mark type="inaudible" />, it was not enough to offset the continued rise in international price. You will see also that for the first time both price were above the basket of U.S. products price, demonstrating the extent of reach of refining margin worldwide are being compared. The recent decline of Brent, which  <mark type="inaudible" /> should substantially improve our balanced stream earnings in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Net income. Slide 11 please. Turning now to the financial results, higher price for our crude oil end product as well as volume builds the increase in the net income. Operating expenses were lower primarily as a result of reduced exploration expenses and had a chance of penalties from <mark type="inaudible" />  contract. Higher net financial expense were caused by a 9% strengthening of the real against dollar during the quarter.</p>
          <p>The improvement of non-operating results were also caused by recognizing a gain of R$409 million from contributing the acquired Petrochemical assets the quarter. Income tax expense was higher not only because of higher operating costs but also because the absence of the <mark type="inaudible" /> interest on our own capital, during the quarter.</p>
          <p>Let's see E&amp;P in slide 12; income from our Brazilian E&amp;P segment increased by 22% primarily as a result of higher price for crude oil sales. As mentioned earlier cost did increase but not to the same degree, as the increase in price. Most of the increase in cost is attributable to higher production taxes caused by higher prices.</p>
          <p>Slide 13 downstream please; our downstream segment was adversely affected by price movement during the period. As discussed earlier we did pass two sizable price increases in May, however the cost of crude oil and products increased by an even greater margin causing a loss for this segment. This cost pressure were experienced by the refining industry worldwide as we showed in the performance of prices.</p>
          <p>These costs would have been greater except for our accounting practice of average inventory purchase over time. When averaging costs in a rising price environment, costs <mark type="inaudible" /> , while in a declining price environment they will be higher. For the company as a whole, unit  sales has had a positive pre tax income on our earnings of our first R$1 billion.</p>
          <p>International operating income, slide 14. Our international segments results were improved by a more favorable price environment in markets where it operates, primarily Argentina. Lower exploratory costs and the absence of contingencies, related to Columbia royalties in the quarter contributed to higher net income quarter-over-quarter. With the first oil from Albany in before  Nigeria to be followed by Abko, our international segment production is set to increase.</p>
          <p>Gas &amp; Power operating income slide 15. As mentioned earlier, our Gas &amp; Energy segment are experiencing positive turnaround. Higher gas price from new contracts signed with distribution companies, higher volume of the net gas available for 70% gross, to 29 million liters per day. I <mark type="inaudible" /> in higher electrical generation as a result of more gas available, and the lower fine with relates to contractual supply of gas. All contributed to positive results for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Slide 16, cash flow page. During the quarter, we generated a positive cash flow after CapEx of R$19 million. During the periods, EBITDA increased by 31% in relation to the first quarter of 2008. The paying out of  dividends combined with modest increases in the net financing result in a small decline of cash balance of R$514 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, the capital structure. Slide 17. Since most of our debt is given on the American dollar, the reevaluation of the real reduces our debt when expressed in reais. As a result, and combined with our gain earnings for the periods, our net debt to net total capital declined to 19% at the end of the period. This is well below the guidance of 25%, allowing for additional debt capacity if needed.</p>
          <p>Thank you. At this time, I would be happy to answer any question you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you. Our first question is coming from Frank McGann of Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Just three questions actually if I could. One is on lifting costs. How sustainable, or do you expect the pressure that you saw in this quarter for pure lifting costs, excluding taxes, to stay or do you think for because of higher volumes, those might come down?</p>
          <p>Secondly, in terms of gas and energy, do you expect that this segment will now remain profitable as we go forward given the higher prices that you are receiving and the greater volumes that you are able to generate? And, maybe if you could go onto a little bit of detail on the cash price, how it's determined under the new distribution contracts?</p>
          <p>And then last, just in terms of gas production and you mentioned the field that will be starting up later this year, I'm looking towards 2009, could you give us update on what the status of the Mistle Moffi is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Frank. I am going to ask the help of Molinari to answer the first question about lifting costs and the gas production. And then to our friend from gas and energy to tell about the sustainability of the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Frank, regarding the lifting cost in reais, we have been continued to operate a  percent in the last quarter compared to the first quarter of this year. On the, mainly due to materials purchased, personnel, little bit of personnel and sharpening of platforms. And also maintenance costs. And we expect the lifting cost to stabilize or go slightly down day-to-day increase in the production of P-52 and P-54 throughout the end of this year. The lifting cost in dollar was very much influenced by the exchange rate. So that is the lifting cost. I think it is sustainable for this year and to the end of this year this will be <mark type="inaudible" />, but the lifting cost at this level or lower. These are the increase of production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the gas production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the gas production, we are increasing. We have to start production this year and the end of the year <mark type="inaudible" />. Then leading toward the indicators the day of capacity. And the delivery to the market in the first nuclear region, the thin gas. We are reaching the target to deliver 40 million cubic meters a day in the first listed region to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the Sul well, how is that looking for the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The Sul well, yeah, next year; sure, next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the values that you are anticipating next year coming from that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it is the platform is being completed by the &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> . And things are going to deliver the project next year. Okay?</p>
          <p>About the gas &amp; power units, this will quarter-after-quarter, and we're still struggling and <mark type="inaudible" /> as these improving. And it depends basically on the energy markets. And the price that we paid for our gas, so that's the great viability of our <mark type="inaudible" />. We can, what we can say is that we are, the admission that the liability of loss in the segment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, as long as your generation stays at reasonably strong levels, the level of profitability will be enhanced here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The generation enterprise that we receive for that generation. And it depends also by the price that we pay for <mark type="inaudible" /> , you know.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Murti of Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a kind of a clarification and follow-up on some of the pre-salt commentary; just wanted to confirm that as far as the core piece of cluster goes, your comments were that we are going &#x2013; you're going continue to participate in the Jupiter well and the Epson BMS-22. But besides that, you're primarily just going to be studying the results of the ten wells drilled to date, and preparing to extend the well test.</p>
          <p>If I did hear that correct, if you can make any comments on that how much of that decision is driven by some of the contract uncertainty. It's obviously natural to hear a lot of rhetoric from the government whenever major discoveries are made in the country and Brazil is no exception. How much of your exploration development plans are driven by the uncertainty around what contract terms may be? And can you provide any color at this point in terms of when you think greater clarification might exist, whether that's 2009 or 2010 on the contract terms regarding the piece off deals? Thank you.</p>

          <p>We are just finishing the first phase or the minimal exploration program for the consult cluster. It does not mean that this is due to any change in the contract. This is just to comply with the terms of the contract we have in force. There is no change, there is not any established in this area. There has been discussion going on about the regulation of the government of Brazil create that can choose. It did not &#x2013; is not part of Petrobras as the government being re-stepped. So there is no change at all.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to confirm, with these last few wells, you will have finished that first phase of exploration to test all the block. And then you're going to study the results. The extended wells tests, both the one that start that next year and I guess more importantly 2010 to Q3. You will want to see the results from the extended wells tests before contemplating full field development of Q3, but &#x2013; is that all correct, what I just said?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Molinari, can you say something as far as I understand, yeah, it is going to be very important. The information I want to collect on the extended well test is going to be keen for our development of the field. But Molinari, can you add something?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's correct. What we want to see there that will behave or behavioral walk, especially on the pile of <mark type="inaudible" />  that we have water interaction, gas interaction. So we want to see how the regulator forms with those. And that will allow us to be right again, and importantly the development of  them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I guess hopefully over the time period, by which you are studying result hopefully at some point within that timeframe, we will have better clarity on sort of how the country is thinking about pre-salt contract terms. I think is that fair statement?</p>

          <p>I mean the country is obviously going through an evaluation of how it wants to consider developing the pre-salt trend. That always take some time anywhere in the world and it will take some time Brazil. But you have a lot of studying to do whether it's of the extended well test or just the other information you've got from the wells. I presume you're going to want to &#x2013; while you are studying these results somewhere within that timeframe, we ought to get some better certainty on how the country will go about developing these field and the timeframe hopefully overlap, plus at some point by the early next part of next decade, that will be then the timeframe by which you would be thinking about full field development of whether it's Tupi or the overall pre-salt cluster area.</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if you can. I think what we've been trying to say is that we are following a process that begins with exploration, goes to appraisal. Within that appraisal, you have the extended well test, the pilot. And that that plan and process, it has nothing to do or is completely unrelated if you will or not affected by this other discussion that is there is going on. It's just &#x2013; this is &#x2013; what we are trying to do is explain what is the process now and is to get a process, that is not &#x2013; it doesn't need to or in no way is thinking about this other issue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. That was basically the question whether any of the uncertainty or rhetoric was at all causing you to delay how you are thinking about.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well good morning everybody. I have two questions; the first one you mentioned the next ones to come on stream are P-51, P-53 and <mark type="inaudible" />, if you can provide some timeframe for those incorporations.  And then on CapEx, excluding the announcement that you could be making in October for Petroparia, how would CapEx look to elsewhere during the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the CapEx for the second half of the year we have today, we are planning yeah &#x2013; we &#x2013; the total CapEx for the first half was almost 21 billion riyals and our target is to reach 62 billion riyals. Usually in the second half of the year we spend more on CapEX than the first half. But probably we will be somewhat behind the target of 62 billion by 10% to 15% as is usual in the company. We established some targets that is very challenging and industry is sometimes behind and the day-to-day activity happens to retain the development somewhat. So we expect to increase in our CapEx in the second half maybe be somewhat below the true target. Regarding P-51, P-53 and Tupi FPSO can we give out some information, with that, defining <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you still have P-51 will start in November this year. Then we have our production of Cavoy  and Mah hee nas in December. P-51 and Mah hee nas both will have 108,000 barrels per day capacity and the <mark type="inaudible" /> 100,000 barrels per day. So their contribution to the production for this year will be very little, although they are increasing total 460,000 barrels per day capacity, that will increase, may be it will increase production by 2009</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello gentlemen, everyone. Two questions. One is about the D cluster area. I would like to understand, at least in your mind, the process for the development of the D and Lara that's the main result of to believe us for utilization of failures that are not in the hands of anyone at the moment, present any challenge in terms of how the rules are established or if you understand the framework that we have today is already familiar enough to provide for the utilization of this area and eventually the area of the BM-S-9, BM-S-23, BM-S-8 and so on. So what's your view on the utilization process and how clear are the rules for that to be in place? That's the first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let's <mark type="inaudible" />.  Molinari, will you say something about this utilization, it's going to be needed or not. We have information at this point in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. I can talk a little bit about cost, how high it is  and how it's going on and when it will go. But in general terms, since we have a blocks with different partners. And then also the blocks which are not awarded yet in the pre-salt. So all of these, when we had them at last  connected, we required this utilization.</p>
          <p>When that will happen is that, the company will grow, but we'll be adding things together that present <mark type="inaudible" /> on the production. They have the rights and they discuss and they get  one agreement how much belong to each one. And after that, any production in the area, they'll be split according to the what was established in this group. And even if it's another <mark type="inaudible" /> for the blocks not awarded. It's the same thing with the value, because it will be Jordan establishing a partner.  In the areas where there is no concession today, then the ANP will be shooting after a interest in the group.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But important to say that no process has started yet. Nothing about the mitigation of reais is being discussed with partners.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Second question would be about the Jupiter drilling. A few weeks ago, <mark type="inaudible" />  speaking to the H3 newspaper suggested that you have not decided whether it would be necessary, should it affect you at Jupiter, you know, given what the reservoir characteristics, the fact that we have a gas cap and then oil reserves as well et cetera.</p>
          <p>I would like to understand if you now have made a decision about testing that well, or are you reaching the target position? So, what's the game plan there if you have an update to share with us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jupiter, we are still drilling there. We are going deeper in to the reservoir. And today we don't have any topsoil test in Jupiter,  just completing the well and until beginning of September, when we are going to send the agreement in that will completed to the  Cachalote Basin. That's our plan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. One last question if I may, coming back to the comment about lifting costs. Every press release that we read about the lifting costs, the explanation is always the same, the raw materials, the personnel, <mark type="inaudible" />. These are factors that affect basically lifting cost. I would like to understand how much more are you happy to explain the drilling or for lifting is too big to offset the decline of the acceleration of the decline of the fuels of the most predictive fuel at the moment. It the decline playing an increasing role in this increasing lifting cost or does that doesn't really have an impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the lifting cost, the factors I mentioned that cause the pressure on the lifting cost. And but that there is not only Petrobras's seeing an increase in the lifting cost but nearly all oil companies due to the price of the oil price in the market. That price will be fairly to contrast, okay? And all the activity on the exchange rate regarding the decline rate, our decline rate is 10%, 10% per year. And so, that leaves <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Almir, maybe you can tell something about the program we've had to keep production on the on natural fuels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes we have a project to improve the forms of the natural fuels. We are doing very great job on shore and we have fields producing for 50 years and we are still, they are reaching the second peak production. That's indicating <mark type="inaudible" /> reaching the second peak. We view each peak as a  goal and now we are reaching a second peak of production. So there are several things we are doing to improve the recovery factor of the fuels, we are injecting water, gas, some polyamides and so we are very, very much success in these techniques, especially on shore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Just some clarification here. During the presentation you mentioned the drilling of two blocks at SC-13 and at SC-14, Santa Catarina 13 and Santa Catarina 14. In both blocks are you shooting for a pre-salt target?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes well, DMC-14 is not,  it is hard to say, unaccomplishable, but DMC-14  will be the next well drilled by <mark type="inaudible" />.  What's the other one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You said Santa Catarina earlier in the presentation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Santa Catarina is BM-S-12.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>13 and 14, is it south or north?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is in shallow water and I don't think it's pre-salt there. It's shallow water, below 1,000 meters water there. Shall be about the same time of targets we drilled in the north <mark type="inaudible" /> discovery at the &#x2013; It is also off  BM-S-40. BM-S-40, recently they discovered there  <mark type="inaudible" /> and I believe BM-S-12, it is south of BM-S-40, in shallow waters.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, I have two follow-ups. just wanted to clarify an earlier comment  and maybe one question. On the sub &#x2013; I understand that you are coming close to the end of the expiration, firstly of the expiration drilling. Have you mentioned or talked about the Jupiter or maybe I missed it, where are we in the our drilling, our redrilling of the Jupiter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Jupiter we announced it back in this quarter, between the first announcement we made, that was the only announcement we made so far for Jupiter. Remember, Jupiter is being until the beginning of September, the drilling will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When, I am sorry when you are going to complete that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Beginning of September.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Beginning of September you are going to finish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then on the I think earlier, talking about the capital spending, you saying that your budgeting is 60, R$62 billion and that you maybe 10% to 15% lower. Even assume a 15% lower, that's about 51, 50 &#x2013; R$51 billion for the year. You spend about 20, 21 in the first half so you need to spend about 30 billion in the second half, can you actually spend that quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry Paul just to clarify, you're asking we spent R$20 billion in the first half of the year and how much do we expect to spend, the second half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I mean based on the earlier comment, you saying that for the full year you think you will spend about 50 &#x2013; R$51 billion given the same year, 15% lower than your budget. That will still suggest that in the second half you have to spend about in the R$30 billion. I mean can you actually spending as fast as that? How likely are you to spend that fast?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're expecting to increase and this is not unusual to have the second half much higher than the first one. If you took 2006 and compare with 2007, year-over-year we had an increase of more than 30%, 30 to 50%. So it's feasible to reach 50, 50, something more, billion reais of CapEx for the rest of the year, the total of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last one, in I think over the last several months, it seems like there's a substantial shift in the company focus and strategy towards banking the domestic expansion and growth both in the downstream and the upstream. Wondering if you can comment how your international refining and upstream strategy have seen change. I think that one pawn actually would be that acquisition is a big keys of this strategy, is acquisition is still a big piece of the strategy in the international or that you're really going to cut back substantially more and put more effort and resources that are primarily in the domestic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon everyone, just two questions. One on in refining, you mentioned that you had a R$1 billion benefit in the core, to the average cost accounting. I was wondering if you could comment on how the average cost of your inventory right now? And then on the  <mark type="inaudible" /> again. So I understand that you will, in terms of the deviation of the and the configuration of the reserves I understand that those should take between 12 to 18 months. And just if you could comment on what is your prospects for continuing items on your new frontier and what you are expecting, or what is the indication there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The second question is about the, on the E&amp;P. I understand that you, it will take some time for you guys to have an idea of the size of the reserves. Just checking if it's around 12 to 18 months for you guys to be able to have an idea. Or to have an idea of the size of the reserves in the pre salts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah the pre salt cluster you mean.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very, very frequent question and of course this will take some time, yes, about, probably not 12  to 18 months. And of course also in a degree certainty as time goes, more information, we'll be collecting data evaluation we'll have. But I believe earlier than that, we will have some idea on the total reserve of the area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Marcus, your second question, I think was in respect to the average inventory? You were asking, what is the additional value, if you will, today, that would be --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>More or less, have an idea of what would be the average cost of the inventory right now?  And just to have an idea of, I understand that in the third quarter, you probably will have higher costs in your inventories and that will have a negative impact in third quarter. Just trying to have a sense of how much the impact would be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The negative impact that could happen in the third quarter --</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>-- with declining prices, given that we had a positive impact in the second quarter. You want us to give an estimate there?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, yes. Give an estimate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess , Alves correct me I'm wrong, but I think the, if you could assume that if you had a one billion positive in the second quarter and prices decline, you could have up to a one billion in reduction in the third quarter. Would that be a proper way to express it, Alves?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct. It depends of course of other items in the next part, that we can't say now. But this positive effect, this quarter, if the other items don't vary in the next quarter, we can believe that we will reduce our results in one billion the next quarter, it's correct. But I like to say, it depends on the other item that we can't say now, prices next quarter. It depends on the price.</p>

          <p>Yeah, that's a new frontier, the eastern margin of Brazil, south of Buy ear is a great potential area.  In fact, we are drilling there, in deep water, that's why there are also deep water in that area. And we just got an expansion because of the original exploratory contract was ending, closing. And now we've got an extension of 454 days due to the delay in the obtaining the environment licenses. So now we have <mark type="inaudible" /> and hopefully find a new area for exploration.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark McCarthy with Rexford Capital.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys, it's Mark McCarthy.</p>

          <p>Hi Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a few questions. I'm just going to put them out there, see how we do.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, that's it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The first one is --  what's that? Two questions? Two questions then. The first one is a easy one. Can you give us an update on your plans or if you are going to buy Valero's Aruba refinery There has been quite of bit of discussion suggesting that you are at the final stages of negotiation. The second question, in light of tense --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, Mark, since you asked that first question, you can ask a third. Because I think the first answered question will be very short, so you can ask a third.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's great. The second question is related to, Molinari just commented about expansions. As you think about your existing portfolio looking out five to seven years, you had quite a bit of an existing backlog to declare commerciality bring on development. And then all of a sudden you had the opportunity with the pre-salt, which itself has its own sizable deadlines that you are facing to race around, drill wells to move towards the declarations of commerciality. I guess I was always under the impression that you would be faced with having to substitute some levels of production and possibly even having to relinquish existing discoveries, just facing infrastructure constraints.</p>
          <p>As you have now laid out this massive drilling program, should we interpret this as, A, the resultment of the pre-salt may take longer, but it's going to be ultimately incremental to all the existing discoveries. B, have you decided in some cases to relinquish existing discoveries to be resold back to the government. Or third are you getting this &#x2013; are you getting extension for the most part across the board, which will allow you more flexibility to do both.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are doing our plan and we don't intend to, <mark type="inaudible" /> split up volume and talks. We are contracting daily rigs across the mill drilled daily mix. 12 of them are already contracted to be built abroad and 28 can deliver until 2012. And our other 28, that would be contracted probably in Brazil to begin in Brazil. So we are below the problems that constrain the market. In this special pre-release for our interview, and we divided them to help deal with this. So we, the problem we have today is to do increase production, also store up all the effort to fulfill all the obligations we have, and continue to the proven reserves as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Molinari; I would take that to be that you anticipate it to be incremental? You don't plan to relinquish anything and you are not getting extensions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. The extensions we may have now, if we had guardians like a nation obtaining environmental license constraint, no one may agree with me there. We may ask for extensions for the national agent. But --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you think about, like say, the Wells Park, which was a discovery in 2003? You need to be submitting a lot of commercial development plans really over the next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's right. Also we have the exploratory phase handy. We needed to declare the commission stability. Now we are within the timeframe and past the development phase. But this is our, already considered in our plan. We are revising right now our strategic plan, and it will be released in October this year and that will be taken into consideration, all the pre-salt, all the exploratory areas, other exploratory areas and also production included.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just if I can take that third question then; going back to the unitization question. As you sit around the table and try to divide up the equity interests in the reservoir, how do you define the state interest and/or who controls ultimately the budget given that there is a very high profitability, I would suppose, that Petrobras will be in majority control and so a unitization agreement could actually work really to Petrobras's benefit? That's first part of that. And then to what extend if there are other areas surrounding the areas that were already license and the state has 100% of the areas that have not yet been sold, but are defined also as part of the reservoir, can they ultimately get themselves at the table?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's what has happened now. People, our  company's interest in the national agents, we have seen it and discussed the, how much each one have. On the volume of each participant and then the build rate, usually build rate is up there, again the production for each participant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to complete the answer, if there is any part of one particular field that lies in areas that are not awarded yet, it belongs to the government. And according to their constitution, the government can exert the exploration production directly. So, they are going to decide what to do. They have many alternatives and probably they are external, they can become a partner. They can do mainly different things. And we are waiting to see maybe this committee is having this one point to consider. The committee that the government has created <mark type="inaudible" />, all these result problems.</p>
          <p>Regarding Valero, we, we are waiting, we have no decision. Probably by the time we'll be releasing the new business plan we'll have a final decision on this point.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. I have a couple of questions. Can you give us an update on the rate of negotiations and how much of the production in fact expected for the coming quarter? And can we expect the supply division to have this high utilization rate going forward or if this like, this 95% will be actually going forward? Can you comment on the utilization rates as well? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One of the questions on what you can expect with respect to the utilization rate going forward. Maria if you want to answer that quickly? The utilization rate which was very high this quarter, what would you expect going forward? Even shorter, it's right at 93%, 95%. What do you expect it to be, the utilization factor for refining, the capacity utilization?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The refining, all the refining we are going to produce diesel and gasoline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The capacity utilization factor for the second quarter was very high. Do you expect that to continue? The 95%?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we are &#x2013; we've reached a level that probably is not going to be maintained for the remainder of the year. And it will depend a lot on the maintenance of refinery. We are going to stop one <mark type="inaudible" /> one refinery now in the third quarter and to have a stock program in the fourth quarter of which one is going to be maintained in the fourth quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As we understand in the calls that it was mentioned that the upgradation of refineries has been completed. So that's way I was asking whether you are going to have this higher domestic utilization rate going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Probably, we cannot maintain this level. But the remaining must be, we will do our best to keep it. But diesel is very high, above the average of the world capacity.</p>

          <p>Regarding the strikes that has been discussed in the late, last month, it's all over. It was only about the way to distribute the, each of the share of profit to the employees. And we agreed in '08 that unions and believe in the company were happy so the issue is over. We don't expect more problem in the near future. We have, of course, in September the agreement on the salary rising. But as we had done in the last opportunities we had, we were able to negotiate and come to a gain.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I had two quick questions, the first one very much related to the quarter. When we look at slide 15 when you talk about the improvement and the results of the gas and gas power units, there is an improvement mentioned on the cost effects on average COGS. Can I get a little bit more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, can you help us?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The greatest fact that the cost daily due to greater generation and the downside of the energy price in the spot markets. Quarter-to-quarter, that variation reduced our costs in the energy segment. It's response there is gross improvement in --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, it was lower spot purchases?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Also with later generation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. The second question Almir, this one I think is a little bit more strategic, we have been hearing a lot on regulation and I know that most of this is out of the government's sphere. But we have also heard a lot from Petrobras as far as their support of a change that we see on the pre-salt. Can you just briefly touch on why you guys think this is good for the company?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gustavo, we are not going to, our intention is not to discuss this subject until this committee comes to reach their conclusion.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question is coming from Paula Kovarsky with Ita&#xFA; Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. I would like to follow-on a little bit on production for production growth. Actually, I was trying to reconcile a couple of numbers. You have P-52 is currently operating at 154,000 barrels a day and P-54 at 96. If you take from the beginning of the year where both were around 40, it means those two platforms together have already added something like 150,000 barrels a day of production. And I don't know exactly where is the, you could broad a ramp-up in spending. But at the end of day, this is a significant production addition, which all alone would mean something like 10 or even more percent growth in production as compared to the end of last year. So, I would like to understand how is depletion affecting Petrobras's ability to meet production growth goals?</p>
          <p>And what if the company is having any type of initiative to try and get lower depletion or &#x2013; I mean how can we evaluate or what shall we expect on depletion going forward? And than what's your new guidance if there is any on production growth for the year; what's the target for average domestic oil production?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Molinari?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Paula. The declining now of the mature fields, would be larger as we have a declining rate of 10% per year. And our target therefore this year is 1,950,000 barrels per day. We have value our self for 2.5%. Right now, we are running at the lower end of this target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We cannot &#x2013; something else here is &#x2013; if we compare with the first half of last year and the first half of each year, we can see that the new units we installed add to the production 202,000 barrels per day and we have a decline on the same few, of a 162 what has added to our production of oil and other liquids of 40,000 domestic. And in the year the decline was 162 that is less than 10% of the production that we had last year. So, we have &#x2013; our performance in terms of declining rate is in the range we have estimated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And do you expect any additional contribution for the programs that you've recently announced, like the Hikagia or any other programs to maybe lower a little bit that that depletion and allow the overall production to grow on a steeper basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Paula. I talked about the programs Hikagia onshore, the problem is not only for onshore the production; the contribution is lower than offshore. But we are doing great effort there to increase the production from mature fields. And regarding new projects, we are going to start production from the steel to sunsa marina 138 real in that piece out and its about the field that will give also a huge contribution for the production increase in the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you quantify how much those two would contribute?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is <mark type="inaudible" />, it is limited by the capacity of the 60 P-34 platform which is 60,000 barrels per day so they still have 12,000 to reach this capacity. So if the &#x2013; even the well can produce more, we will have to reduce or increase our model well, okay? Because the pre-salt is light oil it's more important for us. So if you reach the capacity, then the well can provide more than 12,000. We'd have to increase the production from diesel and reduce production from all the heavy oil.</p>
          <p>And onshore we may have, the contribution is lower, because the effort generally again is to increase the production in very mature fields like in <mark type="inaudible" />. I don't have a number here, but...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, you mentioned a contribution of 12 from the P-34, but what about the other one?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you. We are going to finish up our conference call with one question from the Internet, which I'll read, it's coming from Christopher Buck from Barclays Capital. Could you comment on Petrobras's plan to issue additional debt in 2008, previously the company indicated that they issued more than two billion international bonds during the second half of '08; is this still the case?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so, we are looking at a market that is not in good shape now. But we were happy in the second quarter as you have seen by increasing our EBITDA to a record in the period. But depending on the market, it might well come up in another shape after years and months of orders. We may touch the market, we may duck the market and raise the money we were aiming at. It all depends on the market itself; market conditions.</p>
