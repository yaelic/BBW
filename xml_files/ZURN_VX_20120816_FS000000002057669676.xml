          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Zurich Insurance Group Half Year Results reporting 2012 analyst and media presentation. I'm Goran, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in listen-only-mode and the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mrs. Debra Broek. Please go ahead, madam.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. Welcome to our half year 2012 results and it's my pleasure to be here with our CEO, Martin Senn, and our CFO, Pierre Wauthier.</p>
          <p>And I would now turn it over to Martin Senn for introductory remarks and then we will move into Q&amp;A time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debra, and good morning and good afternoon to all of you and thank you all for joining us today for Zurich Insurance Group's result presentation for the first six months of 2012.</p>
          <p>I'm very pleased to tell you that Zurich continued to perform strongly in the first half of 2012, thanks to an excellent underwriting performance and our continuing focus on pricing and portfolio management.</p>
          <p>We have delivered top-line performance in our growth target markets, in Latin America, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific making an increased contribution to business volumes. The integration of the business units acquired through our alliance with Banco Santander is progressing well and delivering results. This alliance will support our future growth strategy.</p>
          <p>We have also seen promising performance in mature markets, especially in North America. Each of our business segments has continued to execute on their strategies for growth and in addition we have delivered a total investment return of 3.2%. This is non-annualized, but thanks to our disciplined risk management and effective investment management. As a result, we improved our strong capital position within our AA target range and we are well positioned to continue delivering sustainable profit growth.</p>
          <p>Talking about GI, I'm also very pleased to have announced yesterday our new CEO for General Insurance, Mike Kerner. Mike is a 20-year veteran of our company, a 25-year veteran to the insurance industry, I should add. Mike combines great people management and business skills with deep industry knowledge and a proven ability to drive forward our ambitious and, as today's results show, successful GI strategy. And I'm pretty sure that over time as you get to know Mike, you also will appreciate his professionalism and his personality.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have achieved strong profitability and growth in shareholder equity in a very challenging environment. We have continued to successfully execute our strategy and remain on course to meet our targets for 2012 &#x2013; for 2013, excuse me.</p>
          <p>And with that, at the end I will be happy to take your questions and to have a good dialogue. Thank you.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> The first question is from Mr. Spencer Horgan from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions please. The first one is on the de-risking you've carried out. I think you pointed to a $2 billion saving of risk capital under the Zurich ECM model, which is about 5% of the year-end capital requirement. Would it be fair to roughly assume that the same actions will reduce the Swiss Solvency Test capital requirement also by around 5%, and or is that a different number?</p>
          <p>And the second one is on the Zinszusatzreserve. Thank you very much for the slide you've put in on there, which would suggest that the addition to that reserve in the second half should be similar to the first if everything else stays stable. If everything stays stable, would you be able to say anything about the amounts that might be required in 2013? And also, could you just remind me how much remaining RFB there is in Germany? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Spencer, I'll take the question. This is Pierre. Hi, and thank you for these two questions. So, yeah, your assumption is essentially correct, just $2 billion compared to an RBC of $37 billion would actually be slightly higher than six points, but indeed these de-risking actions would flow directly through into the RBC and therefore would improve it, which is why we indicated &#x2013; or indicated in my speaker notes that we see a stronger solvency ratio from a Z-ECM perspective as a result of these actions.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Zinszusatzreserve, two points that I'd like to make. First is that this impact on earnings is already included in our RBC, so it does not affect our economic capital as we've recognized where interest rates currently are. So this is purely something that is recognized from an IFRS perspective. And essentially, the way you phrased your question, the answer would be yes, but let me clarify. What I mean by that is that indeed this increase in &#x2013; or this impact on budget is really caused by the lower reference rates of the Zinszusatzreserve and assuming that the rate of decline remains the same, then the amount of provision taken would be comparable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And another, I guess the --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The <mark type="ph" /> pre-RV (06:37) is around &#x20AC;400 million currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Good afternoon. Just a few questions. Firstly, you said that your risk reduction actions with the $2 billion reduction in RBC isn't going to affect your investment result. I was wondering if you could just explain this. I mean, how can it not have a cost? And if the situation was that you were taking market risk without upside beforehand, it just doesn't make sense that that was sort of allowed to happen.</p>
          <p>Second question is on Farmers. You talked about a 9%, I guess, cat loss in the first half, which brings you down to sort of 99% combined ratio, but you also mentioned a lack of reserve releases. Could you talk a little bit about what you would expect sort of going forward to get to a sort of more normalized combined ratio?</p>
          <p>And I guess the third question is you talked about lower investment income in your Non-Life business, because of low re-investment yield, but you also said it was due to capital repatriation to the group. Could you explain what that means and how much capital was repatriated? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, that was three questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I think I &#x2013; no, no, no, but that's really because I make notes. Can you please repeat the last question, because that one was too quick? I was still writing the first two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, so you talked about lower investment income in your Non-Life business being affected by low re-investment yield, but also capital repatriation to the group. Could you explain what you meant by this and how much capital you repatriated to the group?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (08:48).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I referred to a comment you made in your webcast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's low income in GI, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right, yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Okay, all right, fine. So, the first question was how does your risk reduction not have an impact on your investment results. There are two key elements there. One is in the strategic asset allocation where we rebalance and reduce the risk, there's a series of events. So, while we did indeed reduce our exposure to credit risk, we also adjusted the duration and, in essence, what has happened is that these two elements were happening, they have more or less &#x2013; or they have significantly reduced the impact on the investment income. Now, it's not zero, but it is actually relatively small, is really what we wanted to highlight.</p>
          <p>With regards to the tail risk Eurozone, this is a purchase of an options or a series of options to adjust against the risk. So this is then a derivative that goes through fair market valuation, and obviously the results of that derivative will depend on where the market develops. It will be a great result if, as we hope, as we don't hope actually something happen and what we will more expect indeed the results of that derivative would be lower in case we got a good resolution of the Eurozone and a clear continuation of the Eurozone. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (10:29)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry, just to come back on the derivative, I mean, have you also sold some upside to reduce the cost?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have some --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sold some upside to reduce the cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I talk &#x2013; I was just going to <mark type="ph" /> enhance (10:46) because &#x2013; this is Martin. I talk to enhance as well what Pierre has said. A part of the hedge and that's about the worth of $1 billion of capital reduction was the full hedge of the equity portfolio by means of buying put options.</p>
          <p>So the point that is not going to have an impact on investment income is up, or just not the material, let's put it, is absolutely correct. But obviously, the equity hedge, this course was a payment of option premium, and that option premium has an economic impact but not an impact on the business operating profits, the economic impact being over the tenure of the optional reduction of net income attributable to shareholders.</p>
          <p>So I think that should answer then your follow-up question. I was just going to have a dialogue, the three of us, on that note as well to make sure you understand the de-risking has two components, strategic <mark type="ph" /> capital (11:45) allocation and tail risk reduction by acquisition of options.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And it was a clean purchase of options, Farooq.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, there is no options sold to reduce the cost.</p>
          <p>With regards to Farmers, I think your question ultimately was, yes, indeed, last year there were some higher reserve development, which have resolved this year. It was pretty much neutral. We're not planning for reserve releases. More importantly is, where does this go? We really are taking a series of actions, not only on the rate increases which, just a reminder, were essentially 5% in auto, 6% in home and, by the way, we also are filing for more rate increases.</p>
          <p>In addition to that, we're taking also re-underwriting actions, both in homeowners and in auto, such as for example much stricter guidelines in the non-standard auto and particularly in states where the combined ratio is higher, as well as further and stricter efforts in personal injury protection, as well as a better accumulation management in wind-prone areas, such as Florida. Altogether, I think it's important to keep the strategic perspective. We think these actions will have a significant impact. And our goal is to go back to the long-term combined ratio of 98%. And this is what these actions are meant to achieve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard now to your last question, the lower income in GI, essentially two reasons, one is a very simple one, is as we have maturing bonds, and re-invest them, we re-invest them at the current yield, and as a result, this has an impact on the investment income reported. And then with regards to the capital repatriation, as you may remember from prior presentations, we paid or GI paid last year $2.4 billion in capital repatriation. This was actually slightly in excess of the capital generation simply through the net income after tax, so that also had a impact simply in terms of where the asset base is going by lowering the net income &#x2013; sorry, the investment income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I see, yeah, okay. So that's referring to the retrospective dividend that you paid up and, therefore, your starting asset was lower. That's the point you're making?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

          <p>Your next question is from Mr. Marc Thiele from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. My first question is related to the Life Insurance division. There's been $570 million of net outflows in the second quarter and I was wondering if there was any specific region or a specific reason for this and how do you expect that to develop in the coming quarters?</p>
          <p>My second question is related to D&amp;O insurance, do you anticipate any visible losses following the LIBOR and money laundering settlements? And what's your appetite to increase exposures going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I'll answer for the first question, so the net outflows is currently due to, as you see, our strategy. We've seen this net outflow primarily coming from single premiums, which is typically savings products, also some expense unit-linked, but where the fees are lower. So this is, if you want, part of our strategy to deemphasize that. I think it's also fair to say that in Europe, where there's a recession, conditions are difficult and the whole market is more declining than increasing and this is also affecting our operations.</p>
          <p>Expectations going forward, as you have seen, I think we've been, I think, really successfully growing our risk and protection business as well as the expense or fee-based businesses. So that will continue to be the focus and we certainly are focusing on increasing the BOP from that perspective.</p>
          <p>The net inflows and outflows, I think, will continue to be determined by the continuation there for our strategy, and really what is happening in the Eurozone, and whether there's a change in sentiment, which is not necessarily completely correlated by the rate of GDP growth. So, we'll see. But, we're optimistic on our capabilities to continue to grow the protection and the risk business.</p>
          <p>With regards to the D&amp;O insurance, I think it's really too early to have any predictions on that. Just as a reminder, we are presenting the D&amp;O insurance, but really the bulk of it is more in the U.S., and we're really focused on the smaller institutions. So, I would say that relative to other big writers we're not really in the same camp yet. But clearly, we will be assessing the situation as it evolves and develops.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. I'm not sure if you mentioned this in your video. I don't think you did. Could you just give us a sense if there's any meaningful exposure to &#x2013; I know you write multi-peril crop insurance through various joint ventures, but any meaningful exposure to the current drought situation, just give us a flavor of your exposure there.</p>
          <p>Second question, what more on retention in U.S. commercial, I mean your &#x2013; the degree of rate increase has increased again a little bit in the second quarter. It's a bit hard to judge what's happening in retention just from the premium growth because I know there's some historic premium additions happening. Can you give us a sense of what's happening to your retention rate on commercial &#x2013; U.S. commercial with these rate increases and how that retention rate &#x2013; has it improved, has it deteriorated, has it been easier to put through rate increases, and not have an adverse impact on retention? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Andrew, so on the crop insurance, just and I know Farmers is called Farmers, but actually Farmers is not active in the crop insurance business, so that was the first.</p>
          <p>With regard to NAC, we have a limited exposure. It's only 2% of our premiums. So, the impact there, we would expect anyway to be limited, and also just as a reminder, the structure of these insurance contracts are revenue-based. So, while, I think, clearly everyone expects this to have an impact on the production, there also will be at least some compensation on the price side. We've seen the commodity price increases. So it's really the net impact that has an influence on the insurance. I think it's too early to say where both are going, but in any case, the exposure is limited.</p>
          <p>With regard to rate increases, you're absolutely right. We have been accelerating rates in the U.S. pretty much across all lines of business if it needs to be strong, particularly also workers' comps where we continue to have double-digit increase. You may have noticed market scouts also reporting that the rates are continuing to be still low-single digit but at sustained level. As a result probably of that, but I would also hope by good underwriting and customer relationship, we actually have seen retention rates increasing pretty much across the broad, which also is a reminder was already a trend we had observed in the first quarter and is obviously a key driver, in fact, that we've also been growing premiums as a result in North America Commercial.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions actually. One on Farmers, just trying to reconcile for Zurich the process that Farmers is going to go through to try and correct its underwriting margins at the moment and what that would mean to the growth. I think Farmers has grown for some time ahead of the market in various &#x2013; for various reasons, organically and inorganically. But if you're correcting for some of the, I think, slightly disappointing performance there, and appreciate some of that's catastrophe, but even with that in context, they're still I think underperformed. Should we anticipate some sort of loss of market share and, therefore, an impact to the Farmers fee business.</p>
          <p>And just to attach to Farmers as well, the development of 21st Century, the growth there in 2Q looks like it's stalled relatively year-on-year. I was wondering if you've got any update on that. And a bit cheeky, that's one question.</p>
          <p>And then, so the second question just on developing trends you've seen in terms of economic impact on them and I'm thinking you use, I think, significant amount of surety in the U.S. Just wonder whether that you'll see or &#x2013; and actually globally whether that is anything we should be concerned about on those lines or any other economic consequences coming through on perhaps some non-retail stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Andy. So I noted three questions. One is the underwriting measures, the rate increases, et cetera, that we're taking, does that mean a loss of market share. Could I comment on 21st Century whose growth seems to be stalling and do we see, I guess from the economic environment, any indications with regards to our surety business.</p>
          <p>So, with regards to the actions we're taking, actually we're seeing a lot of our competitors who are also taking corrective actions and, therefore, we at this stage at least do not expect that it would have a significant impact on growth. In other words, the growth actually has continued to be strong, but what we're seeing is that we're not necessarily misaligned to the market and actually the July results were encouraging, but one month clearly doesn't make a trend.</p>
          <p>With regards to 21st Century, I think you have to just keep in mind that the growth was 5.6% in the first half, so it continuous to be strong. What is happening is that it's not accelerating as it was last year. We have a somewhat lower budget that we have implemented, but we see a continuing success in the cross sell and that is continuing to grow. So, we don't necessarily see further acceleration of the growth rate, but we feel at this stage that the growth in 21st Century is healthy.</p>
          <p>On the surety business, it's difficult to really comment where this is going. I think all we can say today is that this continues to be a really profitable business and we're really happy with the way it is developing.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just to come back on the 21st Century, I'm referring to the policies enforced actually on the auto side, which I think on &#x2013; in the slides &#x2013; in the appendix it's suggesting that in the half year they were only up 0.3%, half year on the year-end. And I think quarter-on-quarter it's actually down on the next slide. So, that's what I was referring to with 21st Century direct. So not so much premiums, just policies enforced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, yes, it's not going as fast as it was. I mean, to some extent, as I said, we've pared down a little bit on the marketing expenses, which last year were very strong. So, that probably has an impact. We're continuing to work actively, however, on the marketing and don't forget that we're also seeing some benefits of the 21st still coming through in the cross sell, because the cross sell actually while it is a 21st Century benefit actually flows through the Farmers' exchange. So from that perspective, I think we need also to look at it globally.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Stefan Sch&#xFC;rmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I have two questions, the first one is on Europe Non-Life, you had a negative growth. Can you give some feel at what's really happening, especially in the markets now being in recession like Italy, or U.K., or Spain, in terms of top line and the claims frequency on the Non-Life side?</p>
          <p>And the second question leads to Switzerland only. I think you stated a very strong combined ratio, below 80% despite I think some hail storm claims. Basically question is how much basically is the reserve releases and is there more to come here on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well spotted, Mr. Sch&#xFC;rmann. So, you had Non-Life first. Those I think Ireland, Italy, Spain are markets that are actually, from the global market perspective, in decline. I think the reasons are obvious. These countries are in recession, so it's simply what customers are doing. They are buying less. So that is clearly one impact.</p>
          <p>The other impact is, as you know, particularly in the U.K. and in Italy we've been taking strong underwriting actions. We're actually really pleased with the progress we've made, in terms of improving the profitability of our personal lines portfolio, where we've been having steady improvement.</p>
          <p>And while the profitability has increased, it has had indeed a negative impact on the premiums overall. So that would be the second explanation of the strength, which is perfectly in line with our strategy and, therefore, we're quite happy with the way it's developing. As we have always said, the GI strategy is really to focus on improving the combined ratio, both the loss and the expense ratio.</p>
          <p>With regard to Switzerland, you are absolutely right. Their Q2 result is excellent, and it did benefit from five-year reserve releases, which are linked to the whiplash statements. This is something that we have observed frankly over the last two years, but since this is a changing trend, we've been quite cautious in recognizing that trend in the numbers. So, again, this is something voluntary. Could there be more to come? I mean, it will come to an end, but we feel at this stage, we're conservatively reserve. And if the next question is and how does your &#x2013; how do your numbers look like if you take the whiplash out, then I'd say it's a good return. It's a healthy return, but it is by no means an exceptionally low return that we should be ashamed of either.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Two questions. The one is on the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:34) second Quota Share treaty that you have is on Auto Physical Damage and that is what cost you quite dearly probably in the second quarter. I just wanted to have some more comments on it and if you would change anything on it. And I think it gives you a 25% Quota Share.</p>
          <p>And the other thing is on Farmers. When I'm looking at the cover that you have and when we're looking at the second quarter this year and last year, it seems that you had a high frequency, low severity but when looking at the big transaction agreement that you &#x2013; the reinsurance agreement that you have, it doesn't seem that you have an aggregate cover, the terms of which you would consider given that has already <mark type="ph" /> previous (29:27) with high frequency? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me repeat your question just to make you sure that I understood. The first question was what was the results on &#x2013; of these big catastrophes on our Auto Physical Damage quota share with Farmers and the second question was that we do not seem to have an aggregate cover for Farmers Exchanges. Why not and what are our thoughts about it?</p>
          <p>So to the first questions, you're right, the exceptional hail storms, particularly the one in Texas, in Dallas which happened at the time of rush hour and you had golf to <mark type="indiscernible" /> (30:10) ball hail size caused massive damage in auto only and there were some other hail storm events, which did cause the APD treaty to recognize a loss, which is it may even have been the first time because we couldn't go to all the way back, but the point of this is &#x2013; this is a treaty that's supposed to transfer risk. It does and we had really if you look back at history a very exceptional quarter from the Auto Physical Damage perspective. Overall, and if you look over time, unless there's a complete change in the patterns we feel that this is at both times a treaty that has really worked well and it's doing its job right now. With...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, you don't have any concerns? Sorry, if I may and you don't have any concerns about auto repair cost going up and things like that? You haven't noted any deterioration also on that front?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is some increases in repair costs. But that is more a trend that we observe closely and that we're <mark type="indiscernible" /> (31:24) in rate increases in auto. So that would then be automatically covered through the APD treaty.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regard to the aggregate cover, it's something that we look at on a regular basis. Last year, we felt that the cost of this aggregate cover relative to the risk relief was not economic and, ,therefore we didn't do anything. This is obviously something that we monitor on a regular basis and will continue to monitor going forward.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello and good afternoon. I've got two points. One is you mentioned &#x2013; Pierre, you mentioned on the &#x2013; in the video conference that there is a limit to the All Lines Quota Share contract existing between the Farmers Re and the exchanges, would you be able to comment on what that limit is and also how much has been used up year-to-date?</p>
          <p>And the second question relates to the sensitivities of your internal solvency ratio, the Z-ECM ratio and perhaps also the SST ratio. The sensitivities given are the same as that, as were in place, as at the end of the last year, but I believe that the presence of the equity market hedge will change these sensitivities again. Would you be able to comment on sensitivities with the equity market hedge presence? Thank you very much indeed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, thank you, Ralph. With regards to the limit, there is indeed a limit, a big portion of that limit has already been absorbed in the first half as the amount of capacity that has been much higher than average and, therefore, while there is still some cover at this point in time, it is very &#x2013; or it remains quite limited such that, indeed, if you have another repeat of this first half year, the impact on the Farmers Re would be much lower as a result of exhausting this cat cover.</p>
          <p>With regard to the Z-ECM, you're right that the lower exposure on equity would reduce the sensitivity and we both provide that update on sensitivities for the 3Q results when we will update you on all the Z-ECM, SST and Solvency I ratio.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Thank you. Just if I can start with the global corporate. You mentioned in your comment that energy is one of the lines where you increased pricing. And I've heard from some other insurers that energy in the corporate side is something that people are cleaning up. Could you just remind us what exactly has been the issue with energy if it's just pricing, it it's terms and conditions? And why did it need this kind of price improvement because workers' comp, we can understand, but energy was something if you could comment on.</p>
          <p>And second question is on the choice of deals gains, so for example, when you were talking about Eurozone tail risk, you've chosen to hedge the equity rather than cut your Spanish exposure in terms of sovereigns or covered bonds. And is there something that there was a debate and what was the deciding factor of this debate, if I can ask that?</p>
          <p>And then on Farmers, just last question from me, on Farmers, what would &#x2013; could you just remind us at what point would you think about increasing the All Lines Quota Share given that Farmers is now at 36% of this ratio? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, thank you very much for these questions. With regards to energy, this is a very competitive line of business and has been the case. So, what we have done is really review our strategy and how we can improve the profitability and this improvement of the profitability goes through typically the two same actions as we've taken throughout in GI, one which is some strong rate increases, especially for those customers where we thought that could be adjusted. But also we've been paring down the portfolio as a result of that so that we can continue in that business and we can continue beneficially for both parties.</p>
          <p>The Eurozone tail risk, actually I forgot what the question was.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>The decision on the hedge.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The decision on the hedge, yes. And maybe Cecilia or Martin can comment further with regard to the strategy, but still more on the technical point of why the equity put options was chosen rather than credit spread. There's a very high correlation between the two, first of all. That's a very important factor. And then when you compare the two and the costs of the two doing some hedges on the credit is much harder because you've got higher spreads, more in liquidity and you have to do it in a much bigger size. So, when we look at the reducing the risk, which is what really been focusing on, we found that the most effective way of doing that was through that strategy. And then Martin has here <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:48) comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="indiscernible" /> (37:49) thanks a lot to what you have just explained. Of course, there was a debate at the time as there's always a good debate about any cost decision you take, an let me stress as well, this has not been a change of our scenario. I still believe that the Eurozone will hold up, but that's at least cash increased substantially beginning of the second quarter, end of last &#x2013; end of the first quarter. We have looked at it and made an assessment whether our capital is really effectively placed in order to get the right time for shareholders and that was not any more the case as expected returns will be lower at risk levels at the time.</p>
          <p>And the very specific decision that you have to take is that as you have been alluding to where you sort of get the maximum benefit for any risk hedging, i.e. not threatening too much of potential return expectation, what their macro-hedge consideration. And at the time of that debate, there was a bit of a mispricing i.e. equity, equity did not really price in that risk so the equity hedge was much more economical relative to a hedge of any fixed income exposure in any of the respective PIIGS countries, and that's really the main reasoning. And I think we feel very good with the way we have implemented that now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I mean the fixed income hedging would be expensive, but actually reducing the underlying may have also been an option. That's what I was asking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. But then you look for the investment alternative. Then you go soon into cash and then it becomes &#x2013; or indirectly, Vinit, you have to hedge again then, so but that was I think fairly well done by our investment colleagues.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think you had the last question which was our thoughts about the increase in the All Lines Quota Share and our surplus. So just as a reminder, the surplus ratio of the exchanges, currently at 36%. So it's well within our range of 32% to 40%, which we communicated earlier and, therefore, it's quite comfortable within that range. We look at the All Lines Quota Share on a regular basis and then clearly we will review that as part of that exercise, but currently there are no plans in changing that at least for this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you so much. Lovely results and unlike the underlying loss ratio, on that. Can you just say &#x2013; you remember when Mario Greco, who about 10, 15 years ago said you want to beat the, I think, it was combined ratio of peers by 3% to 4% by 2013, I think it was. I guess you've reached that target now. It feels like you have, but I just wondered and maybe give us a feel <mark type="indiscernible" /> (41:04) of what has changed or not changed, I don't know.</p>
          <p>And then on Farmers Re, in that nice chart where you show the underlying &#x2013; the implicit business operating tax, business operating profit ROEs of each division. You also show Farmers as forty -- about -- seven percent in the first half. Now working backwards from that, it means that the capital is about $2 and a little bit billion, maybe $2.2 billion. This, you have $2 billion of sub-debt which you've kind of lent to Farmers, which implies that Farmers Re has zero capital. Is that right or $200 million on a premium of $4 billion. Just to get a feel for it. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Martin. Let me take the first question, as you referred to a former great professional and good colleague and friend, Mario Greco. What I can say has not changed. This is the strategy and the strategy remains intact as it has been, our strategies and targets we're setting out. They're not dependent on any individual, but really on the interest of the firm, and with that, that target we have described back in to &#x2013; end of 2009 at the Investor Day to achieve 3 to 4 percentage points better combined ratio relative to peers is still intact. So keep in mind that's a target that defined for end of next year.</p>
          <p>Also, our efficiency targets are still intact there, I should say, it's more than a feeling if you're on course or not. I think we are probably ahead it. We will update you at the Investor Day later on this year on the details about that. Overall on the combined ratio, sensing I think we're doing well. The underlying attritional loss ratio shows that and if I just take that somehow of a guideline benchmarking against that combined ratio expression, I would say it feels good we are on track. I hope that gives a bit of a flavor how our feelings are expressed, Michael.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And onto your second question with regard to the BOPAT ROE, so we are allocating some capital to Farmers Re. So, it's I think you don't have &#x2013; while your overall reasoning is correct, you'd have to go finer into the details to really see how much is allocated. For example, the surplus is not $2 billion. It's $1.9 billion, and there are some other elements there.</p>
          <p>However, what I would also highlight is while the capital to Farmers Re is not zero, it is not that big either, and the key reason is that the APD actually has a limited when you look at the range of outcomes, it is a typically less risky type of treaty than others. And therefore, the capital allocation on that one is low.</p>
          <p>Also, as we have mentioned, there is a limit on the cat, All Lines Quota Share treaty which also reduces the risk. So all in all, when you look at the specific features of the Quota Shares, the capital consumption relative to the premium is typically lower than it definitely would be if you did the <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:48) for the exchanges, but the exchanges, as you know, are third party and because also, we're largely in personal life, personal lines is also an area where the capital and consumption is quite small.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon altogether. I have two questions. The first one is I think on actually it's about bridging your &#x2013; so a figure as a whole astonished me during this result is that, yes, enormous, large claims actually in the same amount than last year in terms of percentage <mark type="ph" /> point of the (45:37) combined ratio, but last year you had Japan, New Zealand, Australia. This year, I mean, if you add up what you said in the presentation, account to some $170 million, but the figure there is $1,276 million. So my question is if you could give me some more detail or in order that I could abridge this figure, understand what else is in because I have a gap for some $1.1 billion.</p>
          <p>And the second one, if I look to your intangible position, it increased pretty dramatically from some $6 billion to $8 billion, and here looking forward two or three years from now, where should we expect this figure to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, Fabrizio, thank you very much for your question. Your question on the large losses, so all the events that you're referring to, such as New Zealand and Japan earthquake as well as the Australian floods and other cats that we had, were actually reported in cats. So the capacities where the impact last year was 4% or almost close to $600 million and this year, the impact of cat was zero.</p>
          <p>So there is a massive difference here indeed in terms of big, major natural catastrophes. The large losses do not include any of that and typically our policy has been anything above $100 million qualifies for major cat, and that anything below. So, the large losses, we would never expect them to be zero. Typically, they range between 7% and 9% if you look at the last years. And these losses are $2 million, $3 million. So a $10 million loss, that we start to notice, but we will always expect to have large losses.</p>
          <p>So, we have that and it's been a bit lower this year than last year, but we would still expect to have there part of the large losses that had an impact this year was, as I mentioned in the video, hail storms that we had both in Germany and Switzerland, sorry. And we had also if you look at the first half year, you may remember the winter was very, very cold. That also had an impact and I guess the last is although that was more third quarter than second quarter, it was relatively wet in England right now. At least there is no crops wet in the U.K.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the intangibles, the answer is yes, you're right. It did increase substantially, but this is, in essence, due to the Santander joint venture, where a large part of our purchase was recorded intangible assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but is there any plan &#x2013; I mean, will this figure stay stable going forward over the next two to three years? Or I know that external auditors tells to you that this is all reliable and nothing needs to be written down and so on. Still, will there be some adjustments to this figure maybe in the next two, three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this figure is typically driven by the acquisitions we make. So if we don't make any other acquisition, that number would actually decline. Part of this intangible asset consists of a distribution agreement. That's true also for Sabadell. These are typically amortized over the time of the distribution agreement. So in the case of Santander, it will be 25 years. So that number over time will go down.</p>
          <p>And then, of course, we'll review on a quarterly high level, and then on detailed basis, annual basis whether the value of that intangible asset is still justified. This is essentially doing what you guys do extremely well, which is a discounted cash flow analysis using an appropriate discount rate of the value of that, and then if the value based on this discounts and cash flow analysis is lower than what is booked, then that would cause an impairment.</p>
          <p>We are making just on that point perhaps, we're making very good progress in the operation of Santander, as you may have seen on slide 15, I believe. We're growing our statutory profit by 18%. The cooperation is working really well, and we're very pleased with the way it's going, and it's really according to our expectations.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. You partly answered some of my questions, so sorry for that. First of all, what are your expectation regarding the general insurance expense ratio? Are you expecting any of this happening, decreasing, increasing, et cetera?</p>
          <p>Secondly, do you expect the All Lines Quota Share of treaty of Farmers to be back to 12% in Q3? And finally, in Q1 and Q2 international businesses generated between 3% and 5% of your General Insurance business operating profit. Are you happy with <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:32) contribution of international businesses, or do you expect an increasing contribution as it was a target for the group both in Life and in Non-Life? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thank you very much. With regards to the expense ratio, what we're seeing in line with our strategy is we've been focusing on &#x2013; first actually, we've been focusing on reducing expenses in mature markets. So with regard within the expense ratio the other underwriting expenses was, as we're focusing on reducing expenses, we would expect that to also have a positive impact on the technical expenses. Should keep in mind that we're looking at really the overall expenses so that program has an impact both in the technical expense, as well as the non-technical expense, as well as in the loss adjustment expenses. So, it's a bit everywhere, but I'm pleased to report that on that, we're making very good progress on our target to 2013 to reduce the overall expense by &#x20AC;500 million as we have communicated and we'll give you some further update at our Investor Day.</p>
          <p>With regards to the commission ratio, that ratio has been affected by the fact that the commission structure in Santander is higher than the group average. So, that has had an impact of increasing the commission ratio, and that we would expect to continue since at least for the next 25 years, given our agreement with Santander. But that is not necessarily something we're worried because the business overall is profitable. So we're happy to continue that association.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Quota Share, as I mentioned early in the questions, the Quota Share is currently at 20% and we have no plans to change it, at least for this year. So, no for 12% going forward, at least not this year.</p>
          <p>And then the international markets, we clearly -- as you know, we are focusing on growing in international markets we've identified, and there are a lot of these markets are in Latin America, as well in Asia. We're very pleased with the growth that we're experiencing. You can see in particularly in GI that most of the growth actually comes from that in international markets, and then clearly as the business develops and grows, we would expect the BOP contribution to grow as well.</p>
          <p>And Martin, maybe you want to make some further comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just maybe to add as well, Raphael, on that question, you asked are we happy with the development. We're definitely very satisfied because this is exactly in line with the strategy. I really look for a profitable growth opportunity into new markets, and if you see for the first six months, take an <mark type="ph" /> axis peak (54:47) out, GI as an example, 27% up in international markets versus 2% down in Europe, and this is nearly four times overcompensating, and we are relatively early into that sort of joint venture on distribution with Santander in Latin America next to our organic own pipeline. We're relatively early into the acquisition in Malaysia.</p>
          <p>The same strategy, obviously, pursue as well in Life and that is also kicking in now in Latin America. So, I would expect over time on the assumption that the economic growth in mature market is going to remain low. It might level off somehow as well in emerging markets, but it's going to remain positive. In Europe we're fighting recession, full stop. And I do not see that to change over the next two quarters, frankly.</p>
          <p>So I would see that this trend we showing here will continue. We will find a base in Europe and then I also see that we're going to grow back into Europe, as we at the moment grow well in North America with 5% in GI and the global corporate 3% altogether. That includes also mature markets. So, the numbers we're showing here are exactly in line what we have defined in the strategy and with that, we are very pleased.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Daniel Bischof from Helvea. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Actually just one question left on pricing in GI, you achieved a price increase of 4.1% in Q2 after 3.1% in Q1. Can you just remind us again what portion of this price increase do you expect to translate into an actual improvement of the underlying loss ratio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the rate increases, we expect to exceed the claims inflation. So, as a result, we expect an improvement in the underlying loss ratio, but clearly the pure rate increase is not going to flow through one for one into the loss ratio given the claims inflation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But would one-third be a good assumption?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One-third, we &#x2013; no. Look, I think, there is &#x2013; it varies by business and the trends change. So that's why we're really careful in giving you an indication there. We're satisfied to tell you that the rate increases do exceed the loss-cost inflation. Giving you a percentage I think is going to be dangerous. But, I would still say that the claims inflation is running &#x2013; how should I express that? Just that only one-third of the rate increases would be absorbed by the loss cost would still be too low, because then you're implying that loss-cost inflation is only 1%, or very slightly above 1%, which it is higher in certain lines.</p>
          <p>But, again you really need to look at it on a line-by-line business, because we're seeing in certain lines of business inversely 0% to 1%. But, then those lines where the combined ratio is really good, then we may not necessarily take some rate increases, and that would be completely appropriate. So, when you go into the details it becomes more complicated.</p>

          <p>Impressive discipline. I want to take then this occasion to thank you all for joining us today and for your questions. Also on behalf of Pierre, of course, let me just quickly end with some messages and, as I said earlier, we believe that these are solid, strong results in a pretty challenging environment. We do remain profitable, we are well-capitalized, we improved solvency, and we are on track to deliver on our targets for this year and for 2013.</p>
          <p>We are very pleased with this performance and we do remain very confident that we are on the right track and that we are well-positioned to deal with any situation whatever the future may hold. We will continue to focus on the execution of the strategy, which is clearly working not only this year but throughout the last five years since the crisis started. And with that, we are continue doing that the Zurich way, which is with discipline and focus. And I'm very much looking, together with Pierre and all my colleagues, to soon catch up with you again in person or latest at our nine months results reporting and not too much later than today.</p>
          <p>And with that, I thank you all. I wish you a nice day and good luck in the markets. Thank you.</p>
