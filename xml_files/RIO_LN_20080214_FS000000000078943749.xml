          <p>Tim Gerrard from Austock Securities.  Look, I do have several questions, but I'll just start with two.  Can you &#x2013; can someone please, maybe Tom talk a little bit about La Granja and you did mention unique metallurgical insights and processes that you're using there.  And in lieu of your comments that you see yourselves as a leader in the sector, could you elaborate a little bit more on those unique processes for La Granja?  And while we're on copper, with regard to resolution in the last quarterly, there was reference to a pretty impressive intersection of 300 meters at 2.2% copper.  In the past, you've talked about that as being a 1 to 2 billion ton resource, inverted <mark type="inaudible" /> or mineralization with a grade of between 1 and 2%.  What sort of upside do you see on resolution bearing in mind our successful land swap and the sorts of intersections you've got recently?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom will you take that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tim.  Maybe I'll first talk about La Granja and I can recall myself first going out there a few years ago looking at the project during the Peruvian privatization and at the time it had been looked at by two companies, one of them by the way BHP Billiton and had been considered unconventional milling processes with a crushing, grinding development of a concentrate, which then needed to be railed to the coast and the creation of a large tailings pond.  This is a very steeply, mountainous area and the cost particularly of a tailings facility in the area would be quite high.  In addition, the concentrate would be carrying with it high levels of arsenic, which will be very difficult to market and what we've looked at, at the time was first of all our geologists were saying don't stop, adjust this.  We think there could be some more.  But second, we were looking at the minerology and partly using some of the work we had been experienced with the Escondido sulfide leech and second recognizing with some modifications at leeching methodology.  We could basically isolate the arsenic.  We were able to find that we could get relatively high leech rates and whole rock material and that's been really what we've been focusing on from the technological side.  And I think it's some pretty unique work and I think it's going to set some of the technologists quite interested as that progresses.</p>
          <p>But just as importantly, it's a much bigger resource.  There's not just one system here, but there at least four systems there and as we continue to drill, we continue to see this thing opening up with depth and if anything, the grades are getting even higher with depth.  So, I think this is something that's a story that's going to continue to run.  It certainly hasn't bottomed out and the interesting thing about is the ore body is not buried, it actually bakes up the mountain, so you have very low strip ratio to start off with and again a very large body mineralization.  So, it's a very exciting project and reminder that we paid all of $20 million to get this privatization only two years ago.</p>
          <p>On resolution, a project we earned in from BHP Billiton for about $25 million, about five, four years ago, we are successful in finding a new ore body below the old Superior mine.  And as you said Tim we found about 1 to 2 billion tons of material and we've been saying roughly between 1 to 2%.  Well, recently we've been drilling along the edges of &#x2013; or one of the edges and one of the blocks in area which we would have been expecting a lower end of the range that we've come in with grades that are quite a bit higher.  So certainly we're shifting our program into that area and we want to get a few more intersections into that but the geologists are quite happy with what they see.</p>
          <p>Now, maybe just one comment on land exchange.  The land exchange is taking some time.  Greens Creek, when I was running Greens Creek we went through a land exchange at that time, it took us several years then to.  These are long processes.  They need to have approvals and the House of Representatives then the Senate then signed by the President.  At that the it was signed by President Clinton, we may just see it again being by President Clinton.</p>

          <p>Do we have a further question here?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Vicki Binns from Merrill Lynch.  My questions are twofold.  The first one is on taxation.  Obviously a 392 million tax benefit because of the change in the Canadian tax rate and the effect on the provisions you'd made.  Is that one-off?  And what can we expect as a tax rate ongoing?  And the second question is on iron ore.  I was pleased to hear you last night Tom, talk about a range of iron ore contract terms.  Could you please talk about how you think the iron ore pricing will evolve?  And also industry speculation that the contract you did with Hyundai recently announced it's quite long term is actually a benchmark-related contract rather than a market-price related contract?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, would you be kind enough to take the question on taxation that Vicki has posed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes sure.  Vicki the answer is, it is a one-off benefit of $392 million.  It is entirely to do with the reduction in Canadian tax rates that was approved at the &#x2013; during December of last year and caused us to change our deferred tax provisioning for all our Canadian businesses and especially for Alcan.  I should point out that we never assumed this lower tax rate for Alcan when we were evaluating it.  So, that's an upside for us in terms of Alcan.  Now, we gave guidance recently about how to model Alcan and we suggested using a Rio Tinto Alcan tax rate of 31%, which we would still suggest for Alcan and for Rio Tinto as a whole, 30 to 31%.  So, I think that you can see that there wasn't significant one-off in 2007 as there also was in 2006.</p>
          <p>In point of fact, the overall tax benefits that were one-off in 2006 totaled $521 million.  So, it was actually a lower one-off element in 2007.  If you looked at the underlying tax rate, we have actually had a higher underlying tax rate in 2007 than we had in 2006.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Guy. Tom, you take the final question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Vicki as you and I have talked about iron ore pricing over a long time, we have been talking since November about a range of market mechanisms including benchmark, including hybrid contracts and including spot prices.  These are all &#x2013; spot sales.  These are all things we've been doing over the years, but as we grow our business we see room to increasing to mix of all three.  And as we've given guidance for 2008, we're looking at roughly 15 million tons to the spot market this year to take advantage of the large delta that currently exists.</p>
          <p>We do see value and benefits to the benchmark system.  It's been a system that has worked quite well for a long period of time.  It's essentially a market clearing mechanism, but priced on a year-by-year basis, which we see it nicely complementing something which is priced in a more of a real time type of basis.  We also see the mix providing opportunity to see through some of the various different characteristics of different types of materials and the different value add that those type of materials might have to different particular customers.</p>
          <p>In the case of the Hyundai, again we see value in components of the benchmark type system, but again we see a overall mixing as we've said in China with benchmark spot and hybrid contracts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Stephen we still with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we have another question here in Sydney, Paul.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good evening.  It's <mark type="inaudible" />.  Paul, I'm just curious to understand a little bit more about your position with regards to the offer.  I understand the value argument.  That's fine.  I'm just wondering BHP has raised the offer now.  Is it &#x2013; are you happy to talk to them?  Or is this still a position of we're even still not prepared to talk even at 3.4 because I mean if I look at it, I mean I don't think you'd disagree.  There is a lot of value to be unlocked by putting the two businesses together.  Clearly just by acquiring Alcan you've doubled your synergies from what you previously thought.  Clearly the synergies that are being counted are 1.7 billion under state clearly what could be achieved.  I mean are you in a position where you can talk?  Or is there still, as you put it two ballparks away?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the ballparks was out of Tom's sporting lexicon and I'll leave that definition with him, but, our position is really very clear.  I think the results that we've spoken about this morning for you are evidence that we have a company moving with great forward momentum, creating a lot of value off the back of assets of high quality, which are very well managed, and we see if anything as Tom has spoken, a gap between ourselves and the BHP beginning to open up.</p>
          <p>So we think we are creating significant value.  For us to leave that, base course, would need a considerable economic incentive.  Now, we've had two propositions of different sorts put to us, which our Board has looked at very careful with the help of advisors.  We think we have a pretty good sense of what the value of the company is.  We do recognize that there are some synergistic possibilities in that combination.  We also think there are some potential risks in the delivery of those synergies.  Some of them fall in the regulatory field.  Our view is that we have not yet seen an economic frame of discussion, which would want us to start a serious discussion.  And I think we have to wait until that presents itself,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe Paul, I'll comment about the ballparks. <mark type="inaudible" /> I've never been much of a sporting fan.  So, it'd be very difficult for me to be any more precise than that.  What I've said today is there's a lot of open water, but I'm sure there is many in the room there have more a nautical bent than I am, so I couldn't be any more precise than that either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello its <mark type="inaudible" />  Just got two questions like others.  Firstly, aluminum, the <mark type="inaudible" /> etcetera have talked long and hard about the various aspects of the value chain and in the past Rio's been quiet clearly that it particular likes wafer and the ability to extract economic rent out of a quality bauxite asset.  Can you just explain to us where you see the ability to extract maximum economic rent in the aluminum supply chain today?  And secondly, a bit of longer term question.  Your pushing the Pilbara as I understand it is ultimately to move to much more of a remote mining operation.  Can you just give us a bit more clarity around that and try and explain this sort of the value opportunity that you see by doing so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  <mark type="inaudible" /> I'll tackle both of these.  First of all, on aluminum and the value chain, we have been in the business of producing bauxite and alumina and aluminum metal for not only years but decades.  So we understand this business quiet well.  We see a different times in the cycle, different components that are extracting more or less economic rent at different points in time but over time all three of these main areas stopping at the production of aluminum metal is what fits nicely, our competencies and what fits nicely the balance of value add.  And it's important to recognize that each of these steps you're essentially adding another zero to the price.  So, you're seeing considerable uplift in the average price with each of those average steps.</p>
          <p>Now again, getting beyond aluminum metal into fabrication, into other products, which is what historically say a vertically integrated aluminum company would do ,wouldn't be playing to our strengths.  So, that even though the Alcan packaging and engineer products businesses are very good businesses in their own right and they're leaders in their respective sectors.  They're again not playing for our strengths, which is why we flagged them for asset sales.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the Pilbara, I have been very excited by the work that both the Rio Tinto iron ore team has been doing and also our technology innovation group based out of Brisbane have been doing to combine to develop a integrated system approach.  The conventional approach again for control and monitoring is that each individual operation has its own 24/7 control systems at each of the loading points, at each of the unloading points in the production chain.  And you've all seen these as you've visited sites, operators looking at computer screens attached to distributed control systems.  And what we are looking at doing now is bringing these operators, bringing these control systems out of these remote locations where they're very expensive to house and it's very difficult to attract and retain people and bring them into a more urban environment, which we're developing ultimately in the Perth Airport area.</p>
          <p>We currently have a trial of this in the Perth CBD just visiting it a few weeks ago where we are currently on a real time basis, unloading and loading our cars, our rail cars remotely from the Perth CBD and I can tell you it's a lot easier to attract and retain people and a lot cheaper in terms of the whole cost, whether its fly-in, fly-out or buying or building homes at roughly $700,000 per piece to do that in the CBD versus doing it in the Pilbara.  Now, that's the first phase, the second phase will be automation, which we're currently trialing, we're currently running automated locomotives.  And then that's going to be matched with a third phase where by the end of this year we will be running a part of one of our pits with a isolated group of remote controled trucks and we'll basically be mining a part of one of the pits over the next several years without drivers in the trucks.  And this represents a fundamental shift in technology and more and more these control systems are not going to be in the Pilbara, more and more of these control systems are going to be bail space to places such as Perth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I add a comment to some of the things that Tom said about the supply chain in answer to <mark type="inaudible" /> question?  I just think there's a point to be made, which is that our supply chain although it is &#x2013; we're operating in the same fields as every other integrated aluminum company, does enjoy certain very important comparative advantages.  The first is that predominantly we're based on hydroelectric power in Canada and chiefly in Canada and that's an advantage which we think is going to increase as time goes on as carbon is priced more expensively.  The second big advantage is technology.  The AP technology is owned by Alcan and now by us and we think that, that is the leading technology in the field of smelting.  And the third advantage, which not all integrated aluminum producers enjoy, is that we are overwhelmingly in OECD countries.  So I think when you look at the value chain, you've got to consider how differentially placed we are.  We think we're very favorably placed as compared to others.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You have the floor.  I wonder if we perhaps invite you to pick up two or three questions from Melbourne and then we'll revert to our Sydney audience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Neil Goodwill from Goldman Sachs JBWere.  Just a couple of question as well.  Just on hoping you could run through the exceptional items, what the write ups were, what the write downs were.  And also could you just go into more detail on those derivative benefits that you've got?  And particularly what the risks are going forward in terms of the magnitude and the upside and downside to those.  And also could you give us an update on how you're seeing the infrastructure in Eastern Australia with your coal situation just in terms of what you see your potential shipments to be this year and next year given the expansions there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Guy I think the first two parts are clearly with you and Tom will perhaps take the infrastructure question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  There are a number of exclusions as there always are from underlying &#x2013; from net earnings to arrive at underlying earnings.  Now, the first is the profits less the losses on the disposable of interests in businesses, very modest number.  Then, we have impairments, I'll come back to that.  Then there are exchange gains on external debt and intra-group balances, that's a big item, about $150 million positive.  And then there are gains on currency and interest rate derivatives, which don't qualify for hedge accounting.  A small positive 35 and then there are other items of about 200 million negative, which relates to a whole range of areas particularly the uplift in Alcan inventories to fair value, the expense of the Alcan acquisition and of the integration and of various other items of like kind.</p>
          <p>Now, on the subject of impairments we have again a number of areas.  First of all, we have the reversal of the Palabora impairment.  You may remember that we impaired that during 2004.  Its performance has really turned round as Tom touched on earlier as well as our view as the copper price has gone up quite a bit, so the after tax effect of that, our share of it is a positive number of 100 million.  At Tarong we impaired that in 2006, but you would have seen that we have agreed to sell that business.  And as a consequence of that, we have felt it appropriate to reverse that with a number of 134 million positive.  At Argyle we have already announced an impairment at the half year of 328 million US net after tax.  And then there are other minor items giving a net-net figure of negative 113 million.</p>
          <p>Now, you asked about the derivative items and what that all meant. This is the result of an accounting standard, which we abide by under IFRS and we exclude it but we don't think it's in the normal course of our business.  We don't really have very many hedging contracts at all in the business.  We don't, as a matter of policy, hedge either prices or exchange rates or interest rates.  There are embedded however, in some of our contracts what are deemed under the standard to be derivative type mechanisms.  There are also changes that arise as a result of the functional currencies of some of our businesses.  I would emphasize that these are not cash items and that in general you can see them moving positively or negatively in each year.  They have not been very material in our results since IFRS was established.  So, I mean, I think that, I never say these things are unimportant, but we have put them outside of the underlying earnings for a good reason.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Guy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  If I may I now talk about our Eastern coal business and some of these infrastructure constraints.  As you know I've spent quite a bit of time talking with senior government leaders about some of these challenges and some of these issues, which are not only affecting Rio Tinto's coal business in Queensland and New South Wales but they're affecting the entire industry.  And they're having such an effect that they're constraining total supply going into the Asian coal markets.  And again, this is something that really needs continued work and we have provided some input.  For example, in our opinion and the submissions we have made in the Hunter Valley, there should be a balancing between port contracts and port commitments and those that have rail commitments.  And if you don't have rail commitments basically that should be taken into consideration when allotting port space.</p>
          <p>It also is important to recognize that the open access regime basically provides a mechanism for more mines to come in than the infrastructure is capable of delivering and that creates a less than efficient scheme because when you throw in smaller players in the middle of larger players, what happens is it tends to create less capacity at the individual ports themselves as ships aren't necessarily loaded as efficiently as they can be loaded.  We certainly think a New South Wales the creation of a facilitator to look into this is a very healthy development and we've been very encouraged by the Queensland Premier's commitment for upgrading the Queensland infrastructure.  Now, more specifically and this is before the recent rains, which has certainly disrupted coal production in Queensland we were looking at a port allocation for the coal and allied business, not too far off the allocation we would have seen in 2007.</p>
          <p>In Queensland I think what we're looking at is a situation where while Dalrymple Bay expansion continues, there have continued to be curtailments at certain times for some of the tie ins, but once that expansion is complete we'll see more shipment s coming out of Dalrymple Bay.  I think the past month the very high rainfalls, while they've been very, very good in addressing the tough drought conditions in Queensland, they've also put a lot of water in a number of the pits.  We came out of that pretty well.  I mean I was very pleased.  I was up at Queensland at that time, but to see that within days we were back up and running at Hail Creek we had to stock pile of work off of.  So, we are virtually unaffected and that puts us in a position now where others aren't able to feed into the coal chain, they're not able to deliver.  We've seen prices increased and we're very well positioned to deliver in that particular market.  So, I would suggest that things will be adjusting over the next several months as we see actually which coal mines are impacted and for how much and how long a time and what the duration of that impact will be.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Craig Campbell from Morgan Stanley.  With the strong results particularly ahead of iron ore in Australia and looking ahead, obviously strong contract pricing coming up.  You're generating lot of franking credits and just wondering obviously you've been busy with the Alcan acquisition.  But do you have any plans in futures to how you may release franking credits in greater quantities to Australian-based shareholders?  And second question, just with regard the current coal situation, one of your competitors noted they may be moving to a quarterly contract on coking coal.  I was just wondering if that discussion has come up at all in any of your negotiations.  And then finally just wondering if there's any color you could give us on the progress of the iron ore negotiations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, will you address franking credits and Tom take the other two?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Well, look, a fully franked dividend which is what you get is as franked as it can be, we can't make it any more franked.  Now, what we can do is increase the dividends, which is what we've done.  We've increased them by 30%, 31% this year and we promise to increase some by at least 20% for the next two years.  So, we're very focused on returning good returns to our shareholders through the dividend mechanism.  Now, we do recognize that we are building, thanks to the success that we've had in our Australian operations particularly iron ore a big franking balance here.  And it's perfectly true.</p>
          <p>So, I think that higher dividends is the first thing we must do.  At some point in the future, it may have been necessary for us to raise some money through equity.  Now, at the present time that is not necessary.  Our gearing is coming down rapidly as I said but our bias, if we were able to raise equity would be to do so in the limited shares.  Apart from anything else, they have a higher price so it would be more efficient to do that, but there would be the secondary benefit of having a broader base on which to release those franking credits.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  First of all, on the coal situation, we are in I think a quite an unusual situation at the time with coal production being impacted, in China, in Australia, in South Africa all at the same point.  So we've seen strong coal pricing.  We've been selling spot business thermal coal north of $100 a ton, coking coal north of $200 per ton and these are prices that we wouldn't have imagined even a year ago.  We also see the trends continuing where China is moving increasingly from being a net exporter with swings in that export business to being a net importer, which I think continues to favor the coal producer, which is why we like to be Australian coal business.</p>
          <p>As we look ahead, I think we already see somewhat of a mix of long-term contracts and spot traded business and I think that's not a bad mix.  Certainly for this year we have a long-term &#x2013; we have one-year contracts in place, and as we wind through those contracts I think we'll look at a full range of possibilities.  I mean what we do over the next few years is a bit academic at this stage because we do have full-year contracts in place for 2008.  Again, we'll be looking at what the pricing for those contracts will be and certainly I see benefits in the current coal supply demand situation.</p>
          <p>In terms of iron ore negotiations, these are as you know, these things can go well into the year and I would say we're still at that stage we're too early to tell when we'll see a completion of the duration of the business.  And again we're coming out of the Chinese holiday period too, which certainly has an impact on getting meetings with anyone.  So, I think we still have some time to run on this.  But again, the conditions are the same as what I said.  That is a very strong set of supply demand fundamentals, an awful lot of room between the 2007 negotiated contract price and the current spot FOB price.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Warren Edney, ABN Amro.  I just wondered if you could give us a bit more color on the Alcan result.  After bagging the tax benefit it only generated $94 million and Tom mentioned about a stock re-evaluation, but he also indicted that most of that was in the excluded items.  So, could you talk about the integration process and what was the driver of that relatively low earnings result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Guy, I think we'll ask you if we can to give that interpretation that is being asked for.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Warren, I think the first thing to say is that nine weeks in the immediate post acquisition phase is not representative of what is a multi-decade investment.  And the reason that it isn't is that there are a number of adjustments including the stock bond, which you referred to which are &#x2013; and the expense of making the acquisition and the expense of integration, which to some degree do interrupt the initial results.</p>
          <p>Now, it's true that many of those items we did put below the line in net income.  Maybe Tom might want to amplify where we are on integration.  It's starting very, very well and the numbers are not though apart from &#x2013; some of the costs are in 2007, none of the benefits are.  I think the tax rate change is another peculiarity of 2007, which makes it a bit difficult to see that the underlying change but I think that if you look at EBITDA, that's an important way of looking at it, I think that when we consider Alcan the first half of this year will be a much more representative feature of what the business is likely to look like going forward.  And so, I don't think that you should make too much of just the first nine weeks, I would suggest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I could speak a bit about the integration efforts because they have been going at a very rapid clip and it benefits I think from the combined integration experience of both Rio Tinto and Alcan.  Dick Evans of course has been through a series of aluminum acquisitions and his experience with both the Alusuisse or the Pechiney or any of the others suggested to him that moving faster was always more successful.  And with each one we've been progressively faster.</p>
          <p>Just last week we spent two days finishing what was &#x2013; what the move from the first 100 days of the integration to the execution of integration and I spent quite a bit of time with the team last week going through the full range of 40 work streams of activity associated with that.  And we have a very aggressive effort here over the next few months, which will be leading into efforts which we will be proceeding over the subsequent period of time with a steady reduction of costs and a steady reduction and consolidation of positions as we field in the synergy effects.  Our &#x2013; we have a number of people working with us including consultants who have worked on other large integrations and they'll say that they have been &#x2013; they've never seen integrations as successful this.  We brought a new Head of HR in place who recently came from Hewlett-Packard and was involved with the Hewlett-Packard compact integration and certainly sees a lot of real benefits here compared to what he's seen in the past.</p>
          <p>So I've been very, very confident and what we're seeing from integration, which is why I've raised my integration target from that 940 million by the end of 2009 to 1.1 billion by the end of 2009.  In addition, we are now just beginning to map out those additional synergy targets we should be setting for ourselves in that post-2009 environment and some of those will be cost related, some of those will be integration of technology related, some may be like the ones that we talked about in November for example, looking at re-powering with <mark type="inaudible" /> with coal instead of with fuel oil and a number of other opportunities and I'd say that many of these will be kicking in early in 2008 but they'll be sequentially over that two-year period of time and my objective is to get them as front-end loaded as possible.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>Thank you, Tom.  Stephen, could we go back to your audience?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes <mark type="inaudible" />. I'm having just a bit trouble reading some of the notes down on the bottom, but on Page &#x2013; on Slide 29 where you're calculating your growth rate there of volumes, is that for selected commodities?  Or is that sort of the business as a whole and pre-divestments of assets you've indicated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I may answer that and Guy if you want to talk about anything else, feel free to do so.  But this would be those business that we have identified that we're going to continue to run with going forward in the future.  So, some of the things that we would be planning to divest would not be build into there.  We have &#x2013; essentially it's very difficult to add a unit of copper and a unit of aluminum and equate that to a unit of something else.  So, what we had to do is index them against consensus for market pricing to come with apples-and-apples additions and created that index on that basis.  But again it's &#x2013; I think it's important to emphasize, this would be a volume growth.  This will be a volume growth of materials essentially produced.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Maybe I can just add a little bit to that <mark type="inaudible" />. I mean we've done our best with this based upon public data that exists from BHP Billiton or which has been released by consultants.  And we have used in one or two cases consultants to help us with that.  In the case of Rio Tinto these are internal forecasts that match the public represented data.  And some of that has not been presented before, particularly for coal, uranium and copper byproducts.  But we've included a very broad range so for Rio Tinto we've got an aluminum, alumina, iron ore, thermal coal, export metcoal, copper, gold, silver, moly and uranium.  So, I think that covers not everything.  It doesn't cover for example diamonds or industrial minerals, but it covers the main products.  And then when we come to BHP Billiton, we've covered again alumina and aluminum, iron ore again, manganese which they have we don't, the same export thermal coal and export metcoal, copper, nickel, gold, silver, lead, zinc, moly and importantly uranium and petroleum.</p>
          <p>In all cases we've done this on attributable basis.  So, again what we tried to do is to do this in a dispassionate manner using a single set of prices and I think that the result speaks for itself.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Paul Tim Gerrard here again.  I was wondering maybe if Tom could elaborate a little bit more on the scope of the Bunder diamond project in India, just approximate scope scaled timing, but also put that in context with other things in India and I'm referring to Orissa.  Is Orrisa a completed dock?  Or is there some possibility of taking advantage of these iron ore markets in India to kick start that project?  The other two quick questions I had, Guy referred to the IPT benefits of $256 million after tax, I was wondering if you can just elaborate a little bit on where that comes from?  And thirdly, with regard to something like $350 million of after-tax exploration and evaluation in 2007, clearly that's got good potential for the future but in '08 and '09, what kind of evaluation expenditures might we expect against the bottom line? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes thank you, Tim.  Bunder diamonds, we now have identified a number I believe we've said eight kimberlites in the Bunder area and we're currently in the process of both drilling and pit benching in each of these.  We are now gathering a sufficient sample for &#x2013; sufficiently large bulk sample that we can begin to do estimates of the diamond valuation and that would be used to then carry it forward to the next stage of feasibility.</p>
          <p>Of course, as we've seen in India with a number of projects, you have a series of regulatory processes.  This is an area where there's sensitive forest issues and you have to basically work very closely with the local agencies to where you put your drill holes, where you put the test pits, etcetera, but I think it's quite encouraging.  It's a surface pittable project and I think what's particularly interesting about it is that and this &#x2013; I would be more positive on Orissa, I certainly see this coming in much, much sooner before Orissa &#x2013; is that we have a very strong brand profile for our diamond business notably the Argyle diamond business in India.</p>
          <p>Argyle was essentially the catalyst to get the diamond cutting sector in India going.  Everyone knows who Argyle is, everyone knows who Rio Tinto is.  We have no problems selling diamonds from Bunder into the Indian diamond cutting sector and so essentially what we have here is very much a win-win situation and all stakeholders are very happy to see India having their own hard rock diamond mine that can feed their own diamond cutting sector.</p>
          <p>Now, on IPT benefits, I would say these &#x2013; we have defined these in the past as being &#x2013; on Orrisa. Orissa is a very attractive iron ore project but we haven't yet gotten all the pieces in place to bring it through development and I think as you've seen with a number of iron ore projects in India, the question about whether that iron ore can be exported through existing or new infrastructure or will be allowed to be exported or should we redirected into a future Indian steel sector are all important questions that part of the process.  And we have been working on this very closely for a number of years within the State of Orissa.  And I think that it's fair to say this is one where I'm going to be looking at what we can do to turn the burner up a bit on it.</p>
          <p>For IPT, as we've described IPT over the past several years, this is an effort to increase and create value through either finding cost reductions or improvements in production.  And these tend to be narrow, deep dives in very, very focused areas that we then apply consistently across several operations.  And I think we've used a couple of examples.  For example, how we would essentially create a filtering system to reduce the particulates in our lube oil and recently how we are better measuring the amount of diesel fuel we're using to look at improving efficiencies in diesel fuel.  We use so much diesel fuel around the group, it just takes small percentage improvements we can create large value improvements.</p>
          <p>Over the past year, because of the crisis in the tire sector we have been very closely benchmarking each mine's usage of tires and learning with best practice and passing them around and that has saved us an awful lot of money on our tire procurement.  But more importantly it has put us in a position where we've avoided production losses that would have otherwise occurred had we not had those tires available.  So, these would be the types of things, narrow deep dives in technical areas by very experienced technical professionals that we basically mobilize all around the world, not just in one location but they spend time in many operations, common KPIs, common benchmarks.</p>
          <p>And finally, on the exploration and evaluation.  The bulk of the money that we're spending on exploration and evaluation goes beyond the normal greenfield type work and it's essentially taking both our discoveries, through to feasibility, for example places like Simandou but also to add additional resources, add additional mineralization at places like the Pilbara.  We are now drilling about a half million meters a year in the Pilbara for example and that would be included in this type of number.</p>
          <p>These are very large expenditures, big investments, but these are the foundation-type investments that are there to create the mineralization, to upgrade the resources, to turn into reserves that we can create the feasibility studies, mine plans and more production from.  So, again as we move forward with things like <mark type="inaudible" /> as we move forward with things like <mark type="inaudible" /> we're going to see these types of expenditures representing the foundation piece for the future production growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I might add on the numbers just to help Tim with his model or with his forecast just a little bit more on that exploration if I may.  I mean the numbers that were of the kind that Tom's just been talking about, exploration and evaluation costs, that was the big numbers as he said and if you add to that the exploration costs that are being conducted around the business units, so kind of local exploration all of which is expense to the business unit.  That totaled pre-tax $380 million in 2007.  And then central exploration, which is more in the character of greenfield exploration was $190 million.</p>
          <p>Now these numbers would be affected by a change from evaluation into commitment at which point we would start capitalizing some of the costs. So, it really depends on when we begin to move forward with say Simandou.  But I think that we're not likely to give up at these levels of evaluation, I think they're looking very good.</p>
          <p>The other factor I think needs to borne in mind in these numbers is the high level of asset sales that we made from the exploration portfolio in 2007, a total number of $253 million before tax.  So, I think that you can see from that that we've got significant investment and the level of evaluation shows how successful the exploration has been.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wonder if I could suggest unless guided otherwise by Stephen or Guy that we perhaps take one more question from each of the locations before bringing the session to a close.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Paul, we've got one more question here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello yes this is <mark type="inaudible" /> Excellent set of results.  Just two questions.  One would say or it could be argued that Alcan, you may have overpaid for Alcan at roughly 22, 23 times net earnings, but the synergy value obviously is coming through.  It's a bit of double edged sword in that if you actually look at even CVRD's bid for Xstrata just recently and we all know the multiples there.  We would maintain that relative to BHP the net multiple could be anywhere between 23 to 26 or even 27 times for prize assets for Rio.  Relative to considering that maybe you overpaid for Alcan but it's maybe coming through that you actually are going to deliver on that, what would you say would be a earnings multiples that you'd expect out of the merging or acquisition with BHP?  That's the first question.  And next question is resource companies have a bit of a notoriety in always maintaining that prices are going to go through the roof and I only remember nickel.  People were saying that the dollar was going to go to 50,000, $60,000 a ton and zinc and so on.  If you look at long-term averages, what is your worse case scenario on your commodities outlook?  We maintain that volumes U.S., with China are &#x2013; there's a structural shift in volume demand round the world, but if you look at demand growth over the next three to four years, we would say that possibly China is recomposing their GDP.  So, we believe that China will not increase its production to more than 500 and maybe 10 million tons of steel next year.  What's your worst case outlook for commodities in the medium term please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're pretty big questions, both of them.  What I might suggest, Guy is that you offer a short response to each of them then we'll see whether there is anything more to be said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul.  Let me start on the first one.  I mean I'm not going to go into what an appropriate multiple should be for any future offer which BHP might make for us.  We've been very clear in saying that the present offer is nowhere near where it would need to be to get us to engage.  In any case I'm a little skeptical of the use of multiples as the most appropriate way of looking at value of a company.  We're very long term in our orientation and I think that factor would apply to anybody looking at mining companies.  So, that would be the first comment.</p>
          <p>In respect of long-term prices and the worst case, I think you referred to the long-term average and the first thing I would say is that we definitely believe that there has been a structural shift so that even if most prices are above equilibrium, which we think they are, when equilibrium is eventually reached a matter of years away in some cases many years away, we don't think it will revert to anything resembling the historical average.</p>
          <p>The reason for that is there have been structural shifts in the cost curves of most of the products in which we're involved.  Thanks to a decline in US dollar, an increase in energy prices, a structural increase in a few other costs that compose &#x2013; that lead to marginal costs and we've drawn attention to some of those in the fields of aluminum and iron ore for example where we've shown that China which occupies the fourth quartile has a series of reasons why a floor exists under that price.</p>
          <p>So, I think that the worst case is not something that unduly preoccupies us.  All our investments are predicated on, in the long term much lower prices than today's prices and we feel pretty confident about the outlook as is quite clearly demonstrated in Vivek's paper, which some of you would have had a chance to read and is enclosed with the documents today.</p>
