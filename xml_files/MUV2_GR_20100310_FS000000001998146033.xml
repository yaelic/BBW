          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Good morning to those participants listening from the U.S. Today, we are having our first conference for this week starting with the financial development in 2009, including market-consistent embedded value and reserving disclosure. These topics will be covered by J&#xF6;rg Schneider today. Tomorrow we will host our Annual Conference on strategic issues for the Munich Re Group as all as for the primary and reinsurance business. In addition, there will be an update on risk management and capital. Nikolaus von Bomhard, Torsten Oletzky, Torsten Jeworrek and Joe Heflin will be the main speakers in London. So the purpose of today's call is to have a concluding discussion of the 2009 results details in order to be able to focus on the outlook tomorrow.</p>
          <p>J&#xF6;rg will now start with a presentation that will be followed by the usual Q&amp;A. In the interest of the other participants in the call, I would like to ask you to limit the number of your questions to two questions per person. So, J&#xF6;rg, please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Christian. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'll start &#x2013; let's kick off with slide three. This is a quick wrap up of the key numbers, which I had already presented on the second of February, therefore I don't have to repeat them now. You see strong top line growth, very pleasing consolidated results, very good underwriting performance in reinsurance and in primary insurance, overall a very good year for Munich Re Group.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, slide four, this is the overview of the numbers. Our gross premiums written went up by 3.6 billion, of which one-third was due to acquisitions and two-thirds due to organic growth. The investment results went up by 33% to 7.88 billion. The operating result was up 23% and consolidated result up 62%.</p>
          <p>On slide six, our capitalization. Throughout the financial crisis, our capitalization has been very strong. At the end of last year, we had regulatory solvency capital ratio of 268% more or less unchanged to the preceding quarter and also years. We had a low-to-mid single digit billion capital buffer according to rating agency models. And we had an increase buffer according to our own economic model, which will in future be the basis for our capital requirements under Solvency II.</p>
          <p>The available financial resources went up by four billion to 28.4 billion. This was due to the increase of shareholders' equity plus positive impacts from discounting of claims reserve and the MCEV as far as not anyway reflected in IFRS equity. From these available financial resources, we can deduct some 1.7 billion for the dividend and the share buybacks to be paid out until end of April. Leaves us with available financial resources then of 26.7 billion and our economic risk capital, our capital requirements went up by 0.9% &#x2013; by 0.9 billion, 900 million to 17.4 billion, which leaves us in economic capital buffer of 9.3 billion, including 4.3 billion hybrid capital.</p>
          <p>Our risk disclosure and capital position is now part of our Annual Report on the pages 154 and following. And tomorrow, you will hear lots more details from Joe Heflin. We had a substantial increase in the book value per share, which increased to &#x20AC;114.90. The development since January 2005 was equivalent to a combined annual growth rate of 5.4% in spite of the very high level of distributions and share buybacks.</p>
          <p>Munich Re's financial solidity has also been reflected out externally by the low beta of the Munich Re stock and the very low CDS spreads, which are substantially lower than of all other major banks and other financial institutions and insurance companies. So far, risk capitalization solid like always.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to slide 10, with a lock on our investment portfolio. We have investments with a market value of 185 billion and 86% or 164 billion fixed income investments. Within that portfolio, we had a cautious shift from government bonds and structured credit into corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe in the first half of 2009. In the second half, we reduced our exposure to corporate bonds by buying derivative protection and in the first quarter of 2010, we sold part of that portfolio and of the corresponding derivatives. That demonstrates quiet clearly that we are not only sitting on a low risk portfolio, but that we are actively managing the portfolio in order to increase the yield in spite of the overall moderate risk profile of the portfolio. Our exposure to equities taking into account the derivatives was 2.8% compared to 1.7% a year earlier.</p>
          <p>Let's have a look on the fixed interest portfolio on slide 11. You find also a lot of details in our Annual Report and in the backup to this presentation. I would like to point your attention to the government bonds, which make up for 44% of our fixed interest portfolio and here our exposure to countries like Greece, Spain, Ireland and with exposures of some 3% of our overall total government exposure or in other words a little bit more than 1% of our overall investments. This is easily absorbable by a portfolio like Munich Re and almost 50% of the portfolio, the government portfolio is composed of German and U.S. American debt. We feel well positioned and some yield pickup is taken here with very moderate risk overall.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the investment result on page 13. Before comparing numbers a quick look back to 2008, our equity portfolio at that time was highly protected by derivatives. Therefore, with collapsing stock markets, we had an extremely high level of impairment losses on the underlying shares, which were to a large expense compensated by gains from write-ups and disposals for corresponding derivatives. This is towards little bit the comparison between 2008 and '09.</p>
          <p>In 2009, we had a more normal year with return on investment of 4.3% and a total return of 5.7% on the portfolio. This was driven by regular income of 4.3% ROI, a substantially positive balance of gains and losses on disposal, some of it were due to forward transactions of the previous year. And we had a moderately negative balance of write-ups and write-downs.</p>
          <p>The other income and expenses is normally driven by the unrealized gains for the policyholders of the unit linked insurance product, which are fully compensated by corresponding by a similar development in the net expenses proclaims and benefits and in the technical results. You will find details on the slide 15 to 17 as well as in our Annual Report. But before we move on, a closer look on at the next page.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, you see the development for the major asset classes. And in the last two lines, we have separated the investment income for reinsurance and primary insurance, which seems to be rather interesting. It was particularly in reinsurance where we had high disposal gains. Together with the results from write-ups and downs, we had an overall positive impact of this extraordinary investment result of 1.6 percentage points and this can obviously not be repeated for 2010. In primary insurance as compared to reinsurance, we had a higher running yield, however offsets by higher write-downs and lower disposal gains.</p>
          <p>We now expect that gradual decrease of our running yield due to the low interest rate environment and this will be only partially partly compensated by courses investments in spread sensitive product like corporate bonds and Pfandbriefe. These numbers especially for reinsurance should explain our somewhat moderate outlook for the investment result of 2010. I'm convinced that things do not look much different for other insurers, who like Munich Re has decided not to run into high inadequately priced investment risks.</p>
          <p>So much for investments, now let's move on to reinsurance, the highlights on slide 19. Gross premiums written went up by 13.5%. This was due to the acquisition of Hartford Steam Boiler, Midland, Sterling, but even more due to the very strong organic growth in life and health reinsurance. We have talked about it a couple of times.</p>
          <p>Our technical result went up by 25%. The investment result declined by 249 million, but in previous year, we had the ERGO dividend of 947 million paid to the reinsurer Munich Re AG. If we adjust for the ERGO dividend in the preceding year, we have a plus in the investment result of 22%. If we also adjust the operating result for the same effect the plus would have been 45% on an adjusted basis and for the consolidated result even 76%. And even on an unadjusted basis, we had an increase of the consolidated result of 6%. So, on overall very pleasing result, which is due also to a very strong underwriting result in property casualty business.</p>
          <p>On page &#x2013; on slide 23, you find the combined ratio development. Major losses came in well below the five-year average, NatCat with just 1.4 percentage points was significantly below the average, 1.4% is net after 1% run-off gain on prior year. Man-made losses came in somewhat higher than expected. In total, 510 million or 3.6 percentage points were due to recession-related losses. Overall, our major &#x2013; the major loss impact was roughly 3% lower than anticipated and this explains the very good combined ratio of 95% apart from the good underwriting result overall.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, primary insurance, first the overview. Negative foreign exchange effects were more than compensated by the effect of the acquisition of Bank Austria Creditanstalt Versicherung in Austria and by Daum in Korea. Overall gross premiums written went up by 3%. The technical results declined by 478 million and this was mainly driven by our health and property-casualty business where we had higher net expenses for claims and benefits and a special effect in life, which I will describe later in some more detail.</p>
          <p>The investment result went up by 53%, the operating result declined by 6.6% and the consolidated result more than doubled to 375%. When you look at the net result of our subsidiary ERGO, it's 173%, so substantially lower. This is due to the fact that ERGO &#x2013; the ERGO result takes into effect all the &#x2013; into account all the consolidation effects because the dividends, the internal dividends are paid from all ERGO companies to ERGO Holding and ERGO Holding is booked here under property-casualty. That is the reason. So, the 173 is a good proxy for the Munich Re consolidated primary insurance results.</p>
          <p>As promised some more words on primary life on page 27. The recovery of the financial markets lead to a positive consolidated result in the segment primary life, nevertheless the changes in operating results shown on this slide are distorted by some special effect. The unit link business improved the investment results significantly. There is a corresponding increase in the income from technical interest, as well as in the expenses for claims and benefits. In total, there is no bottom line effect from unit link business for the technical and non-technical result.</p>
          <p>In 2008, BACAV, Bank Austria was included only in the fourth quarter figures. The full year involvement of Bank Austria Versicherung in 2009 affect all P&amp;L position. At last, in 2008, we increased the shareholders profit participation from 10 to 15% where as in 2009 a slightly lower shareholders' profit participation lowered the technical result.</p>
          <p>In order to give you a more reasonable picture from the operating result, we adjusted the P&amp;L of primary life on the following slide. For the distortions from unit linked business from Bank Austria and the changes in shareholders profit participations. And here the picture becomes somewhat clearer starting with the investment result you can see a decline. This can be explained by the high write-downs on derivative for hedging against low interest rates, whereas in 2008 we had the opposite picture with write-ups for these options.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, '09 shows an improved net result from write-ups and downs from shares and corresponding derivatives due to financial market recovery. Overall, the two effects results in the decrease in the investment result. In line with the investment result, we can see in this adjusted calculation a decline in net expenses for claims and benefits mainly as a result of lower allocations for the provisions for deferred premium refunds.</p>
          <p>In addition, net expenses for claims and benefits decreased due to lower maturities as well as lower claims payment. Also the decrease in the income from technical interest is in line with the declining investment result. The increase in operating expenses is driven by our international operations mainly by higher acquisition cost from bank distributions.</p>
          <p>So far with primary life, let's move on to property-casualty primary insurance and here especially the development of the combined ratio on slide 32. We can make it short here, the favorable combined ratio in Germany 87.9 was somewhat compensated by an increase in claims payments abroad, which was due to some kind of imported inflation there. We also had a slight increase in expense ratio just due to higher commissions whereas our admin costs went down marginally. Overall, the combined ratio of 93.1 for the full year and especially for &#x2013; of 90.0 in quarter four is excellent in comparison to almost all competitors.</p>
          <p>And now to finalize the report on IFRS numbers, let's move on to slide 34 about our reserve for reinsurance business and on the next page then together with non-life reserves for primary insurance. From a reserving perspective, 2009 has been a quite year in a positive sense. As one would expect from a carrier of our size and diversification, there have been developments in both direction that means reserve increases and releases. Bottom line, there has been a moderate release. The increase that we had seen came from isolated pockets of casualty business and from lines exposed to financial crisis related losses like credit, D&amp;O and E&amp;O business.</p>
          <p>These advanced developments were more than compensated by very consistent good news from almost all other lines. In line with our general reserving approach, we have immediately and decisively responded to all signs of adverse development whereas more tempered approach was taken in respect of the positive developments. As a function of this general approach and the largely good news that we had seen in '09, we now carry a slightly stronger margin. This increases our ability to absorb unexpected volatility in our reserves.</p>
          <p>On slide 35, you'll see a triangle for our property-casualty reinsurance and primary insurance claims reserve. The best estimate of our losses has significantly decreased compared to last year. This overall favorable development comprises movements of individual accident years in different directions.</p>
          <p>Most notable is 2008 for which we now expect more losses than a year ago. It should however be emphasized that this change is predominantly driven by a revised estimate of our business volume and not by growth assumptions about losses and profitability. In other words, we do not only expect more losses but also more premiums than a year ago.</p>
          <p>While on a stand alone basis, 397 million run-off gain appears to be a significant number, it only represents about 1% of the overall reserve volume or a little bit more than 2% of our net earned premium. Therefore, I wouldn't call this run-off profit and much rather think of it as a black zero. Probably, this is at least matched by a rather generous current reserving practice. Therefore, our bottom line result was in my view not supported by reserve releases to a large extent.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, our embedded value numbers and this is now a challenge because this is a very complex topic and it would need extremely lot of time to explain it in the appropriate detail. On the other hand, those of you who are interested in the topic can have a look on our website where we have the full comprehensive and in my view very informative report and I would now just give you a little bit of an overview here.</p>
          <p>Starting with slide 38 and first with a few remarks on the methodology; our embedded value reporting starts with a transition from last year's European embedded value to the market-consistent embedded value. While the impact for primary insurance is on balance almost negligible as you can see here in the bottom part of the page, the restatement results in the decline of the reinsurance MCEV by 1.5 billion. The lion share stems from switching to cost of capital approach.</p>
          <p>In the past, we deducted costs for residual non-hedgeable risks simply by adding spread to the risk-free discount rate. The deviation of almost one billion is because in the low interest rate environment of '08, the old approach over estimated embedded value substantially. At higher interest rates, the difference between both approaches would have been much smaller. Changes in the definition of the required capital also contribute to the reduction of the embedded value. However, it is important to note that on Munich Re Group level, there is an offsetting positive effect in the business, which is not yet measured by MCEV.</p>
          <p>As a rule of thumb for our reinsurance business, the transition from EEV to MCEV principles reduces embedded values as well as a value of new business by one quarter. Details on the changes are described in the full report. What I would like to emphasize is that similar to recent years we use prudent and very clear assumptions when calculating the embedded value. Also we do not take liquidity premiums into account and we use swap rates and volatilities as of the end of the year.</p>
          <p>On slide 39, you see the overview of the MCEV result 2009 of reinsurance. The MCEV increased by 45% mainly due to strong MCEV earnings. With regard to the opening and closing adjustments, the development of the Canadian dollar contributed overall 449 million to the rise in value of the MCEV. 2009 is characterized by an excellent new business value of 562 million. This is twice as high as the 264 million in '08. An important share results from financially motivated transactions where we provide capital relief to our customer, these are the big quota share treaties. We are confident that we will see more of that kind in 2010, but probably not to the same extent as in '09. The economic variances are also substantial.</p>
          <p>These were driven by three positive effects. First, the duration of liabilities is longer than the duration of our assets especially in our North American business. Therefore, rising interest rates in Canada and in the U.S. has unbalanced positive effect on the EV.</p>
          <p>Secondly, tightened credit spreads also had a substantial positive effect on the market value of our asset portfolio also especially in North America. Thirdly, due to higher discounting the present value of the cost of non-hedgeable risks declined.</p>
          <p>Let's move on to the MCEV result of primary insurance also very positive, but a somewhat different picture. The value of the business increased by 48% or 1.7 billion to 5.1 billion while financial markets recovered to enormous state and this is the reason. The acquisition of shares of ERGO and ERGO <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as the first inclusion of two smaller life companies increased the embedded value by 10%, here shown as opening adjustments. After the age capital market turbulences, which at that time also affected the MCEV of new business. In 2009, the value of new business recovered almost to the level of '07. Countervailing effects are reflected in the operating variance. Various model refinements as well as the implementation of text grouping within the covered business of ERGO.</p>
          <p>Operating earnings are a healthy 8% of adjusted opening MCEV. After last year's devastating results, recovering financial markets had a big impact. Higher interest rates together with considerably lower implied volatilities led to the economic variances of 1.2 billion. Thus two-thirds of last year's losses could be recovered.</p>
          <p>So far with the embedded value, now let's move on to the last slide summary and outlook which is slide number 42. 2009 was a good year for Munich Re, we came through the crisis in good shape. We could continue executing our strategy, we made use of our strength by the acquisition of Hartford Steam Boiler, as well as by underwriting very attractive P&amp;C and especially long-term life and health reinsurance business. We even met our 15% RoRaC target, increase the dividend and continue our share buyback. We are well positioned for 2010. The storm Xynthia and the Chile earthquake hit us with losses of a magnitude of &#x20AC;500 million. In relation to 2010 net earned premiums, this equals to some three to 3.5 percentage point loss ratio.</p>
          <p>We are now clearly ahead of our major loss expectation for first quarter. But we are still aiming for a good combined ratio for 97, 97 will be very difficult to achieve now. We need a period with lower than expected major claims burden. But such major losses are part of our business. And this is very helpful for price discipline in a competitive market.</p>
          <p>In primary insurance, we are confident to stay below 95% combined ratio. Investment returns will be lower than in 2009 with a return on investments below 4%. With reinsurance declining here with more than primary insurance lacking major capital gains. We are nevertheless still aiming for two billion net result, but this is of course dependent not only on major losses but also on further development of the capital markets.</p>
          <p>Capital management remains high on our agenda. Our dividend represents a total payout of almost 1.1 billion. Let us finalize first our common share buyback by the AGM then let's see we would very much like to continue the buybacks if circumstances allow. That's all from me, I'm sure you're glad to hear the final whistle. Thank you very much for your attention and back to Christian.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, gentlemen. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We will now take our first question from Andrew Broadfield from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two quick questions please. One, just on your sort of assumptions for the year ahead, do I &#x2013; am I right in assuming you &#x2013; assuming a sort of current interest rate levels where they are and sort of zero realized gains, losses or are you &#x2013; what sort of levels of &#x2013; what sort of assumptions you're making within that investment return and assumption for your two billion plus guesstimate for the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question, just on the reinsurance new business study, I just wanted to check I understood what you were saying correctly about the changes to the cost of capital assumptions and non-hedgeable risks. Did you say that they were essentially a quarter lower than they would have been under the old regime, so the reinsurance new business value actually would have been, if I've got this right , it was 562, would it have been sort of closer to 700 under the old regime?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Andy. First with our assumptions about interest rate levels and so on more or less unchanged. So, we do not bet on anything and we do not anticipate any major movements. And what is perhaps important to know is that we do not bet on rising interest rates. Yeah, so we have increased the duration of our assets to bring it more or less in line with our liabilities.</p>
          <p>Second question about value of new business and here, yes, this is true and we had an original target of 440 new business and we lower that now to 330 because under the new methodology, we have higher costs on higher required capital. Yeah. And therefore you are absolutely right, if we translate it into the old methodology, it would have been some third more than some third of this. So, a little bit less than 200 million more over &#x20AC;700 million. This is a very strong number. And I have to point your attention to the fact that this is not easily repeatable. These were extremely favorable conditions in the last year. Does it answer your question, Andy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it does. Just one other thing, I think you mentioned that there was still some follow through some of the challenges you were anticipating for 2010 as well in terms of I guess, large life re transaction, is that &#x2013; can we still expect it slightly above what might be a normalized run rate of new business value as a result, so it may not be 560 but it might be something close?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We would be very happy to achieve our original target of 330. Yeah, but this is perhaps a little bit pessimistic, yeah. So there are still chances in the market to make more deals of the kind of 2009, but not to the same magnitude.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I have two questions please. First one, I was interested by your comments but in terms of your internal economic capital model that that would now be the benchmark, which you would manage your capital going forward. Presumably the rating agency still play a sort of constraining factor for you, but do you sort of see that as Solvency progresses and clearly it's uncertain, but to the extent that your internal model becomes more accepted under Solvency II, do you see maybe greater acceptance of your own internal model by S&amp;P and maybe that makes a slight different to how do you manage your capital and view excess capital going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question, is just on you reserve releases the number you mentioned in the triangles, I think 397 million, I know you say that they will kind of offset because you are reserving current accident years more cautiously, but to the extent that these releases are sort of hitting the numbers, could you just give us a rough idea of whether or not this is mainly impacting the primary or the reinsurance business? And to the extent that it has become a benefit in the numbers, is there is some kind of quota where it is hit or whether it's just the year-end adjustment, any clarity there would be very useful? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question was about the capital model, how much will Solvency II, developments influence Solvency II's acceptance of the internal model. I cannot speak for Standard &amp; Poor's and the other agencies, but we have the very strong impression that as the rating consideration is anyway extremely comprehensive taking into account many criteria also the quality of the risk management, the quality of the management as a whole, low volatility and not being hit by unexpected surprises, things like that. And so we see an overall convergence between our regulatory environment and the rating environment.</p>
          <p>And Standard &amp; Poor's and the others have never said that they would look only at their model, they take a much broader look on the capitalization of the company and also a look on the internal model. So it's a kind of overall appreciation and we feel well served by them and we also seem to get enough credit for everything what we are doing internally and what we are providing as kind of information on the risks and returns we run here. Therefore, it's a gradual movement, the convergence, but there won't be kind of "big bang" or so.</p>
          <p>Second question, the reserve releases come from reinsurance and primary insurance. Nothing spectacular in it, absolutely not, and it is mainly based on end of the year overall reserve studies we do, but it's in a way business as usual. Our confidence level has slightly increased in the course of the year and that underlines my statement of before that our conservative reserving is ongoing and therefore one should also not expect too much of any additional buffer to flow into the earnings of the next year. I always emphasize that because I &#x2013; in spite of having a decent buffer, I and my colleagues, we regard this buffer as being absolutely necessary for a book like ours. Does it answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The logic then I guess the question I have is really to get a sense of whether or not your combined ratio is kind of underlying when you look at where you think the run rate profitability is especially in your primary and reinsurance businesses. Would you be kind of stripping out some of this reserve release effects or is it, as you said earlier, that you would effectively not make any adjustments when it came out with the run-rate probability that businesses in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't make any adjustments. So, I would think that this is a very reasonable run-rate also for the business based on conservative reserving practices, but not highly distorted by releases or increases of reserve.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions, one, just goes back a little bit in the excess capital and the other one on Ergo. On the excess capital being &#x2013; on your model you are up from seven billion to 9.3 billion excess capital and the phrasing used to describe S&amp;P rating capital model is unchanged from last year, mid to &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; low-to-mid single-digit billion. So I just wondered, why one moves and not the other?</p>
          <p>And the other one is on ERGO, you will be due to publish your forecast for the Group as part of the squeeze out process in a couple of weeks. And you said that tomorrow you'll be talking about strategy. And I just wondered, if you can give us a flavor of the differences between the figures we're seeing now and what we might expect to see where the kind of flex could come from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Michael, thank you. First, excess capital somewhat increased internal model, Standard &amp; Poor's model is unchanged, has to do with some model changes in haircut in the model, but it's very complex. So, perhaps we look at it and tomorrow Joe can say a few words about it. And with regard to ERGO's forecast, would you be so kind to repeat your question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, and I'd just like to get a feel for where the earnings might change in ERGO going forward. I didn't quite understand where the earnings <mark type="inaudible" /> relative to your expected run rate. And I think it's a fair question to the extent that you said well, tomorrow you will talk strategy. Well, ERGO and the ERGO earnings part of strategy and then in any case you must have a quite clear view of the numbers if you are due to publish the valuation for the squeeze-out report in the next two weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that's '10, yeah, it's difficult for us at the moment because it's a legally very sensitive issue now. Now we have to wait for the squeeze-out valuation report and there we will show the expectations for the turnover and profit development of the next year. And there is obviously the potential for an improvement coming from the investment side, which was still somewhat stressed during last year. And also we continue making progress on the expenses side due to our cost saving program. So, it's a gradual movement and also the growth will somewhat pickup in future in this report, in this valuation. So, I'd beg for your understanding and please wait another couple of weeks. It's end of March when this all will be published and we will give you a notice in advance, but it will be only in German language.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Yes, I've got two questions. Both of which are heading into the undergrowth of embedded values and actually they're both on the expected transfer from the width to three circles, which should be a decent proxy for how much money you're actually making. When I look at the expected transfer from this for the primary business, last year was a rather chunky &#x20AC;343 million. And that doesn't seem to bear any relation whatsoever through the actual money you make in the business. And I'm just wondering how we should think about that and how I guess you might look to square those two figures away because it does either look like the assumptions are wildly optimistic or there is something in the cost base, which isn't included in the life of EV?</p>
          <p>And then secondly on the life reinsurance business, it seems to have the &#x2013; sort of the opposite issue if you like in the sense that the expected transfer from this to free capital was actually being going down and last year it was a very low number indeed a &#x20AC;3,200 million. I'm just wondering how you might explain that because it seems here that the focus is more on e-business profits rather than free capital generation and I guess we're not really seeing that coming through in the life reinsurance business or maybe there were just some technical explanations, which would put that in some context. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It was a little bit difficult to understand because the line was not so clear. Give me one-minute or so because I need some assistance by my colleagues here for this embedded value question B. And overall we are talking about the expected return on the current book of business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Which I guess is a reasonable proxy for how much free capital you are throwing off from the bid option.  And I guess, you should, it looks very, very high in the primary life business, but <mark type="inaudible" /> throwing off capital, it's actually quite low in the life reinsurance business we might expect to be quite high. Just wondering how to think about those two numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And so the expected transfer from risk to free cash flow would be that what we expect if we run down the business if we just close it, yeah, that is my explanation for it. And these numbers are different for both lines of business. So at the moment, I don't have any good answer, so please allow us to take that offline and to also give an answer in our Frequently Asked Questions on the website later on.</p>

          <p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Brian Shea from BofA Merrill Lynch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I am &#x2013; really quickly rechecking my questions. I think you just answered one of the one that I was going to ask you, I always ask a primary life insurance. If I can ask instead your &#x2013; the underlying combined ratio in 2009, it sounds like you're suggesting that we should set aside the reserve movements except that one percentage point release going from NatCat. And it sounds as if you are suggesting we should take your reported number of 95, perhaps adjust for three points of NatCat and get back to 98. If that's correct then at the nine-month stage you guys were at 99 on an underlying basis, what was it about in the fourth quarter that was so much better if that math is right?</p>
          <p>And then the other question, I don't know how willing you are to elaborate on this, but if you could just give us some basic building blocks behind your thinking for the 2011 outlook. And I wouldn't even want to paint you in the corner and call it a forecast, just what kind of assumptions do you make, do you keep your 97 combined ratio in that assumption, do you make allowance for in fact buybacks to continue to make allowance for gains, which I assume will be zero, you are assuming in 2010 for gains to return to normal. So just a couple of basic assumptions you are making in 2011 please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Brian. First, underlying combined ratio, there was a run-off as you said 1.4% for the full year only. And you are right, if we adjust for the impact of major losses would we add to 98 a little bit higher than 98. In the fourth quarter, there was nothing different than from the others except for the typical reserve review, which led to some movements here, but that is all.</p>
          <p>Second, building blocks of our outlook. Yeah, to be clear, if we have three to 3.5 just &#x2013; loss ratio just from one weekend then it's rather optimistic to assume a 6.5% loss ratio for net Rueckversicherungs piece for the full year. And therefore and this is not very realistic, but we need some good luck.</p>
          <p>With regard to 2011, we do not have much better basis for our assumptions here. And so in a way what we write here is that we accept a better result, it's just a gradual movement in many areas of our business. For example, all the initiatives which were set up in the course of the changing gear project are still under way and continue producing promising business and some of that will show up in the number and also it's rather easy when you compare 2010 with 2011 and when you have such a big loss just after two months then to assume that you don't get the same level of losses next year. But I wouldn't put too much weight on our prognosis for 2011. The numbers are quite similar to 2010, a little bit better, slightly better. And this is just a legal duty that we have to put in the prognosis for two years here. And that was the reason why we wrote it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just wanted some additional color on the combined ratio outlook. If I look at <mark type="inaudible" /> accounts you give the combined ratio by class of business. Just looking at two parts in particular liability and credit. I see the credit combined ratio for the year was 173%. Just to be clear, I think in the renewals call in January, you indicated you expected that credit at around 100 for 2010, is that still your expectation and should I compare that with a 173, I'm seeing there?</p>
          <p>Secondly the very high combined ratio in liability, which has deteriorated quite a lot, I'm assuming some of that reflects sort of financial crisis related losses, if you just clarify that will be great?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First of all our expectations for combined ratio for credit is unchanged. Second high combined ratio for liability business, this is partially driven by financial crisis related exposures and some other very isolated items and so it's a mixture.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry just to follow-up, the strong improvement in motor I appreciate you've been re-underwriting the motor book quite a lot in the last couple of years. Is there anything exceptional in that result in 2009. I mean obviously frequency trends were certainly favorable but would you anticipate that could be a reasonable level going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps a bit optimistic, also a topic for tomorrow, but when you see the improvement from 111.6 to only 92.2 this is exactly due to our very consistent underwriting here. I don't know whether it's sustainable, but I am optimistic here.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Michael Haid from Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions, first on share buybacks and maybe it's a little bit early but, I assume just to get a feeling of how you think, assume that you make a net profit of two billion for this year and there are no attractive acquisitions coming up, would you still be willing to pay out two billion cash to the shareholders?</p>
          <p>Second question on primary life, you mentioned an achievable net profit contribution in primary life of 100 to 150 million, you also have a RoRaC target of 15% for the whole Group. I couldn't find the risk adjusted capital of primary life but my memory tells me that it is something around two billion, so 150 million divided by two billion would be 7.5% and not 15%. What do you intend to do with respect to this lower RoRaC that you achieve in primary life? Can you do something or are you just locked in in this situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Unfortunately, you are right, Mr. Haid. And so this is far away from a 15% return on risk adjusted capital. On the other hand ERGO is a wider group and there is a lot of cross-selling and especially when you look at a company like Victoria, which has life insurance book, which does not produce a very high returns. On the other hand, we have the same &#x2013; we have the business with the same clients, which is performing extremely well in primary property-casualty. So, overall, there is some cross subsidization within the ERGO Group and that's &#x2013; it's how it can work.</p>
          <p>But for primary life on extended loan basis for the next couple of years, it is unrealistic to achieve a 15% RoRaC. We also have to take into account diversification by the way. First, on share buyback; and as I said, we would very much like to continue, but I'm not in a position today to make firm announcement. And at the moment, we do not see any attractive acquisition targets at reasonable terms. This is important because we have seen a couple of M&amp;A transactions in the recent past, which lead us to believe that very high pricing is back on the agenda far away from what we would regard as being reasonable. And therefore, it's not a very high probability that we do major acquisitions in near future.</p>
          <p>As you know, the bottleneck for our share buyback and our dividend is the level of the revenue reserve of the parent company. These revenue reserves also protect our shareholders from a dip in the distribution at times when major losses are higher. For example, the losses from the Chile earthquake or the losses from the storm Xynthia will most probably be to a large extent compensated by the equalization reserve. Therefore, overall, I am optimistic that we will be able to continue with our share buyback program, but it's too early to announce it precisely.</p>

          <p>Okay. If I understand you correctly, the RoRaC target of 15% for ERGO as a group is achievable?</p>
