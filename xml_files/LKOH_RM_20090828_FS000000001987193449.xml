          <p>Thank you very much for coming here. A little presentation by Richard Matzke. For a long time he has been and still is the member of the Board of Directors. Before that he used to be a Vice President of Chevron and after that Mr. Fedun, Vice President of LUKOIL will speak about the strategy and will present the financial results over our activities. We have a webcast going on. WE will be taking questions from the audience here. We'll be taking questions from the Internet and from teleconference. Those of you who want to ask your questions, you can send them now to our e-mail. Thank you very much and here I'd like to give the floor to Mr. Matzke. Richard?</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and Mr. Gaidamaka, thank you kindly. Mr. Fedun, thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak for just a few moments.</p>
          <p>Regardless of what period of time you were interested in, whether it's quarter-to-quarter, half-to-half or year-to-year, there have been a great changes from the former period to the current period and I think the objective today is to try to compare LUKOIL's performance in the last period, whether it's a quarter, a half or year, to a similar period, similar prior period.</p>
          <p>Some of the more obvious changes is the price of oil today is half of what it was the same period a year ago. We're going to talk about U.S. GAAP reporting today and the dollar, ruble relationship is substantially different, I think in excess of 40% from what it was in a comparable period a year ago.</p>
          <p>These things have dramatic impact on not only results of the Company's performance, but also the planning for the Company's performance. And I would hope that the question you ask is the other gentlemen at the table today will bring out the type of astute business planning that began more than a year ago when it was apparent that the world was approaching a rather several financial crisis.</p>
          <p>And the kind of crisis management, the procedures that LUKOIL put in place to minimize the financial consequence of the crisis have yielded remarkable results. Not only has the Company positioned itself very substantially in a pure financial point of view, it's also positioned itself in a very enviable position from a operational point of view.</p>
          <p>And I think you probably have noticed in today's earlier announcement and in prior announcements that oil production quarter-to-quarter, half-to-half, is in a neighborhood of 4% higher than it was in the prior period. There's probably not another large company in the world that has had an oil production increase like that and it did not come about through acquisitions, it came about through grassroots in-house development of licenses, concessions and projects.</p>
          <p>And I'm sure you will, if you don't know already, learn today that there are numerous other projects that will be coming on stream in the near-term to mid-term and some in the longer-term, but they're well underway now and they will continue to support high levels of oil production, maybe not increases every year from period-to-period, but over the long-term substantial increases in oil production.</p>
          <p>Gas production, of course, is another issue. Although gas production is down for LUKOIL period-to-period, it's not because the reservoirs are deficient, it's because the market has changed so dramatically from where it was a year ago. But that's not a market that you need to fear for too long.</p>
          <p>There will be a recovery and there clearly are signs throughout Russia, throughout Western Europe, certainly in Asia and now in North America that the crisis bottom is probably behind us and that we're on the road to some sort of recovery.</p>
          <p>It will go at a different rate in different parts of the world and it will be reflected in different businesses, but it's time now to begin to think about a future and LUKOIL is extremely well-prepared to address that future.</p>
          <p>And I think I will end my preliminary remarks at that particular point. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Thank you very much and since Mr. Matzke has already described his understanding of the global situation, his outlook on the situation in the world, let's now see how these global trends were reflected in our Company's activities.</p>
          <p>So we start with the forward-looking statements. This is a regular legal practice and then let's go on to the first slide, key financial facts for the second quarter 2009. You are well aware that average oil prices was $58.47. This is better than LUKOIL planned and you know that our annual program was based on a forecast of $50 per barrel and our investment programs were based on the same figures.</p>
          <p>If you look at the annual average &#x2013; average weighted figure, it already exceeds $54 sales plus 36% EBITDA, plus 70% and net income plus 156%, which exceeds all our expectations. You know that the market expects figures around 15 to 40% of the profits that LUKOIL used to demonstrate.</p>
          <p>I would call it nothing less than a courageous work of our oil men, our managers and because of commitment of all personnel to the Company, we now have this healthy company and the Company is able to adapt to all changes in the market. Next slide, please.</p>
          <p>This slide, once again, justifies to the fact that we are growing on the first quarter in all areas, except for diesel fuel. Among the negative factors, the mineral extraction tax is up and the crude oil export tariff is up. Besides the negative factors there is also the real ruble appreciation. This is good for the Company since right now we do not have any significant assets that could have played on the side of the dollar.</p>
          <p>Next one, you must have noted that if you look at the half-a-year to half-a-year situation, here the picture is slightly different, but our traditional approach to comparing one half-a-year to another half-a-year today is not quite representative. Last year was a unique year.</p>
          <p>It was the last year, the last period of the huge financial bubble that burst exactly last year and starting from November 2008 we have entered a new phase, a new era. It's hard to tell how long this new era will last, but now we need to do the quarter-to-quarter comparison or at least the comparison with the time when the global economy hit bottom.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Main operating results, we have already made an announcement that we have seen the greatest uplift in oil production among Russian companies. Unfortunately, there is negative statistics for gas.</p>
          <p>You know this is because the gas consumption reduced drastically in the first six months of this year. This was due to the export marketing contracts of Gazprom that were connected to the price and they are long-term and in fact they offered, in the beginning of the year they offered the gas at the highest prices to the consumers despite the crisis and, of course, the consumers tried to avoid buying this gas and they limited their consumption as much as they could.</p>
          <p>Now the situation is getting better and Gazprom is restoring its production levels and it means that they now restore their levels of purchase of gas from independent suppliers, just like LUKOIL. It means that it looks like demand for gas and consumption of gas in Europe will go up and the same will happen in Russia and you all know about this big accident tragedy that occurred in Russia recently. It means that other sources of fuel or energy will be more in demand.</p>
          <p>Oil refining, the Group owned refineries, plus 11%. This is due to our acquisition of share in the ISAB complex. We plan to buy 45% of the new assets in Holland and we plan to close the deal by the 1st of December.</p>
          <p>Exports of crude oil, plus 14%, petroleum products export is steadily growing and retail sales of petroleum products has now reached 6.7 million tons in Russia. Production, production of marketable hydrocarbons, you notice that over the past six years LUKOIL has been demonstrating a very steady growth without any significant decreases.</p>
          <p>Western Siberia is now in the falling stage of production and this will very painfully affect the overall production build inside Russia. Delays in introducing large new projects will mean that we will not see any more fast growth in this area and I personally expect a stagnation in the production growth rates.</p>
          <p>There are some projects being announced, but you will notice if you compare today's plans with the regional's plans that a little less production is now being forecasted and investments are being cut. So again, the overall situation with production in Russia will continue to be challenging.</p>
          <p>Auctions for placement of new acreage licenses have almost been suspended. The continental shelf is now allocated to state-owned companies and it means that most probably we will see the stagnation or a decrease in production in Russia. LUKOIL still continues to be optimistic in this respect. We have prepared large fields in the Caspian, as you know, and besides we start launching new large projects outside of Russia. Unfortunately inside Russia the situation is much more sensitive.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows you the key projects that we hope will bring most production in the upcoming years. Yuzhnaya Khylchuya, 7.5 million tons. We are reaching peak production there. I have to admit, though, that we were more optimistic respect to this field and with respect to the reserves in that particular field and still our estimates as to peak production have been already achieved.</p>
          <p>As to the Korchagin field, you know about our block, production blocks have been already sent afloat, so we start the assembly jobs and we will start drilling. Until March we will drill 30 wells and from March 2010 marketable oil will start getting into the Russian transportation system.</p>
          <p>From the 2011 we start producing gas in Uzbekistan. We have no doubt that by 2011 gas markets will get up and this gas will be in demand. Turkmenistan is engaged in a maneuver they're trying now to find alternative, a destination for its gas like China, for instance. And the Filanovsky field, well we plan to commission in 2013. Its peak production is 10 million tons, as planned, ahead of our marine projects.</p>
          <p>Mr. Krasovsky announced that by the end of next year this field will be fully prepared for the start of development and will start ordering equipment for the production in the Filanovsky field. You see that LUKOIL has a good outlook of the future.</p>
          <p>Refining, Russian refining has been and still is very profitable, very profitable. All our refineries, including Astrakhanskaya refinery, Ukhta refinery, which traditionally has been not as advanced as other plants, it is still yielding profit and the refining margin in Russia and abroad is changing for the better. This margin used to be in the low levels, now it's getting better and we hope that in Europe some very simple facilities that do primary refining will be closed.  And after that in the years 2010, 2011 the European margin oil refining will get back to its stable pre-crisis levels as we used to see them, say 2004, 2005 and we will be able to get more out of our refining facilities in Europe.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows our key financial results. You must have seen these figures already. We have already published them. Not much to comment here, probably just to say that high sales are attributed to the fact that, for instance, we ask our company charts utilize all contango capabilities that exists in the beginning of the year. So we managed to take advantage of the existing environment at the beginning of the year, during the year and hence the sales it's all up to our professional managers.</p>
          <p>EBITDA exceeded our expectations. We managed to keep very good control over our costs like the repair maintenance costs of the wells, for instance. Sales breakdown in comparison with the first half of 2008, please notice that sales of &#x2013; domestic sales of oil went down because demand shrank, but everything else is in line with our traditional practice.</p>
          <p>Inside the sales structure at the end of the year there will be one more component, which is sales of electric energy and steam. This is the result of integration of our energy assets. Utilities assets you know that we are finalizing the restructuring. We have set up four regional utilities center and each of these centers services its own local market.  We hope that, well, we do expect the tariffs on electricity will rise for obvious reasons, so this will be yet another factor contributing to growing sales in our Company.</p>
          <p>Next slide shows operating expenses. Operating expenses were under the influence of two key factors. First of all, we consistently continued to optimize costs due to the crisis and this work continues, it's under way. It never stopped and on the other hand already in the second quarter we have seen appreciation of the ruble.</p>
          <p>It appreciated more than 8% on the dollar, so these two facts actually balanced each other, but you see that that we managed to maintain the positive trend overall. There are some expense items where expenses went up, like lifting costs plus 10%, but 8% is ruble appreciation and 4% is production growth. All our costs are under control.</p>
          <p>Refining expenses went up because now we have added more than 10 million tons of refining capacity to our assets. All other factors are within the framework, within the program of curbing the cost that was adopted by the Company at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Here you can see how LUKOIL controls operating expenses. Lifting costs went up, but mostly again this is explained by the ruble appreciation.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. Transportation expenses, transportation expenses are lower than last year, but on the current year transportation costs went up because the tariffs were increased. SG&amp;A expenses are also within the ruble appreciation range. Since we pay out salaries in rubles that's why we have seen that increase in SG&amp;A expenses.</p>
          <p>Next slide, net income reconciliation. I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that one of the factors of income reduction was the changes in exchange rates.</p>
          <p>You remember the dramatic dynamics of exchange rates in the fourth quarter of last year. We managed to somehow balance it out. Right now the Company operates rubles, euro and dollars mostly and change in the exchange rates resulted for the Company in the loss of 157 million. At the same time we managed to save on our OpEx $570 million.</p>
          <p>Next slide, cash flow reconciliation. The cash flow on the first half-year of 2009 was $1 billion 150 million. This is net cash at the end of first quarter 2009. It means that the Company is financially stable and we have all means for normal development.</p>
          <p>A positive thing here is that the credit markets that were closed in the first quarter are now open. You know that LUKOIL managed to place bonds in Russia and we also got access to loans, credits for our own development.</p>
          <p>Abroad now we are closing other loans that we undertook just in case during the financial panic that affected everyone at the end of last year. So now we are, our leverage is getting back to normal. We have again all means to operate normally and to continue the development of our large scale investment projects.</p>
          <p>Next slide, CapEx breakdown. Exploration and production remain the main item, the main area of our investments. You see that in the first quarter we invested 1 billion 118 million. In the second quarter we invested $1 billion 123 million within the framework of the investment program that we originally approved, so we're still within that range.</p>
          <p>At the same time we look into the future with hope in terms of our international projects. Most probably in the fourth quarter our CapEx, our investment into international projects will go up a little bit, but when the time is right we will make the announcements.</p>
          <p>Next slide, please. And the last thing that we wanted to bring to your attention is our new refining assets located in the Rotterdam hub. This is the largest refining center in Europe and traditionally this is the destination of our oil. Total used to manage this plant in the past. Now it's a joint venture.</p>
          <p>There is variety of interest and every company has the right to supply as much oil as is its share and our share is 45%, so this refinery is a cost center. It has surplus hydrocracker conversion capacity and you know that we are the largest exporter of vacuum gas oil.</p>
          <p>So we must say that the total capacity of this refinery can reach 10 to 12 million tons per year. It is integrated with a petrochemical facility and oil terminal in Rotterdam. 21% of this terminal belongs to our joint venture and we also own together with Total the Borsele Marine Terminal and a barge jetty.</p>
          <p>Both Marine and river vessels can call that terminal. Belgium, France are covered by the fleet there and, of course, this brand can handle large variety of feedstock, including euros and will start deliveries there as owners in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>We hope that in early September this deal with Total also by 45% in this refinery will be closed. This will be the second largest asset that LUKOIL acquires in Western Europe.</p>
          <p>This will mean a significant step forward to balancing our production and refinery capacities. We'll be able to process 65 to 70% of all oil that we produce and in this way we hope that we'll be generating additional profit for the Company and for the shareholders.</p>
          <p>So the Company continues to develop despite the crisis. The crisis showed that all Russian companies, including LUKOIL, who believes that a crisis is a permanent environment in which they operates take this crisis very calmly and they continue developing business as usual.</p>
          <p>So all the companies, all the projects that have been scheduled will be brought to life and we will once again prove the fact that we are one of the leaders of the Russian oil and gases sector.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. Your questions now, please.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, indeed. We had a very successful replacement at a very comfortable rate. The question is whether we will need actually any additional financial investment. It's up to the treasury to decide and subsequent placement of bonds is a totally technical decision that is made depending on the needs of the Company. We do not have any particular financial plan for the placement of bonds.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we are still exploring the field and it is our first instance to say that the reserves are slightly smaller. At the same time, we will reach the peak production. It's hard to tell whether we will stay at the plateau for two or three or four years. It's still too early to say that. The only thing that I can say is that our expectations were greater.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. The Antimonopoly Service suspects you of colluding with other oil majors on setting the prices, fixing the prices, your comments? And my other question, who in Russia is to blame for high prices on gasoline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I will start with the second part of your question. You know there are two models of development. The first one is the so-called closed market model of development when the price on any product, milk, sugar, gasoline, clothing is fixed, is set by a certain authority, a ministry, a government, call it what you want. There is financial discipline, so this is not the right approach. The other approach is when the price is set by the market. So first of all you need to answer the question, which model do we want to follow in the future and secondly with respect to who is to blame for high prices.</p>
          <p>You know in Norway the share of oil production in the balance, let us say, per capita, is much higher than in Russia, but the prices on gasoline in Norway are four times higher than in Russia. I have explained this many times over and I think that you know and your viewers know it very well that today oil prices and gasoline prices are determined by the state to 70% and the taxes, if you look into the structure of gasoline price is taxes and 30% is everything else.</p>
          <p>So primarily the gasoline price depends on the taxation policy of the states of the government and if the government decides on the 1st of September to increase the minerals extraction tax and it will be increased, this tax is tied to the market price in dollars. If this tax goes up what will happen to the prices of oil and the prices of gasoline?  Of course, the two will go up. There are a number of other side factors, so it's &#x2013; there is no one definitive answer to your question.</p>
          <p>You can't just say that oil companies are bad and the Antimonopoly Service is good or Antimonopoly Service is bad and the oil companies are good. It's a different question. Right now we are trying to talk to the Antimonopoly Service, so that under the aegis of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs we would have a hearing, a meeting where we would discuss and substrate the rules of the game. Here is how the price is calculated, here is how your costs are calculated, here is how government taxes are calculated. It's a paradox.</p>
          <p>If any oil company stops selling oil at a price lower than the cost of production or stops selling gasoline on the cost of production, then not the Antimonopoly Service will penalize us, but the tax service will penalize us because it prohibits us selling goods at a price that would be lower than the cost of production.</p>
          <p>This is a very difficult and complex environment. Of course oil companies depend very much on the state and they are very disciplined and then the rules are set and we will adhere to these rules. What happens now looks more like large scale PR organized by the Federal Antimonopoly Service. They see just one threat in the world, which is oil companies and doesn't seem to notice any other problems out there. You need to press the button, please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" />. I have a question and a request. The analysts here, you know there is a consensus forecast, a consensus projection and the analysts did not &#x2013; their projections didn't match the consensus forecast. We were coming here to this press conference and I was talking to other experts and analysts.</p>
          <p>We're trying to understand where did we miscalculate everything. Probably it was the taxes, the mineral extraction tax and also the price of the goods that you have purchased for your own production. I don't know if you can answer the question now, but maybe you have time to look at the consensus forecast and analyze it, where did we go wrong to make our projections better in the future? What were the points where we miscalculated? That's my first question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The main mistake, it's not a mistake in the models actually, it is something that is that today only the current level of activity in Russia is analyzed because LITASCO our trading company, this company stays outside of your forecasts and projections. They do trades of oil products in the international market.</p>
          <p>You remember that sometime in the past all our forecasts were higher than actually the actual levels of the Company because we had losses on insurance. Now when the contango exists, of course would have run if we were not to use the advantage of this situation. So everyone took advantage of the contango situation with the marketing situation in the market. There is also another factor, which is minerals extraction tax in Timan-Pechora, for instance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we did the calculation for Timan-Pechora with the production.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, if you want to discuss that in greater detail we have our guys. It's the press conference I don't think it's the right place to do the calculations over and over again. Probably you just did not include in your calculations the oil products transactions and there is another thing, when taxes change and price change so dramatically the deferred residue, it is to say that we produce in one quarter and we pay taxes in a different quarter. And because in different time periods the rates are different, probably this is something that all the models miss.</p>
          <p>You ask the question now, but it's strange that you didn't ask the question before in the fourth quarter when in accounting the same situation exist when the prices go up and the rates go up we write off the reserves at a lower level. There is also this item that's called changes in reserves. Again, it's &#x2013; yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree with you, we have discussed exactly that. We looked at dynamics of inventories of LUKOIL over a long period of time. You can check, you can verify. This is exactly what Mr. Fedun meant. In our inventory we have a lot of inventory of third parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well if you &#x2013; if you would know it better than we do, why come to the press conference?  And with respect to the minerals extraction tax, we make our payments on time and as necessary. And there is one more fundamental thing that's very difficult to assess.</p>
          <p>Your models will have to be adjusted for the following. You only calculate the production in Timan-Pechora because you see this production. What you do not see is additional benefits for areas with high water cuts and high viscosity in Western Siberia and Lower Volga. So we will work with you on this. We will provide you with those figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you very much. And I also have a request from my colleagues. I spoke to them over the phone. It would be very good if you could provide us with those figures and I also had another question about gas? The Nakhodkinskoye field production is decreasing.</p>
          <p>I'm looking at Page Five and we spoke to Gazprom. It seems like Gazprom is saying that with LUKOIL we have long-term contracts for Nakhodka and under this contract they cannot demand a decrease in production. So I'm hearing two different things from two key parties.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well in fact the truth is in the middle. We have contracted, if I'm not mistaken, six billion of gas out of 10 billion and this is what both parties mean. As far as I know Gazprom promised to take more gas, another two billion from us very soon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And also in your list of fields you showed one in a very promising region close to Nakhodka and Rosneft Vankor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we will &#x2013; we plan to launch it in four years time and this is a field in Bolshekhetskaya Depression. If everything goes as planned exploration shows us that we have big reserves of gas and condensates, so this field is getting ready for development.</p>
          <p>So as soon as the markets stabilize and we see that everything is fine, we will start developing that field and we also have three more blocks and we have a schedule all the way up to the year 2023.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Argus Agency. In your reports I read that over six months of this year you have spent 208 million on the Caspian projects and in the previous year over the same period you spent 221. Could you please specify is this the Korchagin field?</p>
          <p>How big is your investments into Korchagin field, I haven't seen that number anywhere yet? And the second question, does LUKOIL have any plans to sell fuel at the electronic trading floors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, $1.3 billion, if I'm not mistaken, is the total investment into Korchagin field. Of course these numbers can be corrected. The numbers that you already see, they have been spent to prepare for exploration, the base, the foundations and McDermott did welding of the underground oil pipeline 87 kilometers long. It is already laid down. It is preserved until the time of production. Right now we are at the stage of onshore infrastructure, onshore infrastructure.</p>
          <p>We are building onshore infrastructure that will receive the produced oil and send it out into the system or to a refinery at the Volgograd refinery. The next stage of investments will mean drilling up 30 wells and completing the infrastructure. 1.3 billion. This is total projects during the life of the projects and the life of the project is 20 years. Is this all?  Electronic trades, the stock market.</p>
          <p>In Russia there is excess of oil products. We produce, we refine twice as much oil products as the domestic market needs, so I think that the electronic trading route will only be of interest, through its own founders.</p>

          <p>Stephen Bierman, Bloomberg. Which fields and which rights for development of oil fields would you like to get during second round of tenders in Iraq?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know there is a West Qurna-2, a well known field, it's not a secret. So that's the field that can produce up to 200 million barrels of annual production, so that's quite exciting, quite an exciting prospect.</p>

          <p>And my second question is about OPEC. The next meeting is in October &#x2013; in September, do you want to participate in the September meeting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>OPEC is the organization of oil exporting countries. LUKOIL is not a state-run company. If the Ministry of Energy invites Russia to the meeting and our ministry is the observer in OPEC and the ministry actually sent an invitation to OPEC to hold its meeting in Moscow. We have learned that from Mr. Smartco and we welcome full contacts with OPEC.</p>
          <p>You know our position. We believe that to a degree due to a very disciplined and well coordinated work of OPEC we managed to avoid a huge decrease in the oil market. All those negative forecasts and people saying that OPEC in not capable of maintaining the market just because OPEC managed to maintain the right kind of production, we can now replenish the base, the mineral base.</p>

          <p>Curtis Company. LUKOIL since August has been supplying 400,000 tons of Western Siberia oil at a formula price to Rosneft. Do you want to increase the deliveries of feedstock to the Ukhta refinery?  Would this be formula prices or increase of your quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well since acquired new refining capacity in Western Europe we have no interest of this type refining capacity in Western Europe. We do not have any interest of that type.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you please tell us more about the CapEx in the Caspian projects in future and will the current crisis impact these projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I have already said that we can discuss the CapEx that already that happened already. We have so far spend about $415 million for the development of the Korchagin field. 1.3 billion is the total investment to the Khylchuyu field over a slight. Of course we do have estimates and projection for the investments in other fields that haven't been finalized yet, haven't been fully approved yet. So I can't disclose them now.</p>
          <p>The Filanovsky field, the second stage, they will be the key ones for the development of the shelf on the Caspian Sea. Again, we have a business plan. We have estimates and these are only preliminary estimates, but we are talking about sizable investments. As to whether cash flow of the Company will be sufficient for the development of those fields, well today's results show that the existing cash flow will cover all our investments projections. We do not see any need to raise any more funds given the current levels of prices in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have a forecast for production on the Caspian?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and we published it, if I'm not mistaken, at the last presentation. We believe that we will be producing about 30 million tons hydrocarbons a year. Which is roughly how much? 12 to 14 million tons of oil and more or less the same amount of gas. Okay, very well. We've got a question that we received online,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Otto at Sanford Bernstein. What are your expectations of the amount of oil production in Russia where demand is today and what are your expectations of demand in Europe, okay, Russia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Today the demand for oil products has stabilized. You must have noticed a slight increase in demand and the regional anxiety that the consumers had is now a thing of the past. As to the future, everything depends on demand stimulation program that the government of Russia is supposed to adopt. You must have seen a dramatic difference in approaches executed by the Central Bank and the financial regulators in Europe and in Russia.</p>
          <p>The financial regulators in Europe try to incentivize demand like the scrappage program, for instance, to buy cars up to 3,000 to 1,000 euros paid to buyers when they bring in their old car and buy a new one and we see now the demands on the cars are even higher than before the crisis. At the same time, we were trying to stimulate production rather than consumption and the cars are not being bought, even though one of the key persons was replaced in the automotive industry. In Russia still a lot has to be done.</p>
          <p>I believe that in future the demand on oil products in Europe will be stable. It will grow very lightly and in Russia the demand on oil products in a short time will go back to the levels of 2006, 2007, growing at a rate of five or 6% a year or even faster. And still the main locomotive, the main driver of demand for oil product is China. They thought the mini cars that these programs like in India, we believe that again the main driver for demand in our products in the world will be India and China.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What do you think of all the investment into mature fields continue to grow, will this help fight water cuts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well you all know how the production in Western Siberia is shrinking. No fuel can develop forever and still our engineers managed to stabilize this fall in Western Siberia. We use all possibilities to plan for this decrease and follow that schedule as to any dramatic techniques. Well I can't really say because the technology advances all the time. There is no direct link between production and water cuts. There are other ways of secondary production, as you know very well.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know that Ghana has become super interesting to all oil companies. Of course some other companies actually discovered big reserves in deepwater. Several years ago we acquired huge blocks in Ghana and in the Ivory Coast and in September we will start drilling a well with a depth of three kilometers.</p>
          <p>This will be the deepest water drilling that any Russian company has undertaken so far. This will be a tremendously interesting experience for us and if we come across a discovery, I hope so. The prospects there are extremely exciting and I have already commented the situation with PSAs in Uzbekistan.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have a question about taxes, the mineral extraction tax in particular. Curious as that in second quarter of 2009 the Company managed to save $300 million with the benefits granted by the government for Timan-Pechora and other mature fields. It means that in Timan-Pechora the Company saved $130 million and $170 million were saved with other depleting fields. Is my assumption correct that you managed to save on 2.5 million tons a quarter?</p>
          <p>And my other question is about taxes. I think everyone is curious about the tax situation. The tax rates that existed in the first quarter, which volumes are these tax rates were carried over to the second quarter?  It looks like after 10 million tons it should have appeared in the second quarter reporting so that we would be able to see this 200 million savings on mineral extraction tax?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now with the second question, I wouldn't want to dive now into the mathematical discussion. The only thing is that we'll be ready to take all your questions in a personal meeting, no problems there. As to the first part of your question, Mr. Gaya Profano will take it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now with respect to the 300 million, in fact it says there that the 300 million includes the savings that the Company got with a cut off price from nine to 15. It's not the actual savings related to the benefit of all the cut in Timan-Pechora, but also because the legislation on taxes changed and maybe it's a confusion, the confusion is there.</p>
          <p>And a couple of more words about taxes, when the prices do not jump as much as they do now, as soon as the oil prices stabilize and the tax stabilize we will have no questions of this type. But if you want to know the details of the calculations, please contact us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how much production is actually subject to these benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maria, I think that you should contact Mr. Gaidamaka or Mr. Krasovsky, they have the data and they will be very happy to answer your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have allocated one hour for the press conference. We have used it to the full and thank you very much for your attention.</p>
