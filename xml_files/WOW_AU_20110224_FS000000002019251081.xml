    <section name="MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good morning everybody. I must be dropping in popularity. There's not as many here this morning. Just my few friends I've got.</p>
          <p>Now, a great expense to the management, we've responded to numerous requests over a number of years to actually get closer to our management team during this formal process. So, from my right, Steve Greentree, who heads up our Liquor division; Debra Singh, who heads up Dick Smith; Julie Coates, heads up BIG W; Greg Foran, who heads up just about everything and Tom who looks after, I'm not sure what, money, yeah.</p>
          <p>So, we're going to go through the presentation here and when we get to the individual businesses I'll defer over to the guys over on the table. When we get to the question time, if you could just direct your questions to me and where appropriate I'll direct them through to the guys and girls on the table. And hopefully that might curtail your need to hang around and do the submarine stuff at tea and sandwiches afterwards.</p>
          <p>All righty so, let's get underway and I'm presuming that most people have already gone through this, so we'll move through, particularly my part a little bit quicker and perhaps a little bit more time with the individual businesses and our team on the table. So, I said this morning to the press that we're pleased to have a sound result overall in a challenging period, both macroeconomic and market and climatic conditions in the past half.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased that that we're able to serve an extra an extra 18.5 million customers and we continue on delivering value to our customers both in value through pricing and shareholders through an increased dividend payout for the half, along with the share buyback that we had during the half.</p>
          <p>In Food and Liquor, our major business in Australia and New Zealand, we continue to have solid sales and EBIT growth. We increased customer numbers in all of our businesses and we had market share growth in all of our businesses under that umbrella in a competitive environment in both countries.</p>
          <p>We continue to invest in our retail offer both with new stores, refurbishments, new formats involving the range, new products and lowering prices and, in particular, developing our online office in all of our businesses; 115 new stores, 139 refurbishments during the half. Our home improvement strategy is very much on track, assisted in the last half by some bolt-on acquisitions and, as I mentioned earlier, for the shareholders, we've had significant return of capital totaling over $1 billion in the calendar year.</p>
          <p>Also took the time to pay tribute to the guys and girls that work in some 3300 Woolworths places of business, in particular, the magic effort they put in during the climatic natural disasters we had in Australia and in New Zealand. They went over and above to look after each other and look after our customers. And I also want to thank in particular our suppliers and our transport providers because they also did some magic things to make sure that we looked after the customers and the residents and the communities of those that were directly affected by floods and cyclones and earthquakes and fires and all those sorts of things that have been happening.</p>
          <p>Okay, so for the highlights for the year, the numbers I think you're all very familiar with, 4% sales, EBITDA up 6.6%, EBIT up 6.2%, net profit after tax up 6% to $1.161 billion, EPS up slightly higher at 6.9% to $0.95 and dividends per share up 7.5% to $0.57 for the half and ROFE down 108 basis points to 16.7% and Tom will put a bit more color into that when he talks to the ROFE slide.</p>
          <p>So to our highlights and I won't talk too much on this because clearly we've got Greg and Julie and Debra and Steve to talk about little bit later, but we're particularly pleased with the fact that we maintained, in fact grew, our grocery share over the half, but in Fresh and Liquor we had very, very strong, well ahead of market and competitor growth in Fresh categories and Liquor categories.</p>
          <p>More importantly, our new format is something that I'm very excited about, the Langton's one. It continues to have tremendous acceptance, both we can see in the store numbers, the Fresh penetration, but our focus groups since then have really told us that we've got the superior format in the marketplace. And more importantly, we've maintained a real price leadership during the half which was something that was very important to us and we're going to make sure that we continue to do that.</p>
          <p>Just wanted to remind everybody that we were the people that actually started this by reducing 5000 products and we now have 12,000 products on national pricing. We were the ones that actually led the reduction in meat prices, we were the people that actually reduced on a national basis the price of vitamins and a number of other categories and we've also made steps in bread in recent days and also in Liquor. So our promise to our customers, particularly in the staples, they're not going to go into a competitor and find a product that they need cheaper, is something that we hold very dearly and something that we won't compromise on.</p>
          <p>Our exclusive brands continue to go particularly well in all of our businesses, not just in food but a good example of that is in fact our Macro brand, food that's good-for-you and you can see here some pics of organic produce in lamb and beef and in fruit and vegetables and the Macro brand has got amazing growth. We've got &#x2013; excluding the produce branded products some 240-odd at the moment and you'll see that this brand will explode over the next year or so into a much larger brand. In fact, my personal bet is that I think over the long term Macro has the opportunity to go past Home Brand as our biggest single brand.</p>
          <p>In New Zealand, in a slowing economy and one where we had the second quarter affected by an increase in the GST, we managed to grow market share very strongly. We grew EBIT very strongly, we reinvested in price, however we were able, as we did in the Australian supermarkets through much better control of shrinkage, improve global sourcing, private label penetration and sales mix trending towards the Fresh. We're able to have an increased gross margin in both but invest quite strongly in price at the same time. And the new Countdown, new generation Countdown and you can see Pukekohe store in New Zealand just are getting sensational results when we transform an existing business into that.</p>
          <p>In BIG W, we're continuing to focus on value and customers every day, so in terms of customer count, another strong half. In terms of volume, an extremely strong half. New brands there that you can see in terms of Mambo and the Peter Morrissey brand, big leadership in discount department store with brands like Apple, major reseller now of Apple accessories, the new toy range is going really well, optical is going really well and online is fast approaching 10,000 items. And we believe that we have &#x2013; in fact we've got the plans to open up to 20 new stores over the next three years.</p>
          <p>The lowest price position we absolutely own. If you've been into some BIG W stores, you'll no doubt see the famous trolleys out in the front where we do comparative shopping and our Dare to Compare Wall and our Shelf Talkers around the store where it clearly shows that we maintain and will maintain our price leadership on like-for-like items in this space.</p>
          <p>In Dick Smith, we're completing &#x2013; well continuing the transformation of this business and obviously in terms of range, in terms of the service offering, the Techxperts, our online business is amazingly strong, our sales are still going particularly well. Of course the challenge is in gross margin, particularly with the strong Australian dollar and the natural deflation in this area and the mix change that we've experienced over time. But pleased to see that we've returned to profitability in this business and the new offering, particularly the bricks and mortar one is doing particularly well.</p>
          <p>Talking about online, overall up 75%. The Dan Murphy business will open transactionally in the next couple of weeks and early to mid March and New Zealand also continues to go particularly well. Our engagement with our customers continues to grow with more and more people joining Everyday Rewards and linking it to Qantas Frequent Flyer; compelling proposition with both fuel discount and Qantas Frequent Flyer points and the opportunity to redeem them for either gift cards or flights or something from the Qantas shopping mall. And likewise in New Zealand, we've got a great growth there in the Onecard, we nearly have half the population there that are members of our Onecard. And more importantly, the information that we're getting is proving invaluable for the future ranging promotion and pricing of our stores across the &#x2013; our brands and in particular our supermarkets.</p>
          <p>In Financial Services, we continued to add to our stable, so the Qantas Frequent Flyer points, Everyday Rewards card, platinum $89 fee has stolen most of the market share in terms of the new cards issued in Australia. The Everyday Money one continues to grow and once again remains the most awarded credit card in the country by CANNEX. Everyday Money, the relatable debit card, alternative to a bank account is off to a fantastic start and of course the single load, prepaid debit card is also proving to be immensely popular. So we're making great traction in that area.</p>
          <p>Quantum, in the tradition of Refresh and Mercury, continues to give us the opportunity over the next five years to deliver significant value to our business and we've identified the vast majority of what we initially targeted and we have got every confidence we're going to deliver that. In fact a number of the major work streams have commenced and we're already seeing, particularly in gross margin, some wonderful results of shrinkage reduction and parallel importing and a whole host of other things that are aiding our gross margin and giving us the ability to invest in price.</p>
          <p>You can see the five areas that, not exclusively, but the five major areas where we're working at the moment. And as I said, we are very confident these are going to be big contributors to the overall efficiency of our business going forward.</p>
          <p>In the supply chain, you can see there that we've got a big body of work. Probably the most important one is Next Gen Replenishment that we're pretty much on the way with. This is actually the next generation of AutoStockR and StockSmart basically becomes one product, extends internationally. It will give us capabilities that quite frankly I don't think any other retailer that I'm aware of has got at the moment. So it's going to be, as AutoStockR and StockSmart were transformational in our business, this has the opportunity to have a similar impact on our business.</p>
          <p>Global Sourcing, the volumes were up 50% over last year and meat processing and distribution operation WA is well underway and we've got DCs happening. Home Improvement, one in Hoppers Crossing has been commissioned and is taking in product at the moment. So BIG W, Consumer Electronics and Home Improvement in a campus in Hoxton Park is well and truly underway, if you go down the M7 you'd probably notice it.</p>
          <p>And our Melbourne NDC, the work has completed there and we're getting a fantastic return on our investment there with significant increased capacity and efficiency and cost reductions. And the Tasmanian Regional Distribution will replace four very old facilities we have in Tasmania and that will greatly improve our position there.</p>
          <p>In Home Improvement, we're well underway in achieving our target of 150 sites within the first five years. Our first stores are going to open in the first half of this calendar year and we aim to have around 15 to 20 stores open in the first 12 to 18 months. IT systems are underway, all the things that we need in terms of store layout, merchandising, supply, trading terms, et cetera, et cetera, are underway. The recruitment and training for the first stores is underway. We're leveraging very much the training capability of Lowes. In fact early teams have been in the States training with the Lowes folk and we also acquired a number of small businesses that are part of our overall plan and good progress has been made on integration of that.</p>
          <p>We announced today that we bought the Cellarmasters Group for $340 million and this is very much a complementary business and it actually sells into a channel that we're not presently part of. It sells products that we don't presently sell and it has a number of other synergies that will be very important for our business, particularly we believe with the Dan Murphy online, that the distribution channel to home, which Cellarmasters has got a very good reputation we'll be able to handle that plus the Dan Murphy and also the bottling and packaging and other services that we presently contract out to others. Having it in house we think will be a very good vertical integration. More importantly, we're going to pay for it from undrawn debt at the moment and it will be earnings positive in FY12 without any synergies at all. So we think this is going to be a really good addition to our business; an enhancement both horizontally and vertically where we don't play at the moment.</p>
          <p>Our report card, you can see that we didn't get our upper single digits assisted by bolt-ons. We talked about the reasons why that might be there. EBIT did outperform sales growth and EPS outperformed EBIT growth. The CODB challenging in a deflationary time. In terms of their dollar budgets, the guys did amazingly well, but more importantly, when we look at the measures of efficiency and productivity, that's items per man hour at the front end and right through our business, the guys and girls have really stepped up to the mark and made amazing gains in productivity so that when we move back into a slightly inflationary environment where our costs of course have built-in inflation with our wage agreements and, of course, things like electricity et cetera, a little bit more than our wage agreements, the ability to actually cover those becomes a bit difficult, but that's the same for everybody. Last year we didn't make it at the half, but you might recall for the full year we did actually make the 20 basis points reduction, finally.</p>
          <p>These are just graphical representations of the numbers that we talked about before in terms of EBIT, just once again, Australian Food and Liquor, certainly did underpin the result for the group. CODB, we talked about gross margin, really just want to highlight once again that we invested quite heavily in price. You can see by deflation effect that we had for the half when we take in volume shift and specials as well as shelf reductions that negative 3.8 indicates a significant investment for the future in maintaining our price position in the marketplace. And the early benefits in terms of shrinkage and some changes in global buying et cetera, through Quantum are starting to show in gross margin.</p>
          <p>Dividends per share up 7.5% to $0.57. The dividend payout ratio is the same. And I'm now going to hand over to Greg to make some remarks about Supermarkets and then we'll ask Steve to talk about Liquor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike, look positive results for Supermarket and Liquor and this is a significantly large business that continues to grow solidly. Volume growth was strong in grocery and perishables and share in those categories has been steady. And that's pleasing when you consider that we were, as Mike mentioned, the first to hook in with price reductions, so a little over 5000 products reduced there and you saw some of the initiatives on screen and we continue to head down that path to deliver good, fair and consistent pricing offer to our customers.</p>
          <p>Fresh and Liquor have been particularly strong and Steve will cover off Liquor in some detail, but Fresh, you get a sense of what we're up to there. We hooked into Gala apples last week as a season launch and some pretty astounding results when you can sell in just one week 1,010,044 kilos of one particular product, Gala apples; so Luke, well done to you and Tobie Puttock for getting us out there.</p>
          <p>Costs well controlled in an environment where things are pretty deflationary and credit to Grant and Ziggy and the team in stores, because we're working really well there at keeping costs where we want them to be. As Michael already mentioned, a pleasing result from the new stores. We hooked into Caringbah during last year, got it completed September/October, pleased with the results out of that. We immediately threw it into Charlestown, a number of you in the room have been to Charlestown and seen that store and it continues to perform ahead of our expectations and certainly better than what we're seeing in the market.</p>
          <p>We rolled that through to some of our key traders pre-Christmas and Grant, Ziggy and Mike and the team have committed to giving us 93 of these on ground by the end of this financial year. So that will be in our new fit out and that's a combination of refits and new stores.</p>
          <p>Steve, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Greg. In what was a very difficult liquor market for the half year which saw some massive declines in beer consumption and virtually no inflation in sell price, our Liquor Group I think posted what is quite a pleasing result, $3.2 billion and that result I think outperforms all other retailers in terms of market share by some significant amount.</p>
          <p>The growth occurred in a very competitive environment, but it was profitable growth for us and it was well supported by the successes of many of our new private label portfolios. Our own brands actually grew faster than any other supplier to the Woolworths Liquor Group and it also grew faster than our total business.</p>
          <p>New products that hit the market in spirits and RTD exceeded our expectations by a significant amount. And I think also the work that our team is now doing with the Gage Road Group also saw us launch new products into categories like light beer and cider. The numbers that we achieved were double what our original targets were.</p>
          <p>Also I guess in the same sort of vein, our direct imports and parallel importing is increasingly becoming important to our business in helping us to generate additional profits. Our new DC in Brisbane, which is now around about six months old has delivered some fantastic results for our Queensland stores. It's allowed us to reduce our cost of doing business significantly in the north, it's improved our in-stock position and therefore our sales that we get from those stores and it's definitely generated additional profits for us. The transition away from ALM was seamless and we would imagine this DC will continue to improve in much the same way that Sydney and Melbourne Liquor has done over the last year.</p>
          <p>It was also a half where we opened probably the biggest rush of stores for quite some time with 12 Dan Murphy stores opening, most of them in December which challenged us and an additional 29 BWS stores, so the fleet now up to nearly 1250 stores. And Michael mentioned Dan Murphy Online we're about to launch, we've got a week or two to go and even though it's not a tradable site yet, the amount of visitation that we're getting to that site is already well beyond what our original expectations were.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>So we might ask Greg to talk about Petrol and perhaps move on to New Zealand after that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. Look a really positive result in Petrol from James and the team and he's taken over a great business that Ramnik set up. I guess what we're seeing here is really solid consistent performance in growth in fuel and that's been backed up by an even better performance in the merchandise in the store. And it's a combination of those two things along with some good buying with our partner there, Caltex, that's seen these results flow through to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>So we've done that and at the same time consistently delivered the lowest cost to our customers. And that's critical in this game because that's what supports this particular business. And just a real highlight here and I want to commend James for this one. He's followed wonderfully well from Ramnik, not one LTI in this business in the first six months of this financial year, so well done James.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, I'm sure Peter Smith who runs the business, would absolutely love to be here today. And Peter and his team have done a really sensational job. Right at this point in time he's endeavoring to get around Christchurch and he rang me literally about two hours ago just to give me an update. His words were, it's a bit like a war zone. Now Pete and I went down there after the 7.1 quake. He said to me, it is a heck of a lot different down there today. So look, we've got 14 stores in that particular catchment and I'm pleased to say that today we've got 8 of them open. We've got a couple of our own DCs on the ground there and the team are doing a marvelous job getting those operating where we've actually flown a few people down from Christchurch to help get some orders picked, but it's a pretty trying time for us down there and I know that all of us who've ever experienced anything like this can appreciate the wonderful efforts that are going on.</p>
          <p>To the business itself, look, a really pleasing result and I guess what we're seeing in here is a business that's through transition and it's now just getting on with the task ahead. The conversion of three brands to one clearly is resonating well with the customers and Mike and I were there Friday/Saturday just this last week and we were able to get around a number of the stores and you can see it reflected in the fresh offering in the store, the in-stock position, the enthusiasm of the team and that shows through in just a nice solid increase in both units in terms of market share growth and also in terms of dollars, so nice and steady. Store standards are really, really good and lots of enthusiasm in the business.</p>
          <p>And just finally, the new National Distribution Centre there where the team under Geoff Thomas have done a marvelous job getting that into shape. That will come online later this year and that's going to be a wonderful addition to the network there and allow us to do things like take stock that's direct to store and put it through the DC, improve service levels to customers, so good business and performing really, really well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Greg and over to Julie to talk about BIG W.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. Well it's been a very interesting environment for those of us that are in discretionary retail as others' results have shown. However the BIG W business is in great shape for the future because we know our customers understand our offer and they know that we represent value, great price, widest range and quality branded merchandise. And we know that they recognize this because in fact our customer transactions have grown in the first half.</p>
          <p>In the first half we experienced significant deflation right across our business and this was largely driven off the strength of the Australian dollar. We also had a slow start to summer with our summer seasonal sales being impacted but also our outdoor categories impacted as well, like our sporting aquatic and also our cooling categories.</p>
          <p>Pleasingly, as I said, our customer transactions and also the units that each customer purchased, were positive, but this didn't offset the impact of deflation on our sales. Our gross margin was up 45 basis points and this was largely driven off some good control around markdowns and an increase in the product that we sourced through our global sourcing office. Our costs were well controlled. Our overall dollars were only slightly up and in fact the percentage to sales increased because of the deflation. But what we did deliver, as Mike said, is a real increase in our store productivity and that will serve us well into the future.</p>
          <p>Our sales decline of $70 million translated to an EBIT decline of $25 million. We now have 164 stores, two more to open in the second half and in fact we have the potential for 20 more sites in the next three years.</p>
          <p>In relation to the work we're doing in supply chain, we're really pleased with the early signs of the CARS program which is the newer version of AutoStockR and you could see this in our business in our in-stock position as we led into Christmas and then as we came out of it. In addition to that, I went to Hoxton Park which is our new DC on Monday and really pleased with the progress there, because together, those two things, an automated replenishment system and a new DC, are going to support the future growth of BIG W.</p>
          <p>And lastly, in the last seven weeks or the first seven weeks of this half, we've been really pleased to see the continuation of the strong customer growth with 500,000 more customers shopping in our business so far this year. And what we know is that this supports what our research tells us which is BIG W absolutely owns value in this market. It's about price, it's about quality and it's about widest range. And at the end of the day, that's what a discount department store's about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Julie; and Debra, Consumer Electronics.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Mike. Well as Mike said earlier, the repositioning of the Dick Smith business is well and truly underway. We now have over 50% of the network converted into the new format and will complete a further 40 stores in the second half.</p>
          <p>And it was an extremely challenging half with tight consumer spending and significant price deflation in the categories that we deal in. We were able to deliver positive sales growth and we were pleased, mildly pleased, with our reasonable comp growth of 4.1% in Australia. But we were very pleased with our comp growth in our new format stores of 16%.</p>
          <p>The sales really do reflect our strong customer acceptance of our new formats and our new offer and we continue to gain market share in those categories that really mean a lot to us, so computing, entertainment, gaming and communications.</p>
          <p>However the change in our new format, as expected, has changed our sales mix, our gross margin mix and our CODB. Costs were controlled, however and we have a very aggressive COD program that will deliver some good results in the second half and in the coming year.</p>
          <p>Online is also another very exciting area for us. Dick Smith has had an online business, as a lot of you would know, for many years. However with our new platform we're gaining very strong momentum and we have a fantastic customer engagement, particularly I'm getting a lot of feedback with ease of use and navigation on the website. And if you haven't been on it, I invite you to test it out. What is even more pleasing is that we launched Click &amp; Collect in October and that is around doing the research online, clicking online and collecting in store and I'm pleased to say that the take up rate is over 80% of customers actually clicking online and collecting in store.</p>
          <p>New Zealand, well it certainly is a tale of two countries and New Zealand does continue to be very challenging for us. We do, though, continue to maintain our market share and our new formats in that market are also performing well. With recent events in Christchurch, as Mike has mentioned and as Greg has mentioned though, we do anticipate that this is actually going to have an impact on the market and we see challenging times ahead. I'm really pleased to say that of our 115 people in the immediate Christchurch area, our team members there, we had no serious injury. We have had some serious injury of extended family members and our teams are really looking after those team members.</p>
          <p>India, everyone's always interested in India, well it certainly continues to please. We've had good growth. We now have over 61 stores across all of the national cities or regional cities and profit just continues to improve year on year.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, I think it's fair to say that we are fairly pleased with the overall transitioning of the Dick Smith business and we fully expect continued growth and improved profitability, albeit there is still a lot of work to be done.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thanks, Debra. Tom, would you mind talking through the pubs and then perhaps going on to some of the financials?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. In relation to the hotels for the six months, this business is actually proving particularly resilient at the moment. We've got probably one of the best management teams in the Bruce Mathieson Group running our hotels, so it's a particularly strong partnership between Woolworths and Bruce and his management team.</p>
          <p>I think even though our earnings are a little bit lower than last year, we actually delivered better earnings than we expected for this half, which is a positive. And as you can see by the comp store sales and the table on the left hand page, the second quarter was particularly strong with 5% comps. That was partly attributed to gaming but also attributed to food and bars within the hotels. So that's particularly good.</p>
          <p>We opened up our 50th Dan Murphy and as most of you know this business is an adjunct to our liquor business. Not only do we have 50 Dan Murphy on ALH sites we also have hundreds of BWSs spread right across Australia attached to our hotel business. The changes in 2012 which will see quite a beneficial impact to this business are on track and so I think the 2012-13 year will be particularly good. We've got 284 hotels at the moment.</p>
          <p>Turning to the balance sheet, our balance sheet remains particularly strong. There's a couple of elements that I'll explain. Our inventory at December was up 7% primarily because the month of December trading or the trading in that month, primarily in the general merchandise businesses wasn't as strong as what we had planned for and that's pretty much across all of the discretionary retailers in Australia.</p>
          <p>So we had a bit of a spike in December and that stock in January and February has already started to wind down and will continue to do so through to June. In our net repayable debt our borrowings have increased primarily to fund capital expenditure. Our strategic property development program, which is really going to underpin our store roll outs over the next three to five years and the two share buy backs that we undertook, one in this half and one in the other half and our shareholders' equity has reduced, really reflecting the capital return on those buybacks.</p>
          <p>Our average inventory data, even though our spot inventory data for December was up our average inventory days over the half compared to last half, were actually well controlled and clearly if we hadn't had the spike in December our average inventory data would have been quite good. In our Woolworths super business if you take out indent and liquor we were actually down about 0.7 days on average inventory over the period. So that just shows the continuing capacity of the supermarkets business to reduce inventory and now we've got the distribution centers in liquor that trend will continue.</p>
          <p>Cash flow, our EBITDA was up 6.6% however our cash provided by operating activities was only up 1.2%. Primarily that was due to the increase in inventory in December which, as I said, will pass through in January, February and March. So there was a bit of a spike there which pulled the cash realization down a bit. Our CapEx we spent just over $1 billion, excluding the property development CapEx, our ongoing CapEx net off disposals was about the same as we spent in the prior year. We generated free cash flow of $785 million. We paid a dividend of $662 million. So we had surplus cash of $123 million and we re-geared our balance sheet with the share buyback.</p>
          <p>As I said our pre-cash flow to Net PAT was slightly down on last year and the year before. If we had adjusted for the inventory and we didn't have that spike we would have been at about 82% which is a pretty good outcome. Shareholder payouts, I think this is a particular good outcome for Woolworths shareholders so we have maintained our dividend payout ratio. We have returned over $1 billion of capital to shareholders and if you're a Woolies shareholder I think that's a great position to be in to know that you've got a reliable capital stream coming from Woolworths and since 2001 we've returned over $9.5 billion.</p>
          <p>In terms of capital management we have, as I said, completed the $700 million off market buyback. In September 2010 we issued $1.25 billion of notes into the 144A market into the U.S. This was a particularly successful offering. We were heavily oversubscribed in the U.S. market. The attractiveness of Woolworths in that market I think took us all by surprise and clearly that is a great source of funds that Woolworths will continue to have going forward. We have some re-financing coming up. We have a $600 million hybrid, a small $300 million U.S. 144A notes and we have to re-finance two syndicated bank loan facilities. All of that financing is in place and there won't be any particular issues in re-financing those facilities.</p>
          <p>In terms of property as most of you would know we're in the market at the moment selling or attempting to sell a large swag of property. We think it will be somewhere between $300 million and $700 million worth that we'll sell. We've got quite a few interested parties in either a portfolio of assets or individual sites and we're particularly pleased how that is progressing. As we said when we started this we have no need to sell the assets, however we spotted an opportunity in the market where we thought the buyers would be keen to proceed and that is in fact the case.</p>
          <p>Our return on funds employed is about 16.7% so it's still particularly strong. It's down a bit on last year. It's really been impacted by the lower earnings in the general merchandise business, the strategic investment in property and the one off increase in inventory levels at December and if you adjust for those you'll find it had normal trends. Return on equity is up at 16% reflecting the share buyback.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks Tom and finally just to reinforce with everybody that we very much clearly believe in having good strategic background for everything we do. We're very comfortable to continue to put long term performance targets out there and have ourselves and the market judge us by that and we haven't changed those and we've also got, as Tom has outlined, a very clear capital management objectives around capital strength and making sure that we maintain our appropriate ratings. In terms of the key growth initiatives, the slide is very much the same as we've seen in the past.</p>
          <p>Clearly the important thing about strategies are that they are living documents, they are not things that are set in concrete. There are some things like our pricing policy and our contract to our customers to deliver the best value don't change but as the world changes and as customers needs and wants for today and tomorrow change then you need to make sure that your strategies evolve and that's exactly what happens within Woolworths and we will continue to invest in making sure that we really do understand through the various methodologies that are available what it is that customers want in our various brands today and tomorrow.</p>
          <p>In terms of the guidance, earlier today I reconfirmed our guidance subject to the normal caveats around uncertainty on inflation and its level and the prospect of interest rate rises as a result of that, the level of strength of the Australian dollar versus the U.S. and particularly the propensity of Australian consumers to save rather than spend and so we reconfirmed that net profit after tax for the full year will grow in the range of 5% to 8% plus over a period this year and EPS growth for the full year of plus 6% to plus 9%.</p>
          <p>I also made a comment on early trading for the first eight weeks of the quarter and we've been pleasantly surprised in all except one and that's New Zealand Consumer Electronics which continues to be in negative territory but all of our businesses have improved their running rate on the half and December and probably the most pleasing one has been the return to positive numbers in a strong fashion of BIG W. But all of our businesses are doing well. The latest market share numbers that we got off for January in our food businesses show that we're growing market share pretty strongly in January.</p>
          <p>So we're pretty happy with the start although I mentioned earlier today it would be a very brave person to extrapolate eight weeks into 26 weeks but I'd much rather be here today talking about positive news rather than negative news. So take that for what you take from it but early days things are looking a little bit brighter but we know in retailing things can change pretty quickly over night.</p>
          <p>So with that, ladies and gentlemen I open to the floor. So once again if you just direct the questions to me and I'll play judge and jury and decide whether it's me. If it's a really hard one they get it, if it's an easy one I'll look good and answer it.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, Michael. Ben Gilbert from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Ben.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just the first question, you talked about how you guys did actually start the shelf prices reduced but it seems like your major competitors probably got a bit of the ascendancy on the marketing side of things in the last 12 months. I'm just wanting your feeling on that and whether there's any change in strategy there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Strategies always change. What I can say is that there are a number of attributes you've got to look at. So whenever we have promotional or advertising that goes out and our competitors do we go into research and we check one, that the message gets through, what was the cut through, what was the recall, et cetera, et cetera. Our trolley basket one actually outperformed all the others in the marketplace. Not by much but it actually had really good recall, really good cut through because it actually talked about &#x2013; there was some confusion with some of them about whether it was about a product or about across the thing.</p>
          <p>With the basket it was very clear it was across a lot of products. The second one is we obviously get the price perception scores on a regular basis and they're tracking we're still ahead and maintain the lead that we've had against our major competitor. What's been interesting though is that both of us have actually shortened the gap between the discounter out there, ALDI in price perception because of the full on supermarkets we've held that position but in overall market, in terms of discount, ALDI clearly has had that but the gap has changed quite dramatically in the last 12, particularly once we started our 5000 price reduction.</p>
          <p>However, that being said this is a very fluid thing and you can read the numbers and you can make a decision but we don't for one moment take anything lightly. So you'll see some things that are pretty exciting over the next little while. I think the apple promotion was a great example of how we can actually turn a simple event like new season's apples into a magic event and you're going to find that we're going to have some fun over the next 12 months or so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just in terms of December on the inventory build, I wondered how much of that was actually in food and how December was in the Food and Liquor business versus expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, most of it was in general merchandise to be quite frank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just finally on the New Zealand business, in terms of the increase in the GST over there are you seeing a benefit in terms of people trading down to private label and that's a big driver of mixed benefits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I haven't put two and two together but there's no doubt that private label has been immensely strong in our Food business. Clearly it hasn't our Consumer Electronics business, particularly another 2.5% on top of what's an expensive purchase to begin with but in Food there's no doubt that it's helped, yep. Shaun?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Shaun Cousins, JPMorgan. Just a question regarding Australian Food and Liquor. Your margins expanded around 32 basis points, that's the lowest since the first half '05.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Should we anticipate going forward, given Coles are a much better &#x2013; lower rates of inflation, you've got cost of doing business going up, that you're going to be a lower EBIT margin and actually a lower EBIT growth? I think your high single digit Food and Liquor EBIT growth. You're going to be a lower EBIT growth business going forward given where your margins are and given the increased competition in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well what I would say is that we actually never focus on those percentages. So if we actually had some inflation in that last half you would have seen a pretty good result on the bottom line. So we don't actually focus on that's the gross margin percentage we want or that's the EBIT margin. We talk about it because it's actually the truth. We actually focus on making sure that we keep our volumes and our customer counts growing. What happened in the last half was we invested pretty heavily in price and we got great volume increase but we didn't quite get the dollars that we wanted and that reflects both. Probably it has its biggest impact when that happens on your cost of doing business because obviously you've got to work really hard on your productivity to nullify that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Doesn't that mean, so even looking at a dollar basis you're moving into given &#x2013; you have to invest more in price, you're moving towards a lower EBIT dollar growth story in the Australian Food and Liquor division relative to what you've had for many years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it very much depends on where the market sits on price. So our position is that we're going to maintain price leadership. One of the things that people have to consider on this is when you jump on the back of the tiger you need to be ready for a long ride.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> there's more in gross margin than just price and the advantages we've got in gross margin will continue. So shrinkage and <mark type="inaudible" /> deliveries for liquor and all those other things that we have plus Quantum will continue to drive out costs. So it's not a clear &#x2013; you know, you're asking for one element but there's so many levers in a supermarket that you can actually pull to achieve a result. Sometimes we'll pull back and I think you and I have had this conversation before, sometimes we'll pull back, sometimes we'll expand, so it all depends what's going on at the moment and in a deflationary environment which we've had we have the result we've got.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You reiterated again your longer-term earnings growth forecast of sales in upper single digits EBIT faster than sales and in EPS. I mean, where do you see that sort of leading into? Does it lead you to more and more of this 5% to 8% type impact growth or does it see you return &#x2013; or should we look at this fiscal '11 being a slowdown in growth and then a return to your more historical levels that have been closer to that 8% to 11% and arguably into the double digit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So let me just take this in two bits. If you actually added back in the deflationary effect in liquor, in general merchandise and food on to the numbers or even took part thereof, we'd be actually in the sales number that we wanted to. If we actually had that our cost of doing business as a percent of sales would actually have decreased quite substantially because we've made real productivity gains. So I've got no doubt, in fact we've done a little exercise, we would have actually got there. Sorry, what was the last bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm just thinking, well I mean maybe further to that, if you're going to go into a deflationary environment and Coles aren't going to give you guys any chances to keep prices up, whereas in the past say under previous management they might have been a bit lax, does it not mean that you're going to have a lower rate of impact growth going forward? Because you won't get the inflation that you spoke of and you won't fractionalize the costs in the manner that you spoke of.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well there will always be some inflation once cost increases and commodity prices come through. It's who actually passes on the most that actually is the price leader. I'm very, very comfortable, given our price checks, that we actually have maintained our price leadership in the marketplace. So whilst others may be coming down they actually have to come down to where we are, not the other way around. So, it's interesting, we increased our margin a little bit, I know that we weren't the only supermarket to increase their margin over the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally, just in regards to inflation, how are you guys seeing food inflation at the moment given you obviously put a release out about banana prices having to go out, supply domestically and then also global commodity?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Greg, do you want to just talk about what we're seeing in inflation just in general terms, particularly in produce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, produce is certainly under inflationary pressure at the moment and it's not just the cyclone, it was the rain that then hit Victoria. So it's double digit at this point in terms of produce and probably will stay that way for a little bit and then it will come down. On a wider scale there's no doubt that there's some suppliers out there looking to move some pricing but as we all know it's a wonderfully competitive market and the retailers will push back and the suppliers will push forward and eventually you end up somewhere where it should sit. So, at this point quite a bit of talk, not a lot of action and we'll just see what happens.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. You're going to &#x2013; good, I thought the Shaun Cousins' memorial microphone was going to stay there. Morning, hey Craig.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Craig Woolford from Citi. I just wanted to follow on from the question around gross margins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Please fix my logic, because prices you said fell about 3.8% in the first half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If that was what Woolworths had absorbed, you also had other initiatives. But your gross margin was up. So had you found 400 basis points of initiatives through direct sourcing, through shrinkage reductions in the half, it seems like a very large number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well don't forget that change includes some mix change so if people move to private label et cetera, et cetera. We did find some really good gains and continue to do so in shrinkage reduction across our business. Particularly in the Fresh areas we've done remarkably well, but right across all of our businesses. Ian's team has done a great job with improving our global sourcing position, so we're buying things a whole lot better.</p>
          <p>And the other areas around products that we used to buy off vendors here that we now parallel import and there's good gains to be made there. You cannot translate because I watch the prices every week. You cannot translate improved gross margin as being the equivalent of putting prices up because quite the opposite is contrary and that deflationary number just shows overall that we've done that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just follow up with a question on BIG W? The margins are now below key competitor Kmart. If I flip the margin around and look at it as a cost margin, Kmart is able to do &#x2013; run its business with a lower cost structure. Most of that would be around its ability to source better and cheaper products out of China. Is there any thought that BIG W would want to shift it's positioning around private label to direct sourcing more product from China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh look, we recognize that our competitor actually was in global sourcing for a lot longer than us and have a much bigger number. It's upside for us, particularly in BIG W and we're looking at new markets. So we've got new sourcing office in the subcontinent that's showing some really good opportunities for us, particularly in textiles going forward. Julie-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I would add is what's fundamental to our strategy is our focus on national brands. So we're not planning on changing that any time soon. So whilst we will source more out of China directly, we still will continue to be the widest range of national branded product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So there are some products that are branded products that we now pick up in China and our plan as part of our next gen is to be able to do that more and more. And we do that in other products as well. So they are branded products but we bypass normal logistical channels and bring it in directly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Last question on Home Improvement. I understand that's still in the central cost line. Was it a net contributor to earnings in the first half of '11 and what should we expect around start up losses or the implications for FY12?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Away you go Tom.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah no it wasn't a net contributor. We absorbed the cost. But the Danks acquisition and the other acquisitions that we've made in this space have helped absorb the start up costs. Probably to, I would say a reasonable degree in the first half. We haven't given any indication of start up costs. But we've said we will absorb them as we go through in our guidance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's a good coincidence of the upside in our hotel business with the start up of the &#x2013; that's with the Victorian changes. So we think that we'll be able absorb those pretty well, the start up costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay if I can just squeeze in there a clarification for central overheads fell by about $10 million, what particular initiatives drove such a fall and was <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah there was, well primarily it was just costs that we incurred in the last half that we didn't incur this half. That's primarily. We had the full Danks business in there again. So there was no &#x2013; it was just sort of one off costs that we had last year that dropped away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But there has been as part of Quantum, we've reorganized a lot of our central overheads. So above the store level. So it's area managers and above and everybody in the various offices. We've actually brought those numbers back to basically to 2005, 2006 levels over the last little while. So we've redeployed a heck of a lot of people back into operational roles and that's actually going to put us in great stead going forward.</p>
          <p>So we already had a pretty efficient overhead model in terms of the numbers, but we've set ourselves a challenge to actually recalibrate again &#x2013; and part of Quantum has been organizational redesign that's partially underway and already it's actually delivered as I said above the store manager line. We're now back with a much, much larger business. And I think we were doing $30 billion back in 2005, 2006. We're a substantially bigger business, but we've actually got a few less people. Howdy.</p>

          <p>Hello, Michael. Greg Dring from Macquarie. Can I seek some clarification on an answer you gave a moment ago? I'm just going to paraphrase it, but I think you're suggesting that the leverage you get in hotels from EGM ownership in Victoria is going to create a pool that's equal to or greater than the start up losses from Home Improvements?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said it will go a long way to it, yeah. We think that the upside out of Victoria is a material number. We're pretty sure on that. And it will go quite a way to counterbalancing the start up costs for Home Improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so the question I was going to ask then is, is the material number that you guys have in mind allowing for the possibility that some proposals in certain minister's websites regarding bet limits and what have you, are or are not implemented?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That may have a small effect but to be quite frank, I would suggest that any changes that may happen will happen over a longer period of time. So by then the Home Improvement will be a strong contributing part of our business. But this is a very, very complex area of change and we've got the State Government's sovereignty and a whole host of things that clearly need to be played out.</p>
          <p>There is no doubt the State Governments have got a very strong view about where they want it to be. We're on record saying that we support voluntary pre-commitment. But even if it went in, it's quite frankly going to take many, many years for it to be across.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on loyalty. You know it's a capability you've been developing but it doesn't have a lot of visibility to us and we can't see its value.</p>

          <p>Pete, he's talking about you. I'll introduce you to Mr. Dring later.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So there's a competitive advantage here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me just address the first part. We've got absolutely enough people. And it was interesting, we actually had some friends of ours that have come across from the UK who were involved in the Tesco dunnhumby stuff and so they've got a working knowledge and working relationship. The things that we've been able to do they haven't seen anywhere else. So there are some measures that we'd been able to calculate and then validate that surprised the heck out of this particular person when we showed them.</p>
          <p>So it's early days yet. But we'll be changing very much the way that we think about particularly our grocery business and some early results that are very, very encouraging, very encouraging. So we're comfortable that we've got where we need to be. Can we improve it, can we continue to grow? Absolutely. Can Peter have any person that he wants, additional resources? Absolutely, if he wants them. But at the moment Pete's very comfortable with the team that he's got. It's not large but they're pretty smart. There's quite a few PhDs in maths and things like that that float round Woolworths that help us a hell of a lot.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. So yeah what you get on a free range chicken breast can vary completely on a packet of almonds. So it's-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the investment there in private label, is that part of the reason your cost of doing business is going up? Does it cost more to serve that private label offering?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No it's cheaper actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it reduces your cost of doing business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes cause you're actually in total control of the whole packaging, the whole way to market, the whole logistical piece. So part of the reason that you can actually sell it typically cheaper than the market equivalent is because you actually control all of that behind it. So you actually end up with a net, net cost that's better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just one on the Home Improvement. You bought some businesses there through the period. Are you going to convert those into the new format and is that in the guidance for that 15 to 20 stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got some that we've bought that have a mixture of sites that are large enough to build a large one and some smaller stores. So the large ones we will be building and some are and some aren't in the numbers that we talked about before. The smaller stores our plan is to run them to get them into a good shape and then potentially franchise them out. So we don't see that we will have 3000 small stores, we will actually buy them, get them into a position where we can then flip them and obviously control through a head lease and through supply agreements going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So how many stores exactly have you acquired there? I think there's about $113 million you spent?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From memory there's the three this year, there must have been close to 20 odd stores I think. Might be 20, 23 stores all up something like that. Grant, the primary &#x2013; would that be right Grant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>19.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>19 I was close. The primary reason though for those is that these are family group stores primarily and they general have a large block of land or they already have a large Home Improvement store on it which we can convert in time into a new format. But 15 to 20 stores that is in this, is all big box Home Improvement stores. So there's no little you know corner stores in that 15 to 20 number, they are big box.</p>

So can you just give us a sense for that dynamic? And obviously is the better sales that you're seeing in January as a result of better sell through at full price merchandise or are you just trying to get rid of the stock that was excess at year end?</p>

          <p>If I look at your sales gross and I then I look at your rent increase &#x2013; rent increase 4.3%, sales gross was less than that excluding petrol 3.8%. Can you give us an indication please as to what proportion of your rent expense is tied to sales? What proportion is inflation driven? And therefore if I looked at it say around about 50:50 it would suggest to me that your inflation component on rent is significantly higher than underlying inflation is tracking at the moment, is that the case?</p>

          <p>Yeah, I was just going to say, we might have to take that one on notice, but just a quick answer. The vast bulk of our business is on turnover rent. So all of our supermarkets I think a great deal of our Dan Murphy's, is that right Steve?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Roughly. Yeah that's right. So bulk goods on turnover and turnover has gone up. New stores are in that. So as we've rolled out new stores over the period. So we did 160 something odd new stores now. So you've got to allow for that as well. The CPI increases are mainly-</p>

        <plist>
          <p>How about we not keep guessing the answer. But the answer is we don't pay rent for businesses that we're not operating.

So let's do some analysis and not only for yourself, we'll share it to whoever else who wants to get it from Jean but yeah.</p>

          <p>And if I have a look at your guidance reiterated now compared to the 24th of January, since then we've had milk price come down substantially, which you're saying you're funding. Since then we've had an increased level of donations because you've continued the donations to Queensland and you're now doing the same for Christchurch which is fantastic. And we've also had the impact of Christchurch et cetera where I would imagine that you will probably have an insurance excess on that one as well. Would I be correct in saying that all of that extra cost to you has been offset by the improvement that you're seeing in the underlying business, particularly in BIG W?</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah if we thought that those elements &#x2013; cause we've had time to think about it between the 24th and now, we needed to change our guidance and we would have. But we think we've got our capacity within the business to cope with those. I think Christchurch, there's going to be some debate whether this was a new earthquake or an aftershock and whether we pay excess again or not. It will be an interesting debate I think.</p>

To me a key motivation of that one has got to be the direct platforms that they've got &#x2013; the direct to customer platform that they've got. You can roll that out for a Dan Murphy's, I can understand that. Can you also roll that out for some of the other businesses?</p>

          <p>I don't think so and I'm looking at Ramnik. I think it's fairly evenly spread across right across the business and Food and Liquor will get its fair share, yeah. So Ramnik's just confirming what I read in the projections going forward.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So I guess it's relative to what you did under Refresh, where rather than getting its fair share it got most of the cost saving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well it got most &#x2013; well I'm not sure it got most of it but it got quite a bit of it, there's no doubt about that. Because a lot of it, you might recall, was we had 7 Supermarket businesses that we rolled into one and we had some significant opportunities to look at costs across states for product that we bought. We see going forward project Quantum will deliver to all of our businesses and Supermarket being the largest part of our business will get the largest part of the benefit, there's no doubt.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. <mark type="inaudible" /> you've given the comment at the Group level, I think, it's roughly up 3%. That includes on-premise liquor which is sitting in Hotels. Was there a major difference between on-premise and off-premise liquor growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Off-premise was, particularly Dan Murphy, had a brilliant half, to be quite frank. And brilliant even though most of its new stores actually came just before Christmas, as did in fact most of the new Supermarkets which had an effect on our sales per square meter for the half. But, Steve?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say, Mike, it's probably fair to say Hotels, you know, after a fairly subdued year, really had a back half of the year that was fantastic for on-premise bar sales, particularly.</p>
          <p>Danks I think outgrew the market probably about 3 to 1 from what the rest of the market grew at, so I think it's probably fair to say there's a bit of both going on. On-premises is doing well as well as the off.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A question on capital management. I've been reading your commentary there. It seems to be more comments suggesting future growth is where you're going to look. I just wanted to clarify that, whether I'm misreading it or whether the capital management may be more of on the backburner now, as acquisitions such as what you've just down with Cellarmasters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Even-handed is the best way to look at it, Phil, so at a point in time if we determine we've got excess capital we'll return it, but if we have acquisitions on the horizon we won't. So there's no bias one way or the other. We really just assess it as we go through the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one from me is on Danks' profitability. I know it peaks away in the corporate line but the dollar profit from the Danks business, would that have gone up significantly first up this year versus last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, obviously it's gone up because we've owned it for the full year as opposed to part year, or full half versus just a month or two when we announced it.</p>
          <p>Obviously, Home Improvement per se, and we saw that in the large plan in the marketplace, slowed down a bit, particularly going to Christmas with all the wet weather, so lot of building sites actually closed down earlier. The Danks business obviously has got pretty good growth in the bottom line because we've added some acquisitions to it over the last half. But the Danks business itself has held its own. We haven't had spectacular growth but we had a really good solid half for the guys.</p>
          <p>We've been able to introduce some significant synergies into the business through the leverage of the Greater Woolworths Group with such things as telecoms and bank fees and a whole host of other things that just changed the cost structure of Danks going forward. But there's still a lot more to be done in that area as Grant will remind me.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just have a question on BIG W, the cost of doing business was up 135 basis points for the half. I understand that cost in dollar terms well it's slightly up. But given sales have been stalled for almost 9 months now, why haven't costs been able to be treated inline? Is it right to assume that the variable cost component is now probably quite low or has there been some specific type issues in the half that we need to be thinking about?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The main issue has really been the enormous volume increase that we've had. So there are many items that up 30% over last year and these are basic core commodities that really are the heart and soul of our business. So you've got 30% increase but you may not get many dollars increase but you've actually got the same labor without any productivity improvements. But what I have seen is both in the distribution and in the stores that the items per man hour, person hour I should say these days, in both of those in BIG W have been really good. But of course, each of the hours still have a built-in inflation of some 3%. So there's no one &#x2013; it's really just purely the cost of the volume increase without the accompanying sales increase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>And also just interested in your view on the FlyBuys program for Coles now that it's under full ownership. Where do you see the rifts for the Qantas program going forward if Coles actually starts to invest in that offer going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, there's no doubt that we've got the premiere airline and the premiere loyalty piece in the country. Without being rude, I'd have to say that our general view amongst the population and the research we've done is FlyBuys has been on the nose for many, many years with many people that were really disappointed in not being able to recover anything. So I think there's a big challenge if that brand is still to stay there to actually recover its position from where it is. But you know what, I wouldn't presume to prejudge the ability of anybody to do that. So good luck.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I apologize for that. But we can hear you very clearly now, so go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, very good. I'm trying to get an understanding of the performance of the cost of doing business for the half. I can understand why percentage of sales, the costs went up because of deflation. But when I look at Food and Liquor's cost of doing business, it went up by $160 million in the half, which is just over 4%. I'm following on from Daniel's question. I think BIG W's costs went up $17 million and I think you explained that, because of increased volumes, and Australian Electronics costs went up.</p>
          <p>I suppose the question that I'm trying to get my mind around is with that absolute increase in costs why is that occurring, particularly when you should be very efficient through your productivity or you should be very efficient through your supply chain and you are implementing Quantum, which is taking out further improvements. I'm just a bit, I'm trying to get my mind around why we are seeing that increase in costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we actually spend a lot of time disaggregating costs and what I can confirm is that there are no additional extra costs that are one-off in there. What I can confirm is that the productivity, that's items per man hour are well and truly there. The items that have gone up clearly are electricity, which is about half of 1% of sales goes to energy in a year. The unit cost of labor has gone up on average about 3%. But there are no additionals. The overhead costs of the Supermarket are very much contained, so there's nothing there this half that wasn't there the half the previous year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it, like when you guys say your costs are probably going to be going up around that 4% or so, does that mean that we need to see inflation up around that 3% to 4%, otherwise there could be continued margin pressure on the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it very much depends on what happens to volume. Clearly, volumes were very, very strong and we had a push towards fresh, so when your share goes towards fresh your average cost of labor, sorry, your average items per man hour is actually slightly less in fresh than it is in groceries because clearly when you look at deli and produce and meat there's quite a bit of extra handling other than just taking a box of NESCAF&#xC9; and putting it on the shelf. So the strength of our fresh food business in the last half has made a difference to it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you also said &#x2013; I think you said to Tom that increased Home Brand reduces the cost of doing business and the increase in Home Brand actually supported increase in gross margin. So I suppose there must be some other drivers of costs as well because you wouldn't have had an offset for increased Home Brand, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well the increase was marginal David, rather than being a transformational. It's not as if we suddenly sold twice as much private label. The percentage of private label as a percentage of our business hasn't moved the needle dramatically, so that would not be a reason. Should we spend a lot of time in each one of our businesses actually disaggregating costs by dollar and percentage and look at all the drivers of them and there's nothing hidden under there except other than the volume and the shift in the type of products that we're selling in some of our businesses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With Cellarmasters, I'm trying to get my mind around that acquisition. You mentioned I think in your announcement you're paying $350 million and I think from memory people around the trade are saying the EBIT is around mid 30 which is why it's profit enhancing, because your cost of debt would be cheaper so that's okay. But that business does involve a winery and a bowling facility. I'm just wondering why you'd need to buy that business given that there's a chronic excess supply of wine in the market and the availability or the source from &#x2013; to build Home Brand is readily there? I'm just wondering what the overall logic is when you probably with the Qantas business and with Dan Murphy's very stock penetration and BWS, why you'd actually need to buy that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of things &#x2013; they do sell products that Dan Murphy don't sell. In fact I had a chat to a few people this morning that aren't customers of Dan Murphy's but they're certainly customers of Cellarmasters. The other thing you might want to contemplate is that bottling plants are multi-use so just because they're presently bottling wine, they can also bottle other alcoholic beverages and they can also bottle things like water et cetera, et cetera. So don't presume that the plant will just be used for bottling wine. In fact I know that it's not used very exclusively that now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you make acquisitions like that, I mean the EBIT's right and the acquisition price is right, you're only getting a 10% return. Yes, that covers the cost of debt but it would be return diluting. I'm just wondering how you make a decision like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well clearly we've got a great view of what we believe the synergies will be. What we've said is the acquisition will actually be earnings positive with zero synergies, but we've actually got a very optimistic and confident view of the synergies that are going to be available. So we'll get a good return on this business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and just finally, can I ask if there's costs that are being capitalized from the start up of the hardware business, like the current admin costs, the research costs and are they being capitalized at the moment or are they all being expensed?</p>

          <p>The one thing that and I've said this before, December part of the schedule that we have each year for the board is to do a property PIA which covers all brands, all new stores, all refurbs that have happened in the previous five years and we look at them in groups of five, four, three, two and one year open and we're looking for the Group and then individual stores to want to achieve the business case in sales but more importantly their business case in EBIT and the PIA came through with a very clean &#x2013; in fact if anything, what we're seeing is that our guys are pretty conservative in doing the business case. So we're really confident that when we do a refurb in a new store that we do so on a conservative basis and we get a really good return. So Caringbah, which has only been going for three months, so it's got a whole heap of extra capital in there, is hitting and exceeding its EBIT increase target for a refurb.</p>

          <p>If I'm correct didn't the trading space year on year go up sort of better than 4%? So just if you look at it in terms of the amount of supermarket space you're trading in, the cost <mark type="inaudible" /> pretty good on a like for like basis.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Richard Bailey from <mark type="inaudible" />. Go ahead please.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Richard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> can you hear me okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, perfectly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm curious to get a little bit more detail on the property &#x2013; the $300 million to $700 million is that sales for the end of the calendar year or the financial year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Full year, we're hedging our bets. We think we'll get there by June. Yeah we think we'll get there by June but I've given myself a bit of leeway. Plus whilst we may complete the transaction by 30 June, because of the different stages of development of some of the properties, we may not receive the cash component until the second half of the calendar year. So that's why it's probably a bit more nebulous than it should be.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then how much more properties beyond the potential 700? I mean simplistically if I looked on the balance sheet for the end of the financial year '10, you know, round numbers it looked like it could be as much as 2.5 <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah look there's a pipeline of property that we'll be able to release subject to market conditions because we're only going to sell it if the price is right on the pun. But there is a pipeline of property there and it's very good quality property that people are interested in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just take a step back a couple of years when we got news from all of our major and medium and small developers when the GFS hit and either voluntarily or because they couldn't get finance they just said well basically the things that we had planned to build for you weren't going to happen. We had two opportunities &#x2013; one was to just go at all too hard or the other was to actually step in and become by far and away our biggest development, probably the biggest retail developer in the country. But we did it with a view that we were going to buy at least whatever develop and then get up and running and then sell. So we're not seeking to build a huge portfolio and as the developing community gets back on its feet over the next five or so years, then we will probably step back a little bit.</p>
          <p>But this year we're going to open 22 new stores. I think I've read elsewhere that it might be 10 or a dozen in our major competitor. We've opened probably as many Dan Murphy's and will this year as we have ever before. The big challenge has really been BIG W because most of those opportunities are in the major property holders like Westfields et cetera and they clearly slowed down during that time. So we've been out looking for standalone marketplace developments, so there's a bit of a lead time on that but that's why we're comfortable in saying we're going to be able to ramp up the BIG W numbers pretty strong over the next couple of years because we've actually bought bigger blocks of land to put a supermarket, a Dan Murphy, a BIG W and Dick Smith and specialties et cetera, so sub-regional centers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so more BIG Ws outside <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I must say, the most sought after asset that we've seen so far in our property sale have in fact been these sub-regionals where we've actually put a kit together and they can see the quality of the build and the quality of the offering and the car parking chips that we put a lot of thought into. So they're very much sought after assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just getting back to that $2.5 billion on the balance sheet, how much again would <mark type="inaudible" /> a timeframe, but how much of that would we eventually expect to come back?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh look that's a difficult question to answer, but some assets we are going to hold because they're of strategic importance to us and there's no way we'd let the site go for a particular reason. But in the main, we're not a holder of property assets so we will cycle through them when the market conditions are right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's probably you know given that our growth and our float's somewhere between $1 billion and $2 billion would probably be a good guess on where we might go depending on how sales go.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yep, understand. I'm just thinking also <mark type="inaudible" /> but traditionally there has been a little bit of a seasonal weakness in the second half <mark type="inaudible" /> EBIT margin and do you think we'll see the same again next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's mainly because of Christmas and it always &#x2013; I mean the first and second halves in terms of sales profile and profit profile are always different because of the mix of products that you sell, so I don't see that changing this year. What will change of course is Easter's moved into the fourth quarter so unfortunately when we release the next sales numbers they're going to be raw and Easter adjusted again. We need to get Easter moved to, I don't know, permanently in February or something like that and make life a lot easier.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No I'm just thinking &#x2013; looking at the EBIT margins across the tail, I mean the last year you actually posted higher <mark type="inaudible" /> EBIT margin in the second half than the first half, but given the preceding year, the first half is always stronger so that's <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll let you know as soon as we finish the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh okay and the other one's on Home Improvement. Home Improvement <mark type="inaudible" /> and the other small acquisitions et cetera-</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, you just have to slow down and maybe just &#x2013; we're only catching &#x2013; it's getting a bit garbled so I apologize it's not your fault it's the line, but if you could just &#x2013; we'll give a good answer if we hear the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I guess have to speak a bit more slowly. Home Improvement as a collective didn't make a positive EBIT contribution for the first half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Tom, confirmed that. Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And it is a minor point but Gage Roads booked loss, I know it's only small so who would have thought it would have been moving in the right direction, can you give a little bit of color there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm allowed to comment in a Woolworths meeting. We posted a small loss but the second quarter was in profit so we've hoping that we'll be able to maintain that from now on.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've got it now from when we first took a stake in Gage Road it produced about 50,000 cases. At the moment we're on track to do annualized about 1.2 million and we think we can probably do significantly more than that, so we've now got another capacity problem we need to try and solve with Gage. So Gage has been wonderful for our private label business.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Presumably you can marry Cellarmasters capabilities with Gage Road?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're a bit far apart I think but most of the Cellarmasters establishments are in the <mark type="inaudible" /> but there's probably not a lot of synergy there to be truthful.</p>
