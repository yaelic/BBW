          <p>Okay. We will make a start. So good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and in the words of the immortal Mick Jagger, this will be the last time for me anyway. To those of you here in the room and everyone watching via our webcast, good morning and welcome to our 2010 Half Yearly Results Presentation.</p>
          <p>I'm joined today as you know by Alison Cooper, currently our Chief Operating Officer. And Alison will be taking over from me on the 13th of May as Chief Executive. And also Bob Dyrbus with the extreme haircut our Finance Director, courtesy of Flymo. In addition, Iain Napier our Chairman as well as another, as well as some of the key Imperial Executives Graham Blashill, Fernando Dom&#xED;nguez et cetera, so lots of people here to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2010 we again demonstrated the resilience of our business. And the success of our enhanced sales strategy achieving further gains with our strategic brands and delivering 16% growth in adjusted earnings per share, which is an excellent performance in a challenging economic environment.</p>
          <p>Cigarette volumes in the half year were down 3.7%. Now three-quarters of this decline can be attributed to two markets. Come on in &#x2013; sorry, so let's say three-quarters of this decline can be attributed to two markets, that's Spain and the United States where market volumes have fallen significantly. But our performance is improving rapidly with second quarter volumes only down 1.4%.</p>
          <p>Our fine cut tobacco volumes were up 9.5% which when combined with our cigarette volumes gives us a total white stick equivalent decline of only 2.1%, which is a pleasing performance.</p>
          <p>Tobacco net revenues were up 4% to &#xA3;3.4 billion whilst our total adjusted operating profit grew by 6% to &#xA3;1.5 billion. In accordance with our stated practice, the Board is proposing an interim dividend of one-third of last year's total dividend, amounting to a 16% increase to &#xA3;24.3 per share.</p>
          <p>There were a number of highlights in the first half with our enhanced focus on the top line delivering growth in our global strategic brands with Davidoff up 4%, and as previously mentioned, there has been some temporary supply disruption in the Middle East which has affected volumes of Gauloises Blondes, which were down 16% as a result. Now adjusting for this, underlying growth of Gauloises Blondes was 6%.</p>
          <p>West continued its strong performance growing by 8%. Our excellent fine cut tobacco performance reflects improvements in our leading shares in numerous markets in the E.U., and we saw strong net revenue growth in the U.K., Germany, the rest of the E.U. and our Rest of the World region.</p>
          <p>Our partnering credentials are well known, and we recently signed three further strategic agreements, the manufacture and sale of Davidoff in South Korea with KT&amp;G, the manufacture and sale of Davidoff and West in Mexico with Philip Morris International, and the cigar collaboration framework in China.</p>
          <p>As ever, cost optimization remains central to our business and I can confirm that the cost synergies, as well as the revenue synergies from the Altadis integration are on track. This, combined with our ongoing focus on business simplification and productivity improvements has helped to increase our tobacco margins by 50 basis points to 40.5%, even with additional investments in the business.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to Alison, I would just like to say that it's been a privilege to lead Imperial and I am particularly grateful for the tremendous support I have received. I would like to thank my colleagues past and present in our now global workforce, our investors, and yes even some analysts for making my time as Chief Executive so immensely enjoyable and rewarding.</p>
          <p>So, I am more than proud to be leaving Imperial in very capable hands. And I wish Alison and everyone else all the very best, and on that note, over to you Alison.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Gareth and good morning. We made good operational and financial progress in the first half, and I am particularly encouraged by our success in driving top line growth, reflecting our enhanced focus on leveraging our brand and product portfolio across our geographic footprint. Tobacco net revenues rose 4% with price increases and improving market shares in cigarette and fine cut tobacco in a number of key markets, offsetting Spain and the U.S.</p>
          <p>We are a revenue rather than a volume-driven company, but volumes are clearly an important component of revenue growth, and I'm pleased with our overall performance in the first half. This chart combines our cigarette and fine cut tobacco volumes for each reporting segment to show the change in white stick equivalent volumes.</p>
          <p>The growth in the U.K. and the Rest of E.U. reflects resilient cigarette and rising fine cut tobacco volumes whilst in Spain, the decline is the result of the difficult economic climate. In the U.S., volumes have been impacted by last year's Federal Excise Tax increases.</p>
          <p>The tougher economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, and the temporary supply disruption in the Middle East, which is now resolved, has meant that our Rest of the World region as a whole saw volumes down 3.5%.</p>
          <p>However, as the previous slide showed, organic net revenues were up 8% in the region, illustrating the volume/revenue dynamic. Our volume development reflects a number of good performances from our comprehensive portfolio of global, regional and local brands and products.</p>
          <p>Let me first look at the performance of our global strategic brands, where additional investment has supported top line growth, and where we have updated all three pack designs and brand franchises to reflect evolving consumer trends.</p>
          <p>Davidoff continued its impressive track record and grew volumes by 4% with particularly good performances in Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East. We recently started to introduce the new packs in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The new design and supporting advertising, some of which you can see here, coupled with new formats such as Superslims have provided further impetus to the brand and we are extending this roll out into other markets in the coming months.</p>
          <p>Given the macro environment and Davidoff's super premium positioning, the brand's continued growth is highly encouraging, and it is worth just spending a moment to consider what we have achieved with this brand since 2003, the first full year of control following the Reemtsma acquisition.</p>
          <p>In total, volumes have grown over 50% at an annual compound rate of just over 6%. The Middle East has been a strong growth region for Davidoff, but we have also achieved success in a number of other regions, notably Eastern and Central Europe. Davidoff has also been a key driver of our recovery in Taiwan and further increased its share in the first half.</p>
          <p>Davidoff has a great track record and we see opportunities to build further, maximizing the brand's potential.</p>
          <p>Gauloises Blondes is our biggest selling brand and achieved excellent growth in Morocco and the Levant markets of Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Gauloises continues to evolve with a one milligram variant now available and special edition packs and events to support its 100th anniversary this year, which will add further momentum to the brand's growth potential.</p>
          <p>West is our second largest brand by volume and in recent years the franchise has been extended into other tobacco products with great effects. We achieved strong growth from West in the second half of 2009, and have maintained this momentum increasing cigarette volumes by 8% in the first half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Central to this growth has been the brand modernization and the launch of a number of new variants such as Superslims and King Size Superslims.</p>
          <p>Complementing our global strategic brands is our versatile portfolio of regional and local cigarette and fine cut tobacco brands.</p>
          <p>JPS cigarette was again strong, with very good performances in the U.K., France, Germany and Australia taking overall volumes up by 13%.</p>
          <p>Notable local brand performances from our first half in cigarette include Fine and Excellence in Africa and Maxim in Eastern Europe, and in fine cut tobacco, Paramount and JPS in Central and Western Europe.</p>
          <p>Our growth momentum is further highlighted in the following slides. In the U.K., our spot share has been on a rising trend since July and in Germany we have been increasing our share since October as the competitive dynamics around the change from 17 to 19 cigarettes per pack last year have diminished.</p>
          <p>In Spain, the market has been more volatile. Our spot share is above the average for the half year and we are continuing to evolve the portfolio to drive further share growth.</p>
          <p>In France, our domestic blonde cigarette spot share has consistently been above 23.5% with the current spot at 23.7, whilst in the USA, our market share has been relatively stable since October and we are encouraged by the ability of our brands to compete successfully in such an intense environment.</p>
          <p>The upward trend of our share developments in mature markets is complemented by similar success in the emerging markets in the Rest of World region.</p>
          <p>In nine of these 12 key markets, we have increased cigarette share. Ukraine is flat and share is down in Russia and Morocco as a result of declines in our local value brands offsetting gains in our international brands.</p>
          <p>The markets of the EU dominate global fine cut tobacco and we had a very strong performance in the first half. Taking the aggregates of the EU's 10 largest markets, representing over 90% of EU volumes, we grew our market share by almost two percentage points in the period, and also grew our volumes by 13%.</p>
          <p>We maintained market share in the largest market, Germany, where our volumes grew by 9%. We also increased our share in The Netherlands, the region's second largest market, as well as in Belgium, Poland and Hungary. This is an excellent achievement, reflecting the success of initiatives to recover share and our ability to anticipate changing consumer preferences.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the individual reporting segments. In the U.K., annualized cigarette market volumes were flat. Downtrading appears to be accelerating following the VAT increase in January and we have continued to leverage our portfolio to capitalize on this dynamic. We are improving our cigarette share, with JPS Silver and Windsor Blue achieving a combined spot share of around 40% of the growing economy sector compared to 29% last year, and in fine cut tobacco our volume growth was driven by Gold Leaf and Golden Virginia Yellow, which we launched just over a year ago.</p>
          <p>Earlier this month, the office of Fair Trading imposed a fine on Imperial, Gallaher and a number of retailers for allegedly restricting competition. We strongly reject this and will be appealing the Decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, and as part of our appeal we will request that the fine is quashed in its entirety.</p>
          <p>Yesterday we announced that we are challenging the government's plans to ban the display of Tobacco products, which is a further example of unreasonable and disproportionate approach to regulating our products and if implemented would simply fuel the growth in illicit trade and adversely impact retailers.</p>
          <p>Move on to Germany, where duty paid cigarette market volumes were down 1% whilst volumes of other tobacco products grew by 8%. Again, downtrading is a key dynamic and we continue to focus on developing our JPS brand franchise to build sales, launching a soft pack variant in November. JPS is now up to 9% of the total cigarette market and 30% of the value sector. JPS has also been a key driver in maintaining our leadership in fine cut tobacco and along with Route 66, delivered an excellent performance in the first half.</p>
          <p>Spain has been severely hit by the economic downturn with cigarette market volumes falling 11% in the first half with fine cut tobacco market volumes down 1%. Our volumes were down more due to our leading position in travel retail and the dark segment, which declined ahead of the total market.</p>
          <p>Our cigarette brand Ducados Rubio continues to perform well and I'm pleased with the progress Origenes is making in the growing natural fine cut tobacco segment since its launch last October.</p>
          <p>In the Rest of EU, we estimate regional cigarette market volumes were down 1%. In France, our domestic blonde share was up and we also improved share in a number of other markets including Greece, Hungary, Poland, Norway and Sweden. Regional fine cut tobacco market volumes were up by 7%, and, as you saw previously, we made good gains in the Netherlands and in Central Europe.</p>
          <p>Market conditions in the U.S. remain difficult in the aftermath of the Federal Excise Tax increases last April. Cigarette market volumes were down 11% whilst our volumes were down 18% as a result of lost share from aggressive discounting and brand repositioning by the major domestic players. Our share is 4% and has remained stable in recent months, supported by increased promotional investment.</p>
          <p>In cigar, the timing of the Federal Excise Tax increase affected the half year comparison because of some trade stocking in March 2009. The tax rise contributed to downtrading into lower value and smaller cigars but our price increases have offset this. We have gained share in the premium segment and we continue to perform well in the mass market natural wrapper category with our leading brand, Dutch Masters.</p>
          <p>As a result of organic growth, acquisitions and strategic alliances, the profit contribution of our Rest of World region has grown rapidly in recent years, just three years ago 16% of tobacco adjusted operating profits were generated by the region compared to 23% today.</p>
          <p>Africa and the Middle East remain key growth areas for Imperial. In Africa we have a strong leadership position in Morocco, with Gauloises Blondes increasing our share of the international brand segment. We grew share in a number of other African countries, and in the Middle East. Davidoff continued to make gains which will be enhanced by the introduction of the modernized pack.</p>
          <p>Cigarette market volumes in Russia and Ukraine have declined 10% and 9% respectively. However, Davidoff and West performed well in Russia and we also saw further growth from Davidoff in Ukraine. We delivered a strong performance in Asia-Pacific, improving our cigarette share with JPS in Australia and West in Taiwan, as well as growing share in a number of other countries in Indo-China.</p>
          <p>We are also seeing signs of recovery in our Habanos cigar volumes in some key Western European, Asian and Middle Eastern markets, with positive pricing and better sales mix driving revenue and profit growth.</p>
          <p>Our Logistics operations were resilient despite the weak economic trends from 2009 continuing. Manufacturer's price increases in Spain, France and Italy have compensated for cigarette volume declines, resulting in profit growth in Tobacco logistics.</p>
          <p>In Other logistics, a number of our businesses have suffered from the difficult economic climate, particularly in Spain, but an ongoing cost reduction programs has ensured only a modest decline in profits, and as a consequence, logistics as a whole has shown profit growth on last half year.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I'll now hand over to Bob to take you through the financials before rounding up with our outlook.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alison, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to start with an overview of the group results, and as usual you will find further detail in the appendices. As already mentioned, our tobacco net revenues were up 4% to &#xA3;3.4 billion and our Logistics business performed well with distribution fees increasing 3% to &#xA3;480 million.</p>
          <p>Tobacco and Logistics adjusted operating profits grew by 6% and 12% respectively. Tobacco margins rose by 50 basis points despite increased leaf costs and further investment in the business, and the Logistics distribution margin was up 140 basis points. The combined result is an increase in adjusted operating profit of 6% to &#xA3;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>A lower level of average net debt coupled with favorable interest rates benefiting the floating portion of our debt resulted in the interest charge falling 19% to &#xA3;302 million. And after tax being charged at an effective rate of 26%, adjusted earnings per share grew by 16% to &#xA3;0.832 or 17% excluding foreign exchange effects.</p>
          <p>Results have been adjusted and presented in our usual basis with the main differences to reported results being amortization of acquired intangibles of &#xA3;231 million and fair value on derivative financial instruments of &#xA3;96 million. There are further details in the appendices.</p>
          <p>Looking at the results in more detail, we can see that excluding the impact of foreign exchange, tobacco net revenues rose 3.4% and logistics distribution fees declined by less than 1%. The impact of foreign exchange was minimal at the adjusted operating profit level for both tobacco and logistics. At the group level, including eliminations, adjusted operating profit grew by over 6%.</p>
          <p>Tobacco profits grew by 6% to &#xA3;1.4 billion, reflecting excellent results from the UK, Germany, and the rest of the EU region. Despite lower revenues, our Spanish business increased profits 3% through strong pricing, synergies, and a minor benefit from foreign exchange. Taken in aggregate, our European Union business was very strong with total EU profits growing 11%.</p>
          <p>Profitability in the Americas was impacted by a very competitive market where heavy discounting and promotional activity was intense as well as by further investment and negative foreign currency impact.</p>
          <p>In the Rest of the World, additional investment in Eastern Europe and the Middle East has contributed to a strong underlying profit performance for the business, partly offset by adverse foreign exchange effects. Logistics had a strong first half benefiting from cigarette price increases in each of its three main markets, additional cost savings and foreign exchange benefits.</p>
          <p>Turning now to financing and EPS. The successful refinancing of just under &#xA3;4 billion in 2009 through the debt capital markets meant that at the end of March, we had committed facilities in place of around &#xA3;14.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Our average all-in cost of debt was down to 5.2%, which resulted in a net interest charge of &#xA3;302 million, and interest cover on an adjusted basis of 4.8 times. Excluding foreign exchange effects, our adjusted EPS would have been up 17% at &#xA3;0.837.</p>
          <p>Moving to cash flow and restructuring, pre-tax operating cash flows were &#xA3;601 million, down on last year, primarily due to increased working capital outflows for the half year. At our preliminary results last November, I announced we had reduced our working capital by almost &#xA3;1 billion in 2009 and that I expect it to broadly maintain in that level at the end of the current financial year. That remains the case.</p>
          <p>I also said we'd retain our cash flow pattern with outflows in our first half being unwound in the second half. And the first half has seen the expected outflow.</p>
          <p>At the end of March, our working capital was negative &#xA3;538 million, being &#xA3;788 million lower than at the same time last year, but still an &#xA3;819 million pounds outflow against the year end position. This was mainly due to pre-production ahead of duty increases in a number of countries and the timing of leaf purchases.</p>
          <p>We expect these stock levels to unwind quickly through the second half generating substantial cash flows and ending the year with a broadly stable working capital position.</p>
          <p>Measured over the last 12 months and thereby capturing the full business cycle, cash conversion was 116%. We paid tax of &#xA3;172 million and &#xA3;387 million of net interest in the half year. Net capital expenditure was &#xA3;109 million. Cash outflows in the half year in respect of the European integration activities were &#x20AC;68 million or around &#xA3;60 million, bringing the total to-date to &#x20AC;206 million.</p>
          <p>Turning to net debt, our adjusted net debt increased from &#xA3;10.8 billion last September to &#xA3;11.4 billion, primarily as a result of working capital outflow with tax and interest being an outflow of &#xA3;600 million and our final dividend being &#xA3;500 million. Unlike recent reporting periods, foreign exchange has not been a material influence on our net debt position when compared to September 2009.</p>
          <p>And finally, I would like to reiterate the Altadis integration remains firmly on track. We generated incremental synergies of &#x20AC;54 million in the first half and remain highly confident of generating cumulative synergies of &#x20AC;300 million in the current financial year, rising to &#x20AC;400 million by 2012.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, trading remains in line with our expectations. Leaf inflation remains an issue. And EU leaf subsidies are scheduled to be removed next year. But we are working to mitigate the impact. We expect our interest cost to average around 5.5% for the full year and our tax charge to remain at 26%.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned, the Altadis synergies are firmly on track. And we expect strong cash flows in the second half such that the first half working capital outflow will unwind resulting in a cash conversion rate of between 90 and 100%.</p>
          <p>So thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'd now like to hand you back to Alison to conclude the presentation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Bob. As a global company with sales in around 160 countries, there will inevitably be challenges in some markets, particularly given the current economic climate. But these results demonstrate both the resilience of our business and the successful application of our enhanced sales strategy.</p>
          <p>Our balanced operating platform, total tobacco portfolio, and renewed focus on sales is yielding results. We currently expect our second half volumes to be stable against the second half of 2009. And I see many growth opportunities ahead.</p>
          <p>Our global strategic cigarette brands, Davidoff, Gauloises Blondes, and West, and many of our regional and local brands are performing well and all have the opportunity to develop much further.</p>
          <p>Our monthly spot cigarette shares are rising and we're also making gains in fine cut tobacco in the EU. Maintaining this growth momentum in both mature and emerging markets is our priority. Key to our success is embedding the new sales strategy and consumer focus across the business. And I'm very pleased with the response so far, both in terms of our results and the enthusiasm and commitment from our people.</p>
          <p>Continued market investment will support topline growth by enhancing our sales force capabilities and developing brand and product innovations, ensuring that our portfolio remains relevant to local consumers. Spain and U.S.A. are key markets and therefore particular areas of focus in the current environment. We're addressing our domestic blonde cigarette share in Spain with positive early indications, and increasing investment in the U.S. to extend our brand coverage.</p>
          <p>Cost optimization is a hallmark of Imperial and remains a priority. We continue to drive business simplification, efficiency improvements across our tobacco operations, while our ongoing focus on reducing costs in our logistics business will help strengthen our competitive position. Effective cash utilization creates additional significant value for shareholders and as Bob said, we expect cash conversion for the full year to be between 90 and 100%.</p>
          <p>Illicit trade is an issue for our industry. We've further invested in our anti-illicit trade activities and remain committed to working with governments worldwide to tackle this problem. We always seek constructive working relationships with governments but will continue to robustly challenge ill-conceived regulation, such as product display bans and plain packaging, which not only undermine commercial and consumer freedoms but also fuel the growth of illicit trade.</p>
          <p>Our focus on long-term sustainable revenue and profit growth underpinned by effective cost and cash management is key to creating value for our shareholders. And I am confident that we are well placed to build on our long track record of success.</p>
          <p>Before we take any questions, I would like to take this opportunity to offer Gareth my very best wishes for a long and happy retirement. To take Imperial from a largely UK based business to the fourth largest international tobacco company is an incredible achievement. He was recently ranked the 13th best performing CEO in the world, ahead of all other UK and Western European CEOs. And I am delighted to be succeeding him.</p>
          <p>Thank you, Gareth, for all you've done and very best wishes for the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. David Hayes from Nomura. Just two questions if I can, firstly, on the additional spend behind the brands? I wonder if you can quantify that at all in terms of the first half, give us a feel for where it's really being focused. Is there additional sales force? I think in the U.S. there has been some of that investment. Or is it the innovation? Is it other activities? And then I guess in terms of the first question, is the run rate now in the first half or is there an additional amount of uplift as you go into the second half? Is it kind of building out through the year?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, in terms of the value-for-money segment, if you look at competitors, L&amp;M, for example, PMI that it seemed to be repositioning that brand quite aggressively in certain markets. Are you seeing that? It looks like you are holding share in a lot of these markets, as you made the point. But is it going to be more expensive to do business generally in the game? What kind of form are you seeing that competition taking? Is that different or is it just the on-gaming kind of competition you've seen historically? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If pick up on the investment point first, it's very much in line what we talked about I think at the full year, we're roughly increasing investment by around 10% this year. As usual, we're a bit shy about giving you absolute numbers. But it's a roughly 10% uplift in investment.</p>
          <p>And it's a mix. It's partly clearly behind the brand rejuvenation that you're seeing. So we've got the Davidoff rollout going on at the moment with the rejuvenated pack. Also with the West rejuvenation, I think I'm particularly pleased with how that's working, that investment is coming through very well. The growth now in West having had a number of years of decline in that brand is coming through very strongly. And I am very pleased with that progress.</p>
          <p>But it's also around, as you'd expect from us, some of the much more tangible, feet on the ground in markets like Russia, U.S.A. We had plans at the beginning of the year that we're executing in half of the distribution capabilities in those markets. Plus some additional increase that we think we needed in the some of the core markets supporting some of those share growth that you've seen coming through in the first half. That's the investment piece.</p>
          <p>On value-for-money I mean clearly, our competitors have got some good brands in the value-for-money segment as well, Pall Mall, L&amp;M in particular. But I think our portfolio performs very well. You can see JPS was up 13% in our first half. That I think boxes very well against those brands.</p>
          <p>Ducados at the moment in Spain is having some pressure from L&amp;M and Pall Mall. But I think what we are doing with Ducados and particularly the soft platform that we've introduced in Spain is responding to that well. So I think a very robust portfolio to compete against fair value-for-money offerings.</p>

          <p>First off, is there a ramp up going on though, which started  from page zero at the beginning of the year and has moved up with more investment  in the second half <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The investment, I'd say it's fairly evenly spread, maybe a little bit weighted towards the second half but it's not &#x2013; I won't say significantly in group terms. Adam you got the mic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I ask two questions too? Just following on from David's question, I notice that the organic operating profit growth had slowed to about 3% from about 7% in the second half of last year. And I can see two explanations. One is your leaf cost is going up. And secondly, your marketing cost as you've just said is going up? And I was wondering if you could say how much of that slowdown could be attributed to those two factors and if there is anything else that I forgotten as well?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, completely separate question. I notice in your presentation today you spent a lot of time saying, effectively, we will fight generic packaging if it appears. And you've &#x2013; I don't doubt that fact, but you seem to be making a bigger point of it than you have done before and I was wondering if you see an increased threat of it, and why you are talking so much about it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, the first question you kind of answered your own question Rooney, in fact it's leaf and A&amp;P related. In fact, we have a done a calculation that we weren't going to shout about particularly, but if you do strip out the impact of A&amp;P and leaf costs you do get to a very similar growth rate to the second half of last year basically, so it is those two factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Those are evenly split, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Pretty much evenly actually, yes, pretty much evenly split. So those are the two key factors that have held back the overall operating profit growth in the first half, but as you can see there is some good signs of growth coming through, and volumes particularly only down 1.4% in the second quarter, which is a good performance. And also I think coming through into the second half we've got a flat volume scenario half-year on half-year. So, I think we'll see a better performance coming through there in the second half overall.</p>
          <p>On generic impacts I think we've just got the indications from the U.K. that they are considering it currently. It was only floated again, I suppose, it wasn't a serious consideration. And you can see from our challenge on display bans yesterday in the U.K. that there is quite a lot of political comment that this is really a step too far in terms of regulation of the industry. So, I think we are just getting our voice heard in an early stage on this, rather than leaving it sort of just bubbling away with people toying with it and then suddenly finding a real proposal comes out. So, I wouldn't say it is because we're seriously seeing significant up-weighting in the threat, it's just a thing that is being talked about a bit more currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I come back very briefly on the first question? As we look into the second half, would you expect the same sort of thing again, are your leaf and increased A&amp;P holding back organic operating profit growth such that it's around, let's say, 3% again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The leaf impact is coming through in the second half clearly as well as the first half, and as I said before we still got increased A&amp;P investment coming through in the second half as well. But I would see a slight improvement, I would say, in the overall organic operating profit growth during the second half.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Jon Leinster, UBS. Just another sort of follow-on from that. With regards to the additional investment, is that a sort of one-off boost, a sort of catch-up or is that likely to be a sort of ongoing part of something which I think you mentioned it, sort of cases of more &#x2013; bigger focus on organic growth. So, is that likely to continue to arise at the sort above the level of sales on ongoing basis?</p>
          <p>Secondly, on the legal challenge, given this is just parliament passing a law, on what basis can you actually challenge that in a court, unless it breaks some sort of European legislation? And thirdly, just a very technical question, what exactly are you using for your definition of white stick equivalent, because there has been a lot of debating historically about what that means, so I was just wondering if you could define it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Gareth, if you pick up on the one &#x2013; the quick one, if you do the legal challenge if you want, go on. Sorry we're talking. Okay, just, I'll pick up on the A&amp;P point. We've moved A&amp;P up around 10% this year. I think if you were modeling going forward, I wouldn't see it moving up much ahead of NSV growth on an ongoing basis. We have just stepped it up in a number of key markets this year behind our investment priorities. But as I &#x2013; we always say, we balance, we make our investment choices where we see the opportunities balancing that share on profit growth in the business.</p>
          <p>But as a rule of thumb, I think if you look at an increase around NSV growth on an ongoing basis, that's what we would be looking at from an A&amp;P perspective. But we look at costing around in terms of optimizing investment across the portfolio, so not just A&amp;P but we are investing in around illicit trade and other things which are helpful to the overall sustainable growth of the business.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the legal challenge or indeed legal challenges, we've announced a few weeks ago Sinclair and Cullis will seek &#x2013; were granted judicial review of the proposed ban on vending machines. And the challenge to the display ban is very similar. You can't actually challenge legislation until it is legislation. And that it was &#x2013; the fact that it was passed, what it has been challenged on is the basis that it is disproportionate and non evidence based and will do significant damage to the trade and give an enormous boost to the illicit traders we have seen in the Republic of Ireland and in Canada. It is a counterfeiter's charter. So we launched that challenge yesterday and we are very pleased to see the political comment, particularly from the Conservatives, regarding the display ban. So we are challenging that resolutely. It is, as far as tobacco regulation is concerned, it is a bridge too far and would be very damaging for this country, so, we will challenge it.</p>

So there's plenty of precedent for taking judicial reviews of various pieces of legislation that we have gone through. And as I say, we will be tackling this very robustly.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>White stick equivalent. Effectively within fine cut there's two main categories: there's roll-your-own and make-your-own. And within make-your-own, you've got various degrees of, shall I call it volumization. At its best you probably see this in the German market where you can have different grammages of make-your-own effectively making the same number of sticks. And so what we're trying to do is effectively distinguish &#x2013; rather than it being tonnage because, simply put, if you can make twice the number of sticks from the same grammage, we're trying to turn it into, if you like, number of sticks consumed. So we use conversion factors for standard roll-your-own and different conversion factors for make-your-own and volumized make-your-owns, just to try to get, if you like, a standard equivalent smoke out of the mouths.</p>
          <p>As I say, we've been running it in Germany for while, we're seeing make-your-own becoming much more pronounced and growing strongly within Europe at the moment. So we've decided to put that in as something that we thought would be useful as a degree of what our total penetration of the smoking market is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And more representative I think of our total Tobacco focus where we see it's a very key dynamic in a number of markets to play between fine cut and cigarette in particular. I was pushing for a measure of moments of smoking pleasure but nobody's taken a bite on that one yet. Then we put these cigars in as well. Monte Cristo would be interesting, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. And could I ask Bob a question on net debt, can you just walk us through the adjustment from the reported net debt to the adjusted net debt figure so we have a sort of handle on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, yes, I think I can, he says. From memory I think the numbers are &#x2013; and you'll correct me if I am wrong &#x2013; I think it's 11.4 billion adjusted net debt and 12.3 billion reported net debt? The two main elements of the difference is there is about 100 &#x2013; just over &#xA3;170 million of accrued interest, which is effectively the same as the creditor, except we owe it to the banks. But mostly that's largely of bond volume interest because interest payments tend to be either annually &#x2013; annual or semi-annual.</p>
          <p>The second element is actually, and I think it's a little north of 670 million, so those two are effectively most of the difference, represents a mark-to-market on our interest rate derivatives. We've obviously got a fixing program in place. What happens is you effectively mark that fixing to what the yield curve is and take that difference as a mark-to-market loss. Well obviously with interest rates close to zero all of those are technically showing losses but they are effectively risk minimization and inherent cash flow charges in the interest charge and the guidance we gave for the interest rate on our debt. So that comes through on this side effectively that interest rates didn't move, instead that we would be paying &#xA3;677 million more interest over the life than if we &#x2013; completely floating. But I wouldn't recommend being completely floating in a company that had quite as much debt as we did.</p>

          <p>Hello. Mark Ailing, GAM International. I have a question on slide 23, which shows as a proportion of your total group profits the Rest of the World geographic segment has grown significantly in the last two years. I just wondered if you could sort of take us on a trip fast forward in five years time, where you see this important geography growing to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The regions &#x2013; or the sub-regions within the Rest of the World region are key growth areas for us. And if you split them out, Africa-Middle East I think we've performed exceptionally well in. I was very pleased &#x2013; I was at Morocco, actually I was stuck in Morocco the other week &#x2013; to add Morocco to our overall portfolio with the Altadis deal because our footprint in Africa-Middle East adding in the Altadis piece, both in Morocco but also in the Levant region in the Middle East, has really strengthened our footprint there. Clearly that's been part of the increase because that's organic and acquisition led in the period. But we've got a very strong business in that region, we've very good portfolio in that region. And that for me is a very key element of the growth story for Imperial going forward. And growth in that region, in particular organic, maybe acquisition if that's possible, will be a key part of this story to move that percentage forward.</p>
          <p>Eastern Europe as well for us, I mean clearly the key markets there are Russia and Ukraine. As you saw, a little bit of share softness in Russia but what I am seeing very positively there is growth in our global strategic brands and therefore from a profitability perspective we are making some very nice progress in that region currently and some very, very good results, particularly on Davidoff given the current environment, which was up around 12% in those markets in the first half. So you've got some good progress in that region, which again I see as continuing to add to that proportion of our profits sitting in the Rest of the World.</p>
          <p>And I think the one we don't talk about quite so much is Asia. Asia we've got strong business in Taiwan where the recovery's come through very well in terms of our share there. We're now over 11% share in Taiwan. Indochina strong growth as well across our business there. But more opportunities, and you can see we're leveraging our partnership capabilities in the first half with the deal with KT&amp;G, which should come on stream in the next couple of months and again add to our momentum there.</p>
          <p>So I think in terms of the total piece for Rest of the World, it's a key area of focus for us, a key area of investment and development. Put a percentage on it? I find that tough because clearly we're trying to develop rest of our business as well. But I would see it as a growing proportion of our profit numbers going forward.</p>
          <p>Jon, would you like to..? Sorry I'll give that to Roger.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, Jon Fell from Deutsche Bank. I've a couple of things; firstly a more general one. On your organic growth, just wondering why you decide to do a fairly harsh treatment, I suppose, of the synergies, and strip them out of your organic performance. Are you going to continue to do that? Because I mean presumably cost savings will continue to be an element of what drives your EBIT growth, as it always has been. And then secondly on the U.S., can you give us a bit more color on what you're doing to fight back in that competitive environment? It looks like your spot share's been flattish for six months. Are you confident you can hold that and maybe grow or &#x2013; what's happening there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The very quick answer on synergies is just transparency, and we said we're going to deliver &#x20AC;400 million of synergies through to 2012 and we're demonstrating to you that that's coming through I suppose, in the business. But I think that links a bit back into questions around incremental synergies. Yes, we'll be focused on costs; I'm talking about increasing some of our A&amp;P spend over time. But at the same time we're focused on cost optimization generally in the business and looking for further opportunities to be efficient around how we spend our money. And that will continue to be a focus of the business. But the synergies, just from a transparency perspective, we'll continue to report for the time being. On the U.S...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah on the U.S. it's been &#x2013; it's been a pretty difficult time since the huge increase in the federal excise tax and it's very competitive. Most of our major competitors there are pretty much land locked; their international brand rights are owned by others, et cetera. And so it's become extremely competitive with deep discounting and indeed price repositioning of some of the major brands. And I think we've done very well to hold our own there in and what has been a pretty aggressive environment.</p>
          <p>What are we doing to improve the situation or, well, grow again? One of the things for us Jon going forward is still the level of where we are in terms of the evolution of our business in America. So we've still got significant distribution gains to make.</p>
          <p>We're still in &#x2013; some of our brands in only just a little under 40% distribution in terms of the total retail universe of the U.S. So obviously taking on incremental sales force and sales areas, it enables us to grow on that basis particularly. And also we've got other brands in the portfolio as well, particularly with the emphasis on the down trading that's been taking place in the U.S. Obviously Fortuna has been doing very well and month-on-month it grows its sales.</p>
          <p>So we got a package of things, but I'd say that the biggest thing is largely the investment in sales force and the widening of the distribution coverage, including the multiple retail grocery accounts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And what I would add is the reasons we saw the U.S. as attractive in the first place is still very much there in terms of the opportunity in that market. So we will put the money behind holding our position &#x2013; growing our position to actually move ahead in the U.S. over the coming years. Roger. You're back.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Rogerio Fujimori, Credit Suisse. I was just wondering if you could comment on which markets drove the sequential improvement in the March quarter. Were there any timing shipments impacting the performance or..? And the second question was a little bit more color on leaf cost inflation for the next fiscal year, fiscal '11? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The March quarter &#x2013; I mean a mix of factors as you might anticipate. I mean clearly we're going to hit a period through March and then into the second half of the year where some of the impacts from last year are beginning to diminish a bit around the U.S. and also Spain is just &#x2013; is just creeping back a little bit, although Spain's not over yet I'd say. But in terms of the other markets, we've got the Middle-East disruption, which is, as I say, now sorted. So that's now coming back through in terms of growth in those markets. And just performance, I think, in our Rest of World business is coming through strongly and will come through very strongly into the second half as well.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Leaf costs. Looking out to next year the overall leaf inflation is coming down, but what we're needing to deal within that as well is the end of EU subsidies around leaf. So potentially it could be high single-digit type inflation, but it's something we're working to mitigate currently. We saw 10% in the current year in terms of underlying inflation. I wouldn't see it as bad as that, but clearly it's going to be high single-digit. But we're working on it. So I think it's something we can at least mitigate if not eradicate. Nico.</p>

          <p>Thank you. It's Nico Lambrechts from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your organics, you indicate that revenue's up 3% so by implication your net revenue across the products is about 5%, I think you indicated previously that cigarette pricing will be up 3% in the first half. Could you maybe give us an indication if that, is that the case or if cigarette pricing was better and maybe what pricing did on the fine cut, so maybe just splitting the volume and price impact on organic basis?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, was there any impact of margin mix on your organic EBIT growth due to the strong growth from fine cut versus cigarettes?</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean in terms of pricing between cigarette and fine cut, I mean, I'll get Gerry to see if he can dig out any more detailed numbers for you, but I mean the vast majority of the pricing coming through is on the cigarette side. There's some impact from fine cut clearly with some increases in markets such as Netherlands, Germany a little bit as well. But the vast majority of the increase is on the cigarette side, so we can get a bit more granularity on that to see how that splits. And you can see the price mix effect clearly coming through, roughly 5% with the volume decline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's probably a little stronger again coming into the second half as well if you look at where the overall full year numbers are sitting, yeah. David?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Fast as I can David Hayes from Nomura. Just on the leaf cost again, sorry. Obviously a big chunk of that is the transactional impact, you can see that in the FX benefit as sales are negative at the profit level. Just to be clear, does that come off a little bit or substantially, potentially, in the second half? Or were you talking about the whole inflation, both underlying and the FX impact? And then secondly, just on the U.K., I think the budget timing had an impact last year, the 7% number volume looks obviously very good for the U.K. Can you just quantify broadly at least what the budget impact is in that and therefore the unwind in the second half? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The leaf I was talking underlying inflation around leaf rather than the FX impact. We'll &#x2013; wherever the FX sits we'll give you a more direct feel at the time in terms of how the FX sits on leaf, and how that winds through. In terms of the U.K. budget, yeah, there's a little bit of an impact around the first half year. But I mean in the scheme of the overall Group numbers you're not talking huge numbers, so that's why we haven't pulled them out separately. It's a small impact.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>John Leinster, UBS, again. Sorry. A couple of things. First of all, I think you mentioned &#x2013; when Bob mentioned in the cash flow, made some mention about a stocking up ahead of duty increases, I was wondering whether that had had any impact in terms of volumes in the second quarter and whether or not this sort of stock ups/stock profits you expect in the second half were considerable, or not particularly.</p>
          <p>And just secondly I think the pension fund, the main U.K. pension fund is up for revaluation, it's not &#x2013; I know it's not a huge area. But does that add considerably &#x2013; does that change cost a bit or not..?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll let Bob pick up on the pension, let me just quickly cover off maybe the stock profits. We haven't got anything substantial around stock profits or shifts of volumes between halves in that sense. I mean the one on the U.K. David just asked is the only one that's had a little bit of an impact. Other than that, we haven't got anything similar to our competitors in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But in the second half, because you mentioned in the cash flow there was quite a big -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think what tends to happen is the industry as a whole tends to &#x2013; you tend to know that the governments &#x2013; some governments give you a period of time, some governments don't put in restrictions, but generally, if you have a period of time, the industry as a whole tends to produce to that. And it uses effectively the run out period competitively. So you're selling old &#x2013; effectively you're maintaining your competitive position.</p>
          <p>The reason that you are actually building the stocks is to attempt to not have the stock there and discount the excise increase backwards. If your competitors are sitting on that &#x2013; is an absolute disaster to profit. So the industry produces and the consumer tends to gain from a delayed increasing in excise in reality.</p>
          <p>In terms of the pension fund, yes, there is going to a claim &#x2013; or valuation. in terms of the charges to the P&amp;L account, in terms of the accounting for pensions, obviously no impact there, because that's not really a cash &#x2013; because it's &#x2013; but we will probably end up having to make cash payments in terms of our actuarial amounts to the U.K. pension fund. Because I would imagine it would be at a slight deficit. But that's over an extended period of time commencing March 2011 and is not a significant amount for the group in any way, shape or form.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Martin Deboo, Investec. Can you talk about logistics? We had a conversation here a couple of results ago that strategically on that business, there was an element that was &#x2013; you regarded as core, an element that you regarded as not so core. Where is your thinking on this as we move on? Is that still the thinking? Has it evolved? Can you just remind me again what the two bits were, as well as a footnote: just where are you on logistics?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two key parts of the business, basically. The tobacco logistics business, which sits very well with us, it sits very well with our customers of that business as well. And it's a business we are very comfortable with, and are very happy holders of. The other bit is the non-tobacco logistics which we been actively looking to try and tidy up, particularly in the current economic environment, where some of that business has been under some challenge.</p>
          <p>So that's where some of the cost optimization programs have come in and, also, I'm looking at opportunities to potentially work with &#x2013; partner with various people to mitigate some of the impact on those businesses of the current economic environment. So that's clearly less, less core to us in terms of the overall business. All I would say with logistics &#x2013; as we would have to say about any part of our business, that we have to keep it under review, see how it fits because the overall strategy going forward and evaluate &#x2013; continue to evaluate options for the business, but we are happy holders of the tobacco logistics business. Adam?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just correct me because I think you said that you were likely to get more pricing in the second half than the first half, and if you did say it, in answer to Nico's question, if I got that wrong, then please correct me, but if I got it right, can you say where and why you think that will happen?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's  the roll up, Adam, it's not supposed to be more a huge raft of additional markets in terms of us taking price increase to those markets. It's just the roll up coming through in terms of the impact of pricing on the overall numbers in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, where the price increase has already happened, and you get the full six months credit in the second half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is that mainly sort of &#x2013; just geographically, is that mainly rest of world, mainly Europe where are you thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a mix. You've got some of the pricing in Eastern Europe. For example, we've got some elements coming through in Africa, Middle East, you've got elements coming through in EU as well. So it's across the patch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I can't see, sorry, Chas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, yeah. Chas Manso from Evolution. You've been pointing out that your spot market shares are rising. Could you give us some feel about how much of that is down to your brand rejuvenations and increased coverage? And how much is simply a benefit of down-trading to, say, the value brands? And on the U.S., obviously the pricing environment is key, I think the noises from the U.S. competitors seems to be that maybe the promotional activity is past the worst, is there anything evidenced in the market now that that is so that the discount levels in the U.S. have reduced already? And on net interest, you are saying that your cost of debt was 5.2% in the first half, is that a cost of debt we could extrapolate for the full year and onwards?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me kick off with the brands. It is a mix in terms of the portfolio, I mean, clearly you can see from the presentation we are doing a lot of work with our global strategic brands at the moment. And that is yielding benefit, particularly if you look at markets like Russia, if you look at Ukraine, you look at the Middle East, you look at Taiwan and Greece, we have some very good momentum from Davidoff. Plus West, if you look at, again, Eastern and Central Europe but also in Taiwan as well with West. So all of these things we are doing with the global brands is clearly helping those shares. But we are also playing to our regional local brand strengths. It isn't just a global brand story.</p>
          <p>And therefore what we've done with JPS, in particular in the U.K., JPS Silver we looked to the growth of the economy segment and we've seen what's going on with consumers in that segment and I think how we position JPS in particular is now up to 4% of the market in the U.K.; very rapid success since launch. Similarly, in Germany as well the positioning of JPS.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's a question always in those markets of seeing where the dynamics are, seeing where the consumers are going and aligning; whether it be the global brands but also playing to our regional local strengths, to make sure that we're pushing the right parts of the portfolio to succeed in those markets. And that's very much been the story behind those various share progressions that you have seen in different markets across the globe in terms of just getting the brand, but also the products strategies right. And I can't overly exaggerate how pleased I am with the fine-cut trajectory we've had in the first half of this year because you know we have been working on that, we've had various quarters where we've reported we've had issues with our fine cut shares but that's all moving in a very positive direction currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on the U.S. point, Chas, I think it's fair to say it's still going on. In fact, with some of the discounting on certain brands, it leads us to conclude that it isn't ongoing discounting, it's what we would define as a re- &#x2013; almost looks like a permanent repositioning of the brands. So I think it's fair to say it's still going on at pretty high level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on the interest cost, Chas, as I said effectively we have &#x2013; our interest rate was 5.2% in first half, I've guided to 5.5% for the full year. Reason being, effectively as debt comes down, it's our floating &#x2013; it's effectively our revolving credit facility. So that's coming, we're only getting 70 bps above the curve, sorry, technical, as &#x2013; and 70 basis points in terms of that reduction. And secondly we are also looking at, I mean, the 5.2% is a little less than we thought in first half because we are looking at the yield curve now, if the yield curve for the balance of year is lower, then that could come down marginally, but not enormously.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, a question for you. I'm just trying to understand the working capital, the number in the presentation was 538 million negative and I think that's half-year on half-year because in the cash flow in note 8 it shows working capital movement minus 819 million, could you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I think my number was actually working capital absolute of minus 538 Nic. Sorry was not that...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, yeah, no, that's a negative 538 million of working capital.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. In terms of the full year, you're indicating that it will be back at flat, is all the working capital improvements or the opportunities for working capital in the base now following a billion improvement last year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Well, I did say last year I'd be happy &#x2013; before the year-end I'd be happy with half a billion, we were closer to a billion. And we are saying we expect to maintain working capital flat. You are talking around &#x2013; around the edges. There certainly isn't another a billion there, or I've not been able to find it, and one of the reasons that I've got this haircut is because I've been running around the company trying to look for it but it's not there.</p>

          <p>I think, Gareth, your tenure as Chief Executive of Imperial is around three times as long as the average Chief Executive of a U.K. company manager's and I think it's pretty clear why that's been the case, I think in every respect you've been an outstanding success in running Imperial. Alison touched on what you've done in terms of developing the business and growing the global footprint and the critical mass in the business.</p>
          <p>I think as analysts, we obviously focus on numbers and I think the numbers the way we look at our EPS is compounded at 16% per annum during your time, dividend growth of 14% per annum, and a total shareholder return which is &#x2013; I think it's too big a number, almost, to quote 1150%  over the time that you have been in charge, versus 124% for FTSE 100 and that means the share price since floatation has compounded seven fold versus a 46% increase for the FTSE 100 over that time.</p>
          <p>I know you said that you had enjoyed dealing with some of the analysts. On behalf of all of the analyst community, can I congratulate you on these outstanding achievements. Thank you for your openness, accessibility, candor and great good humor and wish you all the best for a very long, very well-deserved and, hopefully, very happy retirement.</p>
