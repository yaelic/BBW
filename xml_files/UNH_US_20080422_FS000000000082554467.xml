          <p>Good morning.  My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today.  At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the UnitedHealth Group First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I would now like to turn the conference over to the President and Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Stephen Hemsley.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us this morning.  Our release today focuses on the first quarter results.  But at the top of our call, I want to address the revision to our 2008 outlook.  We have lowered our earnings outlook for the rest of the year, reflecting what we feel will be near term pressures on revenue growth and related earnings and margins.  We have been careful and measured in doing so.</p>
          <p>These projected reductions are caused by a number of concurrent events: top-line revenue shortfalls reflecting competitive pressures impacting both enrollment volumes and net premium yields, and an equally important shift in a difficult economic environment toward lower benefits and lower price points as well as the continuing shift to self insurance.</p>
          <p>In the Medicare market, we are seeing lower than expected engagement by seniors in traditional HMO style product offering and interest rates have dropped dramatically which will affect our projected investment income for the balance of the year.  And so the 10% full-year downward revision reflects declining risk-based member and revenue growth over the balance of 2008, senior business mix in commercial premium pricing pressure, and unusually severe flu season, and reduced investment income; and we are addressing operating cost levels that need to be realigned to our revised growth outlook.</p>
          <p>At this stage, we do not see changes in forecasted medical cost trends at the national level.  We are clearly being impacted by the decline in national economic outlook, including employment levels, the interest rate environment, and inflation trends, which are combining to create pressures not seen for many years.</p>
          <p>Our specific sector conditions are influx as well, some positive and some not.  New generations of products and services are moving forward such as in the consumer domain where we have dramatic national leadership.  Emerging markets are beginning to open up such as in state programs and in-culture ethnic offerings.  We are also regaining traction in the large employer market.  At the same time, other products are beginning to mature such as Medicare Part D.  In addition, we see increasing levels of employed consumers' simply declining coverage of any type, particularly in smaller businesses.  And the pricing economics across all markets continue to be intense, even given the relatively stable medical cost environment.</p>
          <p>Today, though it is not clear how quickly the positive trends will produce results against this challenging backdrop, our approach to an outlook for 2008 has been revised in light of the challenges we face, principally around growth in risk-based offering.  To make it easier for you to see our current assessment, we have provided a summary of our revised 2008 expectations in the press release.</p>
          <p>The first quarter earnings would have been in line with our original expectations absent a few factors.  We saw perhaps the most severe and geographically broad flu season in five years.  It cost us $80 million or approximately $0.04 per share above normal flu cost and we did not have the earnings strength across our businesses to offset that cost surge.</p>
          <p>Our revenue plans are not being realized in risk-based products and accordingly operating costs were high and need to be realigned.  We are addressing this promptly but thoughtfully keeping service levels and growth initiatives fully supported.  Investment income was off in the quarter, but offset by realized investment gains.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter operating cash flows of $280 million were negatively impacted compared with the first quarter of 2007 by the timing of approximately $275 million in various government programs reimbursements and payment which will reverse over the course of the year and more than $250 million in reduced medical payables related to accelerated payment and decreases in risk-based commercial and Part D membership as well as the timing of payments to our pharmacy benefit fulfillment partner of roughly $150 million.  We still anticipate generating nearly $6 billion in cash for the year.</p>
          <p>For the full-year, we have revised our 2008 revenue outlook from a range of 82.5 to 83 billion to a range of 81 to 82 billion.  Although we previously updated this range in January, for ease of comparison we will refer back to the more comprehensive data element from our Investor Day.  Our outlook includes additional revenue from acquisitions of 1.7 to 1.8 billion from Fiserv and roughly half a year from Unison.  It is offset by a reduction of approximately $450 million for the delayed closing of Sierra and the related divestiture of the Nevada Medicare Advantage Lives.  This results in an organic decline in projected revenue of roughly 3% excluding the impact from these acquisition-related transactions.</p>
          <p>The major pieces of our revised revenue and operating earnings are as follows.  Commercial risk membership for 2008, which we have projected to decline by up to 300,000 people is now expected to decline in the area of 700,000.  As a result of this reduction, our revised full-year commercial risk premiums will be 1 billion to 1.1 billion less than previously forecasted.  Premium revenue will also be negatively impacted by slightly lower than planned premium yields, partially offset by benefit reduction causing an additional reduction of approximately $200 million.  These arise from local market pricing pressures and continued growth in lower price point consumer directed products, which is actually an excellent trend for us going forward.  We retain customers that we otherwise might lose while recognizing there is some margin tradeoff.</p>
          <p>The public and senior premiums are now projected to be lower than originally planned by approximately $1 billion.  This is caused primarily by lower than expected growth in Medicare Advantage products of 100,000 to 125,000 people, down from the 125,000 to 175,000 as well as the timing of much of that growth being realized from April 1 through December.  Premiums are further impacted by projected lower risk scores and product mix changes compared to plan, with the majority of the growth coming from our distinctive Special Needs Plans product offering.</p>
          <p>Medicaid premiums and AmeriChoice continue to be in line with expectations.  These reductions in our risk-based volumes affect our OptumHealth businesses and coupled with lower than expected external new business we are now reducing our revenue outlook by around $100 million for these businesses, including a modest Fiserv impact.  Prescription Solutions and Ingenix are also affected by the revenue softness which has already been more than offset.</p>
          <p>The corresponding reduction in operating earnings related to these revenue changes, including the changes in business and product mix is about $250 million in the public and senior market, principally in Medicare Advantage products, $300 million in the commercial risk business and $75 million in OptumHealth.  We are also experiencing higher Medicare pharmacy utilization trends than planned in the first quarter of the year, particularly in the low income subsidy segment.  On an annual basis, this increase in unplanned drug utilization translates to a range of 150 to $175 million of additional cost.  We have included that in our revision and are incorporating it into our 2009 Medicare bid.</p>
          <p>We now expect $100 million less in investment income net of estimated realized capital gain which will also reduce revenues and operating earnings in these businesses. This assumes an estimated $150 million of realized capital gain in 2008.  And finally our outlook reflects the incremental cost of around $80 million from the unplanned high incidence of flu in the first quarter.  When taken together, we expect operating earnings to be between 7.5 to $7.7 billion, or roughly $900 million less than previously planned for the full year.</p>
          <p>Before getting into detail on the first quarter, let me make clear how unacceptable these results revised outlook are to all of us.  They do not reflect the capacities of our businesses and we are moving aggressively to address the performance related issues.  Let me now walk you through first quarter results beginning with revenues, then medical costs, operating costs, and capital.</p>
          <p>Our first quarter revenue of $20.3 billion increased 7% year-over-year.  A number of elements impacted revenue growth.  First, participation in our fee-based benefit services was stronger than expected, reflecting the strong improvement in our service and value to the large employer market sector even during a downturn in the economy.</p>
          <p>Mail order script volumes for our Prescription Solutions pharmacy benefits management businesses are ahead of plan through the first three months and several other businesses were fully on track for growth for the quarter, including AmeriChoice for Medicaid, OptumHealth Financial Services, Ingenix for technology services, AARP Medicare Supplement, Evercare, Part D and others.  Conversely, revenue was affected by net growth below plan in Medicare Advantage and a greater than expected decline in commercial risk business, as well as premium yield pressures and lower benefit uptake from retained commercial risk business.</p>
          <p>Regarding investment income with the bond market's focus on quality, our portfolio's gross unrealized capital gain position advanced from $162 million at December 31 to $240 million at March 31.  We have monetized some of our Treasury investments and will reinvest in other high quality securities.  This sale produced $53 million in capital gains this quarter.  Keeping with our long-term strategy we will likely continue to reallocate at a moderate pace in coming quarters depending on market condition, ensuring a continued high quality diversified investment portfolio.</p>
          <p>Continuing the revenue discussion let me turn to our operating businesses starting with our Public and Senior Markets Group business.  In Ovations, growth was improved meaningfully compared with last year.  We see 2008 as an important transition year as we continue to build new dedicated captive distribution capabilities to support even stronger growth and greater retention in 2009.  Active Medicare Supplement is off to a strong first quarter, with growth of 40,000 new people putting us well on track for our forecasted growth of around 125 for the full year, plus an additional 10,000 acquired from Sierra.</p>
          <p>Our Ovations Medicare Advantage businesses had net organic growth of 50,000 seniors as of April 1.  This was underpinned by more than 200,000 gross new sales, an increase of over 50% on our performance for the same period last year.  These were largely individual members, not group sales, and almost all sales were network-based rather than private fee-for-service products.</p>
          <p>With the opportunity to continue to sell to age-ins, employers and in particular, our dual and chronic Special Needs Plans, which have seen outstanding growth, we expect net Medicare Advantage growth for the year at around 100,000 to 125,000 excluding Sierra and related divestitures and 135,000 to 160,000 all in.</p>
          <p>In addition, Ovations had singular success in winning new fee-based state sponsored Medicaid benefit programs, in which Evercare added 70,000 members during the first quarter of 2008 as well as being awarded the three-year contract for the state of Hawaii's QUEST Expanded Access Program.</p>
          <p>For Medicare Advantage in 2009, I would highlight three elements.  First, our results confirm the strategy of building out our captive distribution channels this year.  We expect to go into 2009 with greater control over how and where our products are sold and with greater member retention capability.  Second, on our Medicare Advantage HMO products, we made the decision for 2008 to hold margins broadly stable rather than reduce them for membership gain.  We will reevaluate the optimal positioning for this product county by county as we consider benefits in light of CMS proposed 2009 rate.</p>
          <p>Third, our 2008 Medicare Advantage growth essentially all comes from retail sales to individual seniors, which can be meaningfully strengthened in 2009 by aggressively focusing on the group Medicare Advantage market, which we believe is beginning to open up.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Part D program lost fewer members than anticipated as we retained dual eligibles who were slated to go to other plans under the government's auto-assign process.  With the addition of Sierra, Part D members and the growth of Medicare Advantage, total Part D participation stood at an industry best 5.5 million people as of March 31.  Overall for Ovations, we now forecast 2008 revenues at about $28 billion, including the effect of our Nevada Medicare divestiture.</p>
          <p>AmeriChoice is growing steadily and we expect it will add more than 500,000 people this year, without including any pending RFPs which there are several in the market. This includes organic growth of roughly 85,000 to 100,000 people, some 60,000 from Sierra, another 370,000 participants when the Unison acquisition closes, and 30,000 more in Washington D.C. that Unison was just awarded. We expect AmeriChoice revenues approaching $6 billion for 2008, including a roughly one half year contribution from Unisys. Fundamentally, our Public and Senior Markets Group is a $34 billion business that is performing at a very steady level of growth.</p>
          <p>Continuing with our Health Care Services businesses, in the Commercial Markets Group we reported a net organic decrease of 560,000 people as we had projected on our fourth quarter call. But mix has changed meaningfully. We had an organic loss of 530,000 risk-based members, about 130,000 more than we had estimated in January. About 60% of the lost were either due to employers converting to fee-based arrangements related specifically to PacifiCare business. The economic downturn has put additional pressure on the already price-sensitive small group markets. We continue to project our margins against that backdrop &#x2013; protect our margins against that backdrop by raising our base rates and limiting our new business discounts. We are committed to sustaining a quality business without taking shortsighted pricing positions.</p>
          <p>Positive commercial developments this quarter include the closure of the Sierra transaction, the addition of 1.3 million fee-based participants through Fiserv Health, and substantially stronger participation than expected in fee-based services on an organic basis. We are down 30,000 people through the first three months as compared to an originally expected loss of 200,000 fee-based participants. We saw stronger than expected growth in retention of consumers at open enrollment of our large employer customers even during poor economic conditions. This is a favorable leading indicator of the strengthening service execution and performance that we have been driving for the past nine months, as well as the broad, stable network access in clinical quality approaches that are part of our value proposition.</p>
          <p>We saw a continued outstanding performance from our consumer-directed offerings, where we remain the national leader. For the first time, we have more participants in the funded savings account than we do in the notional health reimbursement accounts, as consumer-directed HSA offerings begin to scale in the individual and small group marketplace. Our total of 2.7 million people with CDH offerings holds the number one market position in that category and we grew at 25% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Uniprise reports 42% of its employers are using a CDH program and more than 15% of its membership is in some type of CDH plan. A recent study of our national employers indicated our CDH programs provide 10 to 12% absolute cost savings sustained over a four-year period, driven in part by their employees' use of preventative care and evidence-based care for chronic conditions.</p>
          <p>We now forecast a total net increase in commercial markets of 4% or 900,000 people this year. This 900,000 gain is comprised of the addition of 1.3 million people at Fiserv and more than 300,000 at Sierra, the organic loss of 700,000 risk-based participants at UnitedHealthcare, and flat fee-based membership this year. This brings the commercial markets' total estimated revenue to nearly 42 billion for 2008.</p>
          <p>Moving forward, we will continue revitalizing broker relationships, improving flexibility around local market needs and dynamics and strengthening service performance. We will continue advancing in-culture offerings for targeted groups in consumer segments and driving new products that better meet affordability needs, all while pricing to forward costs and balancing the medical care ratio. These actions are also supported by ongoing efforts in the medical cost affordability and clinical quality domain. We believe these are the right actions for sustained, long-term value creation.</p>
          <p>Moving to Enterprise Services revenue; Prescription Solutions is performing well with mail order scripts ahead of plan for the first three months and generic utilization continuing to increase strongly. Prescription Solutions has already sold pharmacy benefit management services to planned sponsors representing nearly one half million unaffiliated lives this year and is working in active pipeline with potential clients representing several million people.</p>
          <p>OptumHealth shows some signs of top-line pressure due to the shortfalls in commercial and senior growth elsewhere in our enterprise. OptumHealth is making targeted investments in its business to capitalize on existing and emerging market opportunities. Areas of focus include public sector product development, specialty benefits product bundling and external sales force expansion, and our consumer engagement initiatives in care solutions. In the public sector, our new product capabilities have already created nearly 1 billion in emerging revenue pipeline and contributed to new sales in 2008.</p>
          <p>Ingenix continues to consistently grow at a high rate with record new order volume in pharma services, continuing strong sales in health information systems and analytics and a backlog of nearly $1.7 billion. We expect Ingenix revenues to reach nearly 1.7 billion, Prescription Solutions revenues of well more than 12 billion, and OptumHealth to be in the area of 5.3 billion. This represents all-in revenues of some $19 billion for Enterprise Services.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll move forward to an analysis of medical costs from across the company. Our Commercial Markets Group medical care ratio came in at 82.5% while UnitedHealthcare's traditional medical care ratio now including Sierra was 81.5% in the quarter. Flu was worth an incremental 40 basis points alone, putting us close to the upper end of our first quarter guidance range of 80.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. Realized premium yields have increased in the quarter, reflecting the strongest realized premium yield increases in several years even in an intensely competitive environment with the average coming in just short of our plan, perhaps by 30 to 40 basis points, which is now incorporated into our full-year outlook.</p>
          <p>Medical costs continue to be in the 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis point range that we earlier anticipated. The total cost picture continuing to be driven more by unit costs than utilization, primarily in the hospital inpatient category.</p>
          <p>In the senior businesses, the Ovations Special Needs Plans have by their nature a higher acuity population and higher care ratios, particularly in the first year when seniors who have not had coordinated care initially join the plan. We have seen strong sales of these SNP plans this year, so this membership mix is increasing the Ovations' medical care ratio. In our traditional HMO-based Medicare Advantage business, the medical care ratio is performing on par with the first quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Overall, we are focused on several key strategies. UnitedHealthcare will continue to be disciplined and consistent in its pricing and drive more affordable designs and stimulate growth. Evercare Special Needs Plans are still a growth driver and a long-term opportunity for enterprise to demonstrate the unique value in our coordinated care skills. We are now looking for a 2008 consolidated medical care ratio in a range of 81.3% plus or minus 50 basis points, including a UnitedHealthcare ratio that is likely to be in a range of around 82.3% plus or minus 50 basis points. The 80 basis points change in the consolidated guidance includes about 40 basis points from Ovations, 20 basis points related to Commercial, 10 basis points because of flu, and the remaining 10 points from other factors.</p>
          <p>Moving on to operating costs. Our ratio of 14.3% of revenues in the quarter is high, particularly because of revenue volume shortfalls. There was also a 20 basis point impact from Fiserv Health and another more than 10 basis points due to stronger than expected fee-based service mix across our enterprise. We have taken targeted and thoughtful steps to realign operating costs to revive revenue levels, while avoiding indiscriminate and potentially harmful disinvestments. We are very committed to fully supporting service, growth and innovation across the full spectrum of our business. That said we are focused on reducing our operating cost run rate by 3 to 5% as well as reducing capital spending.</p>
          <p>Looking at capital, our longstanding approach is delivering benefits. We strengthened our Commercial and senior benefit businesses with accretive acquisitions that will provide good risk-adjusted returns. We also signed a merger agreement that will put us in a leadership position in Medicaid and state services, bringing us to a total of 2 million participants and a presence across 21 states. These moves strengthen and expand and further diversify the UnitedHealth Group services system.</p>
          <p>We repurchased $1.5 billion in stock this quarter, bringing our debt-to-total capital ratio to approximately 40%, which is about the range of the capital structure we discussed last fall.</p>
          <p>With the decreased share price and the active repurchase program, our first quarter weighted average share count decreased 121 million shares to 1.28 billion shares from 1.4 billion shares one year ago. We are in position to repurchase a total of $4 billion in stock this year in addition to having completed the mergers I have described. This repurchase level represents close to 9% of the market cap of the company at recent prices.</p>
          <p>There are some additional non-financial matters to discuss today as well. We have renewed our relationship with Medco through 2012. UnitedHealthcare, together with Medco, has shown exceptional drug performance for customers for nearly a decade on both an absolute cost and trend basis. With the growth we have seen during that timeframe, this was a logical time to reassess our approach to providing drug benefit management.</p>
          <p>For their part, Medco was open to changes in approach which improve our alignment and increase value for our customers. Under the new agreement, we will continue to manage our formulary and benefit design, while Medco will continue to handle fulfillment. We will in-source customer service and customer benefit setup, create a more integrated seamless experience in these customer-facing functions.</p>
          <p>We have an extremely capable and scalable Prescription Solutions business, a business that today serves more than 10 million people and has a 15-year track record of performance, a business we are building for growth. We will continue to use Prescription Solutions for all our rapidly expanding business in the public and senior sector, government business, and in selected commercial markets including pharmacy carve-outs.</p>
          <p>In addition, Prescription Solutions will retain and continue to grow its legacy PacifiCare business and consolidate UnitedHealth Specialty Pharma business. We have integrated Innoviant, the PBM purchased as part of the Fiserv acquisition, inside Prescription Solutions. This renewal puts us in a strong and diversified position and we continue to invest in Prescription Solutions and position it for future growth. We intend to leverage our enterprise-wide scale and expertise on behalf of all our customers. We have been pleased with our two-platform approach and will continue to evaluate our strategies as the marketplace evolves.</p>
          <p>We also continue our efforts to bring the very best talent into our enterprise. Earlier today, we were pleased to make announcements that represent very positive news for us. Gail Boudreaux will join us as the UnitedHealth Group Executive Vice President and President of the Commercial Markets Group. We know Gail well from her work in Illinois and Texas where she was Executive Vice President of the Healthcare Services Corporation. Gail will bring a new dimension to UnitedHealth Group and focus on the clear growth challenges within the UnitedHealthcare businesses. The addition of an executive of Gail's caliber will further expand our capacities in the critical area of our business.</p>
          <p>Our other announcement was that Dave Wichmann has become the President of UnitedHealth Group operations. This means that he will focus his considerable talents and the breadth of his understanding of our business to manage on an enterprise-wide basis several areas that are among our highest priorities. These include areas such as optimizing our business performance, strengthening and better aligning our organization, overseeing our operations and related cost level, technology, integration, capital management, quality agenda and managing corporate development, research, international operations and all integration efforts. We are fortunate to have someone with Dave's ability to take on this senior leadership role.</p>
          <p>Michael O'Boyle, former Chief Operating Officer of the Cleveland Clinic, has joined us as our new President of National Network Services where we believe he will be instrumental in enhancing our network relationships with physicians and hospitals.</p>
          <p>Tina Brown-Stevenson, formerly of Aetna Integrated Informatics, will run all clinical and customer analytics and related services for Ingenix. Each of these people and others like them reflect the caliber of individuals we continue to seek to attract to leadership roles at UnitedHealth Group.</p>
          <p>I am also pleased to announce that another new board member will stand for election at our 2008 annual meeting in June. Glenn Renwick, Chief Executive Officer of Progressive Insurance, brings both expertise in consumer products and distribution and perspectives on insurance, and will be a great addition. He joins Michele Hooper and Bob Darretta as new independent directors, and we expect additional new board members later in 2008.</p>
          <p>And finally, I want to congratulate Dr. Reed Tuckson, our Executive Vice President and Chief of Medical Affairs, for being recognized by Ebony Magazine and Modern Healthcare this month for his profound leadership and impactful contribution to society.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap with some thoughts and a summary of our outlook. The pressure points we discussed this morning are clearly broader in UnitedHealth Group and relate in part to national economics and industry trends. In that category, I would put interest rates and investment income, unusually high influence of cost, continued comparative activity around membership growth, customer demands for leaner benefits that increase buy downs and slow revenue growth, and the risk of declines in business from customers in challenged industries. Other items are more specific to UnitedHealth Group, including most significantly the area of commercial and Medicare risk membership growth.</p>
          <p>We expect revenues in the 81 to $82 billion rate. We are currently forecasting full year results at $3.55 to $3.60 per share. This includes the second quarter outlook of $0.81 to $0.83 per share with aggressively stronger results in the back half of the year. We believe this view is right in light of recent trends, is consistent with what we see in the business today, and we are confident we can perform to this level.</p>
          <p>Overall, I'm strongly confident in our businesses. Our operations and functions are well managed, we have attractive new products and represent a first rate value with strong customer acceptance, we are well positioned to advance to our current stressful special market environment, we have a highly diversified business that serves strategically large and growing markets and that have compiling long-term needs. Our products and services across these markets allow purchasers to choose from an array of prices and features.</p>
          <p>We need to do a better job in maintaining our members in this commercial risk product. That has been the case for too long. It is strongly encouraging that we have increased our commercial pricing yields in 2008, and equally important that our medical trend outlook remains constant.</p>
          <p>Taken together, the UnitedHealth Group businesses represent a unique healthcare services franchise that has strong earnings and cash flow machine. We do not accept our current disappointing position relative to where we have been in the past as a permanent condition and are taking immediate action to change the direction of these trends.</p>
          <p>We appreciate your interest today, and we can now move to questions. I am joined in this room by many of my business colleagues. After the call, John Penshorn, Brett Manderfeld, Mike Mikan and others will continue to be available to respond to any additional questions you may have.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Good morning.  Question first on the MCR for the business. When you look at the commercial risk MCR for '08, it's going to be 100 basis points higher than the total which is with the remainder being mainly government business. I'm just curious how long you think this could persist, I mean, in the government businesses running MCR that's meaningfully below commercial.  And if it does normalize higher, what impact should we think about that having on your long-term growth?</p>

          <p>That's 100 basis points above the UnitedHealth Group overall.  The UnitedHealth Group, the remainder of outside of commercial is normally government businesses, which typically historically, have run higher MCRs.  So if the government is running materially lower than commercial, how long is that sustainable?  You talked a little bit about Medicare Advantage and thinking about the tradeoff of growth versus margin. Just trying to think about how in 2009 and beyond, how we should think about that pressure from the government businesses possibly normalizing higher?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, Justin, there's a lot of ins and outs and we've discussed this before that it's not just the government business that is the delta between the commercial medical care ratio and the UnitedHealth Group.  There is OptumHealth and there's also the pharmacy business that reduces the cost ratio because we purchase &#x2013; Prescription Solutions purchases drugs for the Ovations business as well.  So it's not just the government business, and particularly, it's not just Ovations, but also includes the AmeriChoice business and the myriad of different products within Ovations. So if you're asking with respect to one product line, we don't get into that level of detail, but the public and senior market group, medical care ratio is higher than the commercial medical care ratio in total.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And just a quick question on medical cost, can you walk us through the different components? And you mentioned the in-patient being pressured and the &#x2013; can you kind of specify that what you're seeing there and how close to that 7.5 number you're running?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.  It's Mike again, Justin.  As you recall, last year we ended at the lower end of our original guidance of between &#x2013; we had originally guided at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points, we ended the year at the lower end of 7 to 7.5%.  We guided for 2008 at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points. I broke out those details for you, I think Ken Burdick did as well at Investor Day.  We would change those, some &#x2013; we are seeing some difference in mix, and I'll go through those.  But with respect to unit cost and utilization in aggregate, those remain the same, roughly 5% for unit cost, roughly 2.5% or so for utilization and mix.  And those components are positioned &#x2013; we had been at the investor conference at 4.5 &#x2013; I think 4 or 5% at the Investor Day.  We are now estimating between 4 and 5% per position.  On in-patient, as a result of significant unit cost pressure on the West Coast, as well as the East Coast, we are now projecting in-patient trends at 11.5 to 12%, that's up from 9.5 to 10.5%.  Out-patient, which was at 7 to 8%, is now at 6 to 7%.  I think there is some mix changing there.  And then pharmacy, which we had estimated at Investor Day at 7 to 8%, we now view at &#x2013; are forecasted at 6 to 7%.  If you do the weighting of each one of those on the medical cost trends, it remains consistent with our aggregate forecast that we had with 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.  We've had this conversation in the past and I really think, Steve, you should add to your list of things you got to do better is capital management.  From 2004 to 2007, we have spent $15 billion buying back stock, and if the opening this morning is any indication of ongoing value, the program has been really an enormous mistake. And it's particularly aggravating because it took place in a time when there was substantial insight of selling back to the corporation in effect.  We've had this conversation before, but I like to know how well thought out is this buyback philosophy to where you are excluding a meaningful cash dividend completely.  In other words, when I look at the statistics, 80% of the S&amp;P 500 paid dividend, a 100% of Dow Jones companies paid a dividend, where do you think your stock will be selling at if you took this, say, half of your 355 to 360 in earnings and payout a cash dividend, the remaining half, half went to grow the business and half went basically to offset option dilution and if the shareholders made their decision.  Now, I myself have historically been a fan of stock repurchase, but only when one condition exists; that we are buying back something that's meaningfully undervalued when we're leveraging return to remaining shareholders.  And clearly, we don't seem to have a good handle on what our business is worth or Mr. Market is making an enormous mistake.  So what could we say here about this. I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first of all, I appreciate your perspective, and I believe I understand your perspective. Our approaches to capital have been consistent in terms of reinvesting in a way that we think is measured in our existing business, dedicating capital where we see opportunities to strategically expand our business, and we have seen and felt that share buyback provides the greatest shareholder value when we look at our business and assess what we consider to be the intrinsic value.  I think we are influenced by the fact that we have not executed well and not executed well over the last, I would say, two years.  And, as a result, it is &#x2013; it's clearly been reflected in the share price.  We continue to believe that the potential of this enterprise, executing near or to its potential, is extremely compelling and we are committed to that level of execution.  But I &#x2013; and as a result, share buyback appears to be the most compelling use of that capital.  I take your point with respect to a dividend analysis and I can assure you that we look at that and evaluate that on a regular basis and evaluate it at the Board level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The only suggestion, since you're taking the extreme position, I mean, today, you said you're going to do a $4 billion buyback which is I guess 10% or thereabouts of the market cap, why don't you share the valuation sinking that the Board and financial management of the company has gone through in reaching this decision and send all of us a little letter in discussing this decision, because we spent 3.4 billion in '04, 2.6 billion in '05, 2.3 billion in '06, 6.6 billion in '07; these are substantial numbers.  The biggest investment decision the company has ever made and it's been so far flawed.  Now, I myself am &#x2013; I get intrigued when you really get undervalued; my guess is, you're probably significantly undervalued.  But I'd like to kind of understand the thought process that the management is going through to reach the determination, because the &#x2013; I suspect if we announced this morning that we're going to pay $1.80 dividend, which is half the earnings, the other half would be to grow the business or offset option dilution, your stock wouldn't be trading where it's trading at today.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there.  I'm really struggling with your assertion that you're not seeing a change in forecasted medical trend, because if I look at your commercial loss ratio, you're saying you got better yield than a year ago. And yet, a year ago, the commercial loss ratio benefited from a 120 basis point positive development.  So, even excluding flu, your MLR [Multiple Linear Regression] is up over a 100 basis points.  So, that implies that costs have accelerated more than a 100 basis points.  Can you help me with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one of the major themes there is that we have gotten better premium yield realization this year as compared to the last.  The issue is; are those yields sufficiently covering the level of projected medical costs and Mike can I think provide some color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But how can an acceleration in premium yield not cover trend if trend isn't rising or accelerating?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christine, let me clarify as best I can.  What we've said is, and I go back to my earlier comment with Justin, last year, we ended the year at 7 to 7.5% at the lower end of that range.  This year, we have been forecasting and remain to forecast at 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.  If you go back &#x2013; if you try to tie in yield, last year, as we disclosed to you, is we missed yield or missed trend by about 60 basis points.  If you assume that we're getting 50 basis points better on yield, but we're still short by 30 to 40 basis points from yield to trend, that would imply that your medical costs have increased by 20 to 30 basis points, well within the range that we had given previously.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, why...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year, we ended at the lower end of the range, and this year we're well within the 7.5% plus or minus 50 basis points.  There is flu; that works into that as well</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But 30 to 40 basis points is relative to what we expected trend to be.  So, flu is in there at 10 basis points and then there's some ins and out, but nothing major beyond that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if you are at the lower end of kind of 7 to 7.5% &#x2013; let's call it 7%, I mean, you're saying trend could be as high as 7.5 plus or minus 50, trend could be as high as 8.  So, trend can be up a 100 basis points.  So, am I reading that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the range is 7.5 plus or minus 50 basis points.  The math I just walked you through would be somewhere around 30 to 40 basis points if you take flu into consideration and some other items.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  It's just that it seems to me that ex-flu you're running an 81.1.  A year ago, ex-positive development &#x2013; or ex-negative development and commercial you were at 80% even.  So, even ex-flu, you're up over a 100 basis points with higher yield.  So, I guess I'm still struggling, but I'll take it off-line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  I think we can take you through that math off-line.  I think that would be a more productive approach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Christine, why don't I quickly just give you some other guidance that we've given before?  When you adjust for the development, both the favorable development from last year and subsequent development true-ups for the first quarter, we estimated the loss ratio to be 80.5%.  If you adjust for flu and you adjust for this pricing discrepancy that I just discussed, you would get in the range of what we booked the first quarter at of 81.5%.  So, yeah, I think John, Brett and I, we can follow-up with you on that.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, if we could focus just for a second on your Medicare Advantage membership and the new guidance. Maybe if you could start-off just by helping us square the membership that you cite which is 50,000 adds versus what CMS is reporting, and I believe they talked about that being 19.  And then how realistic are your new guidance points, given the fact that open enrollment has closed, so you no longer have access to the full 45 plus million members?  Is it realistic to think in the balance of the year with a far smaller addressable population that you are going to be able to hit those targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  I think Simon can respond to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.  Thanks, Bill.  So, if you look at the CMS numbers, we do believe they reconcile in that, obviously, the CMS monthly numbers are lagged by three or four weeks.  So, for January, they had us at minus 12, but in fact there was a cost plan number in there which got us flat.  For February, they were at plus 13.  For March, they were at plus 4.  For April, they were at plus 9 getting us to a net of 27.  And then we saw a ramp-up in sales at the end of the open enrollment period, give us our estimated 50,000 April 1st effectives.</p>
          <p>As for the rest of the year, we obviously are able to sell chronic Special Needs Plans in 34 markets and in those markets we think we have potentially 6 million seniors who are potentially able to join those chronic Special Needs Plans.  So, we don't think we are going to be out of runway for the rest of the year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And if I could ask a quick follow-up on your cash flow guidance?  I think your prior guidance points were 7 billion, but, if I recall, that was a five quarter look.  The math that I have done is that you report about 2.2 billion in the fourth quarter.  So, that would imply that you've cut your share repurchase guidance from about 4.8 to 4 billion.  Could you confirm that I am getting that correct?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.  I guess the answer to the question is that you have reduced your outlook on repurchasing stock, which I have to say, given the changes to the balance sheet and the cash flow of 280 million in the quarter is a good thing, but I guess I have to go to a broader question.  We are confused about how you are pricing your product.  I really don't understand what it means that your premium yield is &#x2013; I do understand in terms of the numbers what it means, but your premium yield was better than it was last year. It's still not good enough to cover trends.</p>
          <p>I am going back right to Christine's question on this, and I guess where I am very confused is it that you expected &#x2013; you price for a cost trend say at the 7.5%, what you are getting on premium yield is 7.3%?  Is that the right way to look at this in terms of just putting it in simple English and simple numbers?  Then the broader overall question is, with the increase in debt, with the lack of performance which Steve unfortunately you've had to preside over for the last couple of years with changes in management. How do we get confidence that this is sort of the last time we are going to hear the results are unacceptable?</p>
          <p>I just &#x2013; the message gets more confusing, not less.  You have the right team in place.  Are you pricing the product correctly?  Is the quality of earnings where it needs to be?  Is the cash flow where it needs to be?  That's the general broader question or are we looking at a period of prolonged readjustment before the company can get back on-track?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sheryl, to use your numbers, the way you're looking at using the 7.5%, we are &#x2013; of cost trend, if you were to use that number, we are 30 to 40 basis points below that.  Yet, as Steve noted on the call, we are falling short on premium yield by about $200 million or $1.50 to $2.  That was roughly call it 50 basis points or $1.50 PMDM that we needed.  So, we would have liked to have gotten that in our pricing, but as a result of the competitive pricing dynamics, the market mix, all those things, we are again falling short by 30 to 40 basis points.  That doesn't mean the cost trend that we assumed changed, with the exception of flu and some other non-recurring items de minimus albeit, but the nonetheless we are falling short again 30 to 40 basis points this year compared to 60 basis points last year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sheryl, the second part of your question is clearly fair.  I would tell you that I see perhaps things that aren't reflected in the performance, and I have talked I think in terms of changes that have been initiated I would say over the last year to address needs I think within our enterprise to position it for a long-term consistent performance.  Those are areas around a culture that focuses on organic growth and the innovation and the kind of service environment that is required to sustain it, an organization that has the kind of relationship orientation to work effectively with all the participants in the healthcare marketplace, so that its presence in that marketplace is welcomed and encouraged and I think we have made significant advances in that area.</p>
          <p>We continue to struggle with our capacities around growth, growth in principally risk-based products.  Products that have extreme price sensitivity, where we endeavor to maintain an economic discipline about how we price that product and how we oversee that product in terms of its attributes, so that we have some visibility with respect to the economics of that.  That has been a challenge for us. It's been a challenge across the marketplace and that growth issue has &#x2013; the inability to predict that growth has been I think at the core of our issues and is clearly the core contributor to our guidance with respect to that.</p>
          <p>I would say that we have taken steps and we will continue to take steps.  We will continue to try to find the right mix of leadership and we will continue to adjust our approaches, so that we are more effective as an enterprise in delivering the kind of value that stimulates in a consistent pattern of growth and growth that has a reasonable economic return.  There are other things that can be done within the domain of this business to optimize its performance. Its performance is far from its potential.  I would say this team and management are very, very focused on that and a number of good things are proceeding, but they are not reflected in our performance to date.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question.  In listening to the conversation today and the questions that have been brought up with some of the analysts and also with Mr. Cooperman, I think it's very insightful to look at what's happening to some of your businesses, including the Pharmacy Solutions business.  Today, you announced that you signed the contract with Medco.  Medco today is up 8%. It's adding $2 billion worth of value to its market cap, and it sells at 22 times its earnings.  I would like to understand what you think the strategic relationship would be worth if UnitedHealthcare were to sell Prescription Solutions to Medco?</p>
          <p>Also in light of that, looking at the Ingenix business, which I think is a terrific software business and also OptumHealth, which has very specialized services. It seems like the value in those three businesses, which represents about roughly $20 billion worth of revenues, is dramatically higher in multiple business, especially looking at the Medco business than the way that the HMOs are trading.</p>
          <p>So, I think that, in my view as being a long-term shareholder for our clients, in looking at the valuation on UnitedHealthcare, it seems to me that the parts are worth dramatically more than where the stock is trading now.  Other HMO companies don't have the product diversity that UnitedHealthcare has and it seems to me that when looking at the sum of the part solution to what UnitedHealthcare might be worth is dramatically greater than where it's trading at today.  So, share repurchase program, you're almost looking at a 15% free cash flow yield.  And we're going through a normal cycle I think.  I like the pricing discipline that you have in that PM business.  And I like the fact that you are holding to making certain that you are not pricing the product too low, because of the cost trends have not changed.  So, I like the pricing discipline.</p>
          <p>In looking what private equity is paid for businesses in the medical arena, such as the private equity acquisition of HCA, it seems like the valuation when the credit market starts to normalize would find UnitedHealthcare dramatically undervalued.  So, Stephen, in light of signing the Medco contract and some of the other comments that were made, as far as Ingenix is concerned,  how do you look at these special businesses that are within UnitedHealthcare given the valuation on your company?  And is it something that we should be talking to the Board about as far as realizing the opportunity?  I mean I just, you know, the market is down 57 basis points today. Medco was up 8% adding $2 billion worth of value and we're looking at a stock at UnitedHealthcare down another 10%.  And I am saying to myself, jeez, the value that's, the cash flow valuation is very supportive and I'm just interested in how you look at this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we have had parts of this conversation before and I am very familiar I think with the spectrum of value dynamics across our diversified portfolio.  And I can assure you that we look at that and assess that in terms of what I will call the long-term interest of shareholders and we do that, not just by ourselves but we use external experts in terms of making those assessments.  And you are very correct in terms of seeing the distinctions in value across that spectrum.</p>
          <p>Taken together, if you think about the total healthcare marketplace, its needs, its potential, and the systemic fashion in which we think it is appropriate to address it.  That diversification that has been cultivated over the &#x2013; in this company for more than 10 years has been distinctive, and it's helped us grow in a variety of different domains.  Much of the growth in these special businesses that you are referring to has been stimulated and leveraged off the assets and capabilities of businesses that perhaps are not as vibrant at this moment and I would also say that, the view may be clouded by the lack of consistent execution to getting this portfolio of businesses to all perform to their potential.</p>
          <p>My sense is, is that the evolution of this enterprise to that more complete business model has distinctive capacities in the marketplace and has distinctive value potential.</p>
          <p>That said, Tom, we look at these pieces and we'll look at these pieces and assess whether we could accomplish those same elements, those same goals without necessarily controlling those and we look at that on a regular basis and assess whether the positioning and so forth would be appropriate to unlock value if in fact we thought that unlocking value was appropriate at that time for long-term shareholders.  I use the PBM as an example.  Rx Solutions we think is a very high potential business.  Its potential is far from fully realized.  We are making investments in it and making sure that it grows and can be positioned to something that could be quite distinctive in the marketplace.  And I might look at the extension with Medco as a bridge to that ultimate kind of potential.</p>
          <p>So, I think, for example, you could look at that as a piece in a strategy that might play exactly into what you are suggesting.  And we are looking at these across the spectrum, whether it's Ingenix, Rx Solution, OptumHealth, AmeriChoice, across the Board. I'd offer one other element and that has been consistent for many years is that, a core element that has allowed us to cultivate these businesses the way they have has been the competencies around care access and clinically integrated care management.  Information, which is key to the, I think, success of all of the businesses and the leverage and use of technology and those are present in all those businesses an important leverage point that one has to consider if these were ever to be separated.  It is a point that our Board does deliberate over and would always welcome your thinking and discussions with you on that level.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.  I just want to get the commercial margin maybe from a different perspective.  I guess just at a basic level, you know, the commercial risk membership is declining even faster than we expected, while the MLR is going up. You know, to us that would suggest that the absent mix changes that the UHC risk pool is deteriorating.  I guess, 1) is that the correct conclusion? And 2) if it is a factor, is it because, you know as you say, you're seeing dis-enrollment and maybe that dis-enrollment has been coming from healthier groups or healthier members within your groups?  Or is it too because of these competitive pressures you are mentioning, perhaps competitors are picking off your better risk membership through maybe not irrational pricing but maybe pricing to a lower margin. Are any of those factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Greg, this is Ken Burdick.  Let me respond to your question.  I would say that the pricing pressure that Steve outlined in his opening remarks is intense, but I would describe it as rational.  To your point, we do see the strongest pressure in those markets where we compete against non-profit players, and we continue to focus on pricing our business to our forward look of cost and so while we are pleased that we are getting stronger net premium yields this year than last year, we remain displeased that we aren't hitting our target of matching medical cost trend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on the dis-enrollment that you are seeing, I mean is there a way to characterize that as being healthier members being priced out of the insurance market altogether or in just opting out?  Or, is there any conclusion you can draw around the relative risk of the membership that you are losing relative to the stuff that you are keeping?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, we look at that on a monthly basis.  We do not see a degradation of the underlying demographics and the quality of the risk pool.  What I can tell you is that to the earlier comment, we are seeing a much higher level of in-group attrition.  The enrollment declines due to the soft economy.  So for example, in the first quarter of '07, we saw 55,000 members within existing customers leave.  For first quarter of '08, we're seeing double that amount, but we're not seeing a substantial, or any meaningful, differentiation in the quality of the risk pool.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning.  A quick one here.  How much of your revision was related to Fed rate action?  And then secondly, could you provide us with some metrics that illustrate the flu season this year relative to others be that admits per 1000 or some type of script that would indicate magnitude of change, this year being a unique year in the flu season relative to others as we try to learn about this flu season?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Why don't I &#x2013; it is Mike, Tom.  Why don't I try &#x2013; I'll start with the second question and I'll ask Bob Oberrender, our Treasurer, to answer your first question.  We analyze &#x2013; we've obviously been analyzing the flu season for a number of years.  We always take a look at how &#x2013; when the flu season occurs, what is the duration, what is the influenza like, patient visit percentage over the baseline.  As you know, this year was a dramatic spike in the mid-February time period.  We generally estimate that the flu costs across our book-of-business somewhere around a $150 million a year.  We estimate that range to cost us for the first quarter in 2008 to be roughly 230 million, say, 70 to 90 million, or if you want to put a corridor around it, of incremental flu cost.  And each one of the &#x2013; we manage the different diagnoses, but each book-of-business is different, whether it's physician visits in the commercial business, inpatient stays in the Ovations business, and it's all across the board for the AmeriChoice business.  So there isn't one unique item, but we do manage it across each individual block. In an aggregate, we estimate it to be around $80 million incremental.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tom, this is Bob Oberrender.  With respect to investment income a 200 basis point decrease of the Fed action impacting rate impact on our investment income going forward, and then the incremental part is some lower average balances as we trued up with CMS compared to last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it's about $250 million degradation offset by, as Steve indicated in the comments that he made in the opening, of about $150 million of estimated realized capital gains of which we realized 53 million in the first quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just interested if you could give us an update on where enrollment stands currently in commercial for the legacy PacifiCare and AMS books, just in terms of thinking about how much more potential attrition risk is there before we essentially get to zero with that commercial business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, this is Ken Burdick again.  The PacifiCare losses for the first quarter of 2008 came in about 50,000 members higher than expected.  We were planning on 200,000, it came in at 250,000.  I would note that 130,000 of that is attributable to four large customers where we were operating with very, very thin profit margins.  Over the remainder of the year, we expect continued losses substantially subsiding 80,000 to 90,000 over the remaining three quarters of this year, and our business is much better-positioned now.  We know that we have felt the effects of the very rapid transition that we implemented in the way we manage the business operationally, but the remaining customers are seeing the service improvement and the network stability.  So, we are going to continue to see a dramatic improvement in the losses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Ken, could you just remind us what is remaining at this point in terms of commercial membership from PacifiCare, what's left in that block at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="a">

          <p>1.6 million members.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then I just had a quick follow-up in terms of, on the Part D business and some of the comments you made around the costs in the LIS business.  Can you help us think about what you think pre-tax margin in Part D will look like this year?  I know historically you've talked about targeting a 3% to 5% pre-tax margin to that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes Scott.  This is Simon.  Part D continues to be a successful and profitable business for us, and the new benefit designs that we introduced for 2008 are generally performing well.  We've certainly been successful in stimulating increases in generic mail penetration as we planned.  As Steve said, we are however, now seeing higher than planned pharmacy trends, particularly for our low income Part D members and this is, to some extent, a spillover effect from last year's low income benchmark bidding process.</p>
          <p>As to margins, obviously as we've said for many years, we typically look to a minimum hurdle rate of 3 to 5% for an established government program, recognizing that returns can often be better for individual participants and programs who are high performing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Simon, is it fair to think may be, maybe a little bit lower than that long term hurdle rate but still profitable for Part D?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's certainly still profitable for Part D. That's the basis on which we participate in all government programs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we're going to have to wrap it up.  I apologize we can't get to all questions and we will have management available broadly for questions through the course of the day.  I would like to though, comment on something that occurred here this morning at 9.  The State of Tennessee awarded AmeriChoice, both the East and West regions for the State Medicaid business, that business will largely be &#x2013; will start in the beginning of 2009, should represent about a billion dollars of revenue growth for AmeriChoice.  I think that's an example of the RFP's that we said were in the marketplace that we think are fruitful.  So, AmeriChoice was successful in securing the State of Tennessee business.  It should represent about a billion dollars of revenues for 2009.</p>
          <p>Our orientation towards growth like this needs to come back into the &#x2013; our commercial risk businesses, we're focused on that we're focused on our operating costs.  We are focused on making sure that this enterprise performs to its potential, and we are urgent about it.  The steps that we are taking, I think reflect that.  We'll be happy to have an opportunity to talk to you about your questions in the course of the day.  Thank you.</p>
