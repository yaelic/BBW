          <p>Thank you very much. I'd just like to inform you all that our CEO, Mr. Roger Agnelli is here with us today and he will participate of the whole conference call. Thank you very much, Roger, for your presence here with us.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So let's start with the first picture of our results in the third quarter of '09 &#x2013; '08, sorry, it was a very good performance, operational performance. We have records in the output production of iron ore, pellets, nickel, bauxite, alumina, aluminum, cobalt and thermal coal.</p>
          <p>Our shipments also were in a record high for iron ore and pellets, copper, alumina, cobalt and thermal coal. Revenues reached $12.1 billion; our EBIT 5.5; EBITDA 6.4 billion. So a tremendous operational performance that was also associated with the recognition award that Vale got this very week of being considered the most admired company in Brazil. That's very good and shows how responsible, socially speaking, we are in the environment that we operate.</p>
          <p>A brief word on our risk management policy. First of all, the basic concept is that our trading desk is not a profit center. It's a &#x2013; our policy is very conservative. We have our policy focused on mitigating cash flow volatility. So this is what drives our policy, our risk management policy, and we have no leverage in our operations. And as of September, the overall position of our derivatives on a mark-to-mark basis was a positive $32.6 million or less than 0.1% of our last 12-month's revenue. So this is an important message considering what was observed unfortunately in the last several weeks for Vale.</p>
          <p>If you look at our release, you'll see a very detailed explanation about our risk management policy and the use of derivatives. And also a note on our financial statements by request of our CVM, our SEC, in which we produced a very detailed explanation about our derivatives and their policies. So this request was made by CVM last Friday and Vale was able to comply fully. And yesterday we released the results already with this addition requested by CVM. So, very important news there.</p>
          <p>So given that now we face a new global scenario, so the picture of the world that we know until September '09 changed in October. It's a brave new world out there in this last quarter. What we saw till September is something that is the end of that now, we have to face the reality of a new world, and for that Vale is very well poised to exploit growth options in this much more illiquid world .</p>
          <p>We have a very powerful cash flow, very large cash holdings that was derived from our capital increase that we promoted our offering in July. Most of the cash that we have today is derived from this operations, $12 billion, and now we have $15.3 billion. We also, as you may recall, we set up a long-term credit facility with institutions like the <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil and <mark type="inaudible" /> in Japan.</p>
          <p>And finally, we have $2 billion in committed facilities for our short-term liquidity needs. So on the top of that, we have a very well structured debt profile. Our total debt EBITDA reached a new low with one-time EBITDA in the third quarter of '08, and this we are talking here, gross debt, I would like to mention that, gross debt EBITDA reached one-time EBITDA, a low level considering what we have today. And the average maturity of our debt stays in a very comfortable 9.3 years level. So it's a very comfortable position. Next year we have $380 million in amortizations in our debt. So this is a very, very comfortable debt profile. At the same time, the cost, the average debt cost is around 5.8%, which at current levels it's a very &#x2013; prevailing markets, it's a very comfortable position as well.</p>
          <p>Well, this new world we are talking about, it's a new world that shows through this PMI that we put there in page 7, a very sharp deceleration of industrial production, and this is part of this new reality and the PMI as a lead indicator is anticipating what is yet to come. So we should be aware that this will be a very difficult environment over the next several months, and the indication that we have is that we should expect weakening in the demand for minerals and metals over the next several months. The world economy has changed, as we put there. There is less liquidity. We observed wealth losses around the world. Trillions of dollars of wealth simply disappeared. And we should expect a slower growth path for the world economy, although with a divergence that we mentioned in our release between emerging market economies and developed economies. That should continue and should widen actually.</p>
          <p>So high cost producers will face a very difficult environment, and the lack of funds and liquidity will most likely hamper the future growth of supply and &#x2013; what in a way it would contribute to market rebalancing sooner rather than later. The Chinese demand is weaker right now, much weaker. There are some cuts in steel production in October, and we do expect production in general in China to rebound in the first half of '09. In fact the Chinese demand for iron ore has been slowing due to, as we put there, a combination of several factors.</p>
          <p>First, we had a snowstorm and then soon after that we had the earthquake. That in fact provoked a major disruption in the logistics and the feeding of the several regions of the country in terms of raw materials. So this caused a major disruption out there. And then we had Olympic Games and Paralympics restrictions where we &#x2013; the areas around Beijing, we had a sharp reduction in industrial activity. And there was of course the affect of the slow external demand for Chinese steel that also affected the dynamics of demand for iron ore there.</p>
          <p>And finally, the negative effects of the domestic credit tightness in China is affecting particularly the property sector. As you can see in slide 10, in chart 10, this credit tightening promoted by the Chinese government has had the effect of slowing sharply, the loans to construction, that almost didn't grow in August. And the total loans also are growing at a much slower pace. So this is a &#x2013; it's the result of the credit tightness over the most dynamic sector of the industry &#x2013; the Chinese economy, and it had a major impact on their steel consumption, as you can see in page 11 where the construction itself represents &#x2013; the profit represents about 24% of the total fixed asset investment, second only to manufacturing.</p>
          <p>And then we have construction that is a major consumer of steel affected, and the measures related to deal with the excess of activity that was observed by the Chinese economy in the late 2007 and early 2008. Inflation is down now, but the result of this tightness was &#x2013; in credit, was a major deceleration in the construction, with obvious effects on the steel consumption.</p>
          <p>However, we believe that the long-term fundamentals are strong. We do believe that there will be some sort of deflation in housing and the affordability of buying new homes should increase over the medium to long-term. Urbanization and rising income are key drivers, and those are structural elements that will not change. They'll continue to be there. We are in a pause that could take several months, but the growth process, the development process of the Chinese economy will be certainly resumed, and now we have to wait until the effects of the measures taken by the Chinese government have an impact on the short-term indicators.</p>
          <p>In fact, in the long-term we continue to have a &#x2013; to hold a very positive view about the long-term. But in the short-term things are much harder, although the Chinese government implemented a very comprehensive package of stabilization of the demand, which tries to avoid an excessive appreciation of the RMB. There was some monetary policy easening, there was softening of credit controls and tax incentives are again in place. So they are trying to deal with the short-term hardships in this way. Of course one cannot ignore the difficulties represented by this crisis in the world economy, but the long-term fundamentals are there. We have, in our case, we have been working to enhance our growth options in the long-term.</p>
          <p>We are better positioned now to weather the down cycle. We have been preparing the company along the fears to work in a less favorable environment and the effect is that today we enjoy a financial strength that is second to no company in our segment, I would say. World class assets and a long and attractive pipeline &#x2013; project pipeline. We implemented, as you could appreciate in our last few quarter's releases, the cost cutting measures that should have an effect. We established strategic alliances with suppliers of parts, equipments and engineering services.</p>
          <p>Of course, in this new world, we will have &#x2013; should have a stronger US dollar and this would affect in a way positively our long-term costs. We will certainly &#x2013; we have to look at our production plans and make some adjustments, as Roger will comment, and unlike previous years, as we put there, we have no large iron ore project coming on stream in 2009 and 2010. And finally, the nickel projects, Goro and On&#xE7;a Puma, we always have the option to extend the duration of the ramp up in order to deal with market circumstances.</p>
          <p>With that, I will pass the floor to Roger to make his comments about the scenario and the prospectus of our company. Roger, please.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much Fabio. Good afternoon everybody. It's a pleasure to be here with you. I don't have a lot of things to add what Fabio mentioned. The point is, the balance sheet is out there. No surprise, the company is still working to reduce costs. I think we manage very well the cost reduction for these nine months of 08'. We are going to continue to work to reduce more of our costs. Of course right now we have in our favor the Real depreciation which is very good for us because our expenditure or our cost is, in Real is denominated. If we had the year of 08' ending in September, I think we should be very happy because we reached all the records, the results, the earnings is busier than last year, already. We work very hard to have all the finance for our projects, and we have all the needs that &#x2013; we have all the money that we needed to continue to finish our project. I think this is the major step that we are going to have next year is to finalize all the projects that we have already started. Of course, the ramp up of those projects will be according to the market conditions.</p>
          <p>Second, to start new projects, of course we have the ability to choose the best timing to do that, and we work carefully to push more investments ahead. Of course we are concerned about the oversupply of different materials in the market right now, and we will be very, very careful to add more volume in the market. So I don't have any additional comments to do, just say that no surprise, the results are good. The year of '08 is very, very sound for us. We are in a very good situation right now and we have all the options open for us. If we wanted to speed up the investments, we can do, we have money, and we have credit lines to do that. If we wanted to slow down one little bit we can do that. If we wanted to continue to analyze possible acquisitions, we have the ability to do that. This is not our priority. As I'm always &#x2013; I am saying this kind of thing, this is not our priority. But certainly in the future we are going to see a lot of depreciated assets that we can analyze if it fits to our strategy or not. If it fits, if it adds value to &#x2013; for our shareholders, we are ready to move.</p>
          <p>The point is we are in a very good situation to face the challenged world that we have in front of us. For the future, what I can say, let's be quiet for a while. We are not pressed or we are not forced to sell our products at any price. Of course some of our competitors are selling at a very low price right now. This is the adjustment that the market is forcing those guys to do that. We are in a very good situation. We can hold a little bit, we can wait a little bit to clarify the situation, to clarify how deep is going to be the recession. There is no doubt that we are going to have at least for the next six, seven, ten months, a very deep recession. But we don't know how long this is going to take to rebound. That's it. I think we don't have anything else to say. Just to answer your questions, if you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Mr. Rodolfo De Angele with JP Morgan.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just my question is about iron ore. Could you just be a little bit more specific as to what do you expect to see in terms of volumes for the next quarters and beginning of our next year? Are you already getting the sense that volumes are down by any percentage terms, any light that you could give us on what is the situation on the iron ore side, would be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rodolfo, to make any comment right now is danger. What we can say is that in September, we shipped all our production without any problem, including China. October, I think we are on budget or maybe a little bit lower in terms of volume. For November, I feel that we are going to face really a crunch in the market but will not be a disaster and, of course, we have the ability to reduce production in some mines that we are not very competitive.</p>
          <p>For next year, I feel, my feeling is that we're going to see at least more three months or four months very, very complicated. After all, I think we are going to rebound. What is causing that is because in the first half of '08, Chinese and some of other estemios they bought a lot of stock. They bought a lot of material and if you go to China, you see mountains, mountains and mountains of iron ore that it has been consuming. I think it is going to take more two or three months to normalize or to have an leveling in terms of demands and supply. But I can tell you, it's really hard to see the next six months. At least I should say that we are prepared to face these next three months &#x2013; very complicated.</p>
          <p>This is the situation right now in the market. There is a stocking process going on. We needed to wait a little bit to see where is the real demand. Some of our clients are cutting production right now. This is a worldwide situation right now. Everybody is little bit scared about the lack of demand but it's not going to take so long to reverse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Jos&#xE9;, thank you. I will save my follow-up questions for later. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Marcelo Aguiar with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi gentlemen. Congratulations on solid results, definitely a new world. Can you comment a little bit, I mean according to our calculation here in the back of your results, I mean, your iron ore cost increased, if I am not wrong, 17% quarter-on-quarter. Can you elaborate about this cost increase and what we could expect in terms of cash costs for iron ore in the following quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Marcelo. I think one of the major drivers was energy costs. It increased this month and also the demurrage. We had a very tight shipment program in the September as part of this whole <mark type="inaudible" />. So, September was business as usual. So, we faced some demurrage costs. And the effect of the exchange rate, the acceleration of the depreciation took place only the last few weeks of September.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the average exchange rate for the third quarter, it's almost the same as the second quarter, 166, 167 respectively. So there was no effect there. So moving forward, if exchange rate remained as it is currently, we should expect, all things remaining the same, reduction in costs associated with the exchange rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. I'm going to get back to the queue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me. Our next question comes from Mr. Jorge Beristain with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, Fabio. I guess, my question is, could you give us more color as to what is happening on the ground in China? We are all aware that China has a massive amount of self supply and given where spot market transactions are being recorded currently in the 65 to $70 range, can you comment if your -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>your clients are now starting to feel the pinch of some of their suppliers essentially going out of business or ceasing to supply product at these price points?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jorge what's happening today is that, as you pointed out, spot prices are below the benchmark prices. Considering what was your comment that there are a lot of inventories out there. They are trying to &#x2013; and inventories that were bought, let's say, were built with a freight cost of $100 per ton and in a different situation.</p>
          <p>So there's a difficult time there because not only prices came down, but liquidity is no longer there. So &#x2013; and freight costs are now at $12 per ton or even $10 per ton. So this made &#x2013; and this of course is a result of our major decelerations to production. There has been cut in production of steel and in some cases up to 30% in steel production cuts. So demand for raw materials declined sharply.</p>
          <p>Considering these adjustments for the situation that's out there, a lot of inventories and a lot of downward pressure considering the credit crunch, and they very slow down of the demand associated with all the elements that we commented there.</p>
          <p>So the scenario that we see in this fourth quarter, there is strong deceleration of the Chinese demand and that should of course affect our shipments that Jos&#xE9; also indicated. We are below budget in October. In November we have a difficult month, although, again we have a very strong position, but we will have a very difficult November and maybe even December.</p>
          <p>So this deceleration of course is concrete and the Chinese government is also observing that and trying to figure out ways to foster more growth given that this deceleration is not in the intensity, maybe, they would be expecting considering all of the elements of the Chinese economic and social development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And my second question if I may is maybe more directed to Roger, but frankly I was a little surprised that in the environment that we're in, Vale came out with an increase of about 30% on its planned CapEx budget to around 14 billion. And I would just like to understand what the real sensitivities are there to the actual slowdown that we're actually now living. In other words, how concrete you believe that $14 billion budget to be and at what point could we start to see signs that perhaps Vale may push back some of these projects or rein in that growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, certainly the $14 billion investment for next year right now is concrete. Of course we have the possibility to slow down a little bit and delay the start of the implementation of some of those projects. The point is we haven't been investing in a very strong bet and we needed to finalize some of the biggest investments that we are implementing right now including Goro, including On&#xE7;a Puma, includes some of iron ore projects and pelletizing plants like <mark type="inaudible" />. So we are going to finish everything. In terms of ramp-up of those new investments, those new production plants or mines, of course we are accommodated according to the market</p>
          <p>For the beginning of some projects of course we are going to analyze next year. I should say that all the investments that we have right now in our pipeline are very efficient, are very good. Even if we compare to the current market capitalization of some of our competitors, I think those investments are in a better situation than old assets, so they are very good assets.</p>
          <p>Just to give an idea, I feel that the project in Peru that we started three or four months ago, we are going to push these investments there. These are phosphate mine and the market is still very good. We wanted to increase our presence in this market in fertilizers or material for fertilizers. So we are going to keep investing in these projects. Most of these projects, I think I feel that we needed to increase our presence in coal business, so we are going to go ahead with these projects. If we analyze the Caraj&#xE1;s iron ore project, it's going to take like three or four years to finish the project, maybe we can finish the project in five years or in six years. But it's very important for us even considering the quality of the ore and the cost of the mine. That is going to be much below than the average cost that we have today.</p>
          <p>So, if we finish these investments, we will be in a much stronger position to compete in any scenario in the market. The project in the railways &#x2013; in logistics, we needed to open capacity or to increase our capacity of transportation for the further &#x2013; for the future projects that once we wanted to implement in the Caraj&#xE1;s area. So of course in the logistic projects, we are, continue to invest. So, I should say that much &#x2013; the biggest part of the investment is concrete. Of course for 2010, we can reduce significantly the investments for the year 2010. But 2009, I feel that we are going to continue to implement all those projects.</p>

          <p>A quick comment here on taxes. Your effective tax rate was extremely low. This of course, <mark type="inaudible" />. So just wondering what happen if &#x2013; if logistic effect gained exactly, why your tax rate was so low? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. It was a combination of elements. First, in our Brazilian taxation, the effects of the monetized corrections associated exchange rate, they're not tax. This is the major element there. So we have more &#x2013; we have a lot of assets in abroad and denominated in Vale. So, there is no taxation because this is simply a changing in the currency. But it affects the result. Also, we have the contribution of the interest on shareholder's equity that we announced. We're paying now this month of October $1.6 billion, and we have deduction associated with that. We also observed a reduction in the tax rate in Indonesia, and then we reverted provisions for the income tax there. This accounted for about $154 million.</p>
          <p>Then finally, the charges associated in the devaluation of the currency over the debt denominated in U.S. dollars, this is fully deductible from the tax base. So, as there was a major depreciation of the real, there was an expenditure &#x2013; accrual expenditure there associated with this depreciation that was fully deductible from our result and this combination of elements caused our tax rate at normal &#x2013; at this abnormal low tax rate, I would say. This is something that you should not expect to happen again. It was a combination of elements that one should not extrapolate for the future, because our tax rate is about the same and should continue to be the same around, the long-term tax rate, around 20%. So this was a &#x2013; absolutely exceptional one-off result.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. So thanks for the presentation. It was very helpful and I think one best from the last two quarters. I, my question is related to iron ore. I think now it's what really matters for Vale, so, I wonder if you could help us think on how we should be looking at the iron ore market for 2009 in terms of prices? What's going to, to happen with the index that the Australians were pushing, how we should think about freight prices, about, now it seems that the, the supply and demand dynamics &#x2013; they are in favor for the steel makers. So, just if you could help us understand how we should think about iron ore prices next year? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to prefer the benchmark system. I think today there is no doubt that this is good for all the industry, because otherwise a lot of volatility in the market and in the last quarter. You are going to see that this is the best way to negotiate with our clients. Index, brings a lot of volatility and a lot of distortions, etcetera. I clearly, I don't understand why the Australians, they like the index or they like this kind of thing. It's their problem. The point is, we are continues to delivering iron ore to China, to Japan, to Korea, to Europe at the long-term contract, at the benchmark system. So, I think we are in a much better situation right now, compared to the stock market. If they are selling at the stock market I don't know, but of course they are &#x2013; they had been hurting by the price right now. From next year it's a completely new negotiation. We will be sticked to the benchmark system to have one price for iron ore. The Caraj&#xE1;s quality is going to be the benchmark again and life is definitely the same. So we don't see big change in the system. Even though, of course, we needed to adapt to the benchmark system to a new reality, because the world is completely different right now.</p>

          <p>Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, please restrict your questions to one at a time. Our next question comes from <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. My question is regarding the general philosophy of the company facing global recession. What has changed versus the prices, prices we saw in '98 and 2002 where companies were not that consolidated and the sacrifices were be of price? What are you foreseeing that is going to change this time? Maybe more adjustments in volume in order to support prices? I want to hear &#x2013; how are you preparing for that? And if you can also give us any following on this question &#x2013; any updates on your negotiations of increasing prices in China 12%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, in terms of market, I think the market today is completely different than it was 2002. First of all, all the mines have been facing up cost increase, because this is the nature &#x2013; this is the nature of the business. When you go deeper, when you increase your production, your cost goes up. So I think we don't &#x2013; it's impossible to compare 2002 with 2007, 2008. For next year there is a lot of low recession &#x2013; low efficient competitors came to the market. I think they will be the first to leave the market.</p>
          <p>A lot of dreams were sowed in the market that a lot of new material is going to reach the market that I don't believe that they will continue to push those investments ahead, because the cost of investment is very high. There is a credit crunch right now in the world and they are not prepared to realize all these investments.</p>
          <p>So, I think naturally the market is going to be adjusted. Supply and demand, we believe that in medium-term, long-term the trend is positive, it is still positive. Don't forget that at the beginning of '08, the end of '07 what we had was abnormal behavior in the market. The price went up sharply due to the exchange rate, the dollar depreciation due to the growth rate in the economy, mainly there in China, because they were finalizing their infrastructure for their Olympic Games.</p>
          <p>So, right now, I think this is not normal, this is completely abnormal, the behavior in the markets right now compared to some companies that are facing problems to price their products, because the price today is affected by liquidity crash. So, if they need money, they need to sell at any price. So, this is not sustainable either. So, for next year, let's wait a little bit, let's be quiet, let's be conservative, let's see what's going to happen.</p>
          <p>My perception is that we'll not have a sustainable oversupply in the market. This is for sure, because the cost is very high, the price &#x2013; the currency prices are below the cost, the average cost of the industry. So, a lot of low efficient producers will be completely out of the market in a &#x2013; I should say in a few months, certainly in a few months.</p>
        </plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, sorry, there is another question. The price negotiation for next year &#x2013; sorry,</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That 12% that you guys were pursuing last month?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, the 12%. Let's talk a little bit about that. First, we had, I was in Japan, in Korea, in Taiwan, in China in last May &#x2013; last April, May. And we mentioned that we set a price, we increased the price by 71% at that time and we said that if they could reach an agreement with the Australian with a price higher than our price, we would like to see something for us. And they accepted to pay a premium for the Australians and the region that we remitted, then they ask us for a quality price increase, and some companies or some clients, the major clients in Japan, in Korea, in Taiwan accepted the price. That was in July, August of '08.</p>
          <p>Right after that, the market changed completely and what is going &#x2013; what is happening today is that, the Chinese, they wanted to have the Australian price renegotiated. So they don't wanted to pay the premium that they agreed to pay a few months ago and they are refusing to accept our price right now. And of course, we are not in a hurry, because a lot of trade &#x2013; there is a lot of local mines. They need to sell their product. So, first, then next year, we're going to renegotiate the price again. We have a completely different environment. What I should say is that we are not delivering, we are not shipping iron ore without the 12% price increase.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>...iron ore and nickel. Can we expect that you're going to show some discipline to the industry, whereby &#x2013; by cutbacks and managing the supply, you can control the inventories a bit more. And being disciplined to the industrys including nickel businesses as a matter of fact that you have implied it in your presentation about On&#xE7;a Puma and on the Goro? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. In nickel market, I think we are facing the major oversupply in the market for short-term or medium term, and we are cutting production. Indonesia for example, we turn off all the power plants, the oil or the thermal power plant and we are running right now only with the hydro power plants, where the cost is much lower. So we're cutting at least 20% production there in Indonesia. In China, we are working right now with 35% of our capacity and we don't want it to increase capacity because to sell at any price is not reasonable. In Canada, we would like to keep the mines producing or operating at their maximum capacity because there, we have the lowest cost in the nickel business.</p>
          <p>So, of course, we are going to follow discipline in the market and we will not sell at any price. If it's necessary, we are going to cut production, no doubt about that. In terms of iron ore, we had at least $30 million that is completely out of our average cost. In some mines that &#x2013; the ore is not good in terms of quality and we are reducing production right now in those mines mainly here in this south system. But we are keeping production there in Caraj&#xE1;s. Of course we are not buying iron ore from third parties right now. We cancelled completely the position of those iron ore and we are reorganizing the company to face the lowest cost production possible. This is for the next three, four or five months. So we are not really pressed by that or working capital. So we can be &#x2013; we will be very disciplined.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We are discussing right now the ramp-up of On&#xE7;a Puma and Goro. Let's talk a little bit about On&#xE7;a Puma. On&#xE7;a Puma was expected to produce 7,000 tons of nickel next year and the step afterwards expected to start in March or April. We are going to postpone a little bit from March to August or September or maybe October and our expectation is to produce 4,000 tons of nickel. So we've turned on the furnaces and we will keep production at the minimum level. The same thins to Goro. Goro, we are going to turn on the furnace until the end of '08, maybe January of next year and we are going to work at the minimum production level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. On the iron ore side, you talked about significant inventories in China. How long do you think that it may take for those inventories to get depleted? You talked about, basically you had been saying in last many conference calls about your high quality iron ore basically that's beneficial for Chinese blast furnaces and you haven't talked anything on that today. In fact, that you are going to push more high quality iron ore in Chinese mills rather than the low-quality which they currently have probably on their inventories there, where you can get higher prices for iron ore in 2009, 2010 period. Is that still the philosophy or has that philosophy has changed now on the downside? Can you just talk about that, on the two factors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think the first &#x2013; the first issue is today the scrap price is $200 per ton, which is very, very, very low. And of course the steel mills they prefer to melt the scrap than iron ore. So if they are reducing production right now what they needed to do is to reduce the efficiency of their blast furnace. So they will consume more low-quality ore, but this is temporarily. I feel that in three, four months the stock or they've inventories that they have there in China will be consumed. But they needed to have of course high quality iron ore to blend. In Europe, they wanted to keep their big blast furnaces at maximum capacity, because it's not easy to shutdown big blast furnaces. So if it's working they needed to keep at maximum production, at the maximum efficiency.</p>
          <p>What we needed to do here is to see how big is going to be the adjustment in steel production, then we will have all the options open to face a new reality in this steel market. The point is in the United States the situation is not good. In Europe some of our clients are cutting production, because there is a lack of working capital, there is a lack of finance right now. So they are obliged to shut down some blast furnaces. So let's wait a little bit to accommodate to see things as in the normal situation. Of course, the level of production will be lower than it was in the first half of '08, no doubt about that. And we are going to adjust our production to this new reality.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the price &#x2013; on the pricing in 2009, 2010, of course you cannot talk about that, but you were contemplating to push high-quality iron ore and do you think that in this scenario you maybe able to get higher prices for the high-quality iron ore or you don't think that &#x2013; it is not likely now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Since declines are set to have a different price regarding to freight, I think we deserve to have a premium for the high-quality ore, no doubt about that. And we are going to be sticked to this policy. Because high-quality iron ore is good for the environment, because the CO2 emission is lower, because the consumption of energy is lower, the quality of the steel is better. So we need it and we would like to have that. Why that? Because they are starting differentiate the pricing in Australia. And right now, if we consider the current freight price, I think there is no big difference between our standard industries (53.23) and the Australian ore.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good morning Roger, good morning Fabio. Question &#x2013; the first one. Have your strategic importance of copper, aluminum, and coal changed with these down market or are those still the three most important avenues that Vale has to grow in coming years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Copper and coal is certainly a market that we would like to increase our presence. We believe that long-term is good. To implement new project is going to take like 4 years to finishing the investments. And at that time, I believe that the market is going to be much better than it is currently. In aluminum, of course the problem is energy cost and energy cost is very high. So we needed to analyze carefully.</p>
          <p>I think we have room to develop the business, but it's very intensive in capital, the return in terms of years is longer. So this is not really our priority to develop aluminum smelters only if we find out places that we can count on a cheap or very low cost energy. For alumina, I feel that we can go a little bit ahead. Of course the timing or the speed is going to be reduced. But we are not going to reduce the speed in terms of copper project implementation like Salobo. We will go at full stream ahead because it's going to take like four years to finish the project.</p>
          <p>In coal, Mozambique very, very, very competitive mine and we are going to keep the same speed that we assumed in the very beginning of the project.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. It's Andy <mark type="inaudible" /> from Marble Asset Management. Could you please give us some thoughts on the cash cost per ton? I realize that prices are falling but at the same time energy costs, fuel costs are also declining. Can you give us some idea after the real adjustment what kind of cost declines we should be expecting in Q4 versus Q3? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the major element there as you can appreciate the markets have been extremely volatile. So, we have a sharp reduction in oil prices that may or may not be translated in cost reductions here in Brazil for instance and other places in which we have operations. This is a major question mark here, at least in Brazil, where we have the bulk of our operations here.</p>
          <p>Also the exchange rates, and not only the riyal, but also the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar. This strengthening of the dollar should affect positively, all things remaining the same, the cost structure of our several operations worldwide. So, again, today to guess what would be the average exchange rate for the fourth quarter is literally a several billion dollars question. But the trend, the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, it's there and one should expect, all things remaining the same, a reduction in costs associated with that and even the exposure that we have to several different current services in our costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And <mark type="inaudible" /> there is another thing that we can add to that, is the fact that a lot of our services suppliers or equipment suppliers, they are facing some cancels in terms of orders. A lot of mines a lot of other companies they put orders in the beginning of the year and they are canceling those orders. So a lot of our suppliers are coming to us and saying, we'd like you to have the equipment right now, we'd like to hire as to do something for you, and we can give you a discount. Because they are losing work right now. So, it's too premature to say or to put guidance of cost reductions. But of course money right now is king. And, we have the money.</p>

          <p>Yes. What I would like to say is that, we like to work hard. We love work hard, and we are continuing to work harder to give or to bring the best return to our shareholders. I feel that we are going to have a lot of opportunities to cost reduction. I think we are going to have a lot of opportunities to support our clients, that is going to be necessary to do that. And our view is always long term. And I feel very comfortable to say that we're in a very strong and very good position right now to keep growing or to keep going on. Thank you very much for everybody for the audience. Bye-bye.</p>
