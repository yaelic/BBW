        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or good afternoon to everybody. Thank you for taking the time to join me on this call to discuss our first quarter 2008 results. We recorded a set of very positive results, but what is more important, these result are in line with our expectations, despite the very difficult operating environment we have around us, and despite the fact that we are in the process of completing, especially from an IT point of view, our merger.</p>
          <p>If we look at our recurring profitability, and that means excluding whatever is non-recurring and the trading &#x2013; profits from trading, you will see that the growth of our result is very strong. You will see that we've reacted to the more difficult market environment through a number of actions on the cost side and our cost reduction will be clearly higher than expected in our business plan.</p>
          <p>Now, we talk about a number of other points. But let me just say one word before we start with the presentation, that is that the results we are showing now, the net income of the first quarter differs from what the market could expect for only two reasons and both these reasons are related to the use of capital &#x2013; to the capital gains.</p>
          <p>First, the capital gains on the sale of the branches has been reduced by some price adjustments in the round of 300 million and by the goodwill we may &#x2013; we attributed to those branches in the round of 165 million. But what is more important, and this is something that already happened in the past, we have used in a very prudent way part of our capital gains for special provisions that will make our results stronger in the future. We have decided to use &#x20AC;400 million worth of provision to enable us to reduce 2,000 more &#x2013; in the round of 2,000 more people in the next future in order to make our cost profile even stronger.</p>
          <p>Page one &#x2013; and the page one is just the foreword we always have in our presentations to make clear the changes in the perimeter of the Group and in the accounting treatments we use for different items. I will not go through it.</p>
          <p>While page number two is the summery of the first quarter results. Net income is 1.7 for the reason I told you before. The 1.2 is the amount calculated excluding profits on trading and main non-recurring items. That means that if we sort of use a consistent basis to compare the first quarter 2008 and 2007, the growth of the comparable net income is in the round of 34%.</p>
          <p>Operating margin, the recurring operating margin is up 13%, that means in line with our business plan targets. Recurring revenues, recurring means without trading on profit, I will elaborate on trading on profits afterwards, we got back to a positive figure, but I will elaborate on that later.</p>
          <p>The growth of recurring revenue is in the round of 4%, while the reduction in operating cost is much stronger than what we had in our target, that is in the round of 3% for a number of reasons and actions I will describe later. In order to make the cost reduction even stronger in the next future, we have decided to use part of the capital gain to make a 400 charge already in the first quarter results and make up in such a way possible a further solidarity allowance for something in the round of 2,000 more people in the bank.</p>
          <p>Credit &#x2013; cost of credit, well in line with our business plan target, 9 basis points in the first quarter. Strong &#x2013; very strong reserve on performing loans, 2.3 billion. A stable ratio between net doubtful loans and loans lower than 1%. Liquidity remains a strength of ours, certainly a key factor for success in the market that &#x2013; where we operate. Direct customer deposits are still higher than loans to customers.</p>
          <p>Page number three. Page number three is the comparison I made before between the net income first quarter this year and first quarter last year. We extracted all the non-recurring extraordinary items and we also excluded the profit from trading in order to make those two figures as comparable as possible and the growth between the two quarter is quite evident.</p>
          <p>Page number four is the liquidity profile. In terms of balance between loans to customers and the customer deposits, as you see, customer deposits more than fund our loans to customers.</p>
          <p>Page number five. The summary of the P&amp;L, and the comparison with the same P&amp;L one year ago. I will elaborate on each line in the following pages, but let's make some few comments on this page.</p>
          <p>Interest &#x2013; net interest income grows 11.1%, this is more than 60% of our revenues and the trend is very clear. Net fees and commissions are minus 4.4%, but for the third quarter in a row, the figure is stable and when we will dwell a little bit in the figures, we will see a number of trends that are satisfactory.</p>
          <p>Obviously, profit on trading is much lower than first quarter 2007 where we reached the record figure. We had the commitment with the market to get back to a positive figure in first quarter 2008 and that achievement &#x2013; and that result have been achieved. I will give you all the details afterwards.</p>
          <p>Obviously, income from insurance business, that is the profits &#x2013; the results of our insurance company are lower than one year ago, and that is to a large extent due to the financial part of the insurance management, in line with most other competitors on the market. So the real growth, if we exclude the trading and the insurance business, the growth in terms of operating income is 4.1%.</p>
          <p>Cost, we'll analyze the detail, but what is really important is that the minus is very significant, minus 3.1%, despite the growth of a number of cost, the so-called development cost and the fact that our International Bank division has grown in terms of cost, more than 12%. So the decrease is really significant and more to come in that respect.</p>
          <p>The operating margin, if we consider the growth, the recurrent growth of operating income is up 13%. Net provisions is in line with the business plan and the make &#x2013; the income before tax in the round of 20%. Then we have all the extraordinary items and we get to the 34% I mentioned before.</p>
          <p>Page number six, the comparison between this quarter and the previous one, operating income obviously up. Operating cost was down in a very significant way, but that's the usual effect of the last quarter of the year. Operating margin, up 23.8%, and then obviously because of the very prudent policy we took in terms of provisions at the end of the year, we have a sharp decrease in terms of provisions and adjustments and income before tax is a figure that is even too much to read.</p>
          <p>Page seven, the portfolio of our revenues. If we put together the Banca dei Territori, the Retail, SMEs and Private division of the bank in Italy, our International Bank division and the Eurizon Capital and Banca Fideuram businesses, we have 85% of our revenues. We will analyze more in detail the quality of revenues of our investment &#x2013; our Corporate and Investment Bank division. And you will see that also in that division, the revenues are very much sound and very much tied to customer activities, not that much affectable by trends on the middle market.</p>
          <p>Page number eight, net interest income, the strongest item on our P&amp;L, a growth of 11.1%, a quarter-after-quarter growth. And this last quarter was the best ever recorded. All the divisions and all the segments of the Group show growth both in volumes and you see the list in the bottom left hand side of the page, very, very strong growth obviously in the ten countries of our Central Eastern European and Mediterranean area banks, but all the segments of the &#x2013; of the Group in Italy are growing at the right level. I'm saying the right level because our attention to the quality of our loan portfolio is and will remain very high. We're not pushing volumes for both risk considerations and on the other side, for keeping our very comfortable liquidity position.</p>
          <p>Page number nine, the analysis that we always make to understand how and who has increased and has contributed to increased net interest income. Between the first quarter 2008 and the first quarter 2007, interest income increased by 283 million, most of it derived from operating activities with customers and in fact, the 198 million is two-thirds of the total growth, most part coming from volumes and the rest coming from the spread. Most of the spread obviously from &#x2013; right from markdowns.</p>
          <p>Page number ten. Page number ten is net fee and commission income. As I said, for the third quarter in a row, we succeeded in keeping the total amount stable, that's the combination of stable commissions from commercial and banking activities, despite the heavy effect of the merger, I mean the alignment of our customers to the most &#x2013; to the least expensive product in each product line.</p>
          <p>At the same time, obviously, we are suffering from an almost 5% decrease in all the commissions that have to do with management dealing and consultancy services, that means portfolio management, insurance products, and placement of securities. But in that respect, we are also in line with our forecast. We believe that the asset management commissions are reaching the bottom of the U-curve. It's a long U-curve that is reaching its bottom and we believe &#x2013; we strongly believe that already in the second half of the year, the trend should reverse and in the next year, we will have to get to the results we have in mind. We have the 1 trillion worth of assets of our customers that are the largest opportunity for growth in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Page 11, profit on trading. First quarter 2007 was the record quarter and last quarter, we had a loss for the first and the only time. We committed to get back to a positive figure in the first quarter 2008 and that was done. Obviously, profit on trading will remain very low during this turmoil in the financial markets. As you know, we have squeezed in a major way our trading portfolios, almost &#x20AC;25 billion year-on-year and that's part of the risk profile we want to keep as a bank.</p>
          <p>If we look at page 12, we see the effect of the different components on the total &#x2013; on the overall results. The total, as we said before, is 25, but that comes from the combination of at least four different major components. Customer activity, stable as you see and that means that there is a component that will &#x2013; that is stable and will remain stable if not growing also in the next future. Obviously, Capital Market &amp; Merchant Banking income is lower than last year. No specific special deals have been done during the first quarter, but 40 million overall performance is a satisfactory one.</p>
          <p>On the Proprietary Trading and Treasury portfolio, we had an almost inevitable loss in terms of mark-to-market of our positions and the structured credit products devaluation are very close to the figure we estimated on the occasion of the last presentation I had with you. Mid-March when we presented the 2007 results, we estimated something in the round of 100 million for the first quarter 2008 in terms of a further devaluation and that was more or less what we got.</p>
          <p>Page number 13, the analysis, one of the main &#x2013; one of the many pages we have on with the analysis of the structured credit products portfolio, most of the pages are now in the appendixes, but we have a summary in this page and in the following one. If we look at the overall portfolio of structured credit products, we see that the total amounts are decreasing.</p>
          <p>If you look at the last two lines on the page, you see that we have sold &#x20AC;700 million worth of positions without any material loss, that's the evidence of the very prudent devaluations we had made during the last quarter. The investment &#x2013; the portfolio is 100% investment grade and more than two-thirds of it as vintages before 2005.</p>
          <p>Page 14, the details for the subprime, but you have the same kind of analysis where all the contagion area and for any category of structured credit products. As far as US subprime exposure is now 49 million with the short positions, that is with hedged position of 77, that means that we have an overall short position of &#x20AC;28 million.</p>
          <p>Page 15, here we have the answer to the question, how much involved are you in Leveraged Finance operations. We have a relatively small and very high-quality exposure and you see &#x2013; as you see on this page, it's a total of &#x20AC;3.6 billion, 80% Italy, 9 &#x2013; almost 90% senior and the percentage that still has to be syndicated when the time will come is in the round of 26%. So are absolutely in line with our policies.</p>
          <p>Page 16, operating costs, this is certainly an area of excellence. I am saying that because our people are really very good at keeping operating cost under control without reducing investments, without reducing the effort, we have to make to foster growth in the long term.</p>
          <p>As I said before, one of our divisions, the International Dank division, shows a 12% increase in operational &#x2013; in operating cost and that's because we are opening new branches and investing in the ten banks we have in Eastern Europe and in Egypt, but overall, the bank has been capable to reduce by 3% its cost; that means personnel expenses decreased by 3.6, other administrative expenses declined by 1.4, and depreciation charges decreased by 5.4%. This is only the beginning of the cost synergies that we will benefit &#x2013; we will get from the merger as you see on page &#x2013; no, page 17 is another point.</p>
          <p>Page 17 is a reminder of what this plan provides for in terms of cost reductions. The reduction of cost on average has to be minus 0.4, 2007 on 2006 was higher than that, minus 1.1 and we are starting the second year of the merger with a minus 3.1.</p>
          <p>In terms of people that have left or will leave the Group, the plan provided for 6,500 of them leaving the Group, 4,300 have already exited the Group, and there is already a written agreement for the 1,500 that will leave during 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>As I said at the beginning of the presentation, we have decided to use in the round of 400 million before tax to make a special provision and make &#x2013; and pay for the cost of the exit of something in the round of 2,000 more people in the next years. That is an agreement that is underway with the trade unions.</p>
          <p>Page 18, the way the synergies &#x2013; the cost synergies will develop during the three years of the business plan. Obviously, the largest part will come in the third year. But if we look at what we have already done in 2007 &#x2013; in the first quarter of 2008, we are more than in line with what we expected. Actually, the more we work on the merger and the integration, the more &#x2013; the bigger ideas for savings come and we expect to have significant higher cost synergies than expected in the business plan.</p>
          <p>Page 19, provision for risk and charges and adjustment to loans that the cost of risk, down 66% on net provisions for risk and charges. As you remember, practically, every quarter last year, we had some extraordinary negative element. While we are getting back to the physiological level, we had also in the business plan. The net adjustment to loans are down nine basis points on our portfolio, in line with the business plan. You might remember that in the first quarter 2007, we had an extraordinary provision for a particular kind of loans that was only in that quarter of the year.</p>
          <p>Page 20, non-performing loans, the net doubtful loans-to-loans are &#x2013; were below 1%. Gross non-performing loans and the net non-performing loans have grown in line with the loan growth portfolio of the Group.</p>
          <p>Page 21, capital ratios, we were and we wanted to be in the round of 6%. We will remain in the round of 6%, that was the decision we took several months ago. We announced to the market that we wanted to use the excess capital we had, and that was responsible for some significant EVA distraction in &#x2013; and that's the reason why we have both cash at Casse del, Carifirenze and that's why we have given for two years in a row extraordinary dividends for 2 billions every year.</p>
          <p>If we apply Basel 1 is 6%, if we apply Basel 2 standardized, not full Basel 2 that will have a much higher effect. But with the standardized approach of Basel 2 is 6.1. And we will keep in this round in the next quarters. I said and I confirm that we have identified a number of non-core assets that might be disposable in the next two years and that's the reason why I mentioned a possible further extraordinary dividend on the results of 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 22, the divisional analysis, but since we have the figures of each division, I will go directly to each one of the divisions.</p>
          <p>Page 23, Banca dei Territori, it's our Retail, SME, and Private division in Italy. Also in this case, we have to extract and to eliminate the trading on profits and making sure that the bank insurance business result if you want to get the feeling of how the division has moved from an industrial point of view. Operating income, up 2.8%; operating margin, plus 9% and the same thing for income before tax.</p>
          <p>We have good trends in terms of net interest income. Obviously, we have the main effect on commissions because that's the division where the impact on &#x2013; of current account has been the highest because of the alignment amongst customers and at the same time here, we have the main effect of the asset management shift &#x2013; of the shift of customers from asset management products to asset under administration products. But as I said, we see there is a sort of U-curve that is reaching its bottom.</p>
          <p>The Eurizon Capital on page 24 results have to be looked at in close correlation with the Banca dei Territori because Banca dei Territori is by far the most important customers of Eurizon Capital. And as you see, the company shows a good stability of results, both in terms of income and in terms of overall results.</p>
          <p>Here, we have the largest asset management company in our country. The first quarter was one of the most challenging one for the company because we bought and we merged and we integrated the Nextra assets that we bought from Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. At the same time, we had to rationalize the immense investment fund software the two companies add in &#x2013; on their accounts that has been a very complex exercise, but is now completed. The new team is onboard, is a very strong one. And now we can start working both in terms of strengthening the offer and developing a further multi-manager capacity. And that's what is even more important, establishing a very strong and more effective relationship with the network of the branches.</p>
          <p>We mentioned that we are very much committed to foster the growth of this business. We have considered also our positions that we do not consider today the most effective way to reach the goals we have in mind. So we will invest on the management of this company and we have some ideas, but no acquisition around the corner.</p>
          <p>Page 25, our Corporate and Investment Banking division, the figures of the division are very much affected by the fact that the top trading portfolio and the top trading results are included in this division. So you &#x2013; I really encourage you to look at the figures in the yellow clouds. This division is growing at a very healthy rate of 8.7% in terms of operating income; cost, very much under control; operating margin, up 16% and income before tax at 28% growth.</p>
          <p>I mentioned before the solidity of the business of this division, and if you look at the following page, page 26, you'll see that this division relies very much on the activity with the customers. The Capital Markets, Investment Banking, and Investment Banking component of its result is relatively limited, while the long-term normal activity with our mid, large corporate relations, both in Italy and abroad and with financial institutions is the bulk of their revenue pie.</p>
          <p>Page number 27 is Public Finance. Our division devoted to infrastructure finance and public bodies financing. Also in this case, we have to extract effect of the trading portfolio devaluations and we have to look at the yellow cloud figures. The division is growing at almost 20% both in terms of operating income and operating margin, 25% in terms of income before tax.</p>
          <p>Page 28. Here we have the ten universal banks we have in ten countries outside of Italy. Almost 7 million customers that are &#x2013; we are getting equipped to service in better and better ways. The growth of this division is very significant. They have been allowed to grow also in terms of cost, you see 12.2% that by pure chance is the same figure than that operating income. If we take away the profit on trading line, we see that the growth in their revenues is more than 20%, 33% the growth in operating margin and almost 25% the growth of income before tax.</p>
          <p>Page 29. Banca Fideuram is the last divisional figure we want to comment. Banca Fideuram is the leader in Italy in the sector of financial advisors. They have suffered, not surprisingly, by the reduction in asset under management that was mostly due to market price impact. At the same time, it's very important to underline that we have a net positive flow of new money, 14% up which is the best evidence of a point I always make that's about the excellent capability of Banca Fideuram to attract savings even in situations like the present one characterized by negative market performance.</p>
          <p>Page 30 is one of the many pages of the integration chapter of the presentation. I just took one of them because we went through that part of the presentation a few weeks ago when we discussed the 2007 results. But we had a very important appointment at the end of first quarter, because between the end of March and the beginning of April, we had to start practically the migration of the Intesa branches from their own old IT system to the new target system of the Group. That appointment was very successful.</p>
          <p>We have already migrated more than 400 branches and now, every weekend, a group of those branches will move to the new IT systems. But the appointment was at the beginning of this phase that, as you might remember, we last less than expected because we estimated to complete the migration of the Intesa branches at least six months in advance vis-&#xE0;-vis the business plan original target.</p>
          <p>Page 31 is not readable but was not meant to be read, it's the list of the many actions we are taking in each divisions to build the so-called engines for growth we are being &#x2013; we are building in each one of the divisions. Most of these actions that have to do with market innovations, technology, training new people, commercial strengthening, etcetera, will become fully operational before the end of the year 2008 and we rely on them for reaching the cruise speed expected by the business plan for the year 2009.</p>
          <p>Page 32 &#x2013; sorry, it's the last page, it reminds that the three years of the business plan have very different targets to achieve. 2007 was the integration year and 2008, that is the year of &#x2013; during which the drivers of growth will have to reach full operation while 2009 is the year of the cruising speed we set for the Group.</p>
          <p>Last comments are very similar to the one I made at the beginning of the presentation. We are satisfied with the Group performance. We believe even more than before that our business plan targets are feasible, difficult but feasible. We have identified additional cost reductions everywhere in the Group. We believe in the driver for growth we are building and that we are putting in place. And we strongly believe that we will have to stick to our five, four plus one strategy we always repeat. So we have to pursue a sustainable growth through very strong cost attention, risk attention, liquidity attention, and by keeping investing. Investment are continued, I mean we are building the pillars on which the growth of the Group will happen in &#x2013; is happening and will happen in these coming years.</p>
          <p>I am now available for &#x2013; to take any questions of yours and thank you for the attention.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the Q&amp;A session is open. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Thank you. First question comes from Mr. Marcello Zanardo from KBW. Mr. Zanardo, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, Mr. Passera. I have three questions. The first one is on asset quality, the second on fees, and the third on cost. On asset quality, if I take your slide on page 20, I see a 10% increase, Q1 on Q4, on the past, you &#x2013; and a 5% increase on substandard. And the loan growth in the quarter is only 1.8% up. And then you pointed out before that you are obviously looking at the risk level, the SME's loans are up by 5% and some of our competitors who just reported were mentioning that deterioration on the retail side. And if I look at provisions in Q1, you provided 34 basis points. So it will be very useful from my side to see, number one, these deterioration that we have noticed in the quarter? Where is it coming from, retail, SMEs, small business?</p>
          <p>And number two, should we expect a higher level of provisions going forward versus 34 basis point like we saw last year that as usual, Q4 not just for you, but for many banks, an increase, and especially in our deteriorating environment if this is the case or am I wrong, maybe this is just one-off and things are good as before? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>The second question is on fees, year one that you had the integration last year, your fees were affected by further simplification price. In year two, unfortunately everybody is affected. But my question here is, do you still expect that even where we are at the moment, fees can be up in 2008 and 2007? Or as I think, you are now taking some measure on the cost that you are saying fees could actually be even down or flat and therefore, I need to act on cost. So that's the second question on fees?</p>
          <p>And the third is on costs, very positive evolutions, you stressed to higher synergies expected 2,000 more people will leave the bank, given your provisions which was unexpected, and am I right in considering that our level of cost given that the revenues are below expectation that could be in the region to clearly going down 2008 to 2007 and perhaps in the same magnitude as quarter-on-quarter show 3% &#x2013; 2 to 3% down? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The two main points on asset quality, first, the new addition of non-performing assets is very much in line with what we had also last year. So I must tell you that we don't have the feeling of any major deterioration of the portfolio given our lending policy. I mean we are very strict on that and we said also on the occasion of the last presentation, we are not pushing very much the growth of volumes in a number of segments both in &#x2013; with retail customers and with SMEs in order to keep the quality of our portfolio as sound as possible. How to forecast the total cost of bad loans on our account, difficult to say but if we have a first quarter lower than 10%, we expect the year not to be far at all from the 40 basis points we had in the business plan. So far, we keep 40 basis points as the best estimate for the whole year.</p>
          <p>As far as fees, you saw in the figures that the banking part of the &#x2013; the commercial banking part of the fees are stable, will remain stable while we expect fees from asset management and services related to distribution of securities and in general asset under management and asset under administration to maybe lower a little bit during the second quarter, but then to start recovering in the second part of the year. I mentioned the U-curve that is in our opinion the best way to illustrate the trend in this area of the activity. And we strongly believe that will be the case before the end of the year. We are not waiting for it to happen anyhow and since we have identified a number of cost reduction opportunities, we decided to bring the structural level of cost down further than what we have had in the business plan. I cannot tell you because I don't want to do it now. But the 3% we have &#x2013; the 3% reduction we have in the first quarter and the further actions, the 2,000 people in particular we have already announced will make the 3% probably a reasonable target for the next quarters, but too early to say.</p>
          <p>Cost, more or less, I reply to your question, we need on cost everybody will have to support on cost. I think we are good, but we will do it before the opportunities for doing it are really available. IT system first, but internal reorganization and the effect of the AV investment we have been doing in the last &#x2013; and that we are continuing to do will make a higher cost reduction pool without creating any disarray  especially the marketing seection. But the front office component of the Group will be under a strong stress in the last &#x2013; in the next few months because these are demands of the migration from the old IT system to the new one. But we don't want to add any further...</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you &#x2013; sorry, thank you for your answer. Just one clarification, certainly in terms of Sanpaolo as one of the cleanest balance sheet in Italy, so I'm not doubting your balance sheet, especially the Sanpaolo side, but also that you sold 9 billion if I remember non-performing loans, but I mean, a 10% increase in past due, Q1 on Q4, and a 5% is substandard, I'm not saying I will annualize this but those are quite big numbers. So I am trying to understand what is happening? Can you give me a bit more color on this? Because I mean those are not small numbers on a quarterly basis, increase in gross non-performing loans. And actually your net total non-performing loans is a 6% increase, Q1 on Q4. So what is happening? Is it one-off? Is it &#x2013; should we be concerned?</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not &#x2013; we are not &#x2013; we are very careful, that's not a very different figure from the figure we had last year in the first quarter. So no, there is no color I can comment is because there is no real trend in any particular segment to be commented in a special way. So if the more or less line with the overall growth of the portfolio and the query as we always mentioned, it is the fact that &#x2013; and of the consumer crisis having  a certain segment of the SMEs are the areas we have to keep with &#x2013; under control with particular attention. But there is nothing else because there is no particular color to the figures you mentioned.</p>

          <p>Next question comes from Mr. Guglielmo Zadra from Morgan Stanley, London. Mr. Zadra, please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good evening, it's Guglielmo Zadra. I have four questions. The first is on net interest income. If we look at the progression of the NII implies a very strong cash flow generation on a yearly basis, you had loans growing by 4.5 and net interest income growing by 11%. So very strong when we compare it on a yearly basis. But if we look specifically to the first quarter, you had loans are still growing clearly but the NII more or less flat. So is this an issue of increased funding cost, is it an issue of treasury contribution or finance contribution, which has become negative? Can you just elaborate a bit more on this weak trend in the first quarter, which seems a bit different from what we could see on a yearly basis?</p>
          <p>The second is on cost, a point that you made is clearly an increased potential of the integration synergies and you've already identified this additional layoff. Just to be clear, when you speak about a material increase in cost synergies, do they &#x2013; does it involve something beyond the announced 1,700 layoff or it's just referring to that specific number?</p>
          <p>And third is on asset management strategy, you clearly mentioned that the M&amp;A doesn't seem to be the solution to the problem anymore but you still believe that in the second half, commissions can start to turn around. Can you just elaborate with us a bit more then what is the strategy, more specifically it seems to be organic which should help the Group, the product and the distribution to revamp this portion of the P&amp;L?</p>
          <p>And the fourth, just in terms of target, you have a target if I understand also on the Basel 1 or the Core Tier 1 of 6% this year excluding Fideuram listing, is that right? And if you can also give us bit of a flavor of where the listing of Fideuram in your mind is at the moment? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello.. And I am just writing down all your questions. First quarter net interest income, a number of comments. That maybe is not the most important but the fact that in terms of the numbers, number of days, the net effect of the different number of days in the two quarters accounts for about 30 million worth of a difference. The reduction of 25 billion in our prop trading portfolios certainly accounts for that. Two other important points that are a good evidence of the effectiveness of our organization is that for the first time since the merger, we have a clear increase in market shares both in terms of loans and in terms of deposits with Banca dei Territori, important &#x2013; very important point. Last point, that is more an area of opportunity for us is &#x2013; has to do with the repricing of the markups. We have done some efforts, not enough. We certainly have not yet achieved what we can achieve in the area of pricing. So we can expect something more also in terms of pricing in the second and the third quarter of the year. But the trend in net interest incomes come from the four facts I mentioned &#x2013; I just listed.</p>
          <p>Cost, we have more than what we said, the one &#x2013; the 1,700 or 2,000 people I mentioned that will leave the Group in excess of what the business plan provided for are only one of the actions that in excess of the business plan target will affect positively the cost line. Asset management; asset management will be affected by a number of actions and decisions. We have decided not to proceed with any major acquisitions for a number of reasons we already commented last time that today we confirm. We expect the trend to change in terms of overall performance of the asset management business in the second part of the year because in the first part, we have been and we will be totally busy with the acquisition of Nextra, the integration of Nextra and Eurizon Capital. At the same time, the Banca dei Territori is reorganizing itself and most of the second quarter will be devoted to the integration of the IT systems. So all these points together plus the fact that we might reach but that's very difficult to forecast. We might reach a point where the risk aversion of the retail customers with the financial markets might change because it has lasted for a long period now and we expect something to change before the end of the year. So for all these reasons, we expect the trend to change erection, let's say, well before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Last question of yours, Core Tier 1 is 6 and will remain 6 during the rest of the year, also without the listing of Fideuram. As far as the Fideuram listing is concerned, it will depend very much on the quality and the situation of the financial market. I mean no reason to force an IPO until the market is not happy about this kind of IPOs. So since we are not at all in a hurry, we will choose the right moment to do it.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, hello, Francesca Tondi from JPMorgan. Some of my questions have been answered, but I would like to just dig a little bit more in a couple of points, particularly when it come to commission, you sound very confident that the asset management will improve in the second part of the year in the following quarters, in terms of sales, in terms of commission generation. Do you see that more a result of markets having stabilized or more the result of you now having completed the large step of the integration and then sales process regaining momentum? And if you can give us a little bit of visibility, given the very significant mutual sound &#x2013; mutual fund outflow in excess of, I think, 10 billion in the Q1? What actually are the product and have you sold instead of mutual funds? Can you tell us what have you sold in terms of structured products? Or even just plain vanilla bonds issued by the bank that actually clients have been happy to buy and clearly will benefit your net interest income. So a little bit of sales, what has happened in Q1.</p>
          <p>One more clarification, the 1,750 people that will be exiting, will they exit in 2008 so we will see more cost synergies in 2008? If you could clarify that. And is actually that number of exit already included in the higher cost synergies that you have on slide 18, or are they on top? Also, one point on the value for breakdown that you have given us for your trading profits on slide 12. What is the reason for this decline in business activity with clients? And to what extent there is a lower contribution from corporate derivatives and if you can give us visibility of how much of that contribution is so derivatives without a corporate or with public sector entities, that will be great. This is all from me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. As far as commission in the second half, whenever I hear the word confident, I react because commitment and confidence are two relatives, but not very close relatives. In any case, we don't expect the trend to change because of market changes, but because &#x2013; well, not only, but especially because of the effect of the integration efforts we are making. I &#x2013; we believe that until this summer, the Banca dei Territori will be very, very much affected by the internal reorganization, by the MiFID new procedures, by the migration of the branches from the old IT system to the new one. So we will have the &#x2013; our people more free to devote to new marketing exercises only during and after the summer. So it's more internal than external-driven change in the trend.</p>
          <p>Outflow of investment bank, I strongly believe that the time for traditional investment funds just without any convocation is probably gone. The room for growth comes from a very simple portfolio management kind of product. Obviously very simple, because we are not talking about private banking that is not included obviously in the asset management and in the Eurizon Capital figures. The multi-manager investment funds and the funds of funds that have been created are the kind of answer to the need for a growing number of customers. And in that area, a quantitative management and a hedge fund &#x2013; easy to understand hedge fund might be the answer. But I will be more clear on this question of yours in the next quarterly result presentations.</p>
          <p>The further reduction in our staff, the when cannot be said now because it's still a discussion underway with the trade unions, but for sure, it will not be 2008. The effects of those further exits are not included in the synergies of page 18. As far as profit from trading, as you know corporate derivatives and derivatives in general are an absolute negligible component in our account, has never been a significant figure, not in the past and certainly not today. And the decrease &#x2013; that is not a decrease versus last quarter but a decrease versus last year in terms of customer activity is much more related to normal business activities that we have with corporate customers but not related to derivatives.</p>

Pressure on deposits will continue, but I must tell you that the defense of markdowns so far has been easier than the defense of markups, while I see, as I said before, some further room for price adjustment on the markups.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I have just a couple of questions, the first one is again on the repricing of loans. If I understood well, you said that we will see some impact of this policy already in the next quarters. And I wonder if this will allow you to keep the &#x2013; let's say, the 11% growth, the speed of growth of the first quarter or so in the remaining part of the year. And the second question is on trading income, if we strip out, I mean, the write-downs of the first quarter, it seems to me that a run rate on a quarterly basis for the trading income is in the region of 200, 250. Is this a reasonable assumption for trading income? Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As far as the first question, because of the figure I gave to your colleague a few minutes ago on the loan growth expectations, no it will be in the high one-digit figures. As far as the trading income, very difficult to say. Customer activity, we expect it to continue in the round of what we have. Very difficult to plan for Capital Markets &amp; Merchant Banking. We expect Proprietary Trading and Treasury to be back to a positive figure very soon. And the last line is something that to a large extent is gone.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. It's Riccardo Rovere, Mediobanca. I have a couple of simple questions. I just wanted to be sure I have understood correctly, did you mention that you see the possibility of distributing extra dividend in 2009? I just wanted to be sure, I understood correctly even without the listing of Fideuram, this is the first question.</p>
          <p>And the second question I have, we have read a lot on the newspapers over the past few days about statement of Mr. Tremonti. If I remember correctly, during the full-year results presentation, you gave a guidance of something like 30% tax rate, would you &#x2013; do you think this is too optimistic now?</p>
          <p>And finally the question on RWA growth, do you think the regulators will allow any capital release given what has happened over the past few months or do you think they could actually become more strict and ask for additional capital requirement to banks rather than allowing any capital release with Basel 2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm still waiting for the simple questions. If your questions were the ones you made, the first one is probably the most easy to answer. No, I said that we will be in the round of 6% Core Tier 1 at the end of 2008 even without the listing of Fideuram. I cannot make any comment on how to plan for dividends in 2010, for sure, given the amount of non-core assets we could dispose of. We could find ourself in the position to have more than 6% in terms of Core Tier 1. And in that case, if the capital requirement remain the same, there will be room for further dividends but the only thing we can say is what we said. The regulators will allow capital release should the Basel 2 or the economic capital approaches increase significantly our Core Tier 1 and Tier 1. Obviously, we don't know. We are now reasoning on the basis of present rules. What Giulio Tremonti has in his many mind is still not known to me. But I believe that keeping a 30% guidance for the time being is a reasonable thing to do. We will understand better in the next weeks, and we don't have any other piece of information for the time being.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mr. Passera. My question is related to an observation that you made in the course of the presentation relating to the fact that in '09, you might expect further capital gains to help you pay out an extraordinary dividend. So in this connection, the first question is, if there is any area of the business that you've already identified as being potentially up for a sale. Are you referring to real estate, or are you referring to other areas that you consider less strategic? And the second point is whether the 7 billion earnings target that I understand you still maintain for '09 is also include in capital gains from this disposals? And the second question that I have is, I think, you already touched upon this, but is related to Basel 2. I don't know if you can give us broadly an idea of the overall benefit from the full application of Basel 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mentioned the fact, and we wrote it in the presentation, that the amount of non-core assets will be higher than &#x2013; non-core assets that might be ready for &#x2013; might be available for sale will be higher than what we had forecasted in business -- the business plan. As you might remember in the business plan, the forecast was between 3 and 4 billion and we are not far from that figure already, and it's &#x2013; I am very much convinced that in the world where we will operate in the next years, we will be &#x2013; we will have to be very selective in the kind of activities we perform, and we will have to focus only on those businesses where we &#x2013; each of us has a clear competitive advantage or we would destroy EVA. So it's not a matter of identifying one big area to dismiss, it's more a very detailed kind of carving out in each of the activity those segments that can be better performed by others, each of the things we have in mind is not a major &#x2013; it's a major activity, but it's still too early to make any kind of a more precise description to what we have in mind, for sure. We thought it was our duty to inform the market that we might be engaged in the next two, three years in some bigger than expected asset disposal. In the &#x20AC;7 billion worth of net profit provided for in the business plan, if I remember correctly, there is a small physiological amount of capital gains but we are not referring to the further divestment I just commented earlier. Basel 2, have to say but we have estimated that the full application &#x2013; full adoption on Basel 2 would bring our Core Tier 1 at least to 6.5%.</p>

          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. I heard your comments on how cautious you have been on consumer credit and that is one of the reason why your loan loss provision has been also low in the first quarter.

          <p>The second question relate to the synergies but on the revenue synergies, your plan was targeting 320 million revenue synergies this year. The market is more difficult and while on the cost side, you keep surprising with new measures, new efforts to find out a way to reduce the cost base, I have &#x2013; no, I have no idea, that's why I am asking you what's going on on the generation of revenue synergies in this difficult market?</p>
          <p>Then the final question is not directly to your Group, but more in general, we have been surprised, at least I was surprised this morning in hearing Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole talking about a large capital increase and moreover to talk about a target Core Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, what are &#x2013; am I missing on the sustainable or, let's say, the reasonable Core Tier 1 target for a banking group given you operate in Europe, you have a different mix of pieces, but more in general, Italian banks have a much lower Core Tier 1. What am I missing if you can help given Agricole is one of your &#x2013; still one of your main shareholder? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Fin domestic is exactly where we were at the last time we discussed a point. It's an open issue. Everything is possible, but a legal discussion is underway and there is nothing else I can tell you. Neos has been a difficult company for a long period of time. I think we are restructuring it successfully. In 2007, it costed us a significant amount of money to strengthen the provisions, and now I see the restructuring getting to the results we had in mind.</p>
          <p>The revenue synergies, after one year-and-a-half from the merger is very difficult from now on to say what comes from synergies and what is normal business. Of the 4.1% growth in revenues, what is from synergies and what is from the strength of the new combined bank, it is almost impossible to say. So what I can tell you is that given our forecast in terms of revenue growth, given it will be very difficult to reach the growth rates we had in mind, we decided to increase the cost reduction in order to get to the same bottom line results. For sure, the revenue synergies will be really feasible and available only after the IT systems have been merged and only when there is only one set of products and one set of procedures and those synergies will be available. But I have to say now how to analyze in separate ways the two components.</p>
          <p>Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole capital policy, I don't want to comment. We think and we suggested it in a number of occasions to our shareholders and to the market in general that a bank like ours, 85% retail, very concentrated in low-risk countries and with a Corporate and Investment Banking activity that is, as we saw before, very much concentrated on commercial banking and safe kind of investment banking activities after a merger like the one we are implementing can justify but more than that, should be in the round of 6% Core Tier 1. We said it very clearly we decide to get to that level. We did it consistently in one-and-a-half year and we think it's the best way not to destroy EVA in the Group.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I've just got one question left and related to capital, can you just clarify what's included in the quarterly number of Core Tier 1 of 6.1%? Specifically, I like to know whether you have already computed the purchase price allocation on Carifirenze and have a rough idea if so of what the impact was? And second, whether the 6.1% includes the 30% stake in Carifirenze which at the time would have been minority capital but now you have subsequently bought it? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In the Core Tier 1 figure, you have at the end of March that is not the last part of Carifirenze that was completed in April and that accounts for something in the round of 40 basis points. Until the end of March, that part that was bought at the beginning of April was in the minority line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the PPA, did you compute it already?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The net effect of Carifirenze, the PPA of Carifirenze quarter-by-quarter &#x2013; on a quarterly basis will be in the round of 25%. And it was 15 &#x2013; I am sorry &#x2013; 15 Carifirenze and 10% Nextra. So the PPA of the two deals that have been completed in 2008 are in the round of 25 million. One other deal that has been already signed and that will enter in our Core Tier 1 only in the second quarter is the sale of AGOS for something in the round of 450 million if I remember correctly &#x2013; 10 basis points. And then -</p>
