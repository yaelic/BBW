      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I call you welcome to our teleconference today. I'm sure you have already seen the details of Henkel's performance in the first quarter of 2012 from our press release and the quarterly financial report, which we have published this morning. Therefore, I would just like to briefly report on the most important developments of the first quarter and then speak about our expectations for the full year. Obviously, Lothar and I will then be happy to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, world economic growth has lost some of its dynamism at the first quarter of 2012. Global gross domestic product increased by 2%. With the debt crisis in Europe and particularly the worsening situation in some Southern European countries adversely affecting &#x2013; well, affected the developments and also, slowing growth in Asia also had a negative impact. Again, in the first quarter of 2012, it was the industrial sector that generated the strong growth momentum for the world economy with expansion amounting to a good 4%. So, industrial output increased at twice the rate of private consumption, which grew by around 2%.</p>
          <p>The first quarter of 2012, therefore, was characterized by a high degree of economic uncertainties. The debt crisis in Europe makes it more difficult to assess how the situation is likely to develop going forward. The situation in the Middle East also remains a cause for concern, and further challenges during Q1 included the higher raw material prices, coupled with price volatility with respect to certain raw materials. In addition, the marketing environment, in which all of our business sectors operate continued to be characterized by a high degree of competitive intensity.</p>
          <p>So we have to reckon with changes and unplannable events becoming even more frequent than has been the case in the past. Therefore, we will maintain a reference to adapt our structures and processes so that we can respond more quickly and flexibly to changes in the markets.</p>
          <p>Henkel has already made great progress in this regard. This also demonstrated by our solid business finance of the first quarter 2012, which I would like now to explain to you in detail.</p>
          <p>Our sales rose by 4.8% to slightly over &#x20AC;4 billion. In organic trends, that is to say, adjusted for foreign exchange impacts and acquisitions divestment, sales grew by 4.7%. Our organic growth was therefore more than double the rate of world economic expansion and at the upper end of the target corridor of 3% to 5%, identified for us for the current year.</p>
          <p>So all three of our business sectors contributed to this development, with the growth in the private consumption having a positive effect on our consumer goods businesses and the stronger increase in Industrial Production benefited our Adhesive Technologies business sector.</p>
          <p>The above-average growth dynamics of our emerging markets continued unabated with the associated share of sales increasing versus the prior year quarter by 1 percentage point to 41%.</p>
          <p>Operating profit, adjusted for one-time charges, one-time gains and restructuring charges, substantially improved by 16.6% to &#x20AC;551 million. And adjusted return on sales also increased insignificantly by 1.3 percentage points to 13.7%. All of our business sectors contributed to this development with, for the first time, each achieving an adjusted EBIT margin in excess of 14%.</p>
          <p>Aside from the increase in our prices, which we were able to implement on the back of our strong brands and innovations in all our business sectors, our ongoing actions measures aligned to increasing efficiency and flexibility, all these made a contribution to this solid outcome.</p>
          <p>Operating profits rose by about a quarter, reaching &#x20AC;538 million compared to &#x20AC;430 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted net income for the quarter increased by more than 20% to &#x20AC;386 million (sic) [&#x20AC;377 million] (5:09) and adjusted earnings per preferred share rose from &#x20AC;0.73 to &#x20AC;0.87. That is an improvement of almost 20%.</p>
          <p>And at the end of the first quarter, net debt amounted to around &#x20AC;1.16 billion and that again puts it more than &#x20AC;200 million below the level we had at the end of 2011. Indeed, in the last 12 months, we have managed to reduce our net debt by around 40%. This development, once again, underlines the solid financial policy Henkel has been successfully pursuing for many years now, and confirms our financial plan. Closely associated with the success, of course, is our CFO, Lothar Steinebach. As you know, Mr. Steinebach will be retiring at the end of June after more than 30 years with Henkel and a good nine years as our CFO.</p>
          <p>Major acquisitions such as Dial and National Starch were made on his watch. And we also enjoyed great success in the placement of a number of bonds in the financial market. In all such undertakings, Lothar Steinebach was and remains a constant guarantor of sound finances at Henkel. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to express my great thanks to Mr. Steinebach for the many years of exceptionally successful work on Henkel's behalf.</p>
          <p>But Carsten Knobel, a successor from within our internal management circle, will assume the position of CFO from July. Carsten, Mr. Knobel, is a recognized financial expert and brings with him many years of experience gained at various positions within the company. This succession provides further evidence of our successful personnel development, enabling us to fill in vacant managerial positions, mainly internally. In this way, we are able to ensure a high degree of continuity and competence within the company.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to come to the outlook for the full 2012 financial year. We continue to expect to generate organic sales growth of between 3% and 5% in fiscal 2012. We want our consumer goods businesses to continue their positive growth trend with sales expected to expand in the low single-digit percentage range.</p>
          <p>For the Adhesives Technologies business sector, we expect sales to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range. We expect adjusted return on sales to increase to 14%, and we expect to improve adjusted earnings per preferred share by at least 10%. In other words, we are very confident of this year achieving the financial targets for 2012 as announced in 2008.</p>
          <p>Needless to say, we cannot take this for granted. The economic environment remains challenging. In addition to the intense level of competition and high raw material prices, the debt crisis in Eurozone is bringing additional uncertainty to the market. Developments in Southern Europe, in particular, will continue to demand every attention in the next few months. We further anticipate the conditions underlying our markets to change quickly and unexpectedly.</p>
          <p>So, given this trend, it remains vital that we keep all of our options open in order to be able to respond flexibly to economic development affecting our markets. Our aim is to further deduct our existing structures and work processes to drive forward innovation and to become generally faster and more efficient. We remain firmly focused on our strategic priorities and are confident of being able to achieve our 2012 targets.</p>
          <p>So, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your kind attention and listening to us. Lothar Steinebach and myself will now be available to you for questions. Thank you very much.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Now you have the opportunity to ask your questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question by Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Matthias Verardi of Reuters (9:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Mr. Rorsted, Mr. Steinebach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to you, too.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a brief question. We have pointed to the situation in Southern Europe, and I might be interested more in Greece. Are there any preparations you have started for instance, that &#x2013; for instance, Greece may default and leave the Eurozone? Will that be reflected also in the turnover figures and the sales figures in 2012?</p>
          <p>The second thing I should like to raise, and I'm interested to hear about, you had kind of an astounding start into the year 2012, no surprise, and that <mark type="ph" /> was reflected (10:35) in the first quarter that you expect this to continue throughout the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for this kind question. I will take the second question, and Mr. Steinebach will then address the question relative to Greece. What we've seen here, we still have a guidance of about 3% to 5% and a margin increase of 14%, and we adjust at 13.7% currently. So, we have started quite well into the year. But I would like to point out one thing. That is we have to look at the favorable conditions especially in the Europe, which is so difficult to handle and to manage. And I believe we'll continue certainly with our guidance. There'll be no changes made about this for 2012. We think the volatilities, of course, are very difficult to assess, how they will come about in the market.</p>
          <p>When we look at France and Greece and this situation, the upcoming elections in the Middle East, and we expect some unrest, and I think that any forecast that we did so far, they will be as relevant for the future. And if there is abnormal level, we will have to change the overall approach. I hope that answered your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. Steinebach, no one can hear you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you hear me now? All right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, we cannot hear you. The line broke down, apparently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I will try to give an answer concerning Greece. We do not have any factories within Greece. It's about 0.6% of our total sales of <mark type="ph" /> Tango (12:28). So, it's very low down, and we estimate not to be relevant. Consequences in Greece will be around the margin as we assess it today when we look at the overall situation. But the consequences we have to reckon with, which <mark type="ph" /> will retrieve (12:43) that follow-up on this, if there is a default of Greece and Greek throughout the Eurozone. But Greece has, by itself, definitely had not great an impact and causing major changes. There, of course, there will be some adaptation that will be negative in order to respond to the situation. But it will not have &#x2013; not negative in any effect on the total sales figures. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (13:11).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. My question. What about this jump of the return on sales? Why was it so high in the first quarter in North America? What was the decisive factor for improvement? And on the capital, and you have reduced also the net debt and that is done <mark type="ph" /> very well (13:42). Isn't that too comfortable a figure because you're going on along according to your guidance, and what about the capital outlay and so on? And what do you think about, perhaps, for instance, buying back some shares, any other plans you have? Or for instance, doing some more acquisitions in the future? Do you have any plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have different locations, 17 locations. Can you hear me properly? I hope so. Well, this jump in our return on sales in North America, that was triggered by the fact that within consumer business is with &#x2013; that is Laundry Detergents and Cosmetics and Toiletries. We have brought about clear improvement, reaching better profitability. Remember, we have communicated this last year that we first had a growth problem first and a sales problem which we had to juggle. And we had also had positive results achieved for that in last year, achieving positive growth. But in terms of profitability, we were not &#x2013; did not make that much progress last year.</p>
          <p>Concerning to the situation worldwide and what we expected also for the North American market, we took that gem. So we have still a very strong growth, especially in Adhesive Technologies and their business. In addition, there'll be a high clear increase also across the business and the two consumer goods businesses. That is accountable for the positive results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How did you achieve this? Were there cost actions were taken?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, any actions were taken. Well, first of all, we have to looked into an increase of our sales and also to boost our profitability. And last year, we added investment to increase our sales correspondingly to the sustainability of <mark type="ph" /> loss to fill (15:35) hours. And it did not have to repeat this year. It was just an ongoing process, which was launched last year and which then developed into the first quarter of this year. And therefore, we have this good jump because of the higher volumes, for instance, which we sold in the North American market. That is reflected by this figure.</p>
          <p>You have to &#x2013; I've noticed quite rightly that we're getting stronger and better as a brand, because we have exercised a great cost discipline and cost control in the recent years, especially this last three years, so that's our own <mark type="ph" /> capture (16:13) indeed. It's not affected. And this is not really a matter of concern, I think. We just want to be on the safe side, because we are living through very hard and tough times, extremely challenging that was of raised by the speakers, what concerns please how to &#x2013; with the situation with Greece continue to be &#x2013; there are so many uncertainties that also exist in other regions, not only in Southern Europe.</p>
          <p>When you look at North America, for instance, you will realize that North America does have really high debt. So, we have worldwide the situation, which is characterized by the fact that the strong growth rates of the past are not safe for the time being, cannot be expected to &#x2013; and what will be the economic development? What will be adverse consequences and effects that come out of this? This is completely unclear. So, we think it would be unwise, for instance to &#x2013; for instance, rush ahead. And I think we should rather wait for some stabilization of the volatilities of markets to respond to this flexibly and more easily.</p>
          <p>Now, what are the precautionary actions we need to take? We don't want to throw them overboard and would be quite wrong for us to do that. We have taken such precautions and for this year's very actions you have suggested will be precluded by myself. We will keep our finances as strong as possible even to be able to respond to anything that's not been expected and anticipated.</p>
          <p>What the situation will be next year in terms of spendings, possible spendings, potential spendings, that would be a different situation. Remember, when we look back on the year 2012 in November, we will have a rigorous outlook concerning the whole year's growth, what we extrapolate into the future into 2013. And that will be revealed much more clearly at the beginning of 2013 to arrive at more conclusion and more solution and valuations. On that, this is the situation we see it for the time being, for this year. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Vorkar Darnish, DPA (18:22).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning to everyone. Mr. Rorsted, you underlined the fact that you see it your constant task to improve your structures. Are there any concrete ideas you have identified? Do you have any potential in terms of savings volumes that you are envisioning?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that is a constant job, to adjust these structures and to adjust this, and therefore, always address this subject for many years, four years. It is the manufacturing footprint to put it there, where you have the demand to change, then about changes, modifications in our structures, especially in the emerging markets. That to strengthen our top brands, the expansion of shared services. That has been expanded, very targeted &#x2013; in a targeted way throughout this last two years, concerned <mark type="ph" /> about this level (19:25) in Manila and Mexico, where there were our service center. There were a number of actions taken, but I don't think that to be &#x2013; we know exactly what we did four years ago. We did not change it.</p>
          <p>We are changing, modifying ourselves successively in response to the market development and the development is in the direction of Asia. The Asian markets are interesting. So, we have now a presence of 41%. It used to be 34% four years ago. And they're more than 50% of our employees in the Asian market. So, we adjusted to these conditions of the global market, and that is something which we need respond to concerning our capacities, our factories and our head count and so on. So, this is a constant adjustment process to the ups and downs of the market and its development.</p>
          <p>We are also lucky that we have really kept abreast of the development of the market and responded to it very fastly and very quickly and very flexibly. But you see &#x2013; remember, one year ago, at this occasion, I pointed at our <mark type="ph" /> one figure (20:32) that we had started with our factory in China and that is one of indication of the continued change within the Group, which we are going to push ahead and promote. We will not <mark type="ph" /> give yield (20:43) to anything else. We will continue this road of constant adjustment for modification.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Mr. <mark type="ph" /> Reinhard Konavesky, Rheinaparse (20:55). Next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I hope you can hear me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do hear you, yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions. You're increasing the prices more strongly than the raw cost prices are rising. So, that is an interpretation of the rising margin of myself. Does that mean that you have become the driver of innovation? What about the last quarter press conference of Mr. Steinebach? Could you comment on this Mr. Rorsted? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that Henkel will not have any major impact on the inflation and its management. Raw material prices, of course, cannot be compared just to selling prices. We have increases of raw materials last year to the tune of &#x20AC;600 million. Of course, price increases are one sort of cause for increasing one's result, financial result. But one of the decisive sources what we do here in this respect is to look at the structures and have these adjusted continuously and to be more efficient in own manufacture and production. You should not overrate the price increases. Of course, when we had a growth increase in the raw material of &#x20AC;600 million, then that needs to be compensated by our own actions. Of course, this has an effect on the prices for &#x2013; on a quarterly base, and prices continue to rise and they &#x2013; the raw material price in the first quarter of 2012 have risen and vis-&#xE0;-vis in 2011.</p>
          <p>And concerning Mr. Steinebach is going to leave and be retired by the end of June. I think at a point of time when it's been convenient and agreeable, we'll say goodbye to Mr. Steinebach and thank him very cordially for his long years of excellent work, and I will <mark type="ph" /> lead the procession (22:57) of farewell occasion and event organized for him. I think you can read it from our records what he has achieved throughout his &#x2013; for many years, Mr. Steinebach, even longer than that have rather many actions, has contributed greatly to the improvement of our structures and restructurization and adjustment processes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>There's another question by Mr. <mark type="indiscernible" /> (23:28), Dow Jones.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just a second question I would like to put in, for third quarter figures, where the sales rise was driven by price rises and volumes have stagnated. When do you ever think you will returned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. We are expecting the increases of volumes in the second quarter. The situation is that this is typical of the period that when you look at a decline in figures, you would see also that the increases where our volumes will come from and when we increase the prices that we did two years ago, we had a delay of volume increases, which were lagging behind the price increases of about two quarters. That is a normal responses in a price-sensitive market, to increase our price levels and also &#x2013; and then we have a decline in the mature markets.</p>
          <p>So, <mark type="ph" /> indeed (24:31), you'll find no increases of volumes, because volume is related to the size of population and if the size of population is not growing demographically, there will not be a greater demand in terms of volume. You can <mark type="ph" /> see also (24:44) certain collects or new ones. So, we need to be on the watch out and look after price level rises to make sure that we can respond to this overall situation much better. Remember, our growth last year was mostly volume driven. And this is at the beginning of this year, this quarter is much more price level driven. So, this is a quite balanced volume to price level ratio, which we expect to come about at the course of the year.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Make sure that the &#x2013; now what was that about? There's another question of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (25:46).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I'm interested that all the momentum you gathered in the first quarter, whether you have been able to take it over into the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (26:00), you are very familiar with us. And you know that all the momentum we have gathered in the first one will not be given at first but taken along into the second quarter. But when you look at our general guidance, and we have this margin of 14%, then we have to increase margin also in the second quarter to achieve this figure. The growth which we have is somewhere in the upper range, between 3% and 5%. This is something which we expect also in the future, what we can expect is the growth within the 3% to 5% range and the margin increase to reach those 14%. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Growth of price level rises is an enhancement expected in the mid-single digit range in the first quarter. It was slightly less lower, in the single-digit range, but for the total year, we'll still expect this, what we have communicated before and which we have forecast. In the course of the year, there will be price increases for the raw materials, in the course of this year. Mr. Rorsted also pointed to the fact that we may need to compensate this, and we cannot always have him check this in short terms. We have to extrapolate the price level increases to also cover for those price rises for the raw materials when we sell them our products. So, we need to anticipate them.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Just a brief summary, we had a good and strong and solid year despite the volatilities and the market conditions. We have almost 4.7% growth and a clear increase in our profitability to 13.7%, an increase of 1.3 percentage points. Our earnings per share is adjusted to 30% and all of our companies have effectively contributed to this. And the growth was driven again by the volatilities and the market conditions. We will still continue to adjust our structures to the market conditions. We're quite confident that we will achieve our aims for and targets for 2012. And we're in a good course  <mark type="indiscernible" /> (28:46).</p>
          <p>We'd like to thank you for your interest and your participation in today's teleconference. Now, I think as for the second half of 2012, we'll be communicated on in August of this year and the third quarter will on the 14 of November as the reporting day. Then, we will also address our strategy and our guidance beyond the 2012. To give you some information on that, I would be very pleased if we were then able to meet again by way of a teleconference. Enjoy the rest of the day and thank you for your kind interest. Goodbye.</p>
