        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much for being here this morning. We are going to begin with the presentation of the Q3 &#x2013; the results of the first nine months of the year.</p>
          <p>Ignacio Gal&#xE1;n, the Chairman of IBERDROLA has the floor.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thanks very much for being here today for this presentation. Those of you who are there physically and those of you also who are following this along through the telephone line or the webpage, as always, we'll have the normal structure. First of all, I'll talk about the highlights of the results of the first nine months of the year and then Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada will go into greater depth in the financial results. Then I will give some brief conclusions before we get into the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>Now, the results of the first nine months in 2009 show the capacity of the group to obtain positive results in an adverse environment. As we said a few months ago, in Q3, we've maintained a negative performance of the <mark type="inaudible" /> price as a result of the macroeconomic situation at global level.</p>
          <p>So today, GDP in most of the economies of the world is shrinking, and that's nothing new, of course. And also access to finance is quite complex despite the reference rates have fallen and the spreads have widened with respect to previous periods. And the currencies, dollar and the pound, are weak and has an impact on the euros, the results in euros and other currencies. This is reflected in the energy markets, but are characterized by a significant drop in demand and prices, which is something that we hadn't seen for quite a bit of time, and a lower hydro and wind in Spain and especially the United States.</p>
          <p>And during these first nine months of 2009, the demand of our major IBERDROLA markets have continued this falling trend after a 5% fall on Spain and a 3% fall in the United States. We should highlight, however, that in the last quarter, we're consulting the signs of deceleration of the fall in demand. In Spain, we are talking about demand levels similar to those in 2006 &#x2013; well, at least the figures that we've looked at in this period. So from June to December, the fall has been 1 to 2 percentage points in all markets where we are working.</p>
          <p>In this complex environment, IBERDROLA has continued focusing on the management of the aspects that we can indeed control and allows us to present data, for example, for the output which has better performance than the fall in demand of the markets. An increase in the energy volumes that have been the forward markets, especially in Spain and the UK, take advantage of the full liberalization.</p>
          <p>And also our growth strategy in renewables in the United States, thanks to the support policy of the Obama administration and its investment incentives called grants in the US. Also we are holding down operational costs, which have fallen by almost 6% in homogenous terms and a more solid balance sheet after reinforcement of capital and optimization of the structure &#x2013; the debt structure. And this has allowed us to consolidate our A rating as we had indicated in previous meetings.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about output, volumes of the company are now above 100,000 in gigawatt hours, with a fall of 1.8% and that was 3 points better than demand in the markets that we are working in. This has contributed especially to the growth in wind technology, especially in the US and UK markets, which are now &#x2013; contribute approximately 50% to IBERDROLA RENOVABLES.</p>
          <p>In terms of the development of the Spanish market, just three months ago, I talked about the opportunity of the full liberalization that could have for electric companies in Spain, a market which is more efficient, where IBERDROLA is positioned swiftly to gain decreased volatility of the pool prices swap. This is now fully visible in Q3 of 2009 where 86% of the energy has been &#x2013; is found at difference of markets of the spot &#x2013; in the spot market and the forward markets allows more efficient management of generation portfolios, in other words more predictability of results.</p>
          <p>Now, IBERDROLA has sold 100% of its output for 2009 and 50% of 2010 output at prices much higher than the pool prices as the CFO will explain.</p>
          <p>In terms of gas sales, the new situation of electric markets in Spain together with the flexibility of IBERDROLA contracts and investment made in infrastructure will allow us to efficiently allocate the amounts committed for the upcoming years. Now, we have committed 100% of the gas required for 2009 and proactively all of that committed for 2010. Also in 2011 and following, we'll have the Isle of Grain regassifying plant in the UK and this will have a capacity of 2.8 BCM. This will be a new access &#x2013; gives us new access to the British market and will reach &#x2013; ScottishPower will reach 5 million customers with that.</p>
          <p>The British affiliate is continuing to give us positive news, optimizing its circulating capital through reducing the debt of its customers, and we're proving efficiencies and we reached &#x20AC;100 million on an annual basis.</p>
          <p>Now, in the grid, the regulatory events continue forward and ScottishPower is leading our consortium, which has brought together Shell and National Grid, which is among the finalists of the bid for the CO2 capture and storage plant in Longannet. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> British government in terms of that.</p>
          <p>In terms of our regulated business in the US, we're working to reinforce the organization of the management team to front the important challenges that we have there. Among these, I would like to point out the regulatory review in New York, where we have our electricity and gas rates proposal and that will come into force in September 2010.</p>
          <p>In IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, the most important highlight is $546 million in grants received and we expect a further 13 million throughout the rest of this year. And for the upcoming years, we also foresee approximately $500 million per year in accordance with the investment that we are making in the US.</p>
          <p>Also, our company is now operating in 19 states and is working in the most attractive parts of the country in terms of remuneration. We are signing PPAs in very good conditions as we mentioned yesterday in the results for IBERDROLA RENOVABLES.</p>
          <p>In terms of the development of operational efficiency, in the first nine months 2009, we have reduced net operational cost by 5.8% in homogenous terms. I also would like to point out the contribution of three businesses, in particular. The energy business in Spain has reduced its expense by 3%, renewables has improved its cost per megawatt by 12%, and ScottishPower once again has reduced its cost, in this case, by 11% in Sterling pounds.</p>
          <p>Also referring to the management of the balance sheet during Q3 2009, we've continued to strengthen our financial structure. First of all, we have improved our debt structure through the emission of &#x20AC;2 billion at five and ten &#x2013; $2 billion in the US market, five and ten-year bonds. This more than triples our final amount and it gives us margins of 108 to 140 basis points, meaning that the five-year bond has reduced &#x2013; plus the reduced application to electricity in the United States.</p>
          <p>We have &#x20AC;2.5 billion and &#xA3;500 million in debt. We have also continued our strict control of our investment and the grants have helped us to reduce that. Also the capital gains has also allowed the group together with the divestment during these months to obtain more than &#x20AC;2.6 billion.</p>
          <p>And finally, our liquidity in September was &#x20AC;10.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, with all of this, the financial position of the group in September allows us to be in a comfortable position within the parameters corresponding to an A rating. So leverage is around 47% with improvement of almost 300 basis points obtained, thanks to an increase in equity, which is above 29.2 billion and our debt level is close to &#x20AC;26 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, the results of the first nine months of 2009 has showed a positive impact of the management that were made by the Group in this current situation. In September 2009, EBITDA of the group reaches &#x20AC;4.951 billion with an increase of close to 1%, despite, as you know, the new businesses of the group have seasonal behaviors throughout the year. Also cash flow has reached &#x20AC;3.457 billion and net profit is above &#x20AC;2 billion in only nine months, affected in comparative terms by the greater capital gains in previous years.</p>
          <p>Now, for the final part of the year, we expect the results to show acceleration. As we mentioned in July, during Q4 in Spain, the results are quite predictable, not only the regulated business, but also the liberalized business because energy in Q4 is already sold 100%, as I mentioned, and therefore we have no risk whatsoever.</p>
          <p>In terms of renewables, we expect our growth to accelerate over the next months, thanks to the increase in installed capacity and also to the load factor for Q4. Also we expect an increase in the prices as we saw in Q3.</p>
          <p>In the UK, demand in Q4 will grow by the seasonality of consumption especially in the gas business. Also, we expect an improvement in the availability of our thermal plants. Also, the results of ScottishPower continue to reflect the impact of efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>Finally, I just wanted to remind you of the comparative effects, the negative development of the assessment of the <mark type="inaudible" /> markets over raw materials in the previous quarter and that we expect to be better in next quarter. In the United States, we'll also have an increase in the demand in the winter months, and whilst we've confirmed a recovery of certain regulatory issues.</p>
          <p>And finally, in Latin America, we'll have a new hydroelectric in Brazil with the incorporation of Baguar&#xED;, which is inaugurated tomorrow by the President of Brazil. Over the next several months, we'll also have three new plants in the State of Goi&#xE1;s.</p>
          <p>So with all of that, we expect to finish the year in line with our provisions that we mentioned in the shareholders meeting, where the economic environment and the exchange rates today, we said it was difficult to make predictions, but the scenario that we looked at showed that our gross operational profit and ordinary profit could be above 2008. And currently, we ratify that and we expect EBITDA and net profit to grow by &#x2013; and operational net profit to grow between 5 and 7% by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to give the floor to Jos&#xE9; S&#xE1;inz Armada, the CFO, to talk in more detail about these figures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, President. Now, what we will do is review the most relevant aspects that have to do with the results of the first nine months of 2009. And we'll be talking about operational trends at the businesses and after that we will move on to the funding of the group.</p>
          <p>But firstly, I would like to remind you that in the results of the first nine months, we have to include the incorporation of Energy East. That was not included in the first nine months of 2008. Sales have gone up 11%, the gross margin 7.5%, and EBITDA nearly 1%. And as the President pointed out, it reaches the total for the Group &#x20AC;4,951 million, which shows the strength of our business model in an environment where they have been slumps in demand and price and with a negative impact of currency. And the increase in financial expenses mean that the net profits have fallen by 18%, but they now stand at &#x20AC;2,029 million.</p>
          <p>The 7.5% growth up to &#x20AC;7,942 million of the gross margin has been pushed by the growth of renewables and by the international business. And the sales have grown 11% and they have now reached &#x2013; have reached &#x20AC;19,786 million, including 2,319 from Energy East without corresponding 2008 and provisioning 15.5% until &#x20AC;11,570 million, of which Energy East accounts for 11% of the total. The basic margin that also covers the net effect of emission rights in the results has grown 5.8% and now stands at &#x20AC;8,154 million.</p>
          <p>The net operating costs have grown 18.8% and now stand at &#x20AC;2,637 million and this has been influenced by the incorporation of Energy East. And as was already mentioned by the President, without this impact produced by Energy East, the net operating expenses will have fallen 5.8%. The net staff expenses in Energy East have been reduced 3.3%. The national energy business shows that there has been a flat evolution.</p>
          <p>We also have 17% reduction in the staff expenses of ScottishPower, which shows the high degree of implementation of the efficiency program and reduction that will reach 11.4% once we have excluded the exchange rate out of Latin America. We can see that there has been a 22% reduction produced by efficiency improvement because there has also been activation of investment expenses and the net external services, excluding Energy East have been reduced by 8.2% and now stand at &#x20AC;1,087 million, including non-recurrent effects totaling something like &#x20AC;71 million linked to insurance coverage and others. And if you exclude these effects, the reduction would be 1.6%.</p>
          <p>And it also has to be mentioned that once we've excluded the impact that has no relationship with the business operations, the &#x20AC;252 million, in other words, the impact has taken away 114 million from EBITDA and the impact produced by the currency has taken away another &#x20AC;138 million, EBITDA would have grown 5.7%.</p>
          <p>But if we were now to review EBITDA in the different businesses and starting off with the liberalized business in Spain that includes generation, commercial and gas, it has to be pointed out that our reduction has been reduced 6.4%, but there has been an improvement in the ordinary system that falls by 12.8% because there has been an increase in the special regime, which is 18% and there has been a slump in demand of 4.8%. And the growth in hydraulic production compensates a part of the slump in nuclear power and in combined cycles.</p>
          <p>The pool price of the Spanish system has slumped and the drop has been 41%. Before it was &#x20AC;64 per megawatt hour; now it's at 38.3 and it had to be in the scope that the price that has been obtained by IBERDROLA in all the markets has only fallen 14% and now stands at &#x20AC;55 per megawatt because of the improvement of the sales mix, because as the President pointed out, most of the production is already being sold at the bilateral market in relation to the European forward prices.</p>
          <p>And the average unit cost of fuel has been reduced 21% and now stands at &#x20AC;20 per megawatt hour, which means that we have part of the positive effects of the revisions and the prices of gas contracts and there has been a slump in the price of CO2 and carbon. This average cost of fuel is a competitive advantage for IBERDROLA, which is impossible to replicate by our competition. By the end of the year, IBERDROLA has estimated, as the President pointed out, that we'll have sold 51% of electricity in 2010 at a price in excess of &#x20AC;50 per megawatt.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of the liberalized business in Spain has fallen 14% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,006 million because of the reduction in generation income, which has to do with the lower prices and the slump in demand. And this has been partially compensated by greater commercial activity. And the net operating expense shows a growth rate of 8% because of the greater commercial activity linked to the liberalization of the market.</p>
          <p>And the sales figure include &#x20AC;100 million for capacity, which has been compensated by 97 million that have to do with taxes for the reduction of CO2, which is not &#x2013; does not apply to Q3 in the year. And EBITDA of the regulated business in Spain has grown 16.9% and now stands at &#x20AC;842 million and this has improved the trends we have in the gross margins of 11.9%, thanks to the evolution of net operating expenses that have grown less than the gross margin. So this growth of the gross margin of the business up to &#x20AC;1,314 million is a reflection of the increase in the level of retribution of the regulated activities according to the Royal Decrees applicable to tariffs of 2009 to which we have the settlements from previous fiscal years of about &#x20AC;40 million.</p>
          <p>And as regards the renewable business it has to be mentioned that the operating capacity reached a growth rate of 30% and installed capacity 1,477, which is 23% more. Production has increased 24% and now has reached more than 15 gigawatts per hour with a load factor of 25%, which is slightly lower than what was reported last year.</p>
          <p>Efficiency is growing because of the cost per megawatt &#x2013; installed megawatt has grew by 12%. So PPAs are still being signed, as the President pointed out, in the United States that prices are higher than those signed previously.</p>
          <p>So as a consequence of all this and as a consequence of the agreement signed with IBERDROLA, it means that prices in the first quarter &#x2013; in the first quarter are 5% higher compared to those of the first half of the year and the gross margin grows 9.7% and now stands at &#x20AC;1,190 million and operating expenses 15% because of the international expansion of the business and because of the operating costs. And EBITDA 6%; in total, it reaches &#x20AC;814 million.</p>
          <p>The base margin of ScottishPower in local currency and excluding the mark-to-markets reaches &#x20AC;1,376 million, which means a 4% slump in &#x2013; with less production &#x2013; that is 8% less and with a slump in demand, 3%, and which has been partially compensated by higher retail tariffs compared to 2008.</p>
          <p>However, and as regards to EBITDA, and in local currency and having excluded the mark-to-markets, has seen a reduction of 1.1 only. So this has been achieved thanks to the significant improvement in operating expenses that have reduced &#x2013; been reduced by 11% because of the efficiency measures implemented after the inclusion of some non-recurrent effects in euros. And considering the impacts that are brought about by mark-to-market and because of the negative effects of currency, with a total of &#x20AC;274 million (sic) [&#x20AC;264 million] , EBITDA reaches &#x20AC;1,096 million and has fallen 20%.</p>
          <p>And by business, wholesale and retail, it's &#x20AC;577 million in local currency and excluding the mark-to-market. EBITDA &#x2013; the business EBITDA shows a slump of 7.5%. Networks were at &#x20AC;426 million. And in local currency, the business shows a growth of 4%.</p>
          <p>And the profile of the EBITDA of ScottishPower in 2009 and compared to 2008 will be in line with the natural trend of the business, and its Q3 and 4 where there will be no significant contribution. And in September 2008, they were &#xA3;130 million in the mark-to-market. And the evolution which at the end of the year, because of the slump in the markets, changed radically and instead of being very positive it turned out to be slightly negative, which explains the profile of the EBITDA of 2008. The mark-to-market has been significantly reduced in 2009. The trend will continue in the future fiscal years. So that means that the business and its evolution is mainly linked to the operating parameters.</p>
          <p>And Energy East has made a contribution of &#x20AC;338 million in relation to the EBITDA of the group under IFRS regulations. And the business has been impacted, as we've already mentioned, by the accounting adjustments because of the transfer of US GAAP to IFRS, which stands at &#x20AC;98 million in that period, which is similar to what was already in June.</p>
          <p>And the possibility of recognizing tariff assets under NIIF generates productivity and the fundamental impact that we've had since the fourth quarter of 2008, in the second quarter of 2008. But the sale prices to the end customers have dropped, whilst the cost of provisioning has not done so in the same proportion. So this difference that is known as NPC is recognized or has been recognized by the regulators in future tariffs which means that the US GAAP regulations allows to recognize in the IFRS and the IFRS doesn't rather. And the President said that the differential will be recognized in Q4 of this year.</p>
          <p>And the Energy East business, as ScottishPower and Renewables, is very seasonal too. In local currency and in US GAAP, there is 65% in the results between the first and the fourth quarter, because the climatology reduces the volume of energy sold and it also increases operating expenses because it's the most suitable moment for maintenance work to be carried out, which also reduces the margins of the second and the third quarter. And after a third quarter that has behaved as expected or, as I said, we expect Q4 will be much more positive.</p>
          <p>The EBITDA of Latin America has dropped 4.1% and now it stands at &#x20AC;645 million, which is lower than the figure we have in the gross margin of 8.4%, thanks to the positive evolution of the net operating expenses that has been reduced by 24%. Brazil provides &#x20AC;354 million to EBITDA and has dropped 9% because of the 11.8% impact in the slump of the real vis-&#xE0;-vis the euro. So the business has grown 1.4%, thanks to a slight improvement in the demand of the distributors because of the efficiency actions that compensate the negative aspects that arise from the tariff revision.</p>
          <p>And Mexico provides &#x20AC;290.5 million for the EBITDA and here we're talking about a different kind of impact because the exchange rate does improve the results in the area of Mexico. The EBITDA of non-energy and engineering had a 21% decline and now stands at &#x20AC;205 million because of the lower activity of the real estate business. And the engineering business provides most of the gross margin of the group with 47% and it's also responsible for the growth of the operating expenses.</p>
          <p>The EBIT of the group has fallen 1.4% and now stands at &#x20AC;3,270 million which is very similar to what we had in June in spite of the lower levels of growth of EBITDA. And the amortizations and provisions have grown 4.7% and now stand at &#x20AC;1,681 million. Amortizations have grown 9.4% and provisions are those that have fallen to &#x20AC;59 million, thanks to the collection management actions already mentioned by the President that have been adopted in the UK business where bad debts are much lower than expected in 2008. The figure is lower than the bad debts we had in that year, which has made it possible to reduce the recurring provisions.</p>
          <p>The total financial expenses of group have grown through &#x20AC;13.5 million (sic) [13.5%] and now stand at &#x20AC;862 million. So this is determined by the greater average balance of the debt, which is 36% more to which a contribution has been made by the cumulative tariff deficit and the debt associated to the takeover of Energy East. However, it has to be said that expenses associated to debt have already gone up 18%, thanks to the management actions that have made it possible to profit from the slump in the interest rates and we've achieved a reduction in costs from 60 to 4.5%.</p>
          <p>So profit before taxes have fallen 16.7, down to &#x20AC;2,661 million. And in September 2009, we have capital gains totaling &#x20AC;222 million, which is &#x20AC;345 million lower than the figure reported for September 2008. Net profits drop 18.2% to &#x20AC;2,029 million, which is somewhat higher than profits before taxes because of the higher rate of taxation relative to 2008. And as the President pointed out, we have to point out that the operating cash flow has grown 0.3%.</p>
          <p>And as regards the tariff deficit, and this can be seen in the balance sheet of IBERDROLA at September 2009, the sufficiently accumulated represents &#x20AC;2,365 million. And in the first nine months of 2009, &#x20AC;180 million were obtained, but the new tariff at sufficiently was generated totaling &#x20AC;1,125 million.</p>
          <p>And after the Royal Decree was published, the correction of the tariff deficit has been guaranteed for the sector. And that's what we've done by articulating securitization fund whose missions will be supported by the state. So the management body for this fund has already been selected and they are still drafting the Royal Decree that will regularize the securitization process.</p>
          <p>And the equities &#x2013; the shareholders' equity in September 2009 totaled 29,189 million and the net debt without including the tariff deficits stand at &#x20AC;26,201 million, which is 104 million lower than the figure reported in June.</p>
          <p>And then this means that leverage will stand at 47.4%, which will be one point lower to 48.4% that we had at the end of June. But if we were to include the tariff deficit, debt reaches &#x20AC;29,651 million and leverage now stands at 50.4%. And the data of September guarantee that the leverage objective will be achieved that was established when the fiscal year was closed.</p>
          <p>And this positive trend in debt and the improvement in the cash flow that we expect for the fourth quarter make us think very positively. And we hope that by the end of 2009, we'll be able to achieve our objectives in terms of financial ratios. FFO in excess of 90%, FFO <mark type="inaudible" /> to interest will be 4.5 times greater and RCF vis-&#xE0;-vis the net debt in excess of 12.5% and leverage will be below 48%.</p>
          <p>And regards the breakdown of debt based on the funding sources, we have maintained a suitable diversification and we've increased the weight of the financial debt in capital markets. So this means that the debt of the company will be reduced in the next month.</p>
          <p>And as regards the structured debt by currencies, as we pointed out, that our coverage and management policy tries to establish a compatibility in the percentage of debt in order to reduce the balance sheet leverage and also reducing the risk that currencies represent. And this means that our debt in euros represent 47% of the total, whereas the debt in other currencies represent 25%.</p>
          <p>As regards the structure, the debt by interest rates, we have increased the variability of the system and we now have a debt, a variable debt of about 45% and a fixed debt of about 55%. And as has been pointed out, that we have an excellent liquidity position that stands in excess of &#x20AC;10,500 million. And with this, we fully cover the needs of the year 2010.</p>
          <p>And I would like to end the analysis of the situation of the group by talking about our loans with a maturity date in excess of six years.</p>
          <p>And now the President will conclude the presentation of these results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jos&#xE9;. I think that these results show the capacity of this group to obtain positive results in any macroeconomic and energy scenario. With an environment characterized by global economic crisis, considered the most serious since the Second World War, IBERDROLA has maintained its production at levels very close to last year.</p>
          <p>Important for this has been IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, especially our work in the United States where we have trebled our production, our output in the period. Also the environmental conditions require companies to make an additional effort to control the aspects that they can control, especially optimizing efficiency. Now, aware of this, IBERDROLA has reduced its expenses by almost 6% in homogenous terms.</p>
          <p>And all this has allowed us to present EBITDA and cash flow figures which are slightly above those in the first nine months of 2008, when we were in a very, very positive situation from a financial point of view. IBERDROLA continues to improve its balance sheet structure, as our CFO said, with a leverage at 47%, the liquidity of more than &#x20AC;10.5 billion. This allows the group to be in a comfortable position within the range corresponding to our credit A credit rating.</p>
          <p>In terms of the results, we assured a good part of our output in Spain and the UK. And growth in the production of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES is another point and the good performance of ScottishPower and Energy East over the last several months of the year will allow us to accelerate our results that we trust will lead to growth of between 5 and 7% both at operational level and also in recurring net profit.</p>
          <p>Now, just to finish up, I wanted to briefly analyze the main perspectives with the available information to date and always subject to exchange rates and the prices of raw materials that we expect for 2010. First of all, the demand in September makes us &#x2013; shows us that there will be a stabilized demand in all markets. Things couldn't be worse always. In regulated business, we expect neutral or positive performance thanks to this stable situation of Spain and the impact of the regulatory reviews in the United States and the UK, which we expect to conclude during the course of the year in a very positive way.</p>
          <p>Now, with respect to liberalized business, we expect a more moderate performance. Here I want to remind you that the Group already has sold around 50% of energy for the period in Spain for next year at reasonable prices, as the CFO mentioned.</p>
          <p>In the case of IBERDROLA RENOVABLES, the trend will be towards growth, thanks to the increase in installed capacity and the expected increase of production in 20%, so the performance of prices which are pretty much assured in our main markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of operational expenses in 2010, we'll continue to delve deeper into improving efficiency in all of our businesses, as we have been over the last several years.</p>
          <p>And we also expect that our financial expenses, the trends will continue to be positive, thanks to reduction in the average cost of the debt and the improved financial position of the group. So in this connection, we maintain our positive investments in line with the cash flow generated and we'll continue to execute our divestment plan.</p>
          <p>You can rest assure that in &#x2013; all the men and women working in IBERDROLA will continue to work to maximize these results in benefit of all shareholders. Thanks very much and now we'll be very happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>We are going to begin with the Q&amp;A session. We'll be doing the same. As always, we'll have questions from the floor, then we'll go to the telephone questions and finally we'll finish up with the Web questions. First of all, are there any questions here from the room? Javier Garrido, you have the floor, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. From JP Morgan. Three questions. The first, could you specify in terms of the volumes that you indicate that are sold for 2010 in Spain? About 50%, you said of the expected output. Could you specify what output do you expect more or less just to know?</p>
          <p>And this leads me to my second question, what are your expectations with regard to national coal and the regulatory changes for national &#x2013; in other words, what output is based on that 50% volume and its assessment on the changes for the regulation of CO2 and the restriction market?</p>
          <p>The second question has to do with gas. You mentioned that, frankly, we have all the gas in 2010 sold, and this is pretty much the same question <mark type="inaudible" />. What are your expectations for output of combined cycles and what are your expectations or operational expectations of the generation market in Spain?</p>
          <p>My third question has to do with ScottishPower, both for regulated and liberalized business. Can you clarify a little bit more your expectations for 2010, given the regulatory review underway? And the draft of that regulation does show some changes in the regulated business, especially having to do with the loss of accelerated D&amp;A and basically a Scottish grid and this &#x2013; will this have an effect on revenues and what effect will that have on the regulated business? There's quite a few questions and I apologize.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last question, I will start with that because I was just last week with the President of the English regulator. I think two issues are important here. They have the news in the media and they have given us information. We have a document. I have a copy here. It's on the webpage, where they say that the UK needs 200 billion investment in the energy sector. There is also news &#x2013; we saw this in the Guardian the other day &#x2013; if the UK wants to have energy, they need some type of premium for their nuclear plants to ensure investment. So in that document, they also state that for the British, the British needs to pay an additional sum, if they want to ensure their energy supply, those &#xA3;200 billion of investment. Also news has come out from the government that for the renewable energy plan, British families would have to increase by a few tens of pounds their energy cost to be able to meet all this.</p>
          <p>Now, in other words, all of the news that we are receiving are moving &#x2013; going in the same direction. In other words, greater remuneration of energy activities in the UK or the UK will not get the investment that it needs. That's the climate right now.</p>
          <p>Now, in this climate, that's where all the regulations are developing, where we are having the discussions needed and that we think will finish up in the Q1 2010. But every &#x2013; all the indications, and you can read this in the press and all the news, are all pointing in the same direction. The UK needs a large investment and these large investments need to be made attractive in terms of return. But if not, the investments will not be made. And if they are not made, then there will be a very serious problem, given that <mark type="inaudible" /> grids and infrastructure and energy generation. They have a very complicated situation over the medium term in the UK.</p>
          <p>Now, the second issue, maybe you can respond to the first question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you all know, the fall in the demand and increase in the output of renewables have meant a fall in that thermal gap. And in 2009, this has been due to the least competitive technology and that has been coal. That's a fact. And it also appears, and again, I'm talking about the data that we have within the &#x2013; from the sector and the government, and the government has the idea that they will put part of the national coal in the load curve. And this is justified let's put it due to quality and guaranteeing supply, having as efficient, if we aim towards efficiency. So we're looking for solutions that allow us to meet these objectives, objectives pursued by the Spanish government with minimized intervention in the market on prices in general.</p>
          <p>And this is going &#x2013; we don't know where this is going to lead, but in my opinion that an increase in national coal <mark type="inaudible" /> of production of imported coal will slightly affect gas. And obviously, it could have a small influence on the final market price, which should be offset by other procedures. For example, national coal will be paid &#x2013; it will be paid in the difference between the cost and the coal &#x2013; the market coal evidence to go outside the market and we'll talk about &#x2013; we will have to cover that loss of pricing and covered by other technologies or in &#x2013; this is not closer to my opinion. And so it's my view. And so we'll need to look at &#x2013; look for the solution that will have the minimal cost for the generation &#x2013; energy generation system and it's compatible with the objectives of coal production that the government has now.</p>
          <p>Our hypothesis that we are working with are that the instance on this price will be minimal, 1 or 2 or &#x20AC;3 per megawatt hour. It's not going to affect output essentially or at least not significantly in terms of gas.</p>
          <p>And then that brings us to the next question. Given the <mark type="inaudible" /> on the output of combined cycles, then practically we have our budget where the changes in gas prices are already said in international contracts. So IBERDROLA <mark type="inaudible" /> nothing strange happens has all of its gas sold either in its own circles or in the commercial market, retail market or in a small part also in international markets. I hope with that I have answered your question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Maybe the only issue left, maybe if you could give us, talk to us about the volumes for 2010 or at least a hypothesis of that 50% sold. What kind of output you are talking about?</p>

          <p>Good morning, Jose A. Lopez from HSBC. Just a question about those 3 billion tariff deficit, can you give us a breakdown of what part of the generation was due to residential sector and SMEs and what part was from sales to professional users, which are not retail or small consumers.</p>

          <p>Good morning. My name is Victor Peiro from Caja Madrid [Caja Madrid Bolsa]. It's a very easy question that has to do with the dividends, and as I think that everybody wants to maintain our policy with a payout between 50 and 60, if I'm not mistaken. But could you tell me [inaudible] on the Board of Directors, but could you just tell us if this would be based on the ordinary profits or whether it be the other profits?</p>

      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it will be on the total net profits, which is much greater than the ordinary profits, so that it will be on the total profits.

          <p>Next question please. Okay. We have no more questions from the people sitting in the room. Let's move on to the telephone questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question comes from Mr. Pablo Cuadrado from Banc of America. Sir, please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everybody. Well, in fact, I have three questions, three very quick questions. The first one has to do with the regulated business in Spain, the distribution business, because the EBITDA has been fantastic with an increase of more than 15%. I think that there has been some settlement of something like &#x20AC;40 billion, but in any case the EBITDA is still above 10%. So could you please tell us what you think the situation is going to be like next year, now that must still have a deflation and do you think that the EBITDA should be corrected or do you think that with new investments there should be further growth?</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with what you &#x2013; <mark type="inaudible" /> relative to 2010, the President said that for next year, some investments have been contemplated. And I'd imagine that, if in the disinvested your plan you've contemplated, do you think that part of this is going to be prior to 2010?</p>
          <p>And the third question has to do with the generation segment. With the forward contracts, you have 50% for next year. And I think that at the closing date of Q1 &#x2013; of the first half of the year, it was said that in 2010 there was 40 to 45% of the production already sold and here you've been talking about 50% at the nine months closing date. So I'd like to know if you've stopped things a bit after seeing the forward forecast or perhaps could you explain what this means?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm not sure about the first half that I'm looking at Franco Mart&#xED;nez C&#xF3;rcoles' face and he looks as if he is saying 45% at the end of the first half. But in any case, this has just been ratified by Franco. But what I can say, firstly &#x2013; well, you can say, Franco, yes. But I'd just like to point that perhaps there was a confusion with the figures related to 2009, but at June we had 50% for 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to answer the first question <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, at this point in time, the distribution, the remuneration system for the distribution system is updated every year with the consumers price index and it also has to do with the demand of each company. It's also updated with the improvement of the indices of quality of service and with the reduction of losses. So this gives you a figure, a figure that can vary between 3 and 8%, for example.</p>
          <p>But in particular, what we have been asking the government for, this is a system that is temporary, but we want them to implement a definitive system. And fundamentally, it is very similar, although instead of being based on the growth of demand, what it would do is provide a remuneration for the investments of the previous year. In other words, increase the remuneration of the regulatory assets that already exists by increasing it according to the consumers price index, amortizing it. And this would be done and then you would have the new investments that were made in the previous year and this would then be remunerated with the remuneration rates which right now is currently under discussion. But I understand, however, that after taxes we'd be talking about something like between 5 to 6% and then you'd have to work out the prices or the punishments for the improvement in the quality of service or otherwise and the reduction of losses. And I think that as far as the improvement of service is concerned, we expect to receive a price because we have improved our quality ratios in that particular area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>As I wanted to clarify this confusion with the figures, perhaps the problem has to do with something from 2008 because we've been using production figures, but at that time because this had not been signed, it did not include the contract for the purchase of renewables, which is another 10 teras or perhaps it could be that or perhaps it has to do with some of the figures related to base energy. But right now, 50% that the President said refer to the total output base and non-base that we have for next year, the 65 tera that he pointed out and that's where we include the production of renewables and co-generation of the entire portfolio in Spain of the liberalized business, whether it be our own or bought through other companies of the group. Jos&#xE9;, would you like to answer?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Divestiture, as you know, they were made as a function of ratio objectives that would allow us to guarantee the fulfillment of the ratios that have been agreed with the rating agencies. And right now, we feel very comfortable with the achievement of these ratio objectives. We have the issue of grants that we did not count on, but we're going to continue with the divestitures plan according to what we've already said that we'll possibly extend the deadline and we'll probably reach 2,500 and I suppose that something will reach in 2010.</p>
          <p>Well, before moving on to the next telephone question, I have got a question from Anna Mar&#xED;a Scaglia [Credit Suisse First Boston].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would like to just get a clarification on your 2010 guidance. And can you please give us a view on ScottishPower, in particular, in generation supply business, given the contraction in spread and the low gas prices that we see there? Do you see that the results that you have been achieving in the past six months sustainable and what are your expectations?</p>
          <p>And also on Energy East, can you please try to give us an idea on what is the &#x2013; in your mind, a sustainable EBITDA level for the mid-term? Of course, you are going through this regulatory review. But it looks like that the numbers we are talking about today are lower than what was the plan at the time of the acquisition. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards to Energy East, what I can say is that right now what we are doing is we are currently revising New York. It nearly accounts for 80% of the business. So being able to predict something that is currently under revision is a very complex issue and I shouldn't even say that because I could have some kind of complication, if I were to do so. But clearly the complications we have are substantially more significant than those we've had in the past, and that's the idea that I can put across right now.</p>
          <p>But as regards ScottishPower, well, could you answer, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as far as ScottishPower is concerned, the forecast we have right now is that, as you know, we had a very strong first quarter in 2009 and which has become more and more stable because there have been some regulatory revisions. And you also know that the purchase of raw materials is something that is done with certain deadlines or according to certain deadlines, so we still have some pressure there.</p>
          <p>But what I'd say is that in 2010, the liberalized business in ScottishPower will go from less to more. In other words, the first part of the year will be weaker compared to the first part of 2009 and then we'll be able to see the second part of the year, if in the second part of the year we can recover relative to 2009. But I think that the ScottishPower curve in the liberalized business is going to be inverse to what we had in the year 2009, in the case of 2010, that is.</p>
          <p>Well, perhaps just to give you a few more details in this respect, I think that the elements that we are contemplating here is that, as I said before, demand is stable or will be growing slightly in the UK next year and we're also contemplating prices that will grow in the second part of the year, now that we have seen that the forwards of some of the raw materials are also on the rise. And then the regulated business, the expectations for the regulated business point towards an improvement, as I said before. And the sum of all of these components is what has produced this charge where the levels have been improved. Thank you very much. Antonio?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My name is Antonio L&#xF3;pez and I'm from BNP Fortis. I have a couple of questions, very quick questions for you. Firstly, your position in relation to the securitization of the deficits, do you think that this can be solved before the year is through? And the second question is related to what I said before, what we said before, are the distribution assets for sale in the UK which seem to be pretty interesting? So would you be interested in reinforcing a certain level of investments in that particular area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the first question, you can answer the first question, Pepe, if you want. And the second &#x2013; to your second question, I have to say, no, we are not interested in purchasing those assets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As regards the first question, as I already pointed out in my presentation, the management body has already been established, which is a very significant step. And we also know, because we are permanently in touch with the Ministry of Economy and with the Ministry for Industrial Affairs where lots of work is currently underway on the draft document of the Royal Decree that's going to recognize anything connected to securitization, and we are working very hard to achieve this before the end of the year. But the important thing, I think, is that we are making progress. Progress has been made at a very good pace and the authorities are providing the necessary means for this to be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>With that, there are no more questions in the room. Let's move on once again to the questions from the telephone.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have a couple of questions and all the others have already been answered. Could be please talk a little bit more about the gas market in Spain because you've been talking about having sent part of the third class gas with the new load factors you expect for the cycle, you've been talking about sending it to other countries. Could you please talk about the commercialization market in Spain and what you think about it or if the margins have dropped? And then on the other hand, you can see that the gas imports have dropped and you've been talking about sending the gas to other places, whether it's just applicable to all the stakeholders or only this market or is it something that is happening at the gas sources themselves? So could you please talk about the flexibility of the contract and what the market is like in Spain?</p>
          <p>And the other questions that I wanted to put to you, and when you talk about &#x2013; you said you've sold half of the production &#x2013; half of the production in Spain for the year &#x2013; for the following year at prices in excess of 50, but what I want to know is that to what extent does this really reflect sales that have already been made last year when the forward market was at higher levels than it stands now or is it that &#x2013; was it something that in this environment in which we have prices of 40 or less in the pool? And in the forward market, when you contract supply, is it possible to obtain a premium? So what I mean to say, is the other 50% that you are going to contract, I suppose that in the next few months, for the next year, are you going to be able to get a 5 or a 4 for the prices?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start off with the gas. Well, starting off with what has to do with supply, the market is very competitive, and that is the margins &#x2013; the sales margin for gas to end customers have been reduced and we are now moving intensely into that market. But what we have to bear in mind is that for those particular purposes, let's say that we are a new incumbent. And although we have volume already sold for the gas market that exists in Spain, we are small. So I suppose that those that are really suffering most, because of these attacks that are taking place in the market, are the big agents or the big agents that have the majority of the supplies.</p>
          <p>But from the point of view of imports, what occurs is that flexibilities are being used as much as possible. I know about our own flexibility. I don't know what the situation is like for the competition. But I suppose that the situation will be somewhat similar. So that means that the take-or-pay clauses are being reduced to minimum levels, and we, at least, are not using the make-ups nor are we using the carryforwards and other kinds of clauses. That means that we still have room to move with a small financial cost as regards using those elements that have not been necessary until now.</p>
          <p>And the wholesale contract that has allowed us to adjust our production to next year have been divided throughout the year 2009, as is notable that the work that has been done. And right now, we can't really see any greater difficulties without adjustments, the kind we've had this year. And in terms of gas, that is what I could say.</p>
          <p>But as far as sales with premium are concerned, I think that what we have to bear in mind is that the forward prices, at the end of the day what they are pointing toward is a price &#x2013; that is not the price that we're willing to pay because there are other things that have to be paid such as adjustments and modulations, complementaries, restrictions and so on and so forth. And all of those things &#x2013; all of those things, <mark type="inaudible" /> regarding the forward prices, but if we are looking at a forward price for next year that is very competitive, 44, for instance, with the other components, the price goes up to 50 on its own. But it's the best. If we were also to add other issues &#x2013; for instance, 50% of our customers, we sell and they buy other associated products that have nothing to do with electricity or gas. Well, I think that has to do with efficiency or maintenance or whatever.</p>
          <p>So all of these additional products, what they do is increase. And when you have them in your portfolio, it means that the customers are willing to pay more. And then there's a final thing that I wanted to mention and that is our percentage in energy is 20% and in contracts it's 30%. So what does this mean? It means that we have contracts with lower relative volumes, so therefore we have people that consider that quality is much more important. But are we going to carry on selling at those price levels? Yes, of course. The wholesale markets are going to produce an effect for the end customers, but we only hope that we'll be able to stand at levels that are close to 50% -- sorry, &#x20AC;50, which is what we have at this point in time.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Javier Suarez from UniCredit. Sir, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, I have a few questions. This is a follow-up to the last question on generation activity in Spain and the UK. We've seen sales prices of the company around &#x20AC;50 per megawatt hour and how does that match up with your gas and coal cost and the spreads that you see during the year for 2010?</p>
          <p>And the second question is also a follow-up after the last response. I would like to know more detail of the level of flexibility that your gas contracts have. Probably the Spanish market has an oversupply, and so if some of the gas will be funneled off to other markets, so if IBERDROLA is willing to do that, under what conditions and what will be the cost for IBERDROLA for that re-channeling of gas?</p>
          <p>And then I have a question <mark type="inaudible" /> on ScottishPower, which is a very good news. So what room do we have to further reduce cost in ScottishPower?</p>
          <p>The last question is for the CFO. I'd like to know your opinion in general about the situation of the credit markets right now, with very low interest rates. But probably &#x2013; you clearly have large spreads and restricted access to credit, so I'd like to know your opinion in general about a utility like IBERDROLA, how you should position or finance yourself over the next months or years in this environment and what will be the performance, the credit performance in the markets for the company for the upcoming months and years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the second question in terms of the flexibility, I think I did and I think Franco mentioned that in any case, if there are any further details you need, maybe Franco you could sit down together and provide further details.</p>
          <p>In terms of the spreads, I think that there was a <mark type="inaudible" /> and you can answer that. Here we showed what &#x2013; we show the cost. And in terms of the global spread, our spread is our cost minus the sales price, and the cost includes all of our generation mix in general. As the CFO said, this is a differentiating factor compared to others. And maybe you can provide greater details of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that in our view of the future, the wholesale sales are <mark type="inaudible" /> minimal, but we basically have bilateral &#x2013; long-term bilateral contracts and we're also going to sell based on the mix that we have. So as the Chairman said, for us, we would like to see &#x2013; we have a customer base that we're selling our electricity to. We have a mix &#x2013; the most competitive mix of cost within this system, probably the most competitive in Europe, I would say. So the spreads &#x2013; sorry to talk about target spreads <mark type="inaudible" /> the overview of business in Spain because the wholesale part will be very similar to the UK, <mark type="inaudible" />. This is not an issue that will have any great impact on our business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about ScottishPower, and then you can answer the next question. ScottishPower, yes, there is still room to improve. We are still in the coal &#x2013; the power plan reducing costs. We have launched another plan as well to reduce &#x2013; additionally reduce cost and look for joint synergies in the different areas of the company. We'll continue working along these lines. I'm sure that we still have important room to increase efficiency and drive down costs in ScottishPower.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, we have important structural changes taking place. And in other words, companies like ours where we're going to use the capital markets for financing, right now, we're initiating a restructuring plan and we'll continue to reduce our bank risk and we're going to look towards the capital markets over the next several days and weeks. We will make some moves in that sense.</p>
          <p>In terms of access to credit industry, this is a concern for us, but basically from the economic side. Right now, our quality is &#x2013; our credit quality is very, very important to gain access to financing. We're also seeing very restricted credit access for companies that don't have a very high credit rating. So the difference in the credit rating will be the &#x2013; absolutely vital because right now the only way to efficiently get financed is through the capital market. So we'll continue in that direction. And thanks to the decisions taken on our balance sheet, we're in a competitive position, in that sense, and we'll continue working along those same lines, reducing our dependence on the banking system.</p>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Alberto Gandolfi, UBS. Sir, you have the floor.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have several questions. First, you're not giving disclosure on the spot market, but can you tell us the change in parts for 2009/2010, the transparency was very clear, <mark type="inaudible" /> to be a fall by &#x2013; of price by &#x20AC;5 per megawatt, but what is the change of the spark spread in Spain? And also can you talk about the gross margin in the UK for ScottishPower?</p>
          <p>My second question had to do with the generation market in Spain. In my view, I see two different impacts in prices. One is the impact of the restructuring of demand through a win &#x2013; through nuclear energy <mark type="inaudible" /> greater number of hours per day. And there is another impact of the availability &#x2013; cheap &#x2013; availability of cheap gas, and so they get on the spot market. And there has to be another impact. Can you talk a little bit about what year <mark type="inaudible" /> of the year or 2010 is there going to be changes in this performance?</p>
          <p>And then another two quick questions. One had to do with the 2010 consensus which is at 7.4, 7.5 billion, are you happy with that level?</p>
          <p>And my last question, the divestitures or EBITDA in 2010, if those figures come through, what is your logic, when are you thinking you could reduce CapEx or change your dividend policy, just to make sure that you reach those objectives? What are your priorities in that connection? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about the spreads, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I didn't understand really your interest of calculating the spark spreads in Spain because we are not a generation company. Essentially <mark type="inaudible" /> generation company, those 65 teras that we are going to produce in the next year, 52 of those are not from hydro comes from water, either hydro nuclear and wind. So for us, the coal production could be around 5 or 10% of the total. So the chart spread is not that interesting.</p>
          <p>And in the case of the cycles, bearing in mind that almost 75% of the production of the cycles in addition to the restrictions and the charge &#x2013; the different remuneration charges, it's also not that significant.</p>
          <p>So my point is the average variable cost of IBERDROLA for 2009 was around &#x20AC;22 per megawatt hour. And the sales price to all markets including the spot market, the retail market was around 50 &#x2013; in the high 50s. So we are working with margins on variable costs around 30, &#x20AC;35 per megawatt hour. And that's our reality. Even &#x2013; we can even be in situations where the spark spread &#x2013; where the spark spread is zero, but with high gas cost that would give us a very competitive margin.</p>
          <p>Now, another issue, if we look at the spark spreads in the UK where as a thermal company &#x2013; thermal generation company and where the spreads are more or less constant and independent of gas or coal prices, so that's more or less &#x2013; I just wanted to make that comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Franco, could you talk about the model market, how we'll operate next year about establishing hydro and nuclear prices and so forth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The way things work is that the agents in Spain where we don't have too much liquidity in the markets and we don't have a liquid gas market, so no one is doing trading with the differentials or the spark spreads or dark spreads, but what they do is hedge their portfolio. So far things works exactly <mark type="inaudible" />. And then with the agency, when they do some trading and optimization that could give &#x20AC;1 million, &#x20AC;10 million if you do things. We are trying to compete with the pool. That's with the Russian agencies now.</p>
          <p>If we have a cheaper pool, that's not really our decision, so in terms of the market operation, of course, we've explained it very clearly and in terms of the influence of cheap gas on the Spanish market given the huge volume of combined cycles of around almost 20,000 megawatts, all &#x2013; almost all are these &#x2013; theoretically, the opportunity costs. But not everything is opportunity costs. If there is very cheap gas, then you have supply contracts. Well, those supply contracts, then they set the stage, they set &#x2013; it's not &#x2013; doesn't make sense to offer for prices &#x2013; at those gas prices which are not that accessible. So <mark type="inaudible" />, we are talking about 20,000 megawatts compared to 400 or 500 that <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>So this enormous volume of gas that has very similar price levels because the long-term contracts and their revisions bring us to very similar prices. So the prices or the margin &#x2013; marginal cost of the use of the rest, it's a use for a company like us in the global <mark type="inaudible" /> there is a very large volume of prices <mark type="inaudible" /> of megawatts. It doesn't matter that much if there is an agent that really didn't <mark type="inaudible" /> continues to build plants. It doesn't matter. It doesn't really matter if there is more or less volume that is taken off the market because the prices will be very similar <mark type="inaudible" /> even for us with our model and business strategy.</p>
          <p>Things are not &#x2013; things are going fine with lower prices. The producers like to see good prices for our products over the long-term. And over the long-term, they reflect the value of electricity generation, but over the short-term there could be slight variations. But globally, as Luis San Pedro said, <mark type="inaudible" /> and then we have our margins. So that's very independent of all those other factors.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. But could you talk a little bit about the questions on the provisions for 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think right now we're in a process, budget process for 2010 as the Chairman mentioned at the end of his presentation and this is what we see right now. And based on the budget that we will be finalizing in November and the exchange rate performance and another series of elements that cannot be managed by the group right now, then we'll start to focus our vision for EBITDA for next year.</p>
          <p>And in terms of the CapEx and so forth, I think that the group has shown in 2009 that it has been very flexible in managing its investment, also bearing in mind that we expect next year, as we said in the presentation, the side of renewables will have access to the grants. And what we are seeing now is we are going to suit our CapEx to the &#x2013; our cash flow generated in the group. As the Chairman said, we really don't see at this point any pre-need for 2010 to take other types of actions just to adjust CapEx and continue with our <mark type="inaudible" /> sometime that we announced reaching those &#x20AC;2.5 billion total for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I have three questions. First, in terms of electricity demand in Spain and the UK, I'd like to see your vision for 2010. You mentioned that probably that you've already reached the bottom of the curve, so do you expect there to be increased demand in Spain and the UK, while one other &#x2013; what is your vision there?</p>
          <p>Second question, in terms of the new plant in Brazil, what an impact will that have on EBITDA for 2010? And finally a question about goodwill of the acquisitions of ScottishPower, Energy East, can you &#x2013; how much did that goodwill &#x2013; how much of the depreciation is left to adjust the impact that that could have in accordance with the regulation of EU? Can you give me that value, so we can see how that's going to impact the regulation, the EU regulation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question in terms of demand, I think that I already answered that demand both in Spain and the UK. Our expectations are that for next year, there will be a stable situation vis-&#xE0;-vis this year or looking at the trends that we're seeing over the last several months. Maybe you could improve a little bit, but in principle the scenario that we're seeing will be stability in demand in both markets.</p>
          <p>Now, in terms of Brazil, I don't have the data, but I can say we'll be positive obviously if we put in a new plant into operation and <mark type="inaudible" /> all add up. I don't have the data right now, but as soon as I have them, I will make those available.</p>
          <p>Also in terms of goodwill, well, just the other day &#x2013; I think the goodwill, the part corresponding to the tax credit, I think in the media there was a meeting of the Spanish Ministry of Economy with the Competition Commissioner. I assume that this would not have an effect on the future. This will be for the new investors, but the investments that were already made or acquisitions that were already made with the other legislative framework, the existing one, obviously, then they won't have any effect on our accounting methods then because they were under the old framework.</p>

      </speaker>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Jose Javier Ruiz from BNP Parib&#xE1;s.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Three questions. The first, can you talk a little bit more about the capital market, if you're going to need a capital increase in your headquarters or in one of your affiliates? Also you mentioned the national coal effect with respect to other technologies, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the impact on hydro, considering what's being discussed now that national coal will be in the restricted market and IBERDROLA is quite active there and it's with its hydro. And then my third question, I'd like to know whether the &#x2013; our accounting adjustment effect will be in Q3 for Energy East?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about those accounting adjustments quickly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in the presentation, I think it was 98 million, if my memory serves &#x2013; yeah, 98.3 million, those accounting adjustments. And as the Chairman said and we've repeated, the answer is no. No, there is not going to be a capital increase and we don't expect that either in the mother company or in the affiliates, nothing of that sort whatsoever.</p>
          <p>I think here the Financial Director has stated this very clear. We have the possibility for financing our debt in the capital market instead of going to banking debt. And in the capital markets, we're getting better conditions. Then through the banks, unfortunately, given the rating that we have allows to go to those markets and to have a diversified presence in our market and our business in the UK, American markets and we can take advantage of those in those capital markets, and that's what we are doing. And we are being quite successful given the average rate that we are achieving.</p>
          <p>And I think that's very positive now in terms of national coal. I think there was a misunderstanding here, so I &#x2013; in principle, what we are talking about here, national coal is coming due to &#x2013; for security of supply, to have a strategic source of energy. This has nothing to do with other actions taken by the system operator. It has to do with the security of the system over the short term. So it's my understanding that complementary services that are providing hydro-energy right now and other sources of energy are going to remain exactly the way they are today.</p>
          <p>So we're going to apply restrictions to hydraulic production and combined cycles, which certainly do not affect whatever has to do with coal because good coal is an artifact that can be burnt, and that's it. Next question?</p>

          <p>Good morning. Very quickly, in the first half, in generations, we had some settlements of &#x20AC;60 million, have you maintained this figure in the nine months or has it been increased? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we normally &#x2013; the definitive settlements, according to the energy division, they are made three or four years after the cycle has come to a close. So we closed the fiscal years with some estimates that are normally conservative of how we understand the things that are going to be closed. But as the National Energy Commission closes a year for the resettlement, with a definitive resettlement, we adjust those that we made some time ago. And this year, they have been increased a lot in Q1. Those &#x2013; the settlements that you pointed out that we'd already noted in Q2, I can't remember the definitive figure, but I think it's something like &#x20AC;100 million, if I'm not wrong.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning again. This is an additional question. Before we spoke about dividends and this is the issue that has to be submitted to the Board, although this was some time ago, I think that it was in 2007-2009, Nat plan, there were certain expectations, although the target as regards establishing a dividend of 1.5 per share. That was before the stock &#x2013; the split was done. And I wanted to confirm that the expectations were completely canceled by the new plan that finishes in 2010. And if we were talking about 7%, and nobody was talking about any specific target in terms of the dividend for 2009?</p>
          <p>And the second question, if you would allow me, in terms of distribution, in the case of tariffs, mid-year tariffs, you were saying that the remuneration that has been established was provisional. And with the changes in demand, with the rate of inflation expected for this year, we're not talking about the new one. The next year, we have to review things. But my task &#x2013; before that, are there any risks? Do you think that at the closing date of 2009, the adjustments will have to be made in the case of these distribution revenues that have been reported until now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're talking about dividend. This, you're talking about the split which dates back many moons. But what I can say is that our dividend policy approach is the same. It will increase in proportion to the increase in the net profits and with a payout of 57 to 60%. That's our scenario. And I haven't worked out the figures because for the increases or non-increase in capital, I'm completely lost for the figures.</p>
          <p>But our dividend policy has to do with maintaining that level of payout along these lines. And because of the question we had before, of course, we pay the dividends based on the total net profits, not only based on the ordinary profits, but the net profits that are much greater than the ordinary profits because of the capital gains they're also generating.</p>
          <p>Yes, it is true that the system that was established in the early months of the year was provisional in nature. I don't know what the commission has said about this, but at least in all the conversations I've held at the ministry, it seems that there's no intention to change things.</p>
          <p>And if it is modified, we'd have a slump in demand and inflation is close to zero, which in no case would allow us to remunerate the new investments that we have had to make. So I don't think that the regulator will establish a remuneration that forgets about the real investments that have already been made. So what we are stressing really is that what we have to do is tap the new system that bases the regulatory changes on the real investments made by the company to meet supply requirements. And we, in fact, have not established any kind of provision to correct that remuneration nor do I think &#x2013; I think that no other companies have done that either.</p>
          <p>So what does that mean? It means in short that the general feeling in this business is that that remuneration is becoming definitive for those not written anywhere.</p>

          <p>Okay. We're finishing now with the telephone questions. We'll move on to the questions from the Web. The first one comes from Andrew Moulder from CreditSights asking two questions. And we said that we expect to have positive regulatory developments in the UK, but other sources say that it's going to be pretty difficult as a process and that ScottishPower would also have to resort to the Competition Commission, could we talk about that situation, please?</p>
          <p>And the second question is that we've spoken about reducing banking funding, are we going to the bond market before the end of the year?</p>
          <p>Well, I have to repeat what I said before. And that is that all the inputs we have at this point in time from the media or non-medium in the United Kingdom, what they have shown is that, if the &#x2013; in the UK they need investments totaling &#xA3;200 billion, they have to find a framework that make them attractive. But if not, those investments will not be made. And this is not what I said, it's what Ofgem has said and what Ofgem has published. So this is what we have.</p>
          <p>As far as the Competition Commission is concerned, I'm not committed with the legal system in the UK, but I suppose that it's not only a case of ScottishPower, but I know that the terms are general and applicable to all agents operating in the UK. So if any of the agents or all of the agents feel that they are not remunerating their expectations, they expected them to. I'm not sure who it will be, but I'm sure that there has to be a legal body, a perfectly structured body they can resort to. But I think at this point in time, we are very far away from all of that. I think that right now we are in a phase and a stage in which we agents have submitted our investment plans. We are now discussing things with the regulator according to these terms. The regulator will make some proposals. The proposals will be debated, so that means that in the month of March next year, we will come to the conclusions. But I expect that the inputs that are now &#x2013; can be seen in the positive &#x2013; in the UK market will become positive, generally speaking.</p>
          <p>But as regards new emissions, <mark type="inaudible" /> would you please answer that one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, of new issuance of bonds rather. Yes, we are studying this. We are looking into it, although we have not yet taken a decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you speak into the microphone please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a question from <mark type="inaudible" />. What sort of needs could we have as regards issuing bonds in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the truth is that these issues are going to be determined by whether we reduce in terms of bank debt. And I think &#x2013; in whatever reaches its maturity, we possibly will be talking about something like &#x20AC;3 billion more or less in debt issues. That's what I calculate now. Those are my estimates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the second question comes from Matija Gergolet from Goldman Sachs. And it has to do with &#x2013; do we expect to &#x2013; do we expect in divestitures in assets before the end of the year? And if so, how much? And yesterday, IBERDROLA RENOVABLES reduced its net profits whereas the group itself has increased. Have there been any unexpected development in any of the businesses that have allowed us to improve the figures in 2009? I think that we've not spoken about net profits in the case of IBERDROLA. We've spoken about operating profits. But I suppose that will depend on whether we do any disposals before the end of the year. But it's possible, although right now there are certain things that are being negotiated. San Pedro is looking into this. And if anything is materialized, well, this would obviously affect the whole issue, but that's the only thing I can say right now.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael Carlton from Santander says could we please be more specific about the financial result and those costs that are a purely related to debt and financial revenue and the losses produced by exchange rates? And the second question can we &#x2013; please provide the development of growth factors in the recent fiscal years and does this favor the combined cycle operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of the 860 million of net of financial expenses we have something like 1080, so in other words it would be 1080 which have to do with what have to do with financial expenses linked to debt. And then we would have &#x20AC;218 million that are positive impact from other chapters where we have some positive impacts in coverage and we also have a certain recognition of financial updating just because of the tariff deficits and other dividend, so on and so forth. So it's a mix, its miscellaneous which gives the total of &#x20AC;218 million. But as regard to that it would have be &#x20AC;1,084 million, which as I said goes up 18%, relative to the financial expenses associated to the 2008 debt. And the second question regarding the load factor, we don't have that information here, so we'll have to send it to you.</p>
          <p>Well, approximately and generally speaking on average combined cycles working with the load factor 30 to 35%, but what we have to distinguish between the combined cycles that are operating for many more hours than others that practically don't operate. And with regards to the contribution towards profits where they don't really make a big contribution, but there are two ideas that I would like to present to you here, that we have the first cycle with investment costs that are very low, then in other words, I think that we're talking about &#x20AC;700 per kilowatts and we have cycles of something like 300 and &#x20AC;400 per kilowatt. And with the cash flows that have been generated in the first year, we practically recovered the investment and as regards that are in operation. They are supplying the market, they also providing complementary services. They are also providing remunerations that are really having a positive effect for the result of the company and we have quite a few operations underway.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from John Honor&#xE9; from Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale that has to do with the UK. That is, what is the situation of the nuclear segment in this country and are we contemplating setting our transport and distribution grids in the UK.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we're not contemplating sales of our distribution and transportation grid. And as regard the UK and the agreements we have a consortium with Gaz de France, Scottish, Southern, and ourselves and we are renegotiating it all to purchase a location in the Northwest of England. So discussions are under way. Lots of progress has been made and unless Pedro says otherwise the issue will be concluded in the next few days. There are other proposals, but there is one that has made lots of progress and we'll finish very soon.</p>
          <p>So I think once we have the location work, we have the plot until we initiate the construction work. It's something that will have to be looked into very carefully, because it's still a very preliminary issue. And I think the first thing you need is the plot, you need that location and once you have the plot then we will look into the technical aspects and we'll take a decision, when the time comes, always in collaborations with our partners with Gaz de France, Suez, and the Scottish and Southern.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Miguel Medina from <mark type="inaudible" /> Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the first one, what do we mean to say when under the heading of energy is what do we by the CEO change, I think is it? And the second question is that in the past you included that incorporation of Garcia Mesa very positive and what do you think about the fact that he is leaving now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that Ulacia is a person that's done some wonderful work for Gamesa. And he told me and he also informed the Board that he wish to leave the company due to personal reasons. We did our utmost to retain him, but I'm afraid that he has decided to leave. So therefore the Board accepted his resignation and has been replaced by the Deputy Chair and I think that you know him perfectly well because he comes from the world of finance from the banking world. His name is Jorge Calvet and Jorge Calvet according to what he told me here today, he wants to be supported by a much more operational Director General and issues that have to do with production and commission affairs. And Ulacia I really appreciate him on the personal front and he is also wonderful professional. So therefore I think, well, that he has made up his mind and I respect that decision.</p>
          <p>Regarding the change of CEO, well, what I have to say is that within the agreement we had to takeover Energy East, there was a period stability for the team that was already in place and it's stability for them and to us. And this has disappeared and now changes are taking place and the first change will be the CEO, he will be leading the company together with some other managers who also left and they will be replaced by other people from, within and without the company. So, the whole thing has already been done. It's a fact.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And the last question for today's session comes from Kepler. Well, it's two questions. What growth do we expect for 2010 in the regulated business in Spain because of what we said before about regulatory changes and also bearing in mind the situation of the low level of inflation? And the second question is what to be expected as the cost in terms of the social benefit, social bonus for &#x2013; social premium for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that as the financial as the CFO pointed out we are still in the budgetary stage, so that means that all of these issues, once we have all the data available, we will be able to get things done, but what we have given you is an outlook. We have told you about what we think can be &#x2013; what can happen based on qualitative issues not quantitative, but as soon as we have everything in place we will have the quantitative issues ready, but perhaps you could say something about this other issue too. More than magnitude of the social bonus has been limited, 2010 discovers the 12th month of the year and this is going to depend a lot on the increase in tariff that occurs in 2010 because this is what is affecting the magnitude of the social premium. But, I don't think that in the sector it will exceed more than &#x20AC;150 million in cost for the entire sector of course.</p>
          <p>So that's it thank you all very much. I Thank you very much for coming and I would like to conclude with this. I think that in the current environment the fact that we have a company that is facing slumps and demand, the price of the factor we can present, these results and also deliver this kind of forecast is very outstanding exercise, think you are the people that I have to analyze what we have said. Thank you very much.</p>
