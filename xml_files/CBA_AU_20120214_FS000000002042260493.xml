        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you very much for coming today for the formal presentation of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia's Results for the Six Months Ending 31st of December 2011. The format today will be we'll follow our normal form. Ian Narev, our new CEO, will kick off by providing overview of the result. David Craig, who's our CFO, will then give you a little more detail around the results itself. Ian will come back for a brief overview at the end and then we'll go to questions.</p>
          <p>So without further ado, Ian, all yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Warwick. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us for this results announcement. Obviously, this is the first time I've had pleasure of doing this and I do want to acknowledge just a sense of privilege I feel doing this for the first time, which I suspect I'll feel every time I do it. And also I use the opportunity again to acknowledge from all of us here the debt of gratitude we owe to Ralph Norris for the distinguished service he provided to the Group and obviously he was the guy at the helm for the lion's share of what is a very good result. So I'm sure that wherever Ralph is looking at this from, he will take a great deal of satisfaction of the &#x2013; for the result.</p>
          <p>And to that extent, it is a reasonably good result to be able to start with although we have a problem here, because this is not working. Here we go &#x2013; no. So well, let me to get &#x2013; can somebody here have a look at this and we'll get &#x2013; we'll. Here we go.</p>
          <p>We start off with a good results and I think you'll agree a pretty clean results. So in terms of all the materials we've given you, I think the numbers that you see here obviously we'll go through the normal discussions about the other distinguishing features of the result, but it is a pretty clean result and a result that I think and the team think shows continuing momentum for the Group and the environment that we're in.</p>
          <p>The headline is a cash net profit after tax of $3.576 billion, which is 7% up on the prior comparative period. The statutory profit of 3.624% (sic) [$3.624 billion] (2:13) is 19% above the prior comparative period and then obviously David will go into bit more detail on this. The difference is a largely unrealized gains and losses on the hedges associated with our funding and we continue to see cash NPAT as the most accurate and reliable representation of the ongoing performance of the Group.</p>
          <p>Cash return on equity at 19.2% is flat. Our cash earnings per share at $2.27 is up 6% on the prior comparative period and then a dividend per share of a $1.37, 4% up on the prior comparative period. And as you'll see from later on in the materials, it's a 61% payout ratio. We've calculated this very consistently with how we've done this in the recent years taking a more conservative approach to the first half dividend and maintaining a payout ratio of somewhere between 61 % and 63% with the exception of that one-off year in 2009, which had its own conditions.</p>
          <p>One of the most pleasing aspects of the momentum is the environment in which we have managed to achieve it. And we characterize the environment above all as an unpredictable environment. When we get to the outlook later on, what you'll see is that as a Group we're adopting very much a scenario based approach to the way our operating conditions might evolve and one of the ongoing realities of our environment is there is going to be uncertainty. And it's important for us to understand how that uncertainty has had translated specifically into the operating conditions in which we conduct business, and we can see four of them here in front you.</p>
          <p>They're all known to you, but it is important to remind ourselves of those aspects of the environment. Subdued system credit growth as we find that both on the retail and the business side of lending understandably our customers are tending to be a bit more cautious than they had been previously. We're seeing an ongoing preference for cash again from businesses and from households and you can see that by steady increase in deposits as a percent of financial assets.</p>
          <p>In case any of you haven't heard by now funding costs are going up and we can see here indicative long-term funding costs continue to rise, but critically and I'll &#x2013; we'll come back to this point later, the six-month term deposit rate, which you can see plotted here, is showing that actually as a result of the logical effects of competition given the wholesale funding environment, we're actually paying a lot more for deposits than we were as well.</p>
          <p>And then we're also in an environment where the uncertainty and the effects inside Australia, but more appropriately outside Australia of the global financial crisis have resulted in an environment of continuing regulatory change. We're in ongoing dialogue with all our major regulators. We believe we've got very good dialogue with the regulators on all the key regulatory issues and we believe that the basis on which regulation is moving as fully understandable, but we need to realize that it adds additional cost and complexity to the business.</p>
          <p>I want to call out in the next couple of slides what we consider to be the real drivers of the good momentum that we have across the Group and equally importantly some of the challenges that we have business by business to that momentum.</p>
          <p>Retail banking services continues to be a strong driver of momentum, and I've called out two particular aspects here, which I find particularly pleasing. We have historic highs in customer satisfaction at 78.9%, but more importantly what we're able to do here is show the shift in the dialogue from just the absolute customer satisfaction numbers equally importantly to the impact of superior customer satisfaction on the business and that has directly resulted in industry leading 2.74 products per customer.</p>
          <p>Critically, in this environment, one of the things that this has achieved is enabled us to broaden the dialogue with our customers beyond mortgages and deposits. And you'll see later on in your materials that our other income from FX and insurance was up 18% on the prior comparative period and is making a material contribution now to the retail banking's earnings. That is a very positive long-term trend.</p>
          <p>At the same time, consistent with commitments which we've given to the market for some period and which we will reinforce today, we have continued to work on productivity in the retail bank in addition to all across the Group and the retail bank continues to be a standout on the cost to income agenda with cost to income ratio again down to 38.3%.</p>
          <p>The business and private bank is continuing good overall momentum. Business banking income is up 12% at the same time as expense growth has been well controlled at 3% leading to a decline in the cost to income ratio i.e., a favorable movement to 42.9%. So what we're seeing here in the business bank is particularly pleasing ongoing top line momentum at the same time as expenses are being well-managed at a very sustainable 3%.</p>
          <p>Institutional bank and markets has been really at the epicenter of a lot of the more difficult trends in the environment over the last couple of years, but particularly on the lending side, we've seen good momentum in the last six months with lending assets having grown in this period at 9%.</p>
          <p>The wealth management business, again, really at the epicenter of the difficult market trends, we don't shy away from the fact that a 24% down on the prior comparative period this is a tough result. Within that, though, on the FirstChoice and FirstWrap platforms, we are continuing to see good flow of new to market funds. So we're happy with that aspect of the performance of the business although as I'll get to in a minute, that remains a business with a great deal of challenge.</p>
          <p>ASB and Bankwest have both contributed a good solid shape with ASB having improved margins largely for the continued substitution of variable loan, home loans or fixed loan, a trend in New Zealand market and Bankwest continuing to perform strongly again with an overall good shape of the numbers income growing steadily at 7% at the same time as Jon Sutton and his team have kept expenses flat. So that's a very good shape of the result and the one that we think is sustainable.</p>
          <p>Not all is rosy in the portfolio as you would expect in this environment with this collection of businesses. Our retail banking margin is down nine basis points since June. I expect that will be the topic of quite a bit of conversation today and beyond. And then we see a collection of businesses, which really have understandably suffered from the impacts of markets.</p>
          <p>Our equities and margin lending business within business and private bank, which is the CommSec and colonial geared investments businesses, is down 8% on the prior comparative period, although, with its market share remaining strong and its yields remaining strong that business still performs very well.</p>
          <p>Our markets income down 45% on the prior comparative period. The counterparty value adjustment is a big part of it, but also this is a function of the conditions in which these businesses are operating and as you'll be aware consistent with the experience of our peers.</p>
          <p>The wealth management business really has struggled particularly in the face of weak equity markets with the ASX down 8% during the period. As a result, income is down 5%, expenses are up 10%. This is not a shape of business performance that we like. What it does show though, particularly in respect of our global asset management business, is a continued appetite to invest in the business even in the more challenging parts of the cycle showing our commitment to the long-term value that they can create.</p>
          <p>Short-term momentum is very important to us. It maintains the confidence of investors, it maintains the confidence of regulators, it maintains the confidence of rating agencies and of our people, and we remain very aware of the need to preserve that momentum. At the same time, though, we believe that we are here for the long term. The fact that we're in our 100th year reminds us of that and our strategic settings very much are designed with an eye on long-term value. So through this period, we've continued to invest. We've invested $647 million over the period as you can see, 48% of it on a variety of projects relating to productivity and growth, 29% of it, ongoing investment in our core banking modernization platform.</p>
          <p>Under my leadership, the Group remains as committed to the core banking modernization platform and the benefits as it &#x2013; that it delivers as it ever has. During this period, we migrated over a million business accounts onto the new core banking platform to join more than 10 million retail accounts that were already there at the start of this period.</p>
          <p>The program remains tracking well and we're very pleased with the manner with which it's been implemented and the manner in which the benefits now are starting to be realized. And critically in this period, we've started to see first signs of innovation on the new platform.</p>
          <p>The core banking platform is no longer the thing we talk about in the future tense and something we talk about being in the business in the present tense. And the Kaching platform, which we've had feedback around from overseas as a globally leading payments application with now more than 100,000 downloads, has been an early example of the innovation possible with real time banking on that platform.</p>
          <p>Productivity is a topic for the long-term on many of your minds, on the minds of many of our external stakeholders and front and center on the minds of management. We do not have any plans for major redundancy programs; we do not have any plans for off shoring. As analysts and investors, that does cause you to ask the question so what do you have plans for. What we have plans for is continued commitment to what we've been doing over the last couple of years to the continued strengthening of the capability which we are now demonstrating within our results and within the momentum of the business, and that is taking a process by process view of the group, applying new technology, applying process excellence principles and making our processes better.</p>
          <p>You can see here that relative to December 2009, our mortgage services processes are significantly more efficient and pleasingly you can see that the momentum continues. This is about continuous improvement. Imaging improved workflow and casting an eye over good process principles has enabled this to happen. And this is by no means the only part of the group this is happening with. On the bottom right, you can see in Bankwest, the calls to fulfillment ratio improving to 7:1 from 14:1. Again looking at workflow and the most efficient way to use spare capacity both within the call centers and in other parts of the business.</p>
          <p>And through CFS investment operations, infrastructure and process delivery, merchant acquiring and credit cards are other examples of where this activity is happening in the group today and will continue to happen. We don't have a different view from any of our competitors on the need to be as productive as we can be. We do have a different view on how to achieve that productivity in a sustainable way. Another part of the importance of long term is continuing to have strong and conservative funding and liquidity settings.</p>
          <p>We are 62% deposit funded and maintain a good balance between long-term and short-term funding for the balance of our liabilities. You can also see here that through David Craig, Lyn Cobley and their teams, one thing we are very focused on and we remain very focused on is the need to maintain a very diverse funding pool in this environment. What we've seen and expect to continue to see is that different funding markets described by geographically and by the character of instrument have quite different behavioral characteristics and respond quite differently to the exigencies of the market.</p>
          <p>So, we need to be prepared to be able to access different markets at different times and that's what we have done. At the same time and you'll see this later in the materials that we have handed out, we are very conscious of the need to maintain a good long term profile and a weighted average maturity of long term debt of 3.6 years remains very strong, and you can see also that recently in January with a full year average of the new debt that we are putting on the book, we are committed to maintaining a good long-term base in our wholesale funding. That is part of good conservative long-term savings.</p>
          <p>The same applies to liquidity. We need to be prepared over time for new liquidity regulation, which we are in dialogue with APRA about, but we also as a group take a view that even now the prudent thing to do is to increase our holdings of liquids. And you can see here that relative to the December 10 to the very current day, we've increased liquids from $93 billion to $133 billion. This is a topic to which we give a great deal of discussion at our monthly ALCO meetings, at our board meetings and our executive committee meetings, and again an example of prudent settings designed to create long-term value.</p>
          <p>I'll now hand over to David for some more detailed analysis of the results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, good morning, everybody. As Ian said, I'd love to take you through the detail. And the momentum in our income has continued despite the slowing of credit growth. And pleasingly income is up 4% and expenses are also up 4%, so we're pleased that we've been able to maintain flat jaws in what has been a challenging time.</p>
          <p>Our credit quality continues to improve and this has lead to a reduction &#x2013; a continuing reduction in loan impairment expense, which combined have delivered this 7% growth in cash net profit after tax.</p>
          <p>If we just have a look at the reconciliation between cash net profit and statutory profit that Ian mentioned, we see exactly the same items as we have seen consistently period-on-period, but you can see that the hedging and IFRS volatility which reflects fundamentally the impact of the Australian dollar moving about relative to the hedging of long-term debt, that's led to quite a flip around this period and the 19% increase in statutory profit. But as Ian has said from our perspective, cash net profit better reflects the results of the group.</p>
          <p>Looking at income, net interest income is up 1% on the past six months. Now, we need to remember as I've pointed out before that there is a re-classification that happens between net interest income and other banking income, again due to IFRS which has flipped $90 million out of net interest income into other banking income, which somewhat distorts that 1% increase.</p>
          <p>Volumes in net interest income are up 4% but margin has impacted us negatively by 3%, and, of course, in this particular period there are three more days, which has a 1% impact. Other banking income is up 5%, again off the back of that IFRS reclassification. And as Ian has pointed out, trading income was down during the period by $50 million and that's knocked 1% off there.</p>
          <p>Finally, funds management and insurance income has been affected negatively by the continuing movements in the market, with funds under management down 4%, but insurance income has performed strongly, and Ian referred to the fact that there has been very, very good cross sell of insurance policies and that's seen a big growth in insurance income for the period.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at net interest margin, the underlying net interest margin is down from 215 basis points to 209, down 6 basis points for the period across the group. That's comprised of an improvement in assets mix, a little bit of pricing improvement in the corporate banking area, and, in particular, a shift from lower margin home loans into higher margin corporate lending has led to 5 basis point uptick. But this has been more than offset by 10 basis points of additional funding costs, that's 6 basis points in wholesale funding and 4 basis points in consumer retail funding.</p>
          <p>And of course that extra holding of liquid assets that Ian referred to comes &#x2013; carries a cost, because liquid assets have a low margin and so that holding of additional liquid assets has cost us four basis points of NIM.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Ian also flagged, offshore net interest income has improved, particularly in New Zealand, as we've seen a continuation of the movement from fixed to floating rate home loans in New Zealand, and those offshore impacts have added around three basis points.</p>
          <p>We've maintained strong cost discipline through the period, with expenses up just 4%, while continuing to invest. As you can see, the individual components are pretty much under control. Occupancy and equipment costs were up abnormally this period because we are consolidating a number of Sydney premises into our new offices down in Darling Quarter and so there is an element of double rent being paid in this period, which contributed to that 8% uptick in occupancy and equipment.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, other costs are also up 8% on the back of some one-off compliance costs, continuing regulation, and of course this being our centenary year, we've made a significant contribution to the community. I'm pleased to say that on any measure, credit quality is improving and so this has led to a continuing easing in the number of basis points of loan impairment expense, down from 22 basis points last year &#x2013; last period to 21 basis points this period. And you'd have to say this is pretty well as low as we would expect it to go.</p>
          <p>The top right hand chart shows you that on all measures of consumer arrears, the arrears are coming down. And equally pleasing for the corporate side of the business, both troublesome and impaired measurements are coming down for the third period running. So that improvement in credit quality naturally leads to slightly lower provisioning, although we still have the most conservative provision of any bank in the sector.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at collective provisions, you can see that the components of the management overlay, we still have $970 million of management overlay. We haven't touched the economic overlays at all, because we still remain concerned about the uncertain environment that we are in. But then there has been the natural runoff: firstly, a small amount due to improved credit quality, the continuing rundown of the Bankwest fair value adjustment. And then, finally, we had set aside within the overlay a provision for the fact that we had a scheduled review of modeling to do and we expected that that modeling would lead to a change in consumer provisioning, which it has done. So we've moved that out of consumer provisioning &#x2013; sorry, out of the overlay into consumer provisioning, and you can see that that's ticked up at the same time.</p>
          <p>If we have a look at the performance of the retail bank over the last six months, it's not surprising, after what Ian has said, that our home loan income is down 4%. But we had very strong growth in both unsecured personal lending and credit card income, up 6%. And although deposit volumes have increased 7%, again we've had margin pressure in deposits, and so the underlying income on deposits is up just 2%. So those things combine to see the retail bank income up 1%, but as Ian pointed out, very strong cost control in the retail bank and so no increase in costs and operating performance up 1%.</p>
          <p>The bottom left-hand chart shows the composition of our deposit mix, and it's pretty consistent period-on-period. No runoff at all in transaction accounts, indeed, a slight uptick. But of course the growth is in the lower margin for us, higher return for our customers areas, and pleasingly here, the new Gold Saver account has added $5 billion of deposits since it was founded.</p>
          <p>We tend to measure our market share based on the independent survey of Roy Morgan, on main financial institution customers. And pleasingly, Bankwest and CBA combined still has a steady 33.2% market share. So despite all of the volatility and ructions that we hear about, it's pleasing to see that our market share is holding firm.</p>
          <p>Finally, on the top right-hand corner, you can see that based on the fact, the retail margin unfortunately continues to decline and it's down fully 39 basis points since 2006. So let's have a look at what's driving that and particularly what's happened over the last period since June.</p>
          <p>You've seen this chart before and what it maps for you is the increase in retail funding costs since the beginning of the GFC. But if we look particularly at what's happened since June, you see that wholesale funding costs have grown 45 basis points with all this volatility and deposit funding retail customers increased 12 basis points. So the weighted average cost of funds for our retail bank, have grown 25 basis points since June last year. And you'd be aware that we passed 10 of those basis points on Monday.</p>
          <p>Turning to the corporate bank or the corporate businesses across the Group, top left-hand chart shows that what's happened for the last year in our business in private bank with good strong growth across the majority of business lending portfolios. Again as Ian flagged, the equities and margin lending business has been affected by markets and declined 8%, but again good control in business and private bank with total income up 4% and costs up just 3%.</p>
          <p>In institutional banking and markets, good lending growth in the institutional bank has been more than offset by the impact of markets, which were down 45%. This was primarily in the first quarter of the half, so basically in that period around August when all of the banks were hit. So income in that business was down 8%, costs again very much under control.</p>
          <p>The top right-hand chart shows, or try attempts to demystify what's happening across those &#x2013; the complete range of business banking metrics from the small corner shop through to the very large institution. So when we start with the institutional bank &#x2013; sorry, with business bank, business and private bank despite the runoff of margin lending has grown at 3.4% compared to system of 2.8%.</p>
          <p>Institutional banking and markets has had strong growth, up 12.1%. In Bankwest, it continues to be a story of two books. We have the legacy book, which continues to runoff, but pleasingly, the new lending that's been done in Bankwest under the CBA credit standards have grown 7%. So overall across the book, we're going at roughly double system on business banking, which is a good high margin business.</p>
          <p>And the bottom right-hand chart shows that the margins in fact are improving slightly. Now, there is three reasons for that. Firstly, the deposit growth has been strong and deposit income counts in the numerator of NIM, but the denominator is just lending balances. So there's a mismatch there that leads to the improvement. Secondly, many of our customers, particularly at the high-end, are asking for more facilities which they're not drawing down. But the establishment fees for those facilities get amortized through net interest income.</p>
          <p>And finally, there has been a runoff of some low margin accounts.</p>
          <p>Turning now to the Wealth Management business, firstly global asset management as you'd expect has been significantly impacted by the markets and the reduced funds under management. However, because that business is such a high performing business with 70% of its funds performing above benchmark, it's been able to hold its income steady.</p>
          <p>The Colonial First State business has been hit by something of a perfect storm in this half. Firstly, as you would expect the funds under administration down 4%, that impacts income. Secondly, there is a shift away from some of the higher margin products of equities and so on into fixed income. And then there's also the impact of much higher &#x2013; much greater regulation, lots of systems work going on for all the regulatory changes that are happening and compliance costs and we also had an enforceable undertaking, so all of those have combined to see income for this particular half down. In CommInsure, as you can see from the bottom right-hand chart, very strong growth in premium income has been offset by the cost of guarantees that are affected by the markets.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to funding and liquidity. And as you can see, our deposit funding is up from 60% a year ago to 62% of our total funding. So with $21 billion of deposits coming in, they've more than paid for the $13 billion of incremental lending. We did $7 billion of new funding during the half and we've done a further $7 billion funding in January and that $7 billion was done at an average margin of 200 basis points or average cost of 200 basis points over.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Ian has flagged, significant increase in liquid funds from a cash point of view, $16 billion more liquids and cash funded as you can see partly out of short-term debt. The right hand-chart just gives you a more detailed perspective of the $133 billion of liquidity that we're holding in total.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me talk to you about capital. And our capital is up from 9.7% a year ago to 9.9% now. Good strong organic growth has been offset by a growth in risk-weighted assets in this period and again there is a couple of features to call out on this.</p>
          <p>Firstly, with more corporate lending that has a higher risk-weighted waiting than personal lending or home loan lending in particular. Secondly, the undrawn facilities and I said, we've had a big demand for more undrawn facilities from our corporate clients those carry within the risk-weighting and so we have to carry capital against those. So although they're not balance sheet, they're off-balance sheet, they still have a capital impost. And finally, the extra liquids that we hold also carry with them a liquid &#x2013; a risk-weighted assets waiting, so, this period seen some slightly abnormal growth in risk-weighted assets. Common equity sits at 7.7% and we're very well placed for Basel III as it comes through with our global harmonized Basel III number sitting at 9.3%.</p>
          <p>So I'll now call on Ian to wrap up and talk to us about the outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. We're in an environment at the moment where we really are not to believe anybody who gives you a confident outlook. But one of the things that we need to be prepared to do here is maintain our readiness for a variety of scenarios.</p>
          <p>In our view, there will be continued volatility. There is no doubt that in the last one to two months and particularly underpinning some of the reasoning in the Reserve Bank of Australia's monetary statements, there are some positive signs driven primarily from the LTRO in Europe and its impact on European banking and liquidity and therefore it affects throughout different parts of the world.</p>
          <p>But it's too early to declare victory on that and too early to plot a linear scenario just based on that assumption of recovery. So, what we continue to do is take a scenario-based approach to the way that we are running the institution both for the short and for the long-term.</p>
          <p>And as a major financial institution, when we take a scenario-based approach in this kind of environment, we do need to be prepared to overweight the more conservative scenarios. We do think that the fundamentals of the Australian economy remain strong in the medium to long-term, but what we've seen is that notwithstanding good underlying fundamentals, Australia is not immune from actual or perceived disruption from what is happening in Europe, United States and elsewhere in the globe.</p>
          <p>So the short to medium term outlook is for volatility to continue. And as I mentioned at the start, we would expect the accompanying more anemic credit growth therefore to continue for some period of time. And in that environment, the outlook is for funding costs to continue to increase.</p>
          <p>So, we look at those different scenarios. We overweight the more difficult ones to ensure that we remain conservative. And then, we put our strategic and business settings to create long-term value, but be cognizant as I said before of the need to avoid compromising our short-term momentum.</p>
          <p>And at the core of both the long-term value creation and the short-term performance is ensuring that we build the business continuously on a strong and sustainable business model.</p>
          <p>And to repeat things that I and David have covered earlier, we continue to invest in technology which we see as a fundamental driver for business in the future and a source of ongoing competitive differentiation on both the revenue and the expense line.</p>
          <p>We continue to maintain strong funding and liquidity with increasing deposit funding and increasing holding of liquids. We continue to maintain a strong capital position at 9.9% Tier 1 at the moment. And we continue to invest in the ongoing strengthening of our customer satisfaction culture, which has seen CBA improve by 14 percentage points over the last 5.5 years at a time where the top rated peer has improved 3.6 years. Now we're the first to acknowledge we had further to move in many of the other competitors, but this is still a sign of ongoing momentum showing up in products to the customer.</p>
          <p>So even when we do wait the business see things to some of the more conservative scenarios, we are confident that this strong and sustainable business model provides a basis for ongoing value creation. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's James Freeman from Deutsche Bank. I just want to ask on the costs, you've delivered sort of a flat jaws number and spoken to us about no big redundancies in continued investment. I mean is that the mantra slight jaws is the expectation that we can take away or where there is some one-offs coming through in the first half that you don't expect to appear in the second half. And so we should start to see a more positive jaws profile. So, that's a question on costs.</p>
          <p>The second question is just on liquidity, David, you mentioned you had a big increase in liquidity, do you think you're there now, have you enough and do you think that drag will start to ease on the margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me take the first question and then make a brief comment on the second question, James, before I hand over to David. We have said for some time that jaws, i.e., the growth difference in the growth between operating income and operating expense is something we look at very closely. When I talk about making sure we've got a long-term focus but while ensuring short-term momentum, jaws are one of the key aspects of short-term momentum.</p>
          <p>So, although with projects like core other aspects that expenditure, we are very long-term focused. What we're always looking to do is look at the shape of the revenue line in the short-term and make sure that our discretionary expenditure ensures that we're not overspending for the environment. And that has meant that even when we've got a more challenged revenue environment like now, we're still keeping pretty flat jaws. My expectation would be that it wouldn't get worse than that. And as revenue starts to pick up and you start to see some of the benefits of productivity, the jaws should start opening more widely, although we don't manage to any specific jaws target.</p>
          <p>In terms of liquidity, the overall setting and then I'll hand over to David. This is something that we're looking at very closely. I mean obviously we've got the long-term regulatory liquidity settings to look at. We've also got the short-term view of our need to hold liquids dictated by our appetite, investors' appetite, the rating agencies, et cetera. And we're constantly looking at that level of liquids in the current environment through asset and liability committee.</p>
          <p>We feel pretty good about the level of liquids there we're holding at the moment. As at that $133 billion number that you can see here, I'd say we don't see a big need to increase liquids at the moment beyond that, but we really don't want to make a lot of predictions about what we're doing because to some extent it's sensitive to the environment. What we are conscious of and David pointed this out earlier is the impact of the cost of holding liquids on net interest margin. So, obviously the name of the game isn't just get as liquid as possible.</p>
          <p>Do you want to add to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, sorry. Can I just confirm side, you said it's not going to get worse but it should get better. What's your timing in terms of when this jaw should get better?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We look at the, James, it depends a lot on the shape of the revenue environment. And even if you take three or four people and you ask for the forecast on 6 to 12 month credit growth, we're still seeing a huge standard deviation in those assessments. So at the moment, even the variability on those forecast in the near-term is difficult to get a good number on. So, as we sit today, keeping four and four in this kind of revenue environment I would hopefully wouldn't do worse than that. But if we go to an environment where we saw, for argument sake, three to six months of slightly weaker credit growth and we look at our expenses and said, you know what it &#x2013; the right thing to do for the long-term for this half might be to spend a bit more we'd look at that. But the base case scenario is to continue to manage to flat and positive jaws.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Richard Wiles from Morgan Stanley. Your investment spend in this period was $650 million, which is tracking ahead of the run rate in the previous years. Given the unpredictable environment that you've been talking about, I'd just like some insight on three issues.</p>
          <p>Firstly, you've spending more than $300 million per annum on core banking modernization. I understand that comes to an end by the end of 2012. Do you think you'll redeploy that somewhere else or save it?</p>
          <p>Secondly, do you need to continue to have the same level of investment in the branch network given that households are now de-leveraging?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, you've gone through a period alongside the other banks of growing FTEs in recent years. I know you've made the commitment to no major redundancy programs, but is there scope to actually constrain that growth and therefore get some cost benefit that way?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me take those three questions. First of all on core, we'll do more of an update on this just in the normal cycle in May. It continues to track to the forecast that it should. And yes, there's a lot happening this year and then it starts to tail off pretty soon after that.</p>
          <p>In terms of are we going to fill it, what we are not doing is saying, look, we've got a budget of X million dollars, that's the amount we want to spend in the business, let's fill it. The way we look at the project portfolio is we take a bottom-up view of what the best projects are. Then we screen those projects against two criteria. Number one is just, is it a palatable level of overall investment spend, and number two, which is actually equally important a constraint, do we have enough expert technical resource in the business to do all the projects.</p>
          <p>So we certainly won't &#x2013; obviously core, particularly from the latter but also from the former, once the core spending tails off, it frees up some capacity. What we're not saying as an executive team is, great, we've got $300 million, how can we spend it. We're continuing that bottom-up discipline. That might result in less being spent. It could conceivably result in more being spent, although I doubt that would be the outcome.</p>
          <p>On your second question on the branch network, I recall a lot of analysis in the mid '90s saying branch networks were dead, and everybody said, let's haul back the investment on branch networks, and they did it. And then all of a sudden about 2000, 2001, everyone woke up and thought, gosh, branches are still making money, let's invest more in branches. Although we do spend &#x2013; talk a lot about technology, mobile, peer-to-peer payments, et cetera, and in the long-term that's going to be a critical source of differentiation, the reality is that in the near to medium-term at a minimum, the branch channel remains an absolutely critical part of our momentum and of our strategic differentiation.</p>
          <p>So although Ross and his team, and more broadly with Michael Harte, Rob Jesudason and others, we are doing a lot of thought to what the world's looking like as branches get used differently, what that does to branch formats et cetera, we still have an appetite to invest in the branch network, because it's still doing very well for us.</p>
          <p>On the third point about growing FTEs. Yes, we have continued to grow FTEs in number. I would expect as we've got the overall productivity initiative that we can get more productive on current revenue base. So if what you said is in a year's time revenue is like it is, we should be able to be doing that year after year with fewer people, and we would manage that, by definition, first, with natural attrition, which is sort of 3,000 people per year, redeployment et cetera. We wouldn't see the need. But that's a lot of difference in FTEs. So that would be on today's revenue base. If revenues kept growing through different business mix et cetera, might that lead to an absolute increase in FTEs? Technically that's possible. But the key for us is to become continuously more productive on the baseline of today's revenue base.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Jon Mott from UBS. If you take a helicopter view of the bank and the business at the moment, you can see a very profitable back book with 19% return on equity, but in the current funding markets, profitability on a lot of the key asset and liability products that you're selling is let's just say substantially less than that. How do you manage that process going forward, assuming funding markets continue to be difficult? Is there opportunities there on that front book &#x2013; or how do you manage that front book / back book process?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a good question. Look, first of all, on the short-term profitability, even with that we've got to be a little bit careful. I mean, in this period that we've talked about, and I might have the numbers not exactly right, but they'll be close enough, basis risk in this period moved between 16 and 42 basis points. That's a major shift just in these six months. So even in the short-term, we've got to be very careful about what we're considering to be some kind of sustained what we call equilibrium level of funding costs, and we've got to work around that.</p>
          <p>And we work around that through pricing committees right through the group, which are looking at the cost of funds obviously, the impact on the back book, the impact on the front book et cetera. And that has got to be a dynamic process. And what we are putting pressure on ourselves to do is make sure that the infrastructure we've got for making those pricing decisions is as good as it can be. But pricing strategies, by definition, need to be able to adapt pretty quickly, and they will continue to adapt pretty quickly.</p>
          <p>In the medium to long term, it's actually a more difficult question frankly, because I think there's a lot of debate about will Greece default, what's going to happen in a month, what's going to happen in two months. The much more interesting and complicated question is what's the equilibrium state we move to once we've worked through all that, if we assume that Europe is difficult for three or four years, what that does to demand for Chinese products, et cetera, work through all that.</p>
          <p>And we've got to make sure that we're doing that thinking but also maintaining very flexible pricing settings, because I'm sure you'll have the same view, there are scenarios you can imagine credit growth coming back really quickly, funding costs coming down. There are scenarios under which you can imagine funding costs continue to go up and credit growth being equally weak as it is today or even worse, and our pricing's got to be able to be flexible enough to adapt to both those scenarios.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Ben Koo, Goldman Sachs. Just on the costs and then just another question on just other opportunities that you might be looking at. On the cost, can you just clarify us a bit on that 35% cost-to-income target of the retail bank, if that still stands?</p>
          <p>And then just longer term as well, just looking at the opportunities for the business, if you do have this environment of slowing credit growth and lower growth in Australia &#x2013; you already have 33% market share, I'm just interested in where you see the longer term opportunities for growth for the bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we're committed to the 35% cost-to-income target absolutely, but with one wrinkle on it which I want to be pretty clear about. What that really &#x2013; what we were saying here is that we wanted to make sure that the ongoing productivity in the retail bank got us to a 35% cost-to-income ratio. The thing that concerns me and always has about the cost-to-income ratio is how much that's denominator dependent. So actually we could get to the situation where we're sitting here in three years time congratulating ourselves on a 33% cost-to-income ratio but actually our process is less productive and we've just grown revenue.</p>
          <p>So our commitment to the productivity that would get us there is exactly as it was. What I think you'll hear us talk more about from the time of the strategic review in April and beyond is more clear productivity measures around unit costs of processes, quality of processes, et cetera that don't hide inefficiency against a strong revenue growth line. And so that's a way of saying, yes, we're committed to the productivity but cost-to-income ratio might not be the best measure of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify on that, is the revenue environment that we're seeing right now wasn't foreseen when you set that 35% cost-to-income ratio? So, you're a little bit less confident about &#x2013; you're confident on the costs side, but you're not as confident on the revenue side. In other words, the revenue wasn't sort of foreseen when you set that target.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm very confident about all the actions we've taken on the costs side. The issue that I've got, and it goes really to the point I was saying in response to Jon's question, is that there is still such a variation of forecasts on the revenue side. I mean, if we've got a situation where credit growth came back very significantly and we were continuously getting productive but the management team said, gosh, we've got six months to make this target, revenue is really down, let's just slash and burn to get the 35%, we wouldn't do it. But we've got the long-term focus, but we want to make sure we keep getting the continuous productivity.</p>
          <p>To the extent you're talking about other opportunities, I think it's really important in terms of the Australian core commercial banking business to be thinking about this across a number of different levels: markets where the market environment is good, i.e. the system is good; areas we've got opportunity for market share; areas we've got opportunity for margin improvement; and areas we've got improvement opportunity for operational productivity, and you could probably add capital productivity to that.</p>
          <p>And when people say to us, gosh, growth in Australia's challenged, they tend to say because your home loan market share is X or your deposit market share is X and you can't possibly get better than that. Now, there are a number of different product lines around the group and we have got industry-leading market shares that are hard to grow, but actually those are businesses we've got a good opportunity to do better on our pricing or better on our operational productivity and that's as valuable value creation as the mixed percentage point of market share might be for example in business banking.</p>
          <p>So as we look at the Australian commercial portfolio, we got &#x2013; we apply very different goals to different parts of the business and how they contribute to that value, but I'm very confident that all the different parts, when they add up, we can still see where the growth is coming from.</p>

          <p>That's domestic. International, I mean, there's been a lot of discussion particularly since my appointment and Rob coming on board that we're about to become a major international bank. Our view on international remains, I think, very consistent with where it is today, which is we're very happy with what we're doing internationally. We're constantly looking for things we do very well in Australia that we could apply to do offshore, and as and when we find those, that we would do it. But we've got to be clear that in the near to medium term, at least the momentum in this business is coming from Australian domestic banking and the wealth management business.</p>

          <p>Andrew Lyons from RBS. Just a question for David on capital, and I specifically refer to slide 44, you fully loaded Basel III APRA core equity tier one ratio of 7.1%, just two things on that. Firstly, is that lower than we would have expected it to have been six months ago, particularly around calculation of that number? And secondly, are you comfortable that you can organically build to a number where you think you need to be sort of over the next two or three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, firstly, we are very comfortable about where we are today. I think we are incredibly well capitalized under any measure of risk today; and we look at capital not just through this lens, but through economic capital lenses and talking with rating agencies and so on and so on and so on, so there are many different perspectives. And from our point of view, under any of those perspectives, we are very, very well capitalized.</p>
          <p>We obviously don't know for sure what the final rules are going to be, nor do we know for sure when they're going to kick in. I mean, obviously there are timetables. But &#x2013; and again, under any timetable, we are way ahead of timing from our point of view. So, I don't know how many ways I can answer the question except to say, yeah, we are very confident about our capital.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, our short view is that banks are not utilities. There are &#x2013; and I mentioned this at the start, it's a reality that we expect and accept that given what the world has gone through, there are all sorts of different regulators looking at the regulatory settings and are wanting to change them and they're becoming in many ways more restrictive. And our approach to that is we engage in good dialogue, we feel well heard and then we adapt the business as it comes, but we engage in very active discussion with those regulators. And that's a trend that we accept and expect to continue. Beyond that, there's all sorts of speculation about what might be done with banks et cetera, and we'll just take that if it comes and we don't do &#x2013; to spend too much time scenario planning around some of those things.</p>

          <p>Craig Williams from Citi. If you look at credit growth at the moment, very subdued. Bank funding positions don't seem to be in a position where that can accelerate dramatically, I would argue. Yet, your return on equity is 19%. So presumably you begin surplus significant levels of capital, and I think what Dave is suggesting is your capital is very strong now, and I would expect that that will continue to build. So how do you consider the balance between returning that capital directly to shareholders and investing the capital back into the business?</p>

          <p>Jarrod Martin from Credit Suisse. Just a question on funding and  clarification. Slide 37, you detail the changes in wholesale as well as deposit funding being an impact of some 25 basis points, and then you say the increase in standard variable rate was 10 basis points that you've clawed back. Then I think, David, on slide 43, when you looked at the funding profile, you said that there was a further $7 billion of funding done in January at 200 basis points. The calculations on slide 37, do they include the additional $7 billion done at 200 basis points or are they prior to that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They include them, but, of course, this is &#x2013; the calculations on the other page are a rolling average cost of funds across the entire retail book. So, although that funding of course was partly for the retail bank, you're talking about less than one month on a small portion of the aggregate funding of the whole book. So yes, it's in there, but it wouldn't have a material impact in that first month.</p>

          <p>It's hardly picked up at all. I mean, with volumes moving around, these things move up and down; one part of the calculation moves up, one part moves down. It's just a reflection of the difference between the regulatory calculation and the more sophisticated economic calculation that we do. So I don't think you should read anything into that very small movement.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just on page 61 of the release, if you have a look at the business in corporate yield on assets, it looks like it's gone down sort of 36 basis points versus home loans. You've obviously had some pretty good growth in business lending. Can you give us some color as to, I suppose, that growth and then opportunity for re-pricing going forward in the market?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, so it looks like the &#x2013; I guess what you are earning on the assets has declined quite a lot. Can you give us some color as to, you've had some good growth. Just color around where you're growing and also the opportunity for re-pricing going forward in that space.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, looking at average balances, obviously these are reflected by what's happening in the market. Interest rates are down, so you've got to look at the net interest margin rather than the gross interest, and this is the trouble with this particular analysis, which obviously is compulsory. So I think that the way we characterized what's happened, which is that margins in business banking have gone up a little bit, margins in home lending obviously down &#x2013; though that's a better reflection of what's happening. And clearly, in terms of where we're seeking to grow, I think it's pretty obvious that we've grown in credit cards and unsecured lending, where margins are holding up well, we've grown in corporate banking where, margins are strong, we've not grown so much in home loans, where margins are weak.</p>

          <p>Victor German from Nomura. Firstly, would you be able to give us an indication of what portion of your business lending is linked to standard variable rate?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a very &#x2013; none of it's actually linked to the standard variable rate. A small portion of the business banking book is cash funded, and that is primarily our residentially secured business loans. So it's growing at about 10%, give or take.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the benefit is not going to come through the business book at all?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, again, as I said before, when we talk about the benefit, we've got people who look very carefully weekly at pricing and make their decisions based on the dynamics of the business banking market. So I think they've done a pretty good job of getting the right volume business margin settings on it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And secondly, late last year there was a paper &#x2013; a draft paper by APRA in terms of capital requirements for the life company. Would you able to be give us an update how that translates to your specific instruments that you hold in Colonial, what impacts it has on the group? And just linking it to the capital position, given it's a little bit lighter than your peers, what should we be expect &#x2013; or should we expect any differences in the payout ratio going forward?</p>

          <p>Payout ratio for the bank group?</p>

          <p>I don't think so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we're doing, like all of the industry is doing, quantitative impact statements across all of the different proposals that APRA has come &#x2013; and there is a range of them at the moment and we're doing lots of QISs. None of those are giving &#x2013; the results of none of those are giving us any particular cause of concern, in other words, where it's obviously working with APRA on proposals and on refining those things. But we don't believe that any of that will lead to any material change in the way we capitalize the group, and particularly the way we &#x2013; and the way we capitalize Colonial. In fact, you may be aware that we've announced today that we're raising a hybrid &#x2013; a retail hybrid in Colonial.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. You've talked about being overweight &#x2013; the conservative scenarios in your outlook. I'm just wondering what key metrics you're looking at as leading indicators of the outlook which would cause you to shift your setting away from conservative to a more aggressive setting.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a good question, and we've spoken about this a lot. You can see later on in the materials some of the charts in the economic research that Michael Blythe and his team do internally that we look at most closely. Obviously some of the classic standards like the unemployment rate are pretty important in the long term. But really, in our discussions on this at our monthly ALCO, we are looking at a variety of factors, including a few of those key macroeconomic metrics, including some indications about what's happening in China, including what are the markets pricing it in terms of interest rates, funding costs, et cetera. So what we don't have is some algorithm that we put under these numbers and its spits out where it sits on the conservatism curve, but we keep looking at a variety of these sorts of metrics in looking at our settings.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Congratulations on a maiden presentation. And I had a question, if you have a look at &#x2013; and I apologize because I am going blind, but if you have a look on page 48, whenever we asked Ralph Norris about this, he tended to dismiss it saying this was just what the economists were saying, and that's quite a valid answer.</p>
          <p>Can we get some explanation, do you honestly believe that system credit growth on these numbers can go back to growing at a multiple of nominal GDP in a world where we know that the regulator certainly is not saying that's a desirable outcome? Could you just run us through whether you actually believe that's right? And I would stress it's quite understandable to dismiss economists' view on that if that is what it is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, thank you for generously giving me that out. The economists &#x2013; the pages as it says, which is the CBA economists forecast, and it's very important to us that the CBA economists' forecasts are not forecasts. The CA or the CFA didn't forecast the CBA economists. I have thought for some time, including my time as the head of the business bank that the line of thinking that just as once we get through all this, we're going to return to the great healthy in a world where credit growth is multiples of nominal GDP isn't going to happen. So I would characterize these as obviously very strong analytically but with probably some more aggressive assumptions that I might have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>There's some kind of acronym that involves crap in there some way, because the problem is, Ian, that on one hand you're communicating on that slide that the revenue outlook is much stronger than perhaps it really is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, look, to be fair, what I'm communicating quite consistently through this is volatility. There were people at the time, I don't know whether you're one of them, who through the financial crisis when the CBA chief economist was making his forecast and including his interest rate forecast as credit growth forecast, was saying this guy is an irrational optimist and it turned out he was right and some of those people who were in the executive committee of the Commonwealth Bank Group. So yes, I think this is fact based, well reasoned set of conclusions, which can't be defended, but there's a big range here and the range of outcomes on the standard deviation around some of these estimates on all sorts of metrics is broader than we've ever seen it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. The second question, David, and I apologize for tending in slightly obnoxious mood, but if you have a look at the housing stress testing stuff, which I've temporarily lost the page reference, but we have the stress testing figure where I note that once again the stressed loss has actually gone up, but then we've now introduced, what I would say is, the super stress scenario where the outcome looks far, far worse.</p>
          <p>I also note that we don't see a slide, which shows the seasoning of the arrears rates on the loans that originated in 2008, 2009, where which were loans that originated when interest rates were low the first home buyers grant was high. Could we get some kind of explanation of how those numbers kind of flip around? The one that really strikes me is that if we have to look at the top one, the probability of the fourth stress factor, can you express that to us in basis points, the frequency of loss?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm going to put Alden Toevs. I notice that he can try to answer that last particular point. But, look, a couple of things; firstly, to your point about the 2008, 2009 loans, I'm pleased to say that the arrears on those loans they've past their peak and the arrears on those loans as indeed the whole book are improving.</p>
          <p>So they were a very profitable bunch of lines. So in terms of when we took back book, those loans were landed at a time when interest rates were very strong and we've had a very high profit from the whole book from those particular loans I suspect, but I'm guessing that the overall loss might have been three basis points as against one basis point average over the long-term, so very little impact and very profitable book.</p>
          <p>As far as these home loans stress tests are concerned, the one on page 104 of the pack is the one that we have used. It's the APRA's stress test and it's the one that we have used consistently for many periods. But, we have done a much more enhanced and sophisticated test, which we've introduced here for the first time just to show what happens over multiple years and what happens when we start looking at from our point of view in a much more granular way at the fact that certain parts of Australia would be more impacted by downturn and other parts both in terms of what might happen to home loan pricing and in terms of what might happen to unemployment. And you know that unemployment is absolutely the leading indicator of home loan loss.</p>
          <p>So it's a much more sophisticated, but a three-year view rather than a one-year view, which we believe is a better way of stress testing what might happen, but it's over three years. So that's the explanation of what the two are. I'll just ask Alden to give a little bit more color.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you got it right, David, as always. And I think it's noteworthy that we do provide this much information on a very complicated test to give you a full understanding of a very big part of our balance sheet.</p>
          <p>The last part that I think of the question that we haven't yet addressed is the average PD for the portfolio as a whole is about 19 basis points, but that includes the mortgage insured, which would have slightly higher PD because of the higher LVR that's associated with it, although we still have good servicing quality to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Alden, just to confirm that six times the probability of default stress factor equals 19 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. One time is 19. So six times would be whatever that multiple is.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Thank you. Just interested in a couple of high level observations on the mortgage market from Ian. The first is you've pointed out what's happening to margins. The New Year started with a lot of political pressure on rates and also your funding costs so much higher. So I'm just interested if you've taken any steps yet or thought about any steps to ration credit to that segment given what's happening to ROEs?</p>
          <p>And then the second question, I see the risk weighting on home loans is down again overall to just over 15%. So I'm just interested in your view, Ian, whether your see that as conservative, whether you see more room for that to fall and does it still strike you as appropriate in this setting with the job offers that we're starting to see come through the economy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Matt. On the overall, yes, look, obviously we're in an interesting environment in terms of home loan pricing at the moment. One of the things we're talking a lot about today is just our view that somehow define the relationship between a bank and its customers by one rate on one product is really quite unique to the Australian environment, but obviously it's a reality of what we're doing, particularly we take all that into account.</p>
          <p>We look at that as &#x2013; the general customer view as one factor in our pricing. We also look at our funding costs and that led us to make the decision that we made on Monday in a competitive environment. As it is today, home loans are not as profitable right now as they were, but we've got continuing appetite to grow at a reasonable rate and we're not credit rationing into the home loan book.</p>
          <p>In terms of the risk weighting on home loans, I think the number looks about right. In this environment lot of people are saying, aren't things getting a lot worse, unemployment is ticking up slightly, but if you just have a look at the overall picture of credit quality in our retail book, we're pretty confident that the risk weighting that we got here is the right risk weighting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Brett Le Mesurier from BBY. Ian, can you comment on what you can see now as the major constraint to your business and has that changed from the time you were a division head to now being Group head?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The constraints &#x2013; the categories of constraints are pretty much the same. I mean, we've clearly got an environment where although we want to keep looking for the long-term, we've got responsibilities for short-term momentum. And therefore the natural ceilings on revenue growth can be a constraint on some activities. And we've got to keep watching it carefully. So we've got a commitment to keep investing. We are going to keep investing.</p>
          <p>But, in an environment where funding costs are what they are, revenue growths are what they are, we do have some constraints in our degrees of freedom to invest in everything that we would want to do. I don't think that significantly different from how it's been for the last few years, but obviously there's a lot of volatility around it. And that's something that we keep watching, but we keep trying within the balance of responsibility to smooth over to keep the long-term view.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Look, our competitor &#x2013; we are in a competitive environment. I think if you just look at deposit processing, we're in a competitive environment. Are they a constraint in what we do? No, they're not a constraint. We're obviously looking at what they do very regularly across all different parts of the business. We're also recognizing that as we go further into the future, the question of who our competitors are starts to change a little bit in some parts of the business. So we look at what they do very carefully, but we feel good about our relative competitive position.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just got a couple of questions on the web, Ian. So I'll just read them for you. Could you provide some clarity around the modest increase in consumer loan impairment expenses? Are you seeing any softness in specific buckets of the consumer loans or is it just a function of a softer economic backdrop?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, there were two aspects here that &#x2013; and I might invite Alden or David to add if there's anything I forgotten. Number one is, it's a bit of a business mix issue here. So although growth in home loans has been a bit subdued, growth in some of the personal lending and the credit cards has remained pretty good. They are good margin business. We're happy actually with the level of arrears we got here, but there are businesses, which naturally will lead to higher arrears and some impact on the loan impairment expense.</p>
          <p>The other aspect we've got here is that over time you can see that the pattern of a normal retail book that you see arrears go up and then sometimes as arrears come down, the ramp goes into the loan impairment expense and that's a natural flow. And there's a little bit of that happening at the moment where we're seeing the loan impairment expense inflated a bit as a result of previous arrears either at the same time as the arrears are coming down. But, overall, the net-net of this is, we are comfortable with way the retail book is. That is performing strongly, and as at today, the credit &#x2013; the overall credit quality looks good.</p>
