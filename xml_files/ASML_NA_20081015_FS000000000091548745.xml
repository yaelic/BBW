          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ASML 2008 Third Quarter Results Conference Call on October 15, 2008. Throughout today's introduction, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After ASML's introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig DeYoung. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This is Craig DeYoung, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications at ASML. I'd like to welcome you to our investor call and webcast.</p>
          <p>As the operator has mentioned, the subject of today's call is ASML's 2008 third quarter results.</p>
          <p>Hosting the call today are Eric Meurice, ASML's Chief Executive Officer, and Peter Wennink, ASML's Chief Financial Officer. Eric's joining us today from Tokyo, Japan. And I mention that just in case there's any technical difficulties where he gets separated from the call, we'll make sure that he rejoins it as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>I'd like to draw your attention now to the Safe Harbor statement contained in today's press release and third quarter results presentation, both of which you can find on our website at www.asml.com. The length of the call will be 60 minutes. And now at this point, I'd like to turn the call over to Eric Meurice for a brief introduction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Craig. Good afternoon, good morning and thank you for attending our Q3 2008 results conference call. Peter and I as usual, would like to provide an overview and some commentary on the quarter before we open up the call for questions. Peter will start with a review of the Q3 financial performance, with added comments on our full-term outlook. I will complete the introduction with some further details on our longer-term view.</p>
          <p>Following the introduction we will open up for questions. Peter, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone.</p>
          <p>First of all like Eric said, I would like to review our Q3 result highlights. The third quarter ended clearly in line with our guidance with revenues of EUR 696 million on the shipments of 37 systems, 26 of which were new and 11 were used. Amongst the new systems, 16 were the immersion systems supporting the strong levels of stable new systems, ASPs of EUR 21.6 million, and with the ASPs of all systems being EUR 16 million, which is the result of a larger portion of used systems sold in the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Our gross margin of 38.1% was consistent with the lower sales in this quarter versus the previous quarters, and along with our reduced operating expenses of EUR 180 million, our operation margin for Q3 was 12%, allowing for an operating margin year-to-date of close to 17%.</p>
          <p>We maintain a strong cash balance; at the quarter end it stands at 1.3 billion. We have debt of 600 million due in 2017, and we have a standby surety of EUR 500 million.</p>
          <p>Our bookings were nearly flat in units, quarter-on-quarter, with 31 system orders in Q3, 18 of which were new and 16 of which were immersion. Although we booked a larger number of used systems in the quarter, those systems did carry a high ASP of about EUR 7.7 million. This high used-system ASP was due to the fact that we booked four used XT:1700 immersion systems in the quarter, leading to a total booking value of close to EUR 500 million in Q3. This leaves us with a system backlog value at the quarter end of over EUR 1 billion.</p>
          <p>Now, the current worldwide financial turmoil and the significant overall economic uncertainty creates a situation in which our customers are reassessing their own capacity ramp-up plans and those of their strategic alliances. Furthermore, our customers are confronted with lower than expected demand, causing overcapacity, low memory product pricing, and important, a restricted access to capital, which limits their ability to ramp up to latest technology. Due to this wait-and-see attitude of our customers, we are unable to guide on short-term bookings or to give any type of midterm sales forecast.</p>
          <p>As mentioned before, a significant appetite for leading-edge lithography systems still exist, as memory makers have designs ready on further cost reductions through the shrink, while reducing online capacity at the same time, as we have seen, announcement of 200 millimeter capacity taken out. Also, Logic makers push for greater device performance through shrink off their feature sizes.</p>
          <p>We do expect that for a foreseeable future, virtually all customers will continue to postpone more leading-edge capacity additions. However, our current view is that the need for continued immersion investments amongst those customers that do have the capital structure to invest, should enable us to secure positive operating margins in the quarters to come. As such, we currently maintain a 27 immersion system order backlog with a value of EUR 750 million.</p>
          <p>In view of these customer issues I mentioned before, we plan to ship only 27, sorry, 26 systems in Q4, with an average selling price of EUR 16.5 million. On this lower shipment volume, our gross margin for the quarter will be approximately 36%. And this will allow us to end the year at the previously guided approximate 20% decline in ASML's full-year revenues, which by comparison will prove to show our performance versus many of our peers by the way.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we are determined to improve the efficiency of our R&amp;D efforts; we are not cutting our R&amp;D programs. And as such, we expect our R&amp;D expenditures will drop to about EUR 124 million in the fourth quarter. But further cost efficiencies are indeed expected. And as seen in Q3, we have further trimmed our SG&amp;A cost significantly, I would say. And we'll cut costs further to EUR 47 million in Q4. This represents a 19% reduction in two quarters, which I think is a clear evidence of our flexibility model. Also, in the area of production, we will reduce cost through supply chain management and through the use of flexible labor and contracted activities.</p>
          <p>I would like to remind you that also, as per our last call, discussions concluded with the Dutch tax authorities regarding the treatment of taxable income related to our patents have resulted in structurally lower effective corporate income tax rate in the coming years, and which will be at an estimate 20% annual tax charge.</p>
          <p>In summary, we remain cautious in an environment of global financial crisis and uncertain economic future. Fighting against product oversupply and falling product prices, our customers are struggling with their own business uncertainties. We are prepared to adapt our organization and cost structure such that we can weather whether these storms. But in this environment, we will keep a sharp focus on our technology programs by balancing efficiency and execution to make sure that our technology leadership is reinforced.</p>
          <p>I now turn back to Eric, who will give an outline on our technology progress, which I said is a key behind ASML's clear robustness. Eric?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. So Peter has highlighted the fact that in these very uncertain times, ASML is arguably doing better than competitors or peers in terms of yearly sales decline, in a very challenging environment. And this is a proof, a testament to ASML's strong product positioning in support of customer technology transitions, which result in high system average selling prices and continuous market share growth. Now that's a statement we've been doing, in fact, fairly good if you add up the fourth quarter of this year, which will be remembered in the industry as a bad year.</p>
          <p>But during this downturn, which is starting, we will continue, as Peter said, our strong investment in R&amp;D. But we will strive to be as efficient in that spend as possible, with a bit of adjustments and trimming and being made so that not to impact any strategic programs, but I would say get us to be more efficient. We will not touch any strategic programs, in particular, immersion, double patterning, and EUV.</p>
          <p>In immersion, our immersion business continues to show significant strength as we again shipped 16 systems this quarter, to -16 additional immersion orders. So it's pretty nice to have a book that we have won in this situation, leaving 27 immersion system in our backlog. We have shipped 46 immersion system year-to-date, and we now have more than 110 immersion system delivered to over 20 individual customers worldwide. So, clearly a leadership position.</p>
          <p>We expect that with immersion market leadership, we'll even strengthen as we go into 2009. We are introducing our new TWINSCAN XT:1950 immersion system, which thanks to a faster stage and an improved lens, has a performance increase of about 25% compared to its predecessor, the XT:1900. This makes this tool first, increasingly affordable for 55 nanometer and 45 nanometer processing, which is what the predecessor was capable of doing. But in addition, extend the performance of this machine to the 32 nanometer node.</p>
          <p>It is clear that this machine, with its unique lens, summarized by the numerical aperture of 135, and the overlay of four nanometer specification, this tool has no competitive tool match in existence or even announced by our competition.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have now today formally introduced our next-generation multiple ports platform, the NXT. It will have unprecedented speed of above 200 wafers per hour and overlay accuracy in the two nanometer range, and will begin to ship in mid-2009. It will be positioned first as a very advanced tool for double patterning, but will soon become the future cost-effective immersion platform of choice.</p>
          <p>Beyond immersion and beyond double patterning, and as reporting in our recent EUV conference in Lake Tahoe in California, we have achieved significant breakthroughs in our extreme UV program. As for productivity of the EUV Alpha Demo Tool, which we have shipped, as you know, in Albany, New York, and IMEC, this tool is now reaching initially targeted throughputs. And as light source suppliers are now confirming roadmaps, which enable system performance well beyond 100 wafers per hour.</p>
          <p>Starting in 2010, we will ship a 60 wafer-per-hour production EUV system, upgradable to 100 wafer per hour. System with even higher speed performance goals of more than 140 wafers per hour, at resolution of 22 nanometer and less, are on the roadmap for 2012 production. EUV will provide game-changing lithography cost dynamics, which will lead to widespread adoption of this technology by 2011, 2012. We will be well ahead when this market transitions takes place.</p>
          <p>In parallel to our focus on R&amp;D execution and as hinted by Peter, we plan to accelerate our operational efficiency program, so as to become an even stronger company capable of weathering the current crisis but deliver, deliver profit. And even, I would say, be more aggressive price wise. We have developed structural, manufacturing, and supply chain improvements, which are already starting to yield cycle time and cost improvement as we make short-term adjustment to our cost base using our embedded labor and contractor flexibility and Peter gave you two or three statistics.</p>
          <p>So although it is much too early to show optimism as to the economic environment, it is, however, important to notice the certain number of fairly positive development. The first one is euro weakening versus yen and the dollar, and as you know we are a euro company, our competitors are yen based and our customers are buying in dollars; so being, or becoming a price-aggressive company due to the weakening of the yen is a good thing. I remind everybody that the euro has appreciated versus the other currencies by a factor of 60 or 80% in the past four years.  We have weathered this appreciation and still gained market share and increased profitability. The fact that the tables are turning is in fact a very, very good encouraging possibility for us to proceed, giving even more value to our customers and probably even reinforcing our market share gain and protecting our margin. So it is good.</p>
          <p>The accelerated retirement of Flash and DRAM 200 millimeter capacity is also a good thing. You have heard a significant numbers of our customers have now announced the retiring of those fabs. You have DRAM fabs in China, in Korea, in Taiwan, in America, which have been retired. You have even Flash fabs in Korea and in America, which are being retired. This is unprecedented in the industry. This is in some ways bad news for our customer in the sense that the price pressure forced them to do so. But clearly, we are now witnessing a significant capacity shrink in this business, which is again a very good thing for the need for further CapEx.</p>
          <p>And then the third point, as we have mentioned it on a regular basis, the virtual stability of 300 millimeter capacity during the year 2008. In other terms, we and our competitors have not shipped in 2008 a lot of capacity built in Flash, DRAM or Logic; we have really much concentrated in technology transition capacity, but not so much in real square meter capacity increase.</p>
          <p>So in other terms, if you add to my point number two, which is retirement of 200 millimeter, and my point number three, which is the fact that we haven't added significant 300 millimeter capacity, you can consider that this all will contribute to a very healthy restart of the business when electronics and demand strengthen. That's the problem of the day. The end demand has tanked for the past say, two months or so. This has created a reaction in terms of CapEx build, but this reaction is healthy in a sense that it doesn't create overcapacity of any sort and allows us, I would say, a springboard of restart.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, it is natural that the CapEx industry like ours is impacted in the short-term, by the uncertainty of the overall semiconductor end demand. It is natural in the wait and see attitude or in the slowness of end products, CapEx is squeezed. Customers can always wait, sometimes a number of weeks or month and this is what we are having today. So a very natural position.</p>
          <p>However, we are confident that in the midterm future, due to our strong technology and market position which I talked about, and due to the current rationalization of the fab capacity worldwide, and in fact the acceleration of this rationalization, we are very confident about our midterm future.</p>
          <p>So on this, I would like to open this to questions. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thanks Eric. Ladies and gentlemen, the operator will instruct you momentarily on the protocol for the Q&amp;A session. But beforehand, I'd like to ask you to kindly limit yourself to one question with one short follow-up if necessary. This will allow us to get to as many callers as possible.</p>
          <p>Now operator, if we could have your instructions and then the first question please.</p>
        </plist>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. The first question comes from Mr. Menon. Please state your company name followed by your questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. It's Janardan Menon from Dresdner Kleinwort. It's a question on a couple of statements you've made. One is saying that you have some degree of confidence that you will be able to have a positive operating margin in coming quarters. On the back of the envelope, I calculate that you probably need about EUR 450 million or so of revenue to reach a breakeven.</p>
          <p>You've also said that 62% of your backlog will ship in the next two quarters, of which about 430 million is shipping in the current quarter. So that leaves you only about 213 million of revenue from your backlog to be shipped in Q1. I was just wondering, do you have enough visibility on your order intake in Q4 to ensure that you do get the remaining 240 million at least of orders with shipment dates of Q1 '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I was muted and I was starting to talk. So I think Peter should take the questions on your breakeven, etc. That's a good question; I can take the question on the bookings. So, go ahead, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On your first question, I would like to refer to our guidance on Q4, just above EUR 500 million sales level with a 4% operating profit. We have to have between three and five. So, yes, I mean if you do your math and you include, so all the cost reductions that I talked about, I think your assessment is a reasonable one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you do have enough visibility that you will get that much of order released, I mean...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's what Eric will answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. At this moment, we, again, the key message that we giving to you today is we have a serious uncertainty regarding timing of all these projects which we've been working on with different partners in the industry. So the timing is the issue.</p>
          <p>But the size of the business in 2009, we are comfortable that at least for instance, immersion is going to strengthen and probably grow compared to this year. So in Q1, achieving an additional 240 million or so booked into Q4 is clearly within reach.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a follow-up, you took in quite a lot of orders from a major U.S. IDM as per your backlog statements in your presentation. How do you see your market share development at that IDM, and is it something that makes you confident about 2010 at this point in time, the kind of orders you've got?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So certainly this is a very large IDM as you can imagine, and this is an area which we &#x2013; a customer that we've said we are developing a potential entry into a very large node, which will ramp into 2010. So the fact that we got, I would say, the first order for this process, gives us confidence that we have a high chance of winning a large part here. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you will regain market share that you may be losing in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, Mr. Gaudois. Please state your company name followed by your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi there, Nic Gaudois, UBS. Just a first question, coming back on immersion probably growing basically next year versus this year. What gives you this level of confidence, Eric? I guess there were two questions in my mind about, where we are now, immersion is partly dependent on capacity requirements not only as shrinks from existing capacity, but also importantly, even some of your reasonably large customers may actually struggle to have a balance sheet to necessarily do the shrink they would like to do. And in other words might see some delay in shrink road maps, so maybe if you could help us a little bit on that would be useful, and I've got a more specific follow-up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The reason why we believe that there is growth in immersion next year is because the numbers of engines where you need immersions is much bigger than &#x2013; in 2009 that it is in 2008. So you are right to say, however, if 2009 is economically challenging, these engine will be tamed a bit, but there are so many of them that we expect this to, the numbers of opportunities to win against the, I would say, the difficult economic situation.</p>
          <p>So let me give you more color. Obviously, if you talk about the first-tier DRAM customers, mainly in Korea, they have to run the new technologies in DRAM, and at this moment there is a key set of projects to move beyond 5X in first-tier DRAM. So that's an engine that we did not expect. And it somehow is triggered by the recession, the need to in fact show even faster transitions.</p>
          <p>The second set of customers, which you can call second-tier DRAMs, those guys have not invested anything in immersion this year in particular because of the difficulty of accessing cash, as Peter say, as you say. But it is now vital for them to do so, because they cannot let the first tier take two years ahead of them and potentially even get into another node why they haven't yet transitioned at all into immersion.</p>
          <p>So are they going to get cash? Well, you may have heard in Japan that PEDA has now secured 1.7 or $1.6 billion of cash from a set of banks here, so this I think is resolved. You've heard Micron has been securing cash with its partner in Taiwan, Nanya, and they have also resolved the strategic questions about where they are going to put all those tools. As you have heard, they have now at last taken a decision on the acquiring of the Inotera share they didn't own and that gives them a significant springboard.</p>
          <p>By the way, as you know, we have 100% share at Inotera at this moment. So we are very satisfied with this development, and again this environment in Nanya, Inotera, Micron, has no immersion of volume I would say at this moment. And these are leaders in what they do and they have secured cash. So you know that something is cooking.</p>
          <p>You were talking about Kimonda. Kimonda is obviously in a weak environment at this very moment. They are looking at their options in terms of partnership, but they just got $350 million of cash due to their sale of Inotera, and they have potentially already got some immersion tools from us at this moment. And the question is how much in fact, how many tools can they really afford? But they have to move. So you've got that segment, which I would add, will include one more, two more Taiwanese who are being financed by first-tier players. So that I would say, would give us a second engine.</p>
          <p>The third engine is the Logic engine; you've obviously, in fact Janardan mentioned the significant order for immersion tool that we received from this American IDM and that will be shipped into next year. And you have, you can guess that we are shipping effectively to the companies doing what is now called computational scaling. It's another big word to say lots of immersion tools, and that has to start and will start in Q1 and Q2 of next year.</p>
          <p>You add to this foundry, which at this very moment is limited by end demand, but as you know, this 2009 is a year of transition, to immersion, and I estimated the volume to be about one tool a month. I don't think we would be very far from this. Maybe I make a mistake in the Q1 timeframe, again, because my timing may be impacted by the recession. So all together, if you sum these opportunities, you should be above year 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. So that's good. Very comprehensive. Now on the more of a detailed question, if we look at the revenues you got from immersion in the quarter divided by the number of tools shipped, we get to an ASP of about EUR 28.5 million, that's down from 29.3 recorded before and first year recorded before that. Is there anything mix related which explains that, and how should we look at ASPs next year with the introduction, of course, of a 1950?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So at this moment, one of the reasons of ASP deterioration, I would say, in immersion, would be mixed with used tool, because we are starting to have a fairly interesting and lucrative used tool business. The other part is that we are now, I would say, customizing some of the tools for different nodes. And you know that in the Logic arena, they don't make full use of the 1.35 NA lens, and we are offering some special price for degraded lenses, again to maintain the margin.</p>
          <p>So ASP wise, it would be natural to cover now a bigger range or bigger mix of products, used plus I would say, customized Logic products, and then 1950s, which cost more than 30, and with this come up with depending on the quarter, an ASP which will be more or less high. But again, this is done so that we would try to maintain the margin. Although the margin is of course under pressure not so much because of that, but because of the overall situation where if you have a minimum demand, of course the customers, it's a customer-driven market more than a supplier-driven market obviously.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks a lot, it's Goldman Sachs. I wanted to ask about, really, more the cost side of the equation. I think you mentioned, Peter, that perhaps you could expect some type of further cost efficiencies; I think you're more talking about gross margin. But if you were to find out that perhaps the cycle as we see it today is lasting around current levels or low levels for some time, how much aggressiveness could you show on the operating expense side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if it gives you any indication, we in the factory currently still have 20% of the workforce on contract. So that's basically contracted activities. So that is, in principle, if it lasts longer, and we need to go to lower business volume level, that is the first thing where we can go.</p>
          <p>We have, in SG&amp;A, of course we are trending, but we are close to 28% in two quarters. So that is where we probably could do a few million, but that's not going to a major, to add a lot of money to the bottom line.</p>
          <p>In the supply chain management, we have started since the beginning of the year quite an extensive and comprehensive program on reducing cost. So that's now running for almost eight months. We will see the first benefits of that coming in in the first quarter of next year. So that's basically the cost of goods, what we, what we basically purchase. And so that's where a level of flexibility is.</p>
          <p>And we have about 50% of our R&amp;D cost is flexible. But like I said currently, and what Eric also said on the expectation of our immersion business next year, we do not anticipate to make major cuts in our R&amp;D programs. So although we do have that flexibility, we are not planning to basically use it as of today. But, and it means that it is there. And...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...if we would see, if we would see as a major prolonged downturn in the industry, and our customers will be cutting their R&amp;D, or at least pushing their R&amp;D programs back, because they need to do something, we will be doing the same. And we will be able to adjust our cost levels.</p>
          <p>So of the operating expense side in the factory, we still have about 20% in the workforce. We have extensive and comprehensive cost reduction programs in the supply chain, and we still have that, let's say famous 50% flex in R&amp;D, which is probably the last item we will ever touch.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood, thank you. And my second question, and I realize you don't want to talk about customer-specific projects, but AMD obviously got a very significant outside investment and looks as if it really is going to be some type of additional foundry fare in the field, which is changing the dynamics a little bit. When you look at that, does that become, or when would that conceivably become impactful given that historically, of course, you've had a pretty tight relationship with AMD?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Eric, you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, certainly. I think the first news that we have to take, which is a good news, is that AMD will be able to do more in their business before we talk about foundry. So that is the first good news and this is part of my optimism about 2009. They clearly will have to build a immersion capacity for next year for their own needs. And that's again, as I say, a very good business.</p>
          <p>I will not comment about whether they are coming into the foundry business. We'll develop an opportunity. It's first a question about what it is. What's your business model? What product are they going to deliver? What's the alliances they are going to create to get some customers, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
          <p>This again, at this moment, I cannot comment. I would say, the way we simulate the business, for us is to say that to try to see, to make a scenario as to how much silicon will be consumed, and then we would not be concerned about who manufactures the silicon. So in other terms, if AMD takes market share out of TSMC or vice versa, we probably will be very much not impacted; we will supply either player.</p>
          <p>So at this moment, we are very satisfied about AMD itself capable of investing in their future and developing a good technology, good new process for their own chips.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you. A silly couple of things. First of all, if I take and I look at the number of litho systems that you're shipping relative to the number of units being produced out there, and if I do some normalization for some wafer sizes and some increases in throughput on the tools, you see that you're shipping roughly 50% less systems per chip unit being produced than even in the big downturn during '01.</p>
          <p>So I'm wondering, A) that would argue that there's going to be a pretty robust snapback here off the bottom, but B) I'm wondering, part of that's obviously cyclical, but is any of that secular in that, there just is not going to be the same number of systems ordered per unit even after you make all those adjustments, because of customer consolidation or some secular issue? Or do you in fact think that it's cyclical and that there's going to be a huge recovery off the bottom as a result?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, we vote for the snapback. We have a simulation system, as you know, which so far has been pretty good at telling us when we have overcapacity or under capacity and that our system basically says that, in view of the consistent shrink roadmap, if the customer uses it there isn't going be a need for machines at a much, much higher rate in particular, because you are going to start hitting this correction of lack of capacity, I would say.</p>
          <p>And the need for double patterning, which multiply the machine to two, by two, and the fact that you may have heard the industry is starting to be worried that shrinking will create yield issues. It's going to be pretty hard to get the same amount of dyes out of each of the wafers, and that also goes in the favor of having more tools.</p>
          <p>So the secular curve is still showing us an opportunity to reach our famous EUR 5 billion sales. But at this moment I know, in view of the fear of recession, we are now talking about breakeven and levels of 2 billion or 2.5 billion or 3 billion, but the numbers, the theoretical numbers steer us towards 5 billion within the next two to three years from now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then I guess just as a follow-up. Pretty much everybody on the sales side seems to be very, very negative on your stock, and yet if this is as bad as it gets, it's, you're probably not going to lose money. If you do, you obviously wouldn't lose very much. So you're kind of sitting on this fairly significant cash balance. So I'm wondering, how do you think about a buyback from here given how negative the street is, given that the stock doesn't seem to react any more to bad news? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, I have to repeat the answer that we gave three months ago. I mean, we have a clear financial policy that says if the cash balance of the company goes outside the bandwidth that we have given, then that excess cash will be returned to the shareholders. There's nothing new. So that will happen. Now, the issue is that, can we do regular share buybacks? I said it last time also, we are still, let's say from a different withholding tax point of view, we are not allowed to do regular share buybacks. So we need to do that through a synthetic structure like we had in 2007, which actually is surrounded with a lot of logistical and legal issues that you don't want to do that for a small number.</p>
          <p>So, if we're outside the bandwidth of our cash balance, and it's a reasonable sized number, than we could do the same level of synthetic buyback as we did last year and we will do so. But also under the current circumstances, it is important to stay within our financial parameters, as we have clearly outlined to the market and to the rating agencies and basically to ourselves and to the shareholders. So currently we stay within that, and we stick to the quoted policy.</p>

          <p>At this moment you know that ProMOS is working on going into this, so that's one. Winbond doing the same, Kimonda is already in prototyping, so we'll need to run production.

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes hello, good afternoon, it's Gunab Parker at Numero. You talked a lot about supplier-based efficiency programs, and I think you said that they helped in Q3 to achieve the 38% gross margin. So could you talk a little bit about how these programs work and how much further scope we can expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the programs are not designed out of raw cost cutting; it's a, we need 5% less or 10% less. It is really the coordination between the supplier, our R&amp;D group, and the factory organization in looking at the designs, looking at the way that they source their products and see where areas are that we can take cost out. So it's quite an extensive and integral program that we have with R&amp;D, our system engineering group, and the factory <mark type="inaudible" />. It's a very detailed model that we have and basically covering the whole machine.</p>
          <p>But we have had cost reduction targets over the last year of about 10% on average, which is actually something that we of course strive to do every year. But like I said, when we have new introductions, new module introductions, it is easier to get cost out than when you try to get cost out of a more mature module that we already have for years.</p>
          <p>Same is true for the lens, with Carl Zeiss. I mean we are almost two companies one business, we're almost fully integrated, and there we are constantly looking for cost reduction opportunities, because the lenses in our most advanced tools are close to 50% of the total cost of the tool.</p>
          <p>So, it's pretty granular. That's why it's difficult to give you a kind of a high-level overview of what it's going to be. But clearly it's focusing on the lenses and the newest modules.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in fact it is very important that you asked the question. I think I forgot to mention, and Peter. Powerchip obviously is one of the DRAM vendors who are driving into 5X. So as you know they publicly are also driving a shrink of 6X, but they are also ramping 5X for next year. So sorry for having forgotten them.</p>
          <p>The fact that I am in Tokyo means that I can report that we are making positive progress. As you know, we are being evaluated for 5X and for Elpida Powerchip and the progress is, are positive, going in the right direction, in terms of the recognition of Elpida Powerchip about the performance of the machine. So at this moment I cannot say more than that except that reporting good progress.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning everyone. It's Lee Simpson from Jefferies. Maybe if I could just ask a quick overarching question on pricing. I mean, if there's some certainty that we're seeing, the downturn as you call it, is going to set to continue. If there's any sort of consolidation or alliance rationalization, and we see an extra pause in CapEx, and you guys are, also seem to be quite fixed on where your R&amp;D levels can go to, at least on just efficiency gains. How far back can ASML cut on these unusual pricing that you could do to help customers? What's the sort of acceptable levels for you guys going into 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, there is no acceptable level to sell a product below the value. So the whole game in discussion with customers even under pressure is to compare our value to our competitors' value. At this moment, the players, so there is Nikon, Canon and <mark type="inaudible" />, are clearly fighting the war of specifications.</p>
          <p>It does happen, however, that when we get into some non-critical layer, we are equivalent in terms of performance and on non-critical, we &#x2013; hunger makes you to be more aggressive than in a normal situation. So that is where I was telling you about the price pressure.</p>
          <p>Again, we are protected by the value of the critical layer, but it is true that we may be losing a certain numbers of points of margin, but never to a level where we would this moment consider this absolutely ridiculous.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It was interesting, the continued use of used tools in immersion, and what we saw in 2Q, we're seeing again in 3Q, I think with foundries taking it this time. Is this an interesting development we should be mindful of as far as ASPs into next year? Perhaps again a helping hand from ASML to its customer base? And can you talk us through how that might continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It is, as you know, two things. One is the used model is a good model for ASML, has worked for a long time. We are shipping about 10 used tools per quarter. Some goes to semiconductors, some go to related-type industry. We make money on the refurbishment of those machines. So it's appropriate margin, and we solve a problem of the customer.</p>
          <p>Immersion has become an opportunity because you have different segments with different needs. Very obviously, Flash is driving immersion to its max, DRAM next and Logic next. So we are creating opportunities for Logic to buy I would say, older type machines. And we, when that was discovered with a foundry, we were very happy to oblige. Because it's not so much a machine that you lose, it's a machine that you place differently.</p>
          <p>So in other terms you buy back a machine with only two to three years of usage in a Flash environment or a DRAM environment. You replace this machine with your latest and greatest and you refurbish and sell to the foundry business. So it's not like you lose a machine, in fact, you sell the big machine where it's most needed, and that, by the way, is another system to avoid margin erosion.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And is also, <mark type="inaudible" /> don't think that there's an abundance of supplier on those tools. I mean, we can do it from time to time, but it doesn't mean that everybody coming by wanting a U1700, that the 1700 is indeed available. Yeah.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just one quick final question on the sort of financial malaise. We're hearing now that shipping is down 70% Q-on-Q. Distribution could be an issue over the next month. I just wonder if there's anything in 4Q, given line of credits and so forth amongst being an issue in some of the Chinese ports, albeit at commodities just now. Do we see any sort of legal resilience in your documentation that makes you immune to any of these issues in line of credit and the distribution that we're seeing?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not specifically. I must also say I'm a bit puzzled about your question, because it's not something that is currently on my table; it might be that we're not seeing something, but at least it hasn't been brought to my attention.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. I mean, you're aware that a lot of ports are not actually shipping a lot of resource at this time given that some people aren't accepting other companies' lines of credit. I'm not being specific about your line of credit, for instance, but maybe the distributors that you use for instance. Is any of this..?</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Actually, my first question is on DRAM. If I look at the balance sheets of just three DRAM vendors, and I know you've mentioned that some of them are going to move to the 5X because they have to. If I look also at the spot even today, down another 5%, it looks like the elasticity of DRAM pricing is not helping any more. And I think those guys, those tier-three DRAM guys are pretty reliant on basically the spot market. So I'm just wondering what's your thoughts are on that and whether those guys are not going to run into so much financial difficulty that really the only way out is a major consolidation, which eventually would be good for the DRAM market, maybe less good for ASML?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, you are correct. The pressure is such on the profitability at every level that if they continue like this, not all of them can survive. I mean, this, I think they would all tell you this with a question mark for you to answer as to who are the weaker ones and who are the ones who will sustain this, and in fact benefit from this consolidation.</p>
          <p>Is it a problem for ASML? I would not think so. This is a business where these companies, all of them, are extremely efficient in terms of CapEx usage. So if you sell to one account or two accounts, if the one account is two times bigger than the two accounts, or whether &#x2013; it's the same need, same amount of square meters of silicon with the same machine.</p>
          <p>So if you are referring to customer power, customer power is as good as competitive power, I would guess. And at this moment, I would not see a difference between the current situation where we have, I would say, six customers in DRAM, and if we would have five, or even four. The fight between six or four in terms of what you call customer power is definitely due the same.</p>
          <p>It's really much depend on the fight that we have with our competitors. And as I said, at this moment, the fight is definitely beyond spec, is particularly in DRAM by the way, much more than in any segment. So we are able to sustain this without a detrimental price war.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And I'd like to add to that, if I may Deejay and Eric. It's also one of the reasons why you hear us saying that we keep a very sharp focus on the technology programs, whether it's the ISD program, whether it's the EUV program. If there is a consolidation in the industry, then it's extremely important that we remain the most viable partner for those customers in the industry because there is still a lot of competition between the three or four or five remaining players.</p>
          <p>And that means that they are all looking for the technology that gives them the best cost advantage. And that means we need to have a roadmap that we can execute that is better than anything else. So yes, you are right that, in principle, that you could say if the market has fewer players to have a bigger buying power, but it's also something else playing.</p>

          <p>Okay. And just a quick follow-up on immersion. It's fascinating, obviously, this transition, and you've given a lot of drivers for immersion business to go up next year. I'm just wondering if you would look at the refurbished immersion business, today you talked about four. You need bookings for the 1700s refurbished. I mean, do you think that the incremental growth in '09 would primarily come from refurbished units or do you think that you will get growth even in your 1900, 1950, let's say, new equipment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like I said earlier, I don't think, don't exaggerate the supply of the 1700s. We have shipped 50 1700s in total. Don't think that they will all come available to be shipped to other places of the world. Some of them are being run in real anger at the customer fabs and they will not be pulled out.</p>
          <p>So I think we will see some opportunities to basically get a supply of 1700s used once, which we can then resell. But I don't think that that is going to, let's say, have a major impact, that that's going to be the big driver why the immersion market in 2009 would actually grow. I think there is an underlying growth trend that Eric talked about that, I think extensively, that is much stronger than just the refurbished market</p>

          <p>Next question is from Mr. Mehdi Hosseini. Please state your company name followed by your question. Mr. Hosseini, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Mehdi Hosseini from FBR Capital Markets. I have a question about your activities, R&amp;D activity, beyond immersion. Can you please help us understand, about competitive land escape beyond immersion and to what extent do you expect competition to rise up when we get to that point in the next several years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is a very nice question. Obviously we feel very good about your question, because it gives us more opportunities. Let me explain.</p>
          <p>Today in the market, you will see the Flash and DRAM segment pushing very, very hard for EUV, and you will see the Logic people, driven by IBM in particular and Intel, but as a, with a separate company pushing for computational scaling, which is another way of saying double patterning with a significant amount of lithography, call it lithography-enabling designs. These are not conflicting. They are trying to solve two different problems; in the DRAM/Flash, you need very quickly new solutions. You need to shrink as much as possible, and there are two or three limiters in the designs that makes computational scaling not in fact solving your problems. So you need EUV. In the Logic arena, you could use EUV, but EUV may arrive about six months late to the timing of some customers and therefore there may be no other choice but trying to prolong immersion by computational scaling.</p>
          <p>So ASML is thrilled, because first of all, EUV, as I said, it's a game changer, it's all in our hands. If we succeed to deliver six months earlier and at the cost target I talked about in my little discussion, then we have the business for two years probably for us. We will sell on technology, that is the fact that it shrinks; we will sell on cost because that thing is much, much more cost effective than computational scaling. But in addition, we think that it is possible that EUV therefore missed by six months or so, some good designs and we want to hit it with computational scaling.</p>
          <p>And this is where we are going to get a very large value added through our acquisition Brion, which allows us to do two things. One, selling, which is service to the customer, which is how to basically scale, how to do the job of design integrated to lithography. And two, that allows us to integrate onto each of the machine a certain numbers of features of metrology and features of programmability which we are going to sell.</p>
          <p>So it's an additional profit generator and ASP enhancer opportunity. So that is also part of our R&amp;D. We're putting a significant amount of money into this and we also expect to be a leader. We have not seen yet significant activity by our competitors on this one, on this segment also. So...</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...we're doing this and we expect to start reaping profit of the EUV and computational scaling, sometime by 2010.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse my lack of understanding about technology, but EUV is still requiring a mask, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, do you see a renaissance for mask-less technology?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there are two competing, not two competing, two potential threats to photon lithography as we are executing. One is E-Beam, electron beam, driven mainly by a small start-up called Map Up in Holland, very much a neighbor of ours, and sponsored and supported by GSMC. There has been a press release yesterday on the subject. And the other options would be Imprint, driven by a small start-up in the U.S. mainly and sponsored by Toshiba.</p>
          <p>Those two technologies are interesting potential technology, which we have assessed and probably most of the market have assessed the same way that we have, for a good usage in lab environment. I don't think the industry and even those players can trace a roadmap towards high volume production.</p>
          <p>There may be an opportunity, and we at ASML would be interested to participate and would be able to integrate because as you know we are integrators. But at this moment, it seems that the technology and the proof of concept does not really get to be a significant threat in I would say mass production. But as a lab tool it would be a good thing. So this is why you would consider like GSMC and Toshiba does, that it's not a bad thing to have the possibility of lab prototypes, prototyping machine, which allows you to test your design early enough and at a lower price, obviously, than the production machine.</p>
          <p>But at this moment as I say, I would, if you look at the vote by the industry about the different technologies of the future and this is why I was mentioning the two big discussion is around EUV and computational scaling. These are the two, I would say, big ones on which the industry as of this moment aligning.</p>
