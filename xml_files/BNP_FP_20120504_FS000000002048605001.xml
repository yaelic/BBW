          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas First Quarter 2012 Results. For your information this conference is being recorded. Supporting slides are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relation website www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I'd like now to hand the call over to Lars Machenil, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to our first quarter results presentation. For those of you that I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting, I'm the new CFO of BNP Paribas having taken over from Philippe Bordenave at the beginning of March. Philippe as you all know has become the COO of the group and I would like to publicly thank him for all the knowledge he has passed on to me and for his unending support. Nevertheless there might still be some items on which I will have to look up the figures, but I hope you bear with me.</p>
          <p>Now let's move to the results and as has become customary, I do not intend to comment each and single slide in the presentation. But I would like to make a few introductory remarks on the key features of our quarterly results and then hand it over to your questions.</p>
          <p>So if I take a bird's eye view to the first quarter of the year, which have seen a good rebound in many areas, compares to the lows of the second part of 2011, but overall we have not really come back yet to the levels of early 2011. In particular though, in our domestic markets we have observed a dynamic commercial activity which has led to growing volumes both in terms of loans and in terms of deposits.</p>
          <p>If I look at capital markets, we saw good resilience with revenues climbing back almost to the level of the first quarter 2011. Then, our strict risk management approach meant that we managed to keep cost of risk at the low level of 55 basis points, compared to customer loans as you know we report them. This was essentially in line with the quarterly average of 2011, of course if we exclude Greece.</p>
          <p>In the first quarter, as you noticed, we booked a significant deal in our deleveraging plan, namely the sale of 28.7% of Kl&#xE9;pierre, which was finalized in preparation for the switch to Basel 3, which will no longer account for the minority interest in the computation of the solvency ratios. But I remind you that the gross capital gain generated amounted to &#x20AC;1.8 billion, but has had with no tangible benefits under Basel 2.5, but with a true benefit only under Basel 3.</p>
          <p>So if we exclude from the quarterly results some significant or exceptional impacts of which the two most relevant ones are Kl&#xE9;pierre that I just said and the other one being the own debt revaluation, which impacted the accounts for around &#x20AC;840 million. So if we correct for those and some others you can find them back in the slides, we arrive at a net incomes or earnings of around &#x20AC;2 billion for the quarter.</p>
          <p>And on that object of the own debt revaluation, which impacted negatively of course, I wish to remind you that BNP Paribas will calculate this on market replacement value and so this impact basically reflects the improvement in the market conditions at which BNP funds itself.</p>
          <p>So if I now take you through a couple of slides and particularly if I can ask you to cast your eyes on slide four, where you basically see the key elements, you see that by the end of March, we have completed 80% of our adaptation plan. I remind you the adaptation plan has objective to improve with 100 basis points the core Tier I ratio, so we have done 80% and of course this has ramifications on Basel 2.5 as well. And we have a handsome 10.4% core Tier I ratio.</p>
          <p>Also our US dollar plan to deleverage for $65 billion has been achieved when we include the sale of RBLs or the reserve-based lending to Houston activities. So I would say we are quite well on track for those.</p>
          <p>Before switching into the evolution of the businesses, allow me to give you a quick update on the solvency, the liquidity and other elements around it. So if I can ask you to flip or slide depending on the device you are to slide seven. And on slide seven, we look at the solvency or the adaptation plan as it impacts the solvency. And as I just said, we have achieved 80% of the overall plan where under other activities you find back the sale basically of Kl&#xE9;pierre and retail you find the progress with respect to leading and Personal Finance. You know these are the elements for which there are also adaptation plans in being rolled out.</p>
          <p>And then in CIB, we have the reserve-based lending deal that we talked about in the US that we have sold to Wells Fargo, and in addition to that of course, we have further reduced the risk-weighted assets by &#x20AC;6 billion in the quarter. And of course all these elements had some impact on the P&amp;L so we will see that as &#x20AC;84 million in terms of adaptation costs. The costs are impacted in this quarter by &#x20AC;84 million due to all these adaptation plans and of which roughly two-thirds are at CIB and then there is also &#x20AC;74 million impact related to the sale of &#x20AC;2 billion worth of assets. So that is part of the &#x20AC;6 billion that I talked about. There is &#x20AC;2 billion that came from sales and which had a little discount and so led to a loss, a one-off loss of &#x20AC;74 million. So that is the status of the overall implementation plan, adaptation plan.</p>
          <p>So if I can ask you to now cast your eyes on the next slide, which is eight, which is still on the solvency. I wanted to give you a quick update on the sovereign exposure. As you know the sovereign exposure in particularly is impacted under Basel 3 as its sensitivity involves to the changes in the capital ratios as it will no longer be filtered out as it is today. And what you see is that we basically have reduced it. We stand at the end of April, we stand at an exposure of &#x20AC;66 billion. You can see that &#x2013; well, in the appendix you will see that we have basically reduced it in most countries and also with respect to Greece and PSI we have tendered our Greek government bonds in line with the exposure and you will see in the details that our exposure to Greece has reduced to around &#x20AC;200 million. So we consider this chapter closed.</p>
          <p>Lastly and this is just for your information, we have also introduced the reporting of the sovereigns in what is called group share view which is basically representing the economic risk of the exposure of the shareholders. As you know, we have minority shareholders. If we do as what we do at the P&amp;L, we reflect the minority shareholders out of that. You will see that basically our exposure at end of April stands at &#x20AC;58 billion of which 42 is in the Eurozone, but you can find all the details of it line-by-line in the appendix.</p>
          <p>Then on the slide nine, the balance sheet. So the balance sheet, you see the evolution of the cash balance sheet. I know that you know the concept of how it works. We basically net our balance sheet and then we basically represent the real elements which need funding.</p>
          <p>I would like to make a little remark. You will see that under the title, it used to say excluding Kl&#xE9;pierre and insurance and it now says banking prudential scope. This is just a small change into the reporting but we basically ensured that the cash balance sheet is fully in line with the banking prudential scope and so this will make it easier going forward to link the cash balance sheet to the balance sheet because they are now entirely in the same banking prudential scope. So meaning without insurance and also without Kl&#xE9;pierre and we restated end of December for Kl&#xE9;pierre being in the &#x2013; reflecting it the way it is today, no longer consolidated.</p>
          <p>So if we look at this, what do we see? We see that the surplus between the client deposits so you wish and the client loans has increased to &#x20AC;51 billion, up from &#x20AC;31 billion last time. And so what basically do we see? Well, you see the increase in the deposit at central banks. This is a bit continuing on what I said earlier. We reduce the sovereign and we of course increase it at the deposits at the central banks which is more advantages under Basel III.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, you see the fixed income securities, that increased, and this might be a little bit peculiar, because I just told you that the sovereigns have reduced. But you should remember that in that caption, fixed income securities, we also do net for the repos. And so basically, the reduction of the sovereign is offset by the fact that we have less repos. So we basically reduce that amount, we net it for a lower amount as we have less repos. Why is this? This is because there is this increase in the short term funding from the LTRO, the second one. And also some return from money market funds, so we basically had less recourse to the repos in the ALM business and that is how it is reflected in here.</p>
          <p>Moreover you see that the trading assets with clients have reduced which is what we wanted to do, as well as the customer loans. If I switch to the other side of the balance sheet, you see that the MLT funding evolved in line with the natural run-off and that the client deposits are slightly up and finally the equity is just reflecting the earnings and the AFS reevaluation. And as just a little remark, if we would do this in U.S. dollars, the surplus reached US$38 billion in line with the achieving of the deleveraging in dollar.</p>
          <p>So that is basically it. If I sum it up on the liquidity which is on slide 29, you see that we have further increased our liquidity buffers in the first quarter. And so, our liquid assets reserve immediately available now stands at &#x20AC;201 billion, up from &#x20AC;160 billion at the year-end and so it basically almost covers our short-term wholesale funding. And you will also observe the &#x20AC;78 billion deposits that we have in the central banks out of which $41 billion with dollars with the Fed.</p>
          <p>And so a quick update also on our MLT funding program, where by mid-April, we basically have funded three quarters of our &#x20AC;20 billion program for the whole of 2012 and you can see that this has an average maturity of around six years and an average price related to mid swap of 111 basis points.</p>
          <p>So lastly with respect to that, there is a cost of risk. If you turn to slide 11, you will see that what I mentioned at the beginning. We were successful in keeping the cost of risk at a low level, essentially stable compared to the previous quarter and to the quarterly average of 2011, basically the result of continued low levels at CIB in the French and the Belgian retail banking. And you observe that in Italy showed a moderate increase related to the adverse economic environment. And you will also see that in Europe-Mediterranean the cost of risk remains somewhat high in particularly due to the situation in Ukraine and BancWest and Personal Finance both showed an improvement.</p>
          <p>So if I can just ask you on page 30 to wrap up this first part, which basically sums it up. So it says that all the activities of the first quarter lead us to a Basel 2.5 common equity Tier I ratio which increased by 80 basis points, reaching in the first quarter 10.4% and so basically benefiting from both capital strengthening and risk-weighted asset reduction. If I simplify the evolution and I say that Kl&#xE9;pierre has a limited &#x2013; the disposal of Kl&#xE9;pierre has a limited impact, then I would synthesize the evolution as follows, saying that stated &#x20AC;2 billion of profit that I mentioned as being corrected for Kl&#xE9;pierre which I take out and the revaluation of own debt which doesn't play, then you basically see that 25 basis points of the improvement is coming out of this &#x20AC;2 billion profit. I take into account the 25% pay-out assumption and then there is 50 basis points roughly, which is coming from the RWA reduction and this RWA reduction is mainly driven by the adaptation plan, but also the low level of market risk.</p>
          <p>And in a nutshell, if you would from the Basel 2.5, reduct the EBA buffer, which stands at 40 basis points and you know that by June, whatever the number is, has to be above 9%. Today, it stands for BNP Paribas at 10%, so that's gives us confidence sailing into the second quarter.</p>
          <p>And just to sum it up in slide 31, we remind you of the elements bridging to Basel 3. Given what I would say the uncertainties around CRD4, although one might hope that the ministers of finance made progress yesterday and that things might crystallize, but as long as it hasn't done, we stick to our interpretation of CRD4, which you know is based on the so called Danish Proposal. And you basically see the roll forward and you see, although there are uncertainties, but if mathematically all these elements would play out, as we have drafted for you, you see the amount of organic profit generation that we need in order to reach the 9%. But we remain around the 9%, given the uncertainties about many elements in there.</p>
          <p>So that is a bit, if I will put it, the view of the corporate side of BNP Paribas. If I now spend a couple of words on the business side of BNP Paribas in the first quarter. And I will do this starting at slide 15, where I start with the retail banking or more specifically I'll start with domestic markets. And as a reminder, these segments basically consist of three key markets which is France, Italy, Belgium, but it also contains Luxembourg retail and some specialized activities which are personal investors, Arval and leasing.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on slide 15, business activity remains sustained. Deposits grew at an average 3.6% with an improvement basically in all businesses. We continued to develop our cash management businesses where we are the leader in Europe in the Eurozone and at the same time we continue to assure financing to our clients with loans increasing by nearly 3%, towards trend points to a slowing demand of course in the recent months. But that is where we stand and this lift in volumes contributed to achieve a positive result in terms of revenues which progressed to close &#x2013; close to 1% despite lower financial fees due to the market situation and also the decline in Arval's used vehicle prices. You know that vehicle prices is basically fee valued to its park of vehicles and given the lowering of these prices, that has an effect on the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Costs remained closely under control, decreasing by 0.7% if I look at the constant scope, hence the gross operating income showed a 3% increase with the jaw effects stood at 1.5pt which we always find pleasing. So that is the result as they stand. And despite an increase in the cost of risk which in any case compared to a lowest base in Q1 2011, pre-tax income held up well and showed a small plus sign year-on-year.</p>
          <p>If I look in particularly to the three main countries, in France deposits were up 3.5% helped by strong performance in the savings accounts. Loan growth was even a little bit higher at 5% particularly driven by corporate activities, and revenues were driven by the net interest income, or fees as I mentioned before were affected by the lower financial markets as well as some regulatory impact. And then effective cost control lead to an improvement in the operating efficiency and cost income ratio improving as you can see, and the pre-tax income topping &#x20AC;600 million as the cost of risk is still low.</p>
          <p>In Italy, BNL banca commerciale saw 1.6% growth in deposit driven in particular by corporate and local authorities, whilst if you look at the figures, the individual current accounts we actually gained a little bit of market share as we managed to contain &#x2013; to decrease better than the system, but there is the overall decrease.</p>
          <p>Evolution in lending activity was flat as for the whole market with a de-accelerating demand especially in terms of mortgages. And in this context revenues proved resilient as especially the corporate segment performed well.</p>
          <p>Operating efficiency was further improved to good cost control and pre-tax income was somewhat penalized by the moderate increase in the cost of risk, which is essentially resulting from an increase in the SME segment and also a seasonal increased in past-due often seen in the first part of the year, but it is in any case reflecting an evolution that we observe in the economy.</p>
          <p>And then last but not least, we go back up north and we go to the Belgian retail banking which showed good volume growth, deposits increasing by 3.3% and loan by 6.7%. Though loan growth was further enhanced by the acquisition of the factoring business. So it's a little bit flattered by this acquisition and if we would look through that, the growth rate would be around 5%.</p>
          <p>Revenues held up well, while operating &#x2013; I know I sound like a broken record &#x2013; but the operating expenses, they held up well as well from the actions being implemented to improve the operational efficiency. And the pre-tax income due to all this was up 9% as cost of risk remained at low levels. So this is basically the key elements of domestic markets.</p>
          <p>Then in that same constellation of the retail bank, I still want to draw your attention to two more. First of all on slide 21, Personal Finance, which continued to implement its adaptation plan on the mortgage front where basically growth in outstandings stopped. So you know that basically we had consumer finance; we had also mortgage in there. That basically, that part of the mortgages we basically stopped growing. You can see that in the exposures, but in terms of the core business of consumer loans, outstandings showed a moderate growth of 1.3%, basically on the back of the successful partnership that we have in Germany with Commerzbank, in Russia as well and in Belgium. In Belgium we had BNP Paribas Fortis of course.</p>
          <p>And then what happened is that the effect of new regulations in France penalized revenue growth, while costs on the other hand were impacted by additional one-off adaptation costs and continued business development. So we are having two streams in this Personal Finance. We have on one hand &#x2013; or three actually, there is a part in France which is impacted in particularly by the regulation. There is a part in the excess of countries that I mentioned which have growth in consumer finance and then of course we have the reduction, but that will take time of the adaptation plan on the mortgage front.</p>
          <p>A last one in this retail part, I would like to draw your attention to slide 20. And I apologize that I hip-hop a bit around, but it's probably the best way to give you flavor, is BancWest, which saw quite a healthy rate of deposit gathering which increased at a rate of 12%. Loans were up 1.9%, particularly also here corporate loans. Revenues were just positive. Also I need to, well the revenues facially are little bit flatter due to the evolution of the dollar between the first trimester. So if you look at what we call constant scope, you will see that it is actually rather flattish and so how do you bridge growing volumes with relatively flattish revenues, has also here to do with the impact of the regulatory changes on, amongst others, fees which basically impact that.</p>
          <p>And the expenses, they rise a little bit because we are in the process of investing here also in various aspects of the business to leverage the knowledge that we have and I could highlight the private banking as one but there are also some others at which we invest.</p>
          <p>And so, finally the improving economic environment in U.S. had positive repercussions on the cost of rich &#x2013; risk sorry, which continued to decrease and leading to a double-digit growth in pre-tax income this quarter.</p>
          <p>And then maybe to end up because otherwise it would seem as if I don't want to talk about it, Europe-Med also showed dynamic activity in terms of volumes, with deposits up with 12.8% and loans 7.5%. However, here also contrasting elements, you have Turkey which enjoyed particularly strong growth on lending and deposit side and on the other hand Ukraine continued to decrease. You know that we have created <mark type="ph" /> bad (23:22) banks where elements are decreasing and so the profits of course are reduced and this is basically what you see in the pre-tax income of Europe-Mediterranean. So this for the retail part.</p>
          <p>If I then switch to the remaining half of the bank and start with investment solutions which are on slide 22 and 23 but I'll synthesize it on slide 22 to avoid you flipping too much around. And in this first quarter, actually investment solutions realized a net intake of &#x20AC;12.6 billion. Basically all business units contributed positively. This brought total assets under management to &#x20AC;881 billion which is up 4.6% since year end, but it's still below, 2.5% below, the first quarter of 2011. As you know references, we always compare basically to the first quarter of 2011. It basically means that the revenues were flat basically as the reduced contribution from asset management which is most impacted by the devaluations was compensated by the insurance and the security services activities.</p>
          <p>Operating cost for investment solutions for operating merchant changed and as we reap benefits or some of the first benefits from the adaptation plan in asset management, but at the same time as I said we also keep investing. We don't go stop-and-go we continue to invest especially in Asia.</p>
          <p>Then if I turn to CIB which is on slide 24, as you can see from the graph on the top right hand corner of this slide 24, revenues bounced back after a lower second half of 2011, however as I said without reaching the highs of the first quarter 2011 as the impact of the delevering actions weighted on the results. I have to be adamant about this.</p>
          <p>However as I said at the beginning, advisory and capital markets show good results while the corporate bank in particularly had showed a decrease, which is in line with the adaption plan. You might also have noticed that we have changed the name of our financing businesses to corporate banking and this is to reflect the fact that the emphasis has pretty much shifted away from lending towards deposit gathering in this kind of line of business and I will go into a bit more detail in this in a second.</p>
          <p>But allow me to first finalize the CIB as a whole, by reflecting on the costs, which were actually marginally higher. If we look in terms of constant scope and exchange rate instead of facially the amount that you see. So if we exclude the &#x20AC;54 million resulting from the adaptation costs and the one that the two thirds of the total that I mentioned earlier and we correct for the dollar which basically appreciated over the periods, the adaptation costs and dollars though, the delta is actually negative at 1.7%. So the costs in that scope reduced by 1.7%. And in any case, BNP Paribas can fund one of the best cost income ratios in the business. I mean even without correcting for the elements, we stand at 60.6%, so 60.6%, which further improves to 57.5% if we exclude the impact of the adaption plan. So all things considered, CIB delivered a good performance despite the impact of the deleveraging, which is underway.</p>
          <p>If I can ask you now to go to page 27, as I would like to spend a couple of minutes on this corporate banking. Here so as I said, we changed the name. We stress the refocused approach to the business and let me remind you this business, which is a business comprising some 11,000 corporate and institutional clients with a global reach and a commercial setup, which of course is articulated with what we have in domestic markets.</p>
          <p>In terms of financing activities, we have been placing the emphasis on advisory and structuring services as is the case, for example, they are in the tombstones, as is the case for &#x20AC;170 million term loan deal for Telenet in Belgium or Invepar mandate in Brazil, which was basically a pure advisory aspect on, for example on the last one, on the first Brazilian airport privatization, where Invepar was basically granted the 20-year concession for S&#xE3;o Paulo Airport for an overall value of &#x20AC;9.4 billion.</p>
          <p>So that is basically an illustration of that we stress the advisory and structuring. We also of course stressed distribution, which has been integrated further with fixed income, as also indicated we mentioned the nine-year $1.3 billion project bond out for Dolphin Energy or a deal in Germany, which basically &#x2013; a good combination example of how financing &#x2013; so the corporate banking and fixed income can successfully work together.</p>
          <p>But nevertheless, you might say these are things that you have heard before. So the real novelty so to speak is in the increased development of the deposit base, thanks to a proactive and targeted client approach coupled with the development of the global cash management platform where we start already from I believe a handsome positioning, as we are ranked fifth on a worldwide basis. So the way forward here is for client loans to decrease further, while we grow the deposit base.</p>
          <p>So that is basically what in a synthesis I wanted to talk about on the corporate bank. And I probably believe, probably that you are now tired of my ramblings and you want to get over to the next one. So it's probably the good moment to do so. So I hope that I've illustrated and gave some color to the first quarter results, which actually in our belief showed good operating performance.</p>
          <p>We have significantly strengthened during the first quarter of solvency to the point where capital is no longer an issue so to speak, but actually is becoming a relative strength and we are progressively positioning ourselves as one of the best banks positioned to serve clients in the new economic and regulatory environment.</p>
          <p>Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your kind attention on a Friday afternoon. And I'm now more than happy to take your questions. So I hand it over to all the fine people in the operation rooms.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi, good afternoon, Delphine Lee from JPMorgan. Just a few questions. First of all just to come back on the Basel 3 guidance of 180 basis points, would it be possible to get a little bit more flavor on the risk-weighted assets increase and the deductions, please?</p>
          <p>Secondly just on your deleveraging plan, it looks like you're 80% down now. So my question would be more on the liquidity side, because it looks like on the Basel 3, you can easily achieve 9%, but on liquidity what else are you actually working on on your balance sheet? You've increased the surplus to &#x20AC;51 billion. So from here what's the roadmap?</p>
          <p>And then certainly maybe just a quick one on the risk-weighted asset reduction, can we get some color on the &#x20AC;13 billion that you've reduced this quarter related to that you mentioned the low level of market risks? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your questions. If I start with the second one, which is the 80% deleveraging. So indeed the plan has progressed well. I would like to reiterate that or I would like to caution against too much optimism. I mean there are still uncertainties around it. So yes we are well positioned, but we aim to be around 9%.</p>
          <p>With respect to liquidity, indeed there we still have to progress. So if you look at the total of our adaptation plan, we have still to further reduce our asset base. So as I said, so we will continue. There is more than $10 billion still to be reduced and we will keep on doing that over the quarters to come. So we consider that on US dollars, we have reached a level. We still have other currencies that we are working on and so we will continue over the next quarters to do so.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on the RWAs, what we do see, so indeed if you look at the overall evolution that there is a couple of elements. There is indeed as I said the implementation of the adaptation plan which has reduced. On the other hand as you see from our elements with CIB, you see that the results that we've generated are basically also accompanied by a low VaR. It is somewhere in the appendices, I don't have exactly the page in front of me, but you basically see the VaR, and so basically this is one of the elements which play in the lower ROE, RWA situation as it stands today.</p>
          <p>Then with respect to your guidance on the 180 basis points, I remind you that we basically took already a while back when we announced our updates on our impacts on Basel 3, we basically announced that we calibrated ourselves on the so called Danish Proposal, which is basically today in its version four and has been debated here yesterday and should probably find or be cast in stone hopefully soon. And so basically, that is what we have taken into account. And so, what does it take into account? For example, it takes into account that we will have an impact of minorities. And the example is in the 180 was included the impact that we would lose minorities such as for example Kl&#xE9;pierre.</p>
          <p>We have also taken into account in there with to respect to the Danish Proposal the aspects related to insurance. Insurance is also something that is into those elements and then we have also taken into account the concepts which are in there with respect to RWA related to CVA on derivatives and others. So we basically oriented ourselves on those and the elements that I mentioned are basically the big bulk of those that we have impacted.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Lars. Good afternoon. I would have a few questions please. I would have a question on your let's say desired level of assets and maybe VaR in the CIB business. So on the loan side, on the financing business, what's the level that you're targeting once you're in a sense fully delevered on that particular area in corporate banking? And then also in terms of the VaR in the capital markets business obviously is declined quarter-on-quarter whilst we've seen for example that, that sovereignty increased. I just wondered whether now that you're sort of almost there to say on your deleverage Basil 3 target, whether you're feeling more free maybe to open the taps a little bit more there or you're continuing to be cautious.</p>
          <p>My second question is on the mark-to-market of the 40 bps of the EBA buffer, I just wondered whether you had an idea of how much it is as of today?</p>
          <p>And my last question is on the jaws affect in your retail businesses, where we've seen some encouraging trends this quarter again and I just wondered whether you had a sense of maybe by business, maybe big countries or something like that of what you can expect for this year, for the full year? Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for your questions. I'll run down by them. To start with the corporate banking, which indeed whereas I said the objective is if you look at the slide in the deck which shows the graphs, which is slide 26. That's where you see that we already have substantially reduced over 15 months the loans by 14.5% and we have been starting to increase. We will definitely continue the ideas to continue that trend.</p>
          <p>What is the optimal level? The optimal level will depend on a bit on where amongst others the regulation will end up. I mean if the regulation would end up with a situation where the LCR is treating the assets and liabilities of those clients differently or if it would some way or another evolve to something where it treats the both sides of the assets of the balance sheet more in an equitable way, it could mean that the targets will have to be different.</p>
          <p>So it is a bit, we focus on the client. We actually further developed it on the client. But there will be a kind of regulatory environment that will of course be guiding into what the optimal is. So I cannot yet give you a figure. Again this is something which over time we will come back to you once these elements are clear.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the VaR, again here the same thing. I think today we are at a relatively probably low VaR. We will have to see how this evolves. Listen, I wouldn't have a crystal ball to tell you, but I think it is something that still might evolve a bit. I wouldn't say, so with respect to Basel 3, I reiterate what I said earlier. I think we are in good shape. I wouldn't expect us to be at 10%. So I think we will keep on keeping a good eye on how things evolve.</p>
          <p>With respect to the question of the 40 basis points, indeed today, one could assume that we don't stand at 40 basis points, because we have of course been reducing on one hand the sovereigns and the spreads are also a bit different. But here also I would like to caution you because the EBA stress test is basically focusing on a part of the sovereigns, whereas in the available-for-sale you have also other elements which are in there, which are not captured by that. So I would still guide you if I may to caution on this one and not discount or let's say up-count this effect too well.</p>
          <p>And then with respect to your last question, I'm not sure if I understood it. Is your question on a guidance of what the jaws would be going forward for the domestic markets, is that the question?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Just two quick questions please. Firstly, I just wanted to make sure I understood the very useful slide 31 on Basel 3 correctly. The 3 basis points you have to be realized from organic generation is just really a plug figure. Is that correct, to show how you can get to 9%, and actually we should assume that there will be rather more organic generation through the rest of the year so that you could be perhaps well above 9% by the first of January 2013? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is that previously you've been kind enough to give us an idea of the direction of the cost of risk by division. Obviously, it's been very stable, but within that there's has been a few interesting moves, a little bit of a pickup in corporate banking and a fall in Personal Finance. I just wonder if you could outline whether you think there will be any other significant changes to trend through the rest of the year given the economic outlook? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The short answer to the first question is twofold, yes and no, meaning indeed the 3 bps is a plug in the sense that we kept all our hypothesis the same, but now starting from of course the reality of March, which indeed suggests that the balance that is to be realized through organic generation is 3 bps and then you can say there is nine months to come. However, I would like to urge you still to caution. There is still uncertainty as I said about how the CRD4 will land. There are other elements for example in the mark-to-market, all those that are uncertain. So I personally, I wouldn't get carried away too much on the end percentage.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on the cost of risk, indeed thank you for allowing me to give you a little bit of color. I think you indeed saw that in CIB, corporate banking that we have been having very low levels over the last kind of quarters. And so I believe that what we have now is a bit more of a return to what you could expect and you might consider going forward. As a reminder for several of the activities like CIB, like Italy, we basically said that we anticipated some pickup in the economic environment. I think this is what you do start see. So I think this bodes a bit for what is to come in the year, both on corporate banking and I think on Italy.</p>
          <p>With respect to Personal Finance, and Personal Finance indeed intrinsically is on an intrinsic trajectory to improve its cost of risk. However, I would like to mention that the first quarter is somewhat flatter by a recuperation of some elements. So you shouldn't expect that the cost of risk will be at the improvement level that you have seen it now, but it would be generically indeed still going down versus what you had in the past.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Four high-level questions and then let's come back to CIB. Just wanted to get a sense on the surplus stable funding, which is obviously improved substantially over the last two or three quarters. What do you see as the kind of go-to level on that and also what part of the improvement is driven by LTRO and what part is the underlying assets?</p>
          <p>Number two is, you have historically, or you've occasionally shown us your leverage ratios relative to some of your peers including your global peers. If I remember correctly, I think we are in the low 20s and that compared to U.S. banks, maybe a third lower. And I guess the question that some people are asking is, what is the right level for BNP? Does it have to go to U.S. bank? Is the truth somewhere in between? So maybe if you could help us with that.</p>
          <p>And the third question, just on CIB deleveraging. So the &#x20AC;45 billion plan of which you've achieved &#x20AC;32 billion, just trying to understand, the part that relates to loan disposals is a smaller part of what has been realized. So if you could give us just a bit more color on the other part, so the part that's not loan sales? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me start indeed with this with, I'll start with your last question. So on this deleveraging indeed, we have a blend of activity that we do. So the sales is indeed a part of that, not necessarily the largest part. There is another part, which is coming from more selective origination. So we basically really see that we can originate with clients that are able to generate cross-selling or that can deliver cash deposits or that can warrant our margins. So that is one thing. So that is another element, which basically reduces the stack, so that is in lending activities.</p>
          <p>And then also within capital markets activities, we have reduced some of the funding requirements in some of the legacy books around that. So that is a bit, the blend of things that we try to achieve, but your reading is correct that the disposal of assets is only a part of that.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question of the leverage, we indeed, we haven't put it in typically in the slides. We aim to limit it to the ones where there are relevant movements. That is what we show, otherwise you would get a Bible of &#x2013; or whatever your reference book is &#x2013; of more than 100 pages. But if I look back at this slide as we published it, I think at the end of last year, you can indeed see that if you calculate the leverage ratio, well first of all, you have to make sure that you compare things which are comparable. So not going into the US GAAP versus IFRS. We basically focus ourselves on the IFRS. Where we took out a maybe too simplistic approach, I agree, but we avoided the whole method discussion and we basically took out, we took out all of the elements which could be methods. So like derivatives and the likes, we took them out for us and for our European peers. And you indeed see that maybe we were quite champion six years ago. Today we are even a bit below the middle of the pack of the European ones.</p>
          <p>And so I would like to, allow me not to go into the discussion about the U.S. versus Europe. I mean there is many discussions on what the gaps are, what the RWAs are and stuff like that. So let me limit it to comparing it to things which are comparable which is in the IFRS zone where we, if we compare it, we are let's say in the pack of where our competitors are.</p>
          <p>So if with this I turn it to your first question which is so, if I understand it correctly, the &#x20AC;201 billion of surplus that we have which has improved over with &#x20AC;40 billion over the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I was referring to the &#x20AC;51 billion, I apologize, just wanted to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, the &#x20AC;51 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. So with respect to the &#x20AC;51 billion, what has happened? So you can see there are several elements in it. So you see that if I look at &#x2013; if you go to slide nine and you look at the dark green part first, so you see that the customer loans and the customer deposits have improved in the sense, or the meaning the loans have come down, the deposits have gone up. This is one hand. And then this is to some extent then mitigated of course by our mid and long term funding which has decreased in the sense that we have of course a run-off of portfolio and we have a plan for the year. And so it is in line with our expectations as I said, 75% we have been reached.</p>
          <p>But then a big part actually is coming from the light greenish part on the left which is the trading asset with clients. And the trading asset with clients, we indeed basically have reduced those with &#x20AC;17 billion, so both on the CIB side where we have these kind of repo, reverse repo activities as in the BP2S, so in the securities related activities. So that are the elements that we have focused on and that we continue hammering as the quarters go by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on that, from &#x20AC;51 billion is there a level that is consistent with your thought process on NSFR or your thought process on what is a comfortable level? And also what part of getting to &#x20AC;51 billion was underlying and what part was LTRO and maybe you can't give us all the details there, but if we could get a sense?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two things, basically the LTRO for us has nothing to do with the surplus. So let me answer this one first and then I'll answer your strategic question. So for us basically we consider today the LTRO as basically as a substitute for repos. So basically the LTRO for us, if I can ask you cast your eyes on slide nine, is in the yellow part which is the short-term funding, which basically means that having the LTRO implies for us that we take less repos. And that is the reason why I explained earlier that the orange part, the fixed income securities which are netted for the repos, have basically gone up. So I basically took less repos because I had the LTROs. So that one is above that greenish part and so doesn't play into the &#x20AC;51 billion.</p>
          <p>So then up to your question, what is your good level? Well, again the Basel 3 on LCR and NSFR will for certain give some guidance. But intrinsically if I look at it today, that I'm able to cover with more than &#x20AC;51 billion, my client loans with client deposits, it's already a situation which I think is quite handsome. Secondly, that I have at available deposits with central banks and unencumbered assets eligible to central banks, which roughly cover my short-term funding. So that is now and now I'm talking about the yellow and the oranges part, gives a situation which should allow us to sail through quite some weather.</p>
          <p>But what will be the exact ideal figure will again will have to depend on what will come out of the regulation. Again, if the regulation says that your assets and your liabilities in your stress tests are treated differently, that will mean that the excess that you will need will be different. So I will have to hold my final answer on this one until we have some more clarity because otherwise, I will make a statement which is basically based on nothing.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon Lars. I would have two question. The first one is regarding the funding of BNL. Can you give us an update of where you are in term of intra-group funding? You were giving us some guidance about the target to be in the range of &#x20AC;20 billion. Are you there and how do you tell have been for you where to get there? Also on BNL to commence the slowdown on the &#x2013; which is linked to the first question &#x2013; is the slowdown on the corporate side? Clearly does it mean that you decide to close the credit activities until you reach a certain point of funding?</p>
          <p>Second question would be to follow-up on the June 1 regarding the Personal Finance. As you said, there has been some adjustment on the French side, where we move from 198 bps to close to 50 between the two quarters. What is should be the run rate on into the Personal Finance on a normal basis, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions. If I start, I have three questions. I have your question the funding of BNL, the origin of the slowdown of corporate loans on BNL and then the guidance on the run rate of the cost of risk at PF, right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So if I indeed look at the overall funding gap that we aim to reduce, it is fair to say that this has been helped by the LTRO. It was already helped to some extent at the first LTRO. I think we made statements that we did at the LTRO-2, we had a small or smaller part that we solicited and basically that part has helped to calibrate the funding into BNL.</p>
          <p>With respect to the business activities, that didn't really tie into that. What we see today is that we are faced with an overall market evolution in Italy, so that the corporate loans slowed down that we see. For us, we perceive it as a system level so the country level and basically we aim just like with the deposits, we aim to stay on a market share, eventually grab a little bit of market share. But here we are faced by what in the economy is happening.</p>
          <p>Then with respect to your question on Personal Finance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to come back on that one, are you below your target of &#x20AC;20 billion of intra-group funding between BNL and the mother? Because if we do the gap, last year you placed something close to &#x20AC;15 billion of BNP Paribas bonds into the BNL network. And then if we want to get to your target of &#x20AC;20 billion, that mean you have at least use at least $4 billion of the LTRO for BNL. Is my calculation wrong or is it roughly that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say that we are roughly around $20 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, perfect. And then just to finish on that part, on the corporate deposit, if we look at the difference between the year-on-year growth and the Q-on-Q growth we can see that definitely there is a massive slowdown. Is also strict will on your side or the competition on the pricing is so high that you're getting to a level that there is no more economic rationale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I don't think, as I said, we are going with, I would say, going with the system in Italy. There are some elements on which we are probably a more natural player, which is like on the corporates, where we try to grab a little bit of market share. But as we said, we are not going to be the one who is going to let's say push forward in a non-equilibrated market situation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to peers, as I said, if you look at slide 13, where you see the evolution, you see the trend. You see the trend as it is and probably the trend as you saw it the first quarter, the second, the third quarter of 2011. It is probably the right trend. I think there is a little bit of a distortion on the fourth quarter on the let's say on the deteriorating side, for which they recuperate it a bit in the first quarter on the positive side. So I think if you would take the first three as a bit of guidance, that would be good. But again and again as I said, be aware the dynamics in PF are more and I'd say it is more difficult because we now have two trends. We have consumer finance which is basically growing in some regions as I said and you have the real estate which is slowly ramping down as it stands.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, but if we look to slide 59, my question was clearly regarding France, where you made a lot of adjustment in term of cost of risk?</p>

So the slide on 59 said the same thing as what I said, which is the figures instead of the bar, you see the evolution that we have and I said the evolution that you see a bit based on the first trimesters is the right one. And as I said, the first quarter of this year is somewhat impacted by let's say a catch-up in provisioning which is not something you should let's say discount going forward.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Beno&#xEE;t P&#xE9;trarque at Kepler Capital Markets. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. A couple of questions on my side. Now just to come back on PF, I see a decline in risk-weighted assets around &#x20AC;5 billion, which does not really make sense in my opinion because there was all this deterioration on the macro in Italy and Spain. So do we need to kind of expect RWA inflation in the coming quarters on PF? And also could you just come back on France again. The 51 bps, I noticed is the cost of risk without this one-off in Q1, that will be useful.</p>
          <p>And then also to come back on the RWA on the capital market, it's a decrease of &#x20AC;25 billion, mainly coming from market risk, I think it's around &#x20AC;16 billion coming from market risk, yes. How much is likely to reverse in the coming quarters? Could you kind of give a guidance because you are not back to pre-Basel 2.5 levels?</p>
          <p>And then finally on the group center, if I take the pre-tax of the group center and adjust for Kl&#xE9;pierre and the own debt <mark type="ph" /> preval (59:27), I have got a negative, around negative &#x20AC;200 million pre-tax which is a big negative as what we've seen at previous quarters. So where are these figures going to end up in 2012 and could you guide us a bit more on that one? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes a couple of things. So if I walk down through them, so on Personal Finance with respect to RWA, allow me to answer it by giving you a bit more color on the business dynamics around it, because I hear you pick up on the southern part. There is a couple of things, so on the southern parts, what we see is that we are producing at good margins, so that is one thing. So that gives us comfort and as I said, the growth that we basically experience is coming out of the more Nordic belt if I can say. So that is relatively that.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on a normalized basis point ratio, I will have to give you the answer a bit later. I'm trying to see how I can give you, when I've done the end of the questions.</p>
          <p>With respect to capital markets and your &#x20AC;16 billion and how much could reverse, it's a bit the same thing. It's today, it reflects the situation where it is. It's respect to VaR, it's respect to the kind of fluxes that we see into the market. How will it evolve? I honestly I don't know. It will depend on how we see the markets and how these things evolve. So I cannot guide you that you should lock it in and see that we will not move up, nor can I tell you that you should take the &#x20AC;16 billion as foregone. I think this one you will have to play it by ear and see it quarter-after-quarter.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on group center, thank you for asking, because indeed there is maybe some relevant things that have been going on there that I can share with you. The long and short of it is, you know there are several elements which are typically in corporate center. So we have a revaluation of our own debt that's in there, but you can retreat for that. That is what you've done. You have the amortization of the PP and the banking book which is in there, which you also know as time goes by becomes lower and lower.</p>
          <p>And then you have indeed some exceptional elements as we mentioned and as you probably have corrected for, you have losses for sales on sovereign bonds. So we have reduced by &#x20AC;9 billion our sovereign bonds and in the first quarter that had a negative impact of &#x20AC;142 million which is in there. We also had the exchange of convertible, so the CASHES, which had a friction cost of &#x20AC;68 million.</p>
          <p>There is one that we didn't mention in here and actually we should have, is that with respect to the PSIs, with respect to Greece. And you know that for Greece we had provisioned 75% at the end of the year. The exchange basically left to a pricing which was not let's say at the right value of 25% but of 23.2%, so which basically left to an additional &#x20AC;54 million of impairment. But that didn't make the threshold, so we didn't put it on.</p>
          <p>So there is indeed a set of exceptionals, but your intrinsic question is right in saying if I correct for it, I am at a figure which is maybe different from the past. And here allow me to qualify. If you would look at our publications of last year and you look at the corporate center and all the exceptionals out of it that we have mentioned, you would see that we basically have a PNB, so an income, sorry for my French, we have an income that is around &#x20AC;200 million a quarter. That's basically the average run rate that we had last year.</p>
          <p>And I can tell you now that in your models, you have to replace it by zero. Why do you have to replace it by zero a quarter, because there are a couple of elements which are coming, or which are already there. The first one is that we recomposed our segments, so we didn't change anything of course on the boundaries of the group. But we recomposed our segments as you know by taking into account 9% of remuneration of equity. So you know that we basically allocate capital to our segments based on the RWA and we basically charge them for it in the past for 7% and as of now for 9%. So that means there is a 2% extra that is being allocated to the segments.</p>
          <p>Of course, as the boundaries of the group don't change, the delta is booked somewhere. That delta is basically booked in corporate center. There is more than &#x20AC;550 million of delta over a full year. So it's around &#x20AC;150 million that you have to take out of let's say the &#x20AC;200 million that you would have observed last year.</p>
          <p>The other thing that you will see is that of course Kl&#xE9;pierre will no longer be into the income. Today in other, Kl&#xE9;pierre is in the income. As of now actually, it will no longer be and it will be in share of earnings and associates. So if you take these things into account, you will indeed see that your run rate has been reviewed and your run rate for the income you should put it at zero.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give some color to the cost of credit outlook for France in particular and as well as BNL, where we saw deterioration. For France, maybe presumably that we could expect some deterioration at some point, or is it the case that the stable outcome for the past few quarters can be maintained going forward?</p>
          <p>Secondly, obviously you've got a liquid asset portfolio which is quite large now. Is there an opportunity cost there in not being able to deploy that to, in high returns? Could you talk about that in more color to us, please?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, obviously there is a notice for a decline in your trading VaR versus SocGen, which increased 50% in quarter and can we infer from that actually that the thick trading result that you had was substantially flow-driven with very little inventory gains? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Well with respect to your last question, I of course cannot comment on any of the other banks. But I can do confirm that for us that it's basically, we are flow-driven as you know and so that is where the income has been made on our side.</p>
          <p>And with respect to the cost of credit outlook for France and BNL, I think today in the economic environment as we see it, I think the first quarter is a good proxy of what is to come. Again forgive me if the economics deteriorate, then we'll see, but today in the environment as we see it, I think the pickup in Italy is a real one and the stability that you see in France and Belgium is probably also a real one. But again to be taken with caution, there are many uncertainties going ahead. But at this moment, I would take the first quarter as a good guidance.</p>
          <p>With respect to your second question with respect to the liquid assets portfolios, and the question is if we regret that we cannot reinvest it. I think my only remark is that we are in the signs of the times. I think this is the kind of levels that we need given the uncertainty and some of the variations that we have. So I think we are very happy to be at those levels today and I think, well, at least from a finance director's point of view, I'm very happy to have them there.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon. I have two questions, if I may. The first one would be related to the corporate banking business. You commented that you obviously want to reduce your lending and increase your deposits. I was wondering if you have a target loan-to-deposit ratio in that business. And also once your deleveraging is finished, if you'll have a, if you could give us a split of how you see the part of the business which would be plain vanilla lending versus the part which would be structured origination business?</p>
          <p>The second question would be going back to the liquidity buffer, because it's gone up from &#x20AC;150 billion to &#x20AC;210 billion. I was wondering how much of that related to the fact that right now the collateral requirement with the ECB are a little bit less hard. So how much of that is due to lower collateral requirement?</p>
          <p>And then the third question would be referring to the VaR in the corporate and investment bank. It basically goes down in every single product except for interest rates where it goes up from &#x20AC;25 million to &#x20AC;35 million. I was wondering if that is a level where you feel comfortable with and because also your flow rates business was, did quite well this quarter. So should we expect that going forward or will you reach it from there? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. So four questions, let me run them from the bottom to the top. And so with respect to your VaR, indeed, well spotted. Well, but as you also saw, a part of the fixed income was made on that kind of ForEx and rates kind of situations. I think the markets were in the opportunity for that. So we basically took that. Again is that a right level, no, I mean we have an overall VaR that we have a limit that we want to be. So don't lock these numbers in. I mean it's a guidance overall below, I would leave to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to your question of the &#x20AC;160 billion to the &#x20AC;200 billion, so the &#x20AC;40 billion additional, so as I said it's a mixed bag of things from having all the elements that I discussed. But I think I could guide you that around some 20%, so a quarter let's say, that around a quarter of the improvement is related to the relaxing between brackets of the roof.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, if I may interrupt, you said one, or you said 20%, or you said one quarter, so would it be 20% or a quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I said &#x2013; I'll put it in pure Arabic figures. So let's say between 20% and 25%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of the increase, of the increase of the &#x20AC;40 billion is related to the relaxing of the rules in some of the countries because you know they are not all who has done it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With respect to corporate banking, I repeat what I said earlier is so the trend is indeed loans going down and deposits going up. If I say in a blunt way, what the target will be or the exact target will be will depend a bit in particularly on how we will settle in the regulation. Which as I said, depending on how asymmetric or not, the assets and the liabilities of these kinds of clients are treated. And again with the blend of activities, I think at this stage, we will have to see. We will come back again. Once the regulation is clear, we will clarify our strategy on those things. But again today I would be telling you something which would be based on thin air and that wouldn't suit nor yourself nor myself.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. Just one question really, which is related to the impact of the LTRO on the revenues in the retail business. So you indicated growth in revenues in France as 0.3%, BNL 2.3%, Belgium 3.4%. And how much can be attributed actually to the LTRO? In other words, what is the underlying revenue growth ex-LTRO? And related to that of course is the question, how the benefits of the LTRO are allocated on a divisional basis, whether it's retail or CIB? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So a couple of answers to that. So the retail businesses are actually not impacted by the LTRO. And so the LTRO, we have considered that part of our treasury activities and so they basically are booked into the CIB part and are not in the business. So the business, the retail businesses are not impacted by it. And as I said earlier for us we consider them short term, so they are if you go into the cash balance sheet of page nine, they are on the yellowish part, so they are at the top. And as I said and this is a bit of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (73:07), but they come in substitution or repos. And so some might say that one is paying 1% for the LTRO and one might say that for repos maybe one might even pay a bit lower. So for us that's basically where it stands. So it's not for us that this generates a carry trade for us, it's a substitution to other product of funding.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon sir. I would have four questions basically. First on book value, we saw a swing in the OCI reserve from a loss of &#x20AC;1.4 billion to a gain of &#x20AC;1.2 billion during the quarter. So I was just wondering if you could give us some detail on the driver there?</p>
          <p>Second question, back on risk-weighted assets especially on corporate banking, I calculate a decline in risk-weighted assets of around &#x20AC;11 billion in the division versus last quarter, &#x20AC;12 billion, sorry, whereas client loan were only reduced by $6 billion. So I was just wondering where the gap came from?</p>
          <p>On the risk-weighted assets also, the Basel committee just issued, I mean on May 3, the fundamental review of the trading book, which could give rise to higher capital requirements for their trading books. And I was just wondering if you had any sort of impact in terms of capital requirements on equity on CIB at BNP.</p>
          <p>And two further questions, the first on French elections. I was just wondering if what your assumptions were or what kind of assumptions you take into consideration when it comes to figure out what could be the impact on your P&amp;L and balance sheet of potential political decisions that the next government will take. And by particular decision that includes higher tax rates in France or a rise in the cap of Livret A ceiling on overdraft fees, or a ban on speculative activities? In addition to that, would you disclose the tax amount that BNP paid in France last year and in Q1 2012?</p>
          <p>And final question, sorry to be long, is on the sovereign bond portfolio, what is your strategy here? Do you want to reduce it to nil or could we have the size that you want to have at your end? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, let's do them one by one. So if I start first with the book value. The book value actually as we reported &#x2013; allow me to go to, it's on page 32 and you are right, we should have put a footnote to clarify, but the book value that we show, both the net tangible one and the book value to core is basically not including any revaluation. So the one that you see later in the document also, so we publish of course a revaluation impact, but in the net book value, they are not retained. So you basically see the natural evolution of the retained earnings into the evolution. So that is that.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on ROE, while we basically as I said have been saying for the day, we don't have any guidance or we don't give any updates on guidance as long as there is too much uncertainty on the levers.</p>
          <p>And that's basically the same thing on your questions on France elections. I mean we should have published our figures a couple of days later, but today I have no answer to that. The only thing I can say is, and all the things you can interpret them many ways, from what we see on the tax rate, you know that there might be an impact. But again there is 25% of earnings of the group which is coming from France and so on and so forth. So that is something to position it. The Livret A, yes, there might be a ceiling that goes up a bit, but that's just a ceiling which goes up, and we will have to see if that really impacts. And for us, it's not that that is a major part of our element. And the speculative parts, we will have to see as we said. Probably those aspects will more come out of Brussels than that they might come out of Paris.</p>
          <p>With respect to the tax paid in France, I do not think that we publish that. But you typically &#x2013; it also depends on how you look at it. I mean we do pay of course basically the regular tax on the income. I mean if you want, we can add the figures to it, by saying we have also tax, VAT and other elements in it, but we are between let's say on the normal tax, we are gravitating around a 30% tax rate and you can assume that as 25% of the income which is being generated in France. So that is a bit where it will end up.</p>
          <p>So then with respect your sovereigns. With respect to your sovereigns as I said, the sovereigns, if we go before Basel 3, the sovereigns, we basically why do we use them? We basically use the sovereigns amongst others in our assets and liability mismatch. So we basically use them in order to have a natural hedge, because we have instruments which have a fixed income, which is interesting if you look at our retail activities with respect to the deposits and the loans. So that was the reason why we have them and the intrinsic reason why we like them. However as you know, Basel 3 is basically impacting that and so we are reviewing and as you see there for the moment we bring it opportunistically down. Will we bring it to zero, probably not. Will we optimize it with respect to duration and other elements which induce volatility, yes we will continue to do so. And you again here, you will have to see quarter after quarter how these things evolve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just back on the OCI reserve, I mean what is the driver of the swing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The OCI reserve, the yield. So I remind you that in the portfolio, the OCI for a big change reflects the revaluation of what we have in the available for sale portfolio, which includes amongst others the sovereigns, but also includes some other kinds of bonds, which revaluate with the yields. And basically the evolution of the yields have led to the revaluation and that revaluation is being reflected in the OCI.</p>

          <p>Yes, good afternoon. It's Anke Reingen from RBC. Four questions please. The first is as a follow up to Jon's question on your capital, slide 31. Are you just very conservative or you mentioned also the potential impact of other regulatory factors and would the potential trading book review play a role here? I'm just a bit surprised it allowed you a very cautious guidance here, then are not a commentary and not guidance.</p>
          <p>Then secondly on Moody's rating review, can you please share a bit of your thoughts and what this would mean in terms of funding costs or a potential additional of collateral requirements?</p>
          <p>And just two small questions, with respect to the dividend accrual in the first quarter, is it as simple as 25% of the reported net profit or did you adjust for the large capital gain?</p>
          <p>And then lastly your guidance for losses from asset sales would suggest there is &#x20AC;726 million left for the year, if we should still keep this number in our models and also how would the capital gain from the sale of US energy book, would the &#x20AC;726 million be net of any potential gain? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's four questions <mark type="indiscernible" /> (81:30). To answer at least maybe the first and the last one here. I mean you have been following BNP Paribas for a while, so you know that we tend to be conservative and prudent in our approach, so that is basically why we guided like this. I mean we just say the CRD4 has not landed yet, and so as long as it has not landed, there might be uncertainties. So allow us to come back once those things are crystallized out, we hope it to be very soon and then we will be able to more precisely guide you. But this is where we stand for the moment.</p>
          <p>With respect to the &#x20AC;720 million which is left, as I said we still have quite some billions in disposals to go. Again from a prudent stance, one might say that in the beginning you might do the easy things and that basically we will have the more complicated or maybe elements to come. So again here for now we guide you to take it, take it for the year and again I think we will be able to give you a more concrete update by the summer. And so that is on those two.</p>
          <p>With respect to the dividend, if I understand your question, so I think it's with respect to the return on equity where indeed in the calculation for it, which is an annualized one, we indeed have taken out the elements of Kl&#xE9;pierre and the element of the own debt.</p>
          <p>With respect to your question on Moody's, so I remind you all that Moody's has announced earlier this year, they have announced a review of basically the whole European banking sector and the global banks with CIB activities. They aimed to or they suggested that there would be &#x2013; that they would announce this review and basically well as of, actually I think they were going to start end of April and continue into May. And they suggested that this could lead to an overall rating decrease for the banks, but they also said that it could lead to eventually a review within the ranking of the banks. What do we observe? We observe that Moody's has announced that they basically delay their announcements. So they've delayed it. For example the BNP Paribas was to be announced mid-May. We understood that it would not be before mid-June. So I think that this is a review which is going on. So we will have to wait for that and we will have to see how that evolves in the rating. But I stress again, for us it's a total review of the whole banking sector. So it basically is a recalibration, which is still a different thing than recalibrating one bank or two bank. It's the recalibrating of a view of one rating agency on a sector and we will, we monitor this closely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it's difficult to say if there are any triggers from a potential rating change to collateral requirements or deposit flows or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (84:34)?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We will have to see. I mean they don't announce that the banks will be on below investment grade. So I think what you can &#x2013; what cautiously what you can see is that if there would be a collective downgrade, there will be a recalibration which will be going on again, which would mitigate probably the overall impact. So we will have to wait until we have more clarity on this one.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Thibault Nardin, Morgan Stanley. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, good afternoon. I've got three quick questions on my side. The first one is on the cost side. If you could just please give us a bit of color on the evolution of your expenses in the capital market activity this quarter. That would be great in order for us to know how much of these increasing costs is driven by higher compensations?</p>
          <p>And the second question is that earlier on, I mean last year, you estimated that your asset disposition cost you around &#x20AC;750 million of recurring operating profit. I just wanted to know if you have a view on how much is already in the Q1 number.</p>
          <p>And finally, just a general question about what's the idea behind replacing repo funding by LTRO money? Is it just, I mean has it to do just with the reduction in balance sheet encumbrance, or in order to free up eligible assets or is there any other explanation? I'm happy to hear it, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, one by one. So if we start with the cost side, so as I said, if you look at constant ForEx, so if you look at constant dollars and if you take out $54 million of the adaptation plan as I said, basically the costs go down by 1.7%. But still there is a couple of things so as I said even the cost income ratio is relatively okay, but it's still indeed a mix of two things. So there is indeed CIB is on one hand adapting itself. It is taking the charges indeed as I said for those, but the synergies which are related to that, they do take some time to kick in.</p>
          <p>I give you the example, the plan in France has been announced by mid-March or March 8, has been announced so these things you cannot account, right. You cannot take it into account that these plans are visible into your accounts when these things have not happened. Also you might have identified activities that you will closed, but maybe the people are still there to do aftercare of branches that you close and what have you. And so it's really something where the costs do come in advance of the synergy.</p>
          <p>So you will keep on seeing the synergies as we said. We believe that as we mentioned, we have &#x20AC;400 million overall adaptation costs at CIB which should bring us a run rate of &#x20AC;450 million of savings. But again as we said today, if you do indeed see the costs, and the savings are to come, and I would like to clarify that the &#x20AC;450 million that we talked about is basically full year and it's full year actually next year. So the amount that you should take, that you should pencil in of say the savings is more around &#x20AC;290 million to be for this year. And here again, I stress this is additional savings over and above a normal run rate of the CIB which still keeps on investing and growing in some areas such as Asia. So you should keep these elements into mind when you try to project yourself on to the CIB.</p>
          <p>With respect to compensation, I think you know our drill a bit. We typically have our rules of doing it. We are typically let's say at the lower end of the scale. You also know that we typically book in the quarter where we do it, so it's not adapted. You know that we have deferrals of our bonuses. Some only book &#x2013; don't book the deferrals up front but book them when they fall. We book them up front and so that is something that you are aware of. And indeed last year of course, the overall compensation was lower. I think you have seen it in our documentation, it's lower. And so we are now let's say in line with the provisioning that you would have for the time of income that you have.</p>
          <p>So that is basically in a nutshell on the costs side and the synergies. And so we have announced earlier both impacts of the deleveraging and of the synergies and we basically stand by those numbers today.</p>
          <p>And so, as I said with respect to the repo versus the LTRO, we consider them basically as short-term. So we did indeed have some LTRO, some repo activities in our funding as a prudent stance. We basically said, we diversify it a bit, and part of that, we have replaced by the LTRO as a prudent stance. This is where we stand today and we, for us there is nothing to say. We will come back by the year-end eventually when there is a choice to be made on how to go forward. But there is no discussion about this topic before that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. just a follow-up question on that part. I mean should we read in that if you consider the LTRO as a short-term funding that you wish to take advantage of the window to repay these funds early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I'm saying nothing at all. I'm just saying that we have diversified and we will come back with our stance when the moment is there.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">

          <p>We have a question from Pascal Decque, Cheuvreux. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. I still have several quick question if I may. The first one is could you give us the magnitude of the capital gains that you will book in Q2 on the Wells Fargo deal? As a follow-up on a question before, I think it was on the dividend payout in fact, do you plan to pay 25% dividend payout on reported net profit in 2012, I mean including the Kl&#xE9;pierre capital gains or not?</p>
          <p>The next question, I am not completely sure that Kl&#xE9;pierre is already deconsolidated in Q1. I mean we would have had including beyond that of minus &#x20AC;80 million something, the <mark type="ph" /> surrender impact  (90:44) more than minus &#x20AC;883 million in revenues, then is it going to stop next quarter? I would like next please some clarification on losses on sovereign debt. I assume that there is one in the corporate center revenues. And my question is why is it not in the CIB revenue like it was in previous quarters?</p>
          <p>And second, if I'm not wrong on slide 40, you mention another &#x20AC;100 million losses, but in cost of risk this time. Why a different treatment there on Greek bonds and in which division is it booked? I can't find it.</p>
          <p>And the last question if I may, I know you don't like it, but one of your close competitor yesterday gave some information to the start of Q2 in CIB. Let's say there was a slowdown. We all know that. But they say they weren't quite satisfied with the first week into Q2 and they were over their own budget. Could you make kind of a statement on this one for BNP? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. A couple of questions. So with respect to the capital gains on Wells Fargo, I will have to disappoint you. But we have agreed with Wells Fargo that we would not share any deal parameters, so I cannot help you on that one, so sorry for that.</p>
          <p>With respect to the dividend payout of 25%, it is of course not the finance director who decides whatever that would be. So that should normally, that will be decided by the Board of Directors and then what it is. But normally it is basically something that you see on your full retained earnings as we have them.</p>
          <p>On Kl&#xE9;pierre, you are absolutely right, but allow me to make the difference between the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement. So the balance sheet, which is the picture of the end of the quarter, where Kl&#xE9;pierre is indeed deconsolidated, but you are absolutely right, up to the moment of the deconsolidation, the impact is in the P&amp;L. So you are right, it is for a part, it's in the P&amp;L, but in the balance sheet and in the cash balance sheet, it is basically out.</p>
          <p>With respect to your losses on the sovereign debt and the question of why in corporate center versus last time treasury. So the last time, it was indeed in CIB because the losses that we had at that time were basically generated out of treasury. And the treasury as you know is allocated into the CIB activities, whereas the activities that we have here are more of an ALM nature to cover the interest rate risks and through that extent they are basic and they are of an exceptional nature that have to do with Basel 3 and therefore they are booked in corporate center. The same goes true for the booking of Greece. And so why is Greece in cost of risk, because it is an activity which basically was impaired. And as I said, we took it to the exchange. We had impaired it for up to 25%, but when we did the exchange, so basically the exchange said there is 53.5% which is lost okay, perfect. Not perfect, but it's lost. That 15% which is being changed in EFSF bonds, which are there and then you have 33.5%, which are basically exchanged into new Greek government debt.</p>
          <p>The moment that exchange took place, if you looked at the markets, basically those traded at a quarter, so they traded at 25% of that. So if you basically do the sum of the EFSF bonds that we got and the trading, the real trading of the Greek bonds, you get to 23.2%. So it basically means there was an additional provisioning that was needed and of course that had to go through cost of risk because that is where the redress was booked. And we had to take an additional part of cost of risk for Greece in corporate center, which is in line with where the other of course much bigger part was launched when we took it last year.</p>
          <p>And so then with respect to your question on Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale, there is two things. Yes, indeed I think if you look outside, you can see that the markets basically are today not in the shape that they were at the start. I mean there was a different environment. There were the statements of ECB, which at that time were different than they are now. So there is indeed a slowdown. But on the other hand, I cannot guide you to what's the budget, because this is something in practice that we do not do.</p>

          <p>We have a question from Jeremy Sigee, Barclays Capital. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, thank you. Two questions please, one is a new one and one is a follow-up. Firstly, I wanted to talk about funding, your strategy for wholesale funding. The two things that surprised me in your slide, slide nine, you have let your medium and long term funding come down quite a lot in the quarter. And then slide 29 shows that actually you have done very, very little public issuance. You've maybe been doing private placements. So linking those two, I guess my question is why have you not done more? Why have you not been more active, particularly given you're a relatively strong issuer, why have you not done more in the quarter to boost your long term funding given conditions that would have probably allowed you do that? So that's the first question.</p>
          <p>Second question, as I say a follow-up, I wanted to come back on CIB costs, because I still don't really understand it. I mean I take your point about the fun is and savings to come, but the sort of spike in costs previously has been linked to stronger revenues than this. And if you look here, even if we take your adjusted cost number down 1.7%, year-on-year revenues were actually down anywhere between 9% and 11% depending on how you adjust them. So it just still seems a very bafflingly big cost number in CIB.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, let's start with the wholesale funding. So indeed what you see is actually in line with our plan. So as you know, the heritage MLT funding has been set up to cover assets and so on who go a bit on that same kind of tenure. Those assets have been running down, also part of the deleveraging plan. And so we basically made the overall plan for 2012 of the emissions that we wanted to do in line with that. So we're basically in line with what our plan is of the asset rundown. So from that point of view we are in line and this is articulated by the fact that already we've done 75% of what we want to do. So we feel okay with that.</p>
          <p>And then limit to the public, yes, well I mean there is a bit, there is of course a degree of balancing and opportunism in there. Private placements form a good way. I mean I know that some might be interested in public placement or in corporate placement, but that we believe that today we have a fine mix of what our signature can do and so we will continue on that level. But as you see, there are opportunities as you saw in the beginning of the year, we've done so in public. And so you will see that evolve over time.</p>
          <p>And so with respect to CIB costs, as I said you are right to say if you make the link towards what we have on the revenues, if you look at the evolution, there are indeed many elements in there. So I will repeat them a bit, saying that well first of all, you have to recast it into the appropriate currency, so see the trend. There are the effects of the adaptation plan and then one of things, and it is indeed true, I mean the CIB is not on a stop-and-go random, so there are elements in which we basically keep on investing, so which provides a little bit of an extra lift. And also to sum it up, in 2011, in the first quarter there were some elements of a exceptional nature, which somewhat brought the cost down. So if you go through the entire list of the elements that I have now summed up, you will see that we have a reasonable evolution.</p>

          <p>Yes. The last question is from Alex Koagne, Natixis. Sir, please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I just have one remaining question regarding BancWest. We see that the loan-to-deposit ratio increased 6 percentage point on the quarter. I was just wondering whether you have a level beyond what you don't want to go?</p>
          <p>And the other question is a more global question regarding your activities in the United States. I was just wondering whether you have an opportunity to transfer some of your loan book within the CIB to BancWest. I know that you have &#x2013; they are not regulated by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (99:42), but I was just wondering whether you have some opportunity over there to do some transfer for funding purpose? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, two questions. So with respect to BancWest, well first of all there is not that there is a specific limit. We are first of all very happy that BancWest is again a very good and fine contributor to BNP Paribas. So we're happy with that. We see that they, on the back of the US economy are doing well. So I think from that point of view, we are happy with the evolutions of the balance sheet and in particularly the kind of business that they do in the model that they are rolling out. So that is the Banc of the West.</p>
          <p>With respect to your last question, let me end on that. The fact that there is regulation changing everywhere is something which has been always there. I mean as a bank or as whatever company you always seek to optimize the environment in which you operate. And indeed, one might indeed say that there is some what I say calibration of activities between entities that is possible. But I think this is something that will &#x2013; that is being looked at, not specifically for BancWest, but in general, in the overall structure of the bank that is being looked at by the teams. And if there are things that would lead to an improvement of serving the clients, we will definitely do so and we will let you know at that moment.</p>

          <p>So okay, so with this we basically have come to the end of the presentation. So I thank you again for being, for your interest in BNP Paribas and being with us on a Friday afternoon. So as a conclusion, I hope to have shown you that in the first quarter BNP Paribas had a good operating performance, that its solvency is strengthened and that adaptation plan is well ahead of the announced schedule and that with that, basically BNP Paribas is one of the best positioned European banks to serve customers in this new economic and regulatory environment. I thank you very much and have a very enjoyable weekend.</p>
