          <p>Good morning, everybody. Thank you very much for joining us this morning for your third quarter results presentation. I am joined this morning by our CFO, Renato Fassbind and Paul Calello, the CEO of the Investment Bank. I am going to give you a short introduction, Renato is going to run through the numbers and then Paul will speak to the performance of the Investment Bank during the third quarter. Paul will also provide more details on the measures we're taking to further transform our Investment Bank. The events for the last few months have led to dramatic changes in the financial services industry as you know. Last week, we announced that we've taken steps to supplement our already strong capital base giving us unquestioned capital strength, confirming our position as a safe haven in difficult markets and allowing us to maintain and accelerate our client momentum. It also means that we already meet the regulatory requirements set for 2013 and we're positioned to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves. Last week, we also announced preliminary third quarter results which we're confirming today.</p>
          <p>The overall loss for Credit Suisse in the third quarter while understandable in the context of the extreme market conditions is clearly disappointing. Private Banking delivered a strong operating performance however pre-tax profit was impacted by provisions of CHF 310 million for auction rate securities. We continue to see a strong inflow of net new assets of CHF 11 billion in Wealth Management. In addition, we achieved inflows of CHF 3 billion in our Swiss Corporate and Retail business. And we've seen a good distribution of asset growth across all regions. Asset Management reported a loss of CHF 58 million and we're progressing with our strategy to build on our strengths and align the business more closely with the integrated model. In Investment Banking, the third quarter presented very challenging operating conditions for the industry and for Credit Suisse. Paul will take you through the details of this result in a moment. We remain cautious regarding the outlook, the environment is changing rapidly, the third quarter was challenging and volatile and our business has been impacted and the fourth quarter has continued to be challenging.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand over to Renato, who will take you through the numbers. Renato?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Brady and good morning. I will start my presentation on slide five with an overview of the divisional results side-by-side. Last week, we reported a net loss of CHF 1.3 billion by our banking delivered to another strong operating performance in the third quarter. However, the pre-tax income of CHF 789 million was impacted by provisions of CHF 310 million for auction rate security settlements. Net new assets continued to be strong with good contributions from all international regions and from the Swiss Institutional and Retail business.</p>
          <p>We have good hiring momentum with continued success in adding new relationship managers and our hiring pipeline remains strong. Investment Banking recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF 3.2 billion in the third quarter. This reflected writedowns of 2.4 billion in leveraged finance and structured products and the gross trading conditions in September. As Brady mentioned, Paul Calello will provide more details on the Investment Banking results shortly. Asset Management recorded a pre-tax loss of CHF 58 million as a result of private equity losses of CHF 109 million and a further 36 million of net valuation reductions on securities purchased from our money market funds.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with further detail of the results starting with Wealth Management on slide six. On this chart, we show the revenues in Swiss francs on the left side and the corresponding gross margin on assets under management on the right. The competition of our revenue margin has become more stable. We have increased the contribution from recurring revenues by 3% for the first nine months compared to the same period last year. The recurring revenues are down only 4% in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2007. Reduction in transaction-based revenues reflects the adverse markets and to the more cautious client behavior. The nine months gross margin, shown on the right hand side of the slide, further evidences the resilience for our business model. As for year-to-date, 2008 margin is almost in line with the previous year. In summary, we have been very successful in compensating for a reduction in client activity and to lower asset base due to market movement.</p>
          <p>Let me turn to the net new assets on slide seven. The net new assets were strong at over CHF 11 billion with good contributions from all international regions. We continue to exceed our 6% net new asset gross target on a rolling four-quarter basis. Going forward, we expect these trends to continue. We are receiving the current opportunities to hire great people. As shown on the slide 8, we continued to hire relationship managers across all the regions. We added almost 500 relationship managers in the last 12 months; there is strong growth rate particularly in Asia and the U.S., but also in our other international locations. This keeps us on track to reach our target of 4,100 relationship managers by the year 2010.</p>
          <p>The strength and stability of the platform has made us increasingly attractive during this period of turbulence. We should also see net new asset inflows benefit from these recruitment success in the coming quarters. This growth also demonstrates our geographic expansion. Since the beginning of 2007, we entered four new local markets and opened 15 new offices globally. And these growth initiatives are clearly delivering results. Currently, more than 40% of our net new assets come from relationship managers that are in their first three years with Credit Suisse. Such expansion comes at a cost as we spend over CHF 350 million annually on our international new plant development.</p>
          <p>We have told you that under normal conditions, efficiency gains in our existing platforms should make room for such additional investments. In the current market environment however, this is resulting in a short-term deterioration in our efficiency ratios. However, we believe that especially large and well-capitalized firms like ours will benefit in the long run and come out of this environment stronger than the competition, and this is clearly our goal.</p>
          <p>Let me continue with Corporate and Retail Banking on slide nine. Pre-tax income in Corporate and Retail Banking increased 3% to CHF 400 million compared to the third quarter of 2007. This reflects continued resilience in the economic environment in Switzerland. Net new assets from Swiss institutional and retail clients were CHF 3.2 billion.</p>
          <p>Let's now turn to Asset Management on slide 10. On that slide, we show you current assets under management, third quarter and nine months net new assets, and third quarter gross margin of our businesses side-by-side. In the net new asset column, you can see that the alternative investments business which comprises our leading private equity and real estate business and our single and multi-manager hedge fund strategies continues to see good asset inflows of CHF 2.2 billion in the quarter or nearly 12 billion year-to-date. These businesses account for nearly half of Asset Management's fees and commissions commanding a healthy 67 basis points gross margin during the third quarter. We believe that the alternative asset inflows will fuel further revenue growth also driven by our best-in-class capabilities. Overall, the gross margin stayed stable at 39 basis points as outflows were primarily in lower at margin assets such as money market funds and the pension fund advisory business.</p>
          <p>This concludes my divisional results review. I will now continue with the Group funding and capital position on slide 11. Here, you can see on the left the composition of our balance sheet at the end of the third quarter. Underpinned by our strong deposit base, which is over 120% of our loans, our long-term debt and deposit based funding makes up around a third of our balance sheet. We have already successfully achieved our 2008 long-term debt issuance target of CHF 29 billion and will continue to take advantage of opportunities to raise further long-term debt. The chart on the right shows a solid level of deposits from our Private Banking clients as clients seek a safe haven in uncertain times.</p>
          <p>Let me move over to capital position on slide 12. During the quarter, the Basel II Tier 1 ratio improved 20 basis points to 10.4% as risk-weighted assets increased by CHF 6 billion driven by a 22 billion increase in foreign exchange movements largely offset by business reductions. The loss recorded in Tier 1 capital was more than offset by the reversal of the dividend accrual, capital issued in the quarter and the foreign exchange benefit. Despite the continued strength of our existing capital base, we decided last week to announce proactive steps to further increase our capital position. We are raising 4.5 billion of core Tier 1 capital and 5.5 billion of hybrid Tier 1 capital. This increases the pro forma Tier 1 ratio as at September 30, 2008, to 13.7%. And with this capital increase, we now already exceed the EBK's 2013 capital target and minimal leverage requirements. We believe that a strong capital base together with a conservative liquidity profile is a competitive advantage especially in these markets.</p>
          <p>With that, I welcome Paul to present the next section of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Renato and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes this morning updating you on the Investment Bank's results for the third quarter. You are all well aware of the events in the markets this quarter and they help explain our losses in the third quarter, but this does not make them either excusable or acceptable. I will discuss specifics on how significant market events particularly those that we witnessed in September have impacted our trading results. I will also cover some of the businesses particularly in our clients and flow trading franchises, which experienced good, and in some cases, record results in the quarter.</p>
          <p>The market environment has made it important for us to accelerate our strategy for the Investment Bank. This is reducing risk, diversifying earnings, growing our client businesses and increasing our efficiency. First of all, given the overall results in the Investment Bank, we will be extremely transparent in explaining our third quarter performance. Many of you are familiar with slide 15, it shows our exposure reduction on the quarter and the writedowns we've taken in leveraged finance and our structured product areas. Although liquidity became more challenging this quarter, we've continued to make sales in a reduced risk. As you can see from the first two rows on this slide, our overall exposure decreased 17 and 15% for leveraged finance and CMBS respectively. Most of our exposures are in fact dollar denominated and if you look in dollar terms exposures were reduced by 25% leveraged finance and 22% in CMBS. We also took further writedowns CHF 900 million in leveraged finance and 1 billion in CMBS as the market levels for these asset classes continued to decline. And while the table shows our RMBS and CDO portfolio increased in the quarter this is entirely due to FX movements. The underlying U.S. dollar positions actually fell in the third quarter. Overall, during the last five weeks it's been more challenging to move these older assets off our books, but we remained very focused on selling down these positions.</p>
          <p>On slide 16, we show material reductions that have been made since the beginning of the crisis. Our leveraged finance exposures now stand at CHF 12 billion. This is concentrated now on a small number of transactions. Of this 12 billion only CHF 3 billion of these have been funded, and 9 billion are unfunded, that is, these transactions have not yet closed. Of the $34 billion of sales we've had made since the third quarter in '07 in leveraged finance, I would like to stress that we've only needed to provide $4 billion of financing related to these sales. I would also like to highlight that we've completed $5 billion of new business in the quarter of which over three quarters were sold down and distributed in the market already. We continued to have tight standards of approval for any new transactions.</p>
          <p>We've reduced our CMBS positions to CHF 13 billion, down from CHF 15 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our focus here is entirely to reduce risk by exploring single property and portfolio reductions to various avenues.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to slide 17, we've included a listing of the key trading areas which were adversely affected by the volatility in market events in this quarter. You can see on this slide, the trading results for financial securities convertible bonds and equity trading strategies. And I will go through each of these areas in additional detail and describe our risk reduction plans.</p>
          <p>On slide 18, we explained the writedowns on our U.S. financial institution securities book. This book is a portfolio of preferred and hybrid securities of banks and other financial companies. The chart on the left shows the performance of various preferred financial securities during 2008. And you can see that Fannie and Freddie on the top and the Wachovia Hybrid in preferred index on the bottom.</p>
          <p>During September when the U.S. government placed the GFCs into conservatorship this resulted in severe reductions in the value of their preferred securities. More importantly, the loss of value in the preferred securities of Fannie and Freddie and the subsequent loss in some other financial firms created a loss of confidence that spread to preferreds of other blue-chip financials. These are now all trading at significant discount or distressed levels. While the U.S. government's intervention has stabilized this market and the portfolio, our plan is to opportunistically exit this portfolio. The convertible bond market was one of the most negatively affected asset classes in the quarter, as the ability to hedge convertibles was adversely impacted by the short sale rule and stresses in the CDS market.</p>
          <p>The chart on slide 19 shows performance of the convertible index during 2008. Ongoing hedge fund unwinds, deleveraging and forced selling caused additional pressure on asset prices. Our plan for this business is to focus entirely on facilitation for our customers and to support primary issuance, which will do by holding significantly lower levels of inventories. We've already cut this portfolio in the third quarter and we will substantially reduce these positions further in the next few months.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 20, I would like to focus on the performance of our equity trading strategies. The chart on the left is a public index of selected trading strategies, which I showed to give you reference to the performance of these businesses in the third quarter. Following the Lehman bankruptcy and unwinds, adverse market conditions prevailed across a number of strategies as a result of risk conversion and accelerated unwinds to leverage market participants. This led to reduce valuations across many asset classes and disrupted various arbitraged trading strategies. Throughout the crises, our strategy has been to reduce our trading risk. For example, we've reduced our long short positions in the third quarter by more than half. However, the sharp volatility and price moves related to many of these positions have outpaced our reduction in risk.</p>
          <p>As a result, we've experienced losses in our fundamental long short trading positions and in our risk arbitrage and event-driven trading books. Our plans for equity trading focuses principally on the quantitative and the statistical arbitraged trading businesses, these are market and neutral trading strategies and liquid underlying securities. Overall, we will significantly reduce the size of portfolio and focus on the strategies in which we've had strong historical returns throughout market cycles.</p>
          <p>As we move to slide 21, I will explain our corporate loan book, which is a diversified portfolio of term loans and commitments. The overall book size is just over $62 billion and it's approximately 80% investment grade. I think it's important for you to be aware that we value this book on a fair value basis. And accordingly, we mark our loans of both drawn and undrawn portions and the associated hedges, both single name and index CDS on the basis of current market prices. During this quarter, as you can see from the chart on the upper left that deterioration in the credit market led to a CHF 1.4 billion fair value decline in the loan values which was only partly offset by a CHF 0.5 billion increase in the prices of the associated credit default swaps.</p>
          <p>Under fair value, our loss was CHF 900 million for the quarter. Under our accrual accounting, losses are recognized only when credits are impaired. Given the quality of our book, impairment charges in the quarter would have been minimal, and as you can see from the lower box on the chart, we would have shown a gain of CHF 562 million on this quarter under this alternative methodology. While painful now, recognizing the market impact under fair value accounting should allow us to avoid recognition of significant losses in the future in the event that credit defaults do rise. Finally, the fair value discounts to our portfolio imply default rates which are significantly above the highest default rates experienced during the past 25 years.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 22 and on a more positive note, I've highlighted just a few of our stronger performances in the quarter. More than ever, we are seeing clients wanting to do more business with Credit Suisse as a strong counter-party in these tough markets.</p>
          <p>In our electronic trading businesses where revenues were up over 50% versus the same period last year, we are market leader in electronic trading with strong market share. We believe that an increasing number of financial products will move to electronic execution as more products like credit default swaps are traded and cleared on electronic platforms, Credit Suisse is ideally positioned.</p>
          <p>Our Rates and FX business represented in the bar chart in the middle had record revenues in the third quarter. We've experienced significant client activity in these businesses and we have seen good contribution across different products and across the regions. We continue to expand our sales coverage in these businesses and expect then to fuel revenue growth in the coming quarters. Our prime service business has experienced tremendous growth in this quarter.  As demonstrated on the bar chart furthest to the right, our franchises experienced over 44% growth rate year-to-date. In the third quarter alone, our balances increased over CHF 100 billion. We are maintaining a highly selective approach in taking on clients in collateral during the crisis accepting just 40% of new clients who approached us for business as we keep a close focus on operational risk and client service. We expect our client franchises to be the lynchpin and driver of the development of our businesses in the coming years. We continue to develop strong and deep relationships with the most important clients in the markets and this will be an important contributor to our activities in the years ahead.</p>
          <p>Slide 23 sets out how we've worked to reduce risk capital over the last year. As you can see in the chart on the top left, since the beginning of the year, we've reduced risk-weighted assets by $43 billion or 18%. We've also reduced trading VAR across the Investment Bank by 42% from the peak in the first quarter of 2008 after normalizing from methodology and dated set changes. This is effectively having our risk positions. But in the trading environment driven by deleveraging and specific market events, which we have experienced particularly in the month of September, our risk reduction was clearly outpaced by the deteriorating market conditions.</p>
          <p>I'd like to close by reiterating the top priorities for the Investment Bank set out on page 24. The recent market environment has validated our strategy and only heightened the importance of acceleration of the execution of it. Our priorities are reducing risk and volatility, diversifying earnings across products and geographies, growing our client-based businesses and driving efficiencies. These have been our priorities and they remain the areas where we will be focused. Navigating the ongoing financial turmoil will certainly be challenging. But our position is strong, and we expect these actions will enhance our franchise and improve the overall contribution to the Investment Bank mix toward the integrated banking model of Credit Suisse.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it back to you Brady for some final observations on the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Paul. Let me just sum it up. The continuing financial market turbulence and the cloudy outlook for economic activity are serious issues in the near term, and we are clearly going to need to continue to manage through a challenging period. Our unquestioned capital position will help us weather these difficult conditions and maintain our strong client momentum. Credit Suisse remains strongly positioned to benefit when favorable markets return and with that, I would like to open the call up for any questions for myself, Renato or Paul that you may have. So, operator, you can open up for questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>[Operating Instructions]. The first question is from Elad Ben-Am from Bank am Bellevue. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I have three questions, if I may. First of all on the corporate loan. Could you elaborate a little more on this portfolio in terms of geographic split and what type of loans are included in this 62 billion portfolio? That's the first question. And the second question, with regard to any Lehman losses, I mean did you book any losses related to your Lehman exposure and if yes, would that be part of the trading losses of 1.7 billion or where would that pop up? And the third question is on wealth management. I'd be interesting to hear how you managed to increase the recurring margin, what led to this increase of the recurring margin? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe I'll just start with on the Lehman loss. I assume there you're talking about our counter party exposures with Lehman. And I believe we said that there was no material impact to our third quarter results. So there was no real material impact from our Lehman exposures. On the corporate loan issue, Paul, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So maybe I can &#x2013; of the 62 billion corporate loan book which I referred to, as I said is 80% investment grade. Of that book, only about one third of it is drawn, two thirds are undrawn. To answer your question on geographic split, about 70% is U.S. based, 20% in Europe and 10% in other, principally Asia.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on your third question on Wealth Management, as you say I mean the private banking business in general continues to be pretty resilient through difficult markets and particularly as you say on the kind of recurring as well as the transactional part of the business. It's really &#x2013; a lot of it's based on our continuing efforts to increase our managed investment products, which has been a successful initiative for us. And as a result, it's actually &#x2013; that part of the business has held up quite well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question is from Kinner Lakhani from RBS [ABN AMRO]. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Three questions focused on the Investment Bank. Firstly, could you give us a rough size of the convertibles trading book as it stands today, especially given that prices and stress seem to have increased significantly post the quarter end? Second question is on the fixed income business, where even if I adjust for the corporate loan book mark-to-market, the results look weak. And you are saying that you've got record rates in ForEx. So I'm trying to understand the missing variable. And final question, clearly you've seen a very sharp growth in prime brokerage balances. Just wanted to try and understand how that affects the kind of group balance sheet and funding position as it relates to slide 11?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Paul, do you want take the first two of those at least?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. As you see here, we've disclosed &#x2013; provided an enormous amount of transparency with regards to our positions. But &#x2013; and the related losses associated with those portfolios. But we're not going to say exactly what our positions are. We've had I think a good convertible business across our client franchise. But obviously, given that you can see the market moves in that portfolio, suffered significant loss as a result of downturn in the market. And correspondingly, we've been bringing the size that portfolio down materially. It's already down more than a third from the balance where it was, but we haven't been disclosing the overall size of that portfolio.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How about the next question on....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to fixed income, as we showed very specifically, the fixed income results were adversely affected by continued write-downs you can see and not only the corporate loan book which you mentioned, but also across continued write-downs in the CMBS and our leveraged finance area, as we've seen &#x2013; as you saw the effect there of continued deterioration in markets there. And then we also saw additional losses which I described under the GFCs, this preferred and hybrid portfolio that I described the losses in; that also resides in the fixed income portfolio. And as you noted, those losses more than offset the gains record results we had in FX and rates.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on your last question on the impact on the overall balance sheet of the prime brokerage or prime services growth, I mean clearly it does have an impact on the balance sheet. There has been growth in the balance sheet in that business as a result of &#x2013; we mentioned an additional 117 billion Swiss francs of client assets in the quarter. And that manifests itself in a couple of different ways, but it certainly has had &#x2013; it's a material increase in the balance sheet. We've had other decreases and some of the more riskier asset categories to get to the net number that we are reporting. But that certainly is an increase, we view that as a pretty low risk part of the balance sheet.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Christoffer Malmer from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good morning. It's Chris Malmer from Goldman. Just a question on the revenues in the Investment Bank. If I add back in the write-downs and the gains on debt, and look at this on nine months basis, effectively for the first nine months of this year. Trying to strip those out and annualize those revenues, I get to somewhere on &#x2013; between 14 and 14.5 billion Swiss francs in revenues. So I was wondering if that's a number at all that you would think sounds reasonable. And looking at that then going forward, obviously you are talking about substantially reducing risk across a number of your trading strategies within the Investment Bank. I was wondering if obviously these strategies have contributed positively to revenues earlier on this year. I was wondering whether the nine month run rate is anything that is realistic to look at considering how you will be cutting back on risk appetite across those businesses. Are you comfortable that maybe some of the client improvements, client franchise gains you've made should be comfortably offsetting some of those trading reduction in revenues going forward? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Chris. Paul you want to take this one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think your run rate assumptions, they're not crazy, although given certainly our &#x2013; the uncertainty in the market, it's very difficult at this time to asses the stable run rate of the fixed income department overall. What we are seeing, as you pointed out, is very good results from client related activities and we expect those to continue and hopefully accelerate. To answer your question, the businesses that we are scaling back the risk in fact have not contributed materially to results, in fact they've been negative contributors over the past year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But if I look at for example the slide you're providing on page 29 on the supplementary information, for example the equity results, obviously there's a substantial contribution in the second quarter. Presumably there was some descent trading related revenues in that 2.3 billion number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think you're probably referring to some of the trading gains in the equities, and those have as you know over a period of time, our propriety trading results have been very good. In the second quarter, some of those strategies did perform well. Having said that, we &#x2013; what I mentioned earlier is, we're scaling back some of the more &#x2013; some of the outright strategies in the proprietary trading, and we'll continue with the quant and stat arb strategies which I believe will continue to contribute to the overall results. So I don't see the material impact in the actions that we're taking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And just finally on that, would you expect there to be any meaningful capital release as a result of reducing those risk levels, or is it &#x2013; as you mentioned, if it's not going to have a significant impact on revenues, it might not have a significant impact on capital, either?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning. It's Huw Van Steenis. I've got three quick questions. First, clearly the world has proved to be a lot tougher than we'd all hoped. To what extent do you feel there's more cost flexibility in the Investment Bank? Certainly the expense base in G&amp;A certainly ran fairly flat. Do you think it's unrealistic to look for sort of 15, 20% cost cuts into next year? Secondly, just on the new Swiss regs, at least there's a slight chance that you've probably &#x2013; you've now sold for at least a three and a quarter Tier 1 leverage ratio. To what extent has the market environment remained extremely harsh with the Swiss regulators now giving you forbearance to slip below that? Would you or the regulators actually like to keep above that, and that sort of requires more balance sheet shrinkage? And then thirdly and lastly, any perspectives on emerging markets? You historically have been very strong in Brazil, Russia and so forth, and to what extent does that cause you concern for Q4 and beyond? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Paul, maybe you can answer the cost and I can address maybe the Swiss regulatory issue and...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. As you know, we've been very focused on cost for now quite some time and we continue to believe there's good flexibility in our cost structure. As you know for the first nine month period, we brought down non-comp expenses about 167 million Swiss francs, over the same nine months period our G&amp;A per head, and we brought down materially from 164,000 Swiss francs to 135. Our non-variable non-comp expenses continue to come down in the Investment Bank. You did &#x2013; you can witness a slight increase in the VC&amp;E expenses as volumes in the underlying markets increased. We do believe there's more flexibility in the cost structure in the Investment Bank, and that's going to be I think particularly true also as you look across as well, including compensation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, Huw, as to your second question, as you know, I mean we haven't sort of talked about the precise levels and exactly how the capital targets and the leverage ratios line up exactly, but as we said last week we are &#x2013; we exceed those levels with the capital raise that we completed. And I think that &#x2013; I mean it's hard to &#x2013; as you say, I mean it's hard to imagine a situation where we would not be in excess of those levels. So I guess right now, I'd say we do well exceed the levels and I think that will be the case hopefully sometime to come. And the third question....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What's that third question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Emerging markets, just emerging markets. And emerging markets were strong in those areas. Yeah how do we view, are those going to be good contributor or what are our perspectives on it for next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are optimistic but extremely cautious with the emerging markets. I think the probably decoupling play has been overplayed, certainly &#x2013; well, we have been starting to see the effects in the emerging markets from the global crisis. We think the diversification is important. We think the underlying fundamental growth in many of the markets, particularly in that we see in Asia will be important and strong contributors to our earnings going forward. In '07, as you noticed, we earn more than 50% of our earnings in the Investment Bank outside of the United States and certainly it will continue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. Yes, two questions on Wealth Management and then one on leveraged finance. On the slide 7, your Wealth Management slide, you gave the net new money figures by region for the first nine months. And could you just comment on the momentum within those regions, which is growing best, which is facing the most pressure either in Q3 or maybe if you could a little prospectively? Second question on Wealth Management, you had a 25 basis point transaction margin which I suppose given market conditions wasn't too surprising. But you tend to have a pretty opportunistic and trading savvy clientele in Wealth Management, at least that's been the perception. Counter intuitively, was there any pickup in trading activity among some of your wealth management clients late in the quarter. And if not, when would you perhaps expect to see some? I know that's difficult question. And then finally just on leveraged finance. If I heard correctly, you said you had 5 billion of new commitments in the quarter, and if that's so, given your move away from the large multi-bank deals towards the smaller ones, do you in fact see some pick up in that smaller market in activity in the smaller market in leveraged finance? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Paul, maybe you can take the last one first and then we'll get the other two.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. And I think &#x2013; I'm glad you picked up and on that. In fact in a market that is as distressed as we've seen it with regards to some of the legacy positions, I think it's a positive step to see some transactions being done and distributed within the same quarter. So we &#x2013; as you noted, we picked up about 5 billion of new commitments, which about two thirds of those have been distributed during quarter. As you also noted, they tended to be of smaller transactions, obviously much sorter closing periods, and we do think that will be &#x2013; that is indicative of some of that businesses and how that business will trend going forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think Matt on the first two questions on Wealth Management, yeah it's &#x2013; in general, we've seen strong flows pretty evenly around the world. Certainly, Americas and Asia have been strong on the nine months as well as I'd say in the third quarter. Europe has been solid, I think Switzerland has been solid particularly across the whole business. In Switzerland it's been pretty solid. So the truth is it's been pretty good all around the world I'd say if any &#x2013; the two regions would probably standout as stronger would be Americas and Asia, if I had to pick two. But pretty strong really around the world.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; and in terms of prospectively, it's a little hard to say. I think we continue the see I think good even flows around the world. So I would say that &#x2013; I would guess that would probably continue.</p>
          <p>On the transaction margin, as you said it's a little &#x2013; it's always a little bit hard to gauge how that's going to move. We have seen a pick up in October in terms of transactional flows, particularly equities brokerage, which has been &#x2013; which is encouraging, I think. Obviously, the product issuing side particularly structured derivatives, things like that, are obviously still on the low side in terms of that aspect to transactional margins. So we have seen a pickup in some of the brokerage though. So again, I think it very much depends on how these markets develop as to whether that &#x2013; whether that maintains or whether it falls off again. So &#x2013; but actually interestly have picked up in October.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Derek De Vries from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. I have three questions, if I might. The first one comes back to emerging markets and given the recent market volatility in that space, I was wondering if you can give us some specific risk mitigations that you've employed in the last six months in the region? And then maybe specifically there has been a lot of press speculation about your exposure to Russian oligarchs and I was wondering if you could comment on how you're handling these important clients and the severe dislocations in their home market. And then second, if we go back to the period where Brady first took over the investment bank and there was much discussion back then about ensuring Credit Suisse had prop trading activities across all the different asset classes and there was a lot to talk about diversification, not being too dependent on any one asset class. Now you're talking about active reduction and trading risks and press convertibles long short equities. So is this somewhat of a reversal of the previous diversification strategy? And if so, do you run the risk of having sort of more concentrated positions by asset class. And then finally, you guys seem to avoiding talking specifically about the leverage ratios that the EBK is looking at. Is that intentional? Or maybe you could tell us exactly what they look at from leverage, because I doubt it's the tangible equity to assets that we all focus on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks very much. I guess on the third question, it's just that we actually said in conjunction with last Thursday that it's not really our &#x2013; we don't think it's our &#x2013; it's not our place really to announce what the guidelines are. That will obviously be up to the EBK and I guess they'll determine whether or not they will actually lay out the specific requirements and how those are calculated, et cetera. They obviously didn't in the past and whether that will change going forward or not, we don't know.</p>
          <p>So we're not trying to be mysterious about it, we just don't think it's our position really to lay those out. I mean I do think as we mentioned, we thought the important thing was to say that with this capital raise, we already meet the 2013 requirement. We have as you know, a very accretive capital generative business model, and any kind of normal markets. And so I think we're &#x2013; our view is that we are &#x2013; well, we think we're probably the best capitalized bank in the world and in an extremely strong position now. So that point of view &#x2013; that hopefully is the most important message there.</p>
          <p>I think on the investment banking side &#x2013; and Paul can add to this if you want something &#x2013; I guess my view is that we have actually been talking about for probably a couple of years now, the concept of continuing to reduce the volatility in our investment banking earnings, diversify the revenue streams and continue to effectively lower the risk and lower the volatility in the Investment Bank, that's been part of our &#x2013; I think pretty clear announced strategy of what we've been trying to do. I think that as we may &#x2013; as I think as Paul mentioned in his preamble to his remarks, this is really more I think an acceleration of some of the steps in response to some pretty volatile trading conditions.</p>
          <p>So I actually think that when you look at the portfolio the activities that remain, I think we still have a very good breadth of businesses that is a diversified portfolio that will I think put us in the position of &#x2013; in addition to building out our client businesses and the other initiatives we have, I think a more diversified, lower volatility, less correlated set of revenue streams in our businesses. But I'll let Paul...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's exactly right, Brady, and it's not a reverse. I mean number one, we're responding to just the enormous increase in volatility in the underlying markets and some of the market dislocation events that we're experiencing. So that's part of the response to the prop trading strategies. And then secondly as Brady said, we're really looking at it in the context of not only the entire Investment Bank, but with regards to the integrated bank, and we're looking at the correlation of the various strategies to the volatility of our earnings.</p>
          <p>So as I said earlier, we really will be focusing on those strategies, the quant and start arb strategies, that truly have significantly less correlation with the underlying businesses. And that's where we'll continue to focus as opposed to outright proprietary positions like you mentioned, the preferred securities, which is more of the directional play rather than a market-neutral type position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just so I understand this. So this is a long-term, we're not going to two years from now when convertibles go back in favor or whatnot, this is a reducing it, not getting back into it kind of strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you will see from us is we'll continue to focus on strategies that we think are complementary, that we believe we can accommodate our goal of reducing risk and volatility across the Investment Bank.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then to answer your question on emerging markets, we share your concern of continued contagion of some of what we've seen in the crisis in the more developed markets, what steps have we taken. We have generally reduced positions overall where we've been able. We've tightened collateral agreements and arrangements with our counter parties. We've taken in particular foreign exchange and interest rate exposure down across emerging markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just &#x2013; do you have a sense of how much your economic capital has been reduced in emerging markets in say the last 6 or 12 months? I mean ballpark kind of numbers? Are we talking a 20% reduction in economic capital or 50% or 5% or no reduction in economic capital? Higher economic capital because of the increased volatility? I don't know, I'm just...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, well I &#x2013; maybe &#x2013; my guess &#x2013; Paul probably has a better view. But my view is we actually were &#x2013; had run it pretty tight even coming into this. So we had run a pretty disciplined risk profile coming into it. So I didn't &#x2013; we had kind of been concerned as the -obviously the emerging markets have been pretty sloppy for some time. So we had been concerned well into this. I think even now though we probably, I don't know, reduced by probably 15 or 20%, maybe the ERC, is that right Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'd have to confirm that, but I think that feels about right given the context of our overall reductions in RWA and our VaR measures. More &#x2013; as importantly as I stated before I think are tightening up some of the other control issues which can mitigate our risk like collateral agreements, which again mitigate the overall exposure to the counter parties in those markets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. A couple of questions, please. The first one is you increased your head count in the Investment Bank by 4% quarter-over-quarter. Could you just share you thoughts, whether this is related to volume increases or whether you think this appropriate going into a pretty tough revenue environment say for the next couple of quarters? Second question, on risk weighted assets, you disclosed them I think for the first time for the Investment Bank. Thanks a lot for that. It's U.S. $193 billion, it went down about 10% quarter-over-quarter. Could you just share your view with us, where you think it might trend to say over the next twelve months or so in terms of potential positive changes? And then a quick one on the loan book. The Investment Bank has 62 billion loans outstanding. Is it the entire amount of that mark-to-market? Because at least based on the full year numbers shown in the annual report, it says it's only $31 billion back then and it was actually reported at fair value in terms of your 240 billion loan book. And the final one just quickly on Glencore, you announced in August 2006 a strategic partnership with Glencore, whose CS level has also blown out recently. And could you just comment on the status of this relationship and potential impact from foreign commodity prices? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks very much. Paul, do you want to start with the first question on IB head count?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Philipp, maybe I can address some of the issues around the head count. We've had a significant amount of movement in the head count in the Investment Bank. As you know, we've announced approximately 1,300 layoffs in the Investment Bank, just enormous reallocation of resources, some from some of the more risk intensive businesses and the client related businesses, and this isn't moving people, it's layoffs from one area and hiring people in others.</p>
          <p>Some areas down like the &#x2013; if you look at the CMBS area, leveraged finance, 50, 65% as you know whereby other areas that we've talked about investing in some of the client related businesses, prime service businesses, up material over that same period of time.</p>
          <p>On the increase that you see over the year represents more than anything an investment in infrastructure. Almost half of that increase is attributable to IT, where we have people supporting the infrastructure for the build out of our prime service, electronic trading and derivative platforms that we've talked about in the investment there. It also &#x2013; those numbers would include increases to our CoE, that's our &#x2013; into our Centers of Excellence, in places like Pune and Wroclaw. It includes increase in people, then we have our mortgage servicer, which we've &#x2013; there have been increasing heads to that mortgage servicing company which continues to do reasonably well. It includes the new graduate classes that have come on board as well.</p>
          <p>So there are a lot of moving pieces here, probably more relevant to look at our overall non-comp expenses and how that's moved, because some of the shift in head count that you'll see is to a lower cost base and lower cost base centers overall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you want to add a take on the risk-weighted assets question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we have &#x2013; are pleased to show that you're pleased with the transparency that we've provided in terms of risk-weighted assets here and certainly from all the comments we've made today, I think it's very clear that that trend in risk-weighted assets is &#x2013; will continue.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then so, question on loan book, so...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The corporate loan book, the corporate loan book in the Investment Bank is &#x2013; that specific loan book is about one-third drawn, so about 20 billion of that you see is the balance, on the balance sheet. And the entire loan book &#x2013; and that includes about 5, that includes the drawn portion and the undrawn &#x2013; is fair value accounted for. There's about 5 billion of bridges in there which is low comp.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Renato, do you want to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> be a little bit &#x2013; very precise here what we talk about. You'll see in the quarterly report an amount of some 60 billion loans by the Investment Bank. About half of that is on an accrual basis, about another half, roughly 30 billion is on a fair value basis. Out of that 30 billion fair value as Paul mentioned, on balance sheet, about 20 is out of the so-called corporate loan book. On top of that, as Paul mentioned, we have another some 40 billion in that corporate loan book on commitment which is fair valued as well. So again, on the balance sheet amounts, you can see in the report about half is fair value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think on your last question on Glencore, I mean they've been a terrific partner for us in the commodity space and our joint venture has actually done extremely well. As you may recall, it is in a number of different areas of commodities where we work together to generate transactions and then share the revenues that come out of those. So it's a pretty straightforward joint venture. They've been a great partner and obviously have terrific contacts into the whole commodities world and that obviously gives us a lot of advantages in terms of being able to market to customer bases, and in terms of ideas around products, et cetera. So it continues to be &#x2013; I think it has been throughout a profitable joint venture and continues to be and we're very happy with them as a strategic partner. Next question?</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good morning. I got two questions, please. The first is on the compensation policy within the Investment Bank. In what appears to be from a revenue perspective, possibly the worst quarter you've had at any time over recent years. The compensation has actually held up at a reasonably robust level, I think certainly comparing it to year-on-year, you're up 78% on the compensation. So I just wonder if you could discuss how we should view compensation ratios or compensation levels going forward, please? The second is again, with respect to your value at risk, obviously you see the value at risk coming down from the second quarter and broadly where we are or where it's been over for the past year and yet again the revenues, especially in the equities business, are very, very weak. And then how meaningful is that, the value of risk as an idea, as a measure of the risk that you're running? Especially if you think about the VIX index having reached new highs over the recent week or so, should we expect another very difficult fourth quarter in terms of your equities result? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. Paul, do you want to &#x2013; or maybe you can take both of those?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I'll start out with compensation. Our compensation expense, you referred to the quarter-on-quarter. In fact, if you look at the third quarter last year, we actually had a negative accrual as we had accrued quite a bit through the second quarter, and then the poor results in that quarter last year allowed us to draw down. So if you'd look just on versus quarter two, it's down about 40%. But as you know, the final decisions on compensation accrual will be determined when we see full year results, and I can assure you they will be in line with the performance of the Investment Bank.</p>
          <p>With regards to the question on VAR, VAR is just one measure. As you know, it's &#x2013; there have been material methodology effects inherent in that, it's somewhat backward looking. It is a valuable measure of risks, but that has to be combined with other risk assessment metrics including looking at our risk-weighted assets, and in particular in these market environments really focusing on our scenario now.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, next question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from Fiona Swaffield from Execution. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, on the Wealth Management division, you talked about the resilience in the recurring fee margin, but I am assuming that's probably because of timing on the assets and I would assume that Q4 is going to be rather difficult from revenues given what's happening in the market values. Could you talk little bit about costs? I mean I know that you've got this investment plan and you mentioned 350. But how much scope is there to have any cost flexibility in Wealth Management given the revenue outlook that's pretty difficult? And then on the alternatives business within Asset Management which looks particularly resilient in the third quarter with continued net inflows. Could you talk about the hedge fund business and any potential outflows coming or what is happening within that business? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Maybe I will start with the second question. I mean as you say we've had good inflows into the alternatives business all year on a net basis, every quarter I believe and continued in the third quarter. So I think particularly in these difficult investing markets I think that's a very strong sign. And clearly though as you say we've had some outflows on the hedge fund side I think about included in that net inflow number in the alternatives area I think there was below less than two billion of outflows on the hedge fund side.</p>
          <p>So we have seen some outflows through the fund to fund business et cetera so. And as you say I think the fourth quarter I mean obviously your guess is as good as ours but would seem to be that there probably will be additional redemptions in that area. But we do still continue to see obviously right now is a great time to be investing in the private equity space. And so people who do &#x2013; I think people who are looking forward are interested in actually putting money to work in private equity now, and hopefully that will mean we will have some healthy inflows.</p>
          <p>With regard to your first question about the kind of the recurring fee margin, fourth quarter and then cost flexibility, actually interest income is quite stable in that business generally. And even though assets under management are down, the margins are better on what we're doing. And so, we again think that that's pretty resilient. We still do believe that a gross margin of 110 over the cycle &#x2013; 110 basis points over the cycle is achievable. And we haven't seen a big impact on the business so far. It has been fairly resilient.</p>
          <p>So I think on that front I would just say I'm not sure that we'd agree with your assessment that it's going to be a very difficult fourth quarter. I think actually the business has shown itself. I mean if you look over the past whatever it's been now, four, five quarters of this crisis, the business has continued to be very resilient throughout. So I actually think &#x2013; it's my hope it's likely to continue that way. And we do feel as you mentioned before that there could even be a pickup on the transaction based side in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>As to cost flexibility, I mean we've continued on &#x2013; we can't answer the question specifically for the Investment Bank, but we continue to look closely at our costs on an overall bank wide basis, and the non-comp cost side has been a focus for some time. And I think we've got good momentum and good systems and processes in place to help to make that happen. As you say we are expanding the business though, and of course that does require investment. And that does incur additional expenses. We continue to believe that this is probably the best time that we've seen in decades to hire people and to add very good resources in the business. And we want to take advantage of that. Given our strong positions in the market we want to take advantage of that to make sure that when the markets do turn, we're in very, very strong position in the Wealth Management business. So there is some cost flexibility, probably on the non-comp side. We will continue to drive that. But overall, we think it's more important now to be making the right investments and then have them pay off when things get better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on one number in the Wealth Management division that really surprised me was lending, it's still growing very strongly. And there is actually no signs of de-leverage. I mean could you just, I mean are you very surprised about that too?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not really. I mean we said our &#x2013; the areas that we saw as big opportunities for us were increasing our managed assets, which I've already talked about a little bit, increasing the liability side, the lending side within our Private Banking business and then lastly increasing the cross-sell particularly across Investment Banking and Private Banking. That's been &#x2013; those have been our themes really for the last, I don't know couple of years.</p>
          <p>And so we were &#x2013; I think we were a much smaller lender in the Private Banking space than many of our big competitors. And so we have been in a disciplined and &#x2013; gradual but consistent way growing the liability side of that business. It gets very good capital treatment. We think we've got high quality loans that we're putting on there, but it is part of our conscious strategy to grow the liability side of that business.</p>
          <p>And again that is helping to contribute to the profitability of the business. And again as you know, it's very high quality lending business because it's mostly secured lending. So it's pretty good business.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions, firstly do you think you might use some of the relaxation on the fair value rules going forward I mean particularly if you are going to have to fair value commitments that you haven't actually lent out yet. And secondly on the Level 3 assets I know we are going to get those statements on the 31st of October, but can you just maybe give us a direction of those in the last quarter. And then finally on note 13 in the financial statements I see there is a big increase in brokerage receivables of 50 billion or so, is that the Lehman effect or is that something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I will ask Renato to answer a couple of the others, but on the third point I believe that increase in brokerage receivables, a lot of that is around as you probably know there has been an increase in the fail situation in the treasury market, repo market in the U.S. as a result of &#x2013; yeah, just the volatility in the markets and some of the unusual circumstances. Some of the traditional holders have stopped lending out those securities that's resulting across the industry enormous amount of fails.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Enormous amount of fails. So there is a very high and persistent fail rate there and so I think that you are very perceptive to pick that up in that note, but that's what it is basically is that there is a large and persistent industry wide issue around fails in treasuries and it has &#x2013; so you see that in the gross number, it has a small impact on our risk weighted assets. It's not a risk issue or anything. It's not something that we're at risk, but it is a persistent fails situation that gives rise to that balance sheet item. Do you, Renato, want to talk about fair value and Level 3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not anticipate that we'll substantially change our approach when it comes to fair value. As Paul said, with the fair value approach we are very close to the market. We are actually frontrunners in valuing properly to market our positions. We actually believe that it would create slight some additional uncertainties. Certainly, we would have a different approach to valuing our positions. On the Level 3 assets, as you rightly say, we will come out with them in a week. My first estimate we have is that we have gone down slightly in Swiss francs terms even considering the impact of the U.S. dollars. So you will see lower numbers in the Level 3 asset level.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the same, and compared to the fair valued assets, we will probably have about the same percentage as we had in the second quarter.</p>

          <p>Hi there. Just one further question please. Are you seeing any early signs of stress in any bits of your Corporate and Retail Banking loan book? Are there any parts of that portfolio that start to cause you concern with economic forecasts coming down pretty sharply all around?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jeremy. No, we are not seeing any signs of stress. I mean obviously, we are in these kinds of markets, and what you &#x2013; given all the things that are happening, we're certainly watching everything. We're not seeing any early signs of stress, and as you know, particularly in Switzerland, there was never really any of the excesses that we saw in many other markets. So we didn't have any of the real estate excesses et cetera. And I think that we've certainly tried to be extremely disciplined about the quality of the book, etcetera, but no, we are not seeing any stress in it. I think we will &#x2013; as you know, we are continuing to see the trend that we have been seeing for a while which is that our releases will be lower than what they've been in the past. So &#x2013; but in terms of problems beginning to mount, we do not see that now.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. It's actually Davida Serra. I have two questions. The first one is, your head count keeps on growing at the Group level, and particularly in the Investment Bank, you added about 1,000 &#x2013; about 800 people year-on-year at about 5% growth. Now, the environment is changing and you're de-risking. Every competitor is cutting staff by between 10 and 20. I agree you are one of the winner, one of the best capitalized, but as a shareholder, when do also employees in the Investment Bank are going to take the hit. And are you thinking of a more significant head count reduction to align the lower profitability expected say in the next couple of quarters?</p>
          <p>The second question is I appreciate the fact that you've been growing the total assets. All I just want to say, why quarter-on-quarter you added 108 &#x2013; 150 billion of total assets, because from the risky assets you are de-gearing, the trading assets are coming down. So I'd love to understand, the 108 &#x2013; 150 billion delta total assets growth, third quarter on second quarter, what exactly it is? I mean we can see it's eight billion loss, and if you can give me a color whether it's government bonds or whether it's carry trade, more color on this 150 billion delta, Swiss Francs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Davida thanks very much. On the second question which I will take first, I think the bulk of the quarter-on-quarter increase in balance sheet is actually due to FX. So, it's about 100 billion of that. And then there is probably the remainder of about 50 billion is mostly from the prime brokerage side where we've seen tremendous inflows during the quarter. In that we showed about over 100 billion Swiss francs as client balances increase, and that has given rise to increases in the balance sheet as well.</p>
          <p>So you're right. The risky assets have been going down, et cetera. We think we are showing good discipline on our risk-weighted asset side for instance. But clearly, FX has kind of gone against us and our client-related assets are going up pretty rapidly, which we think is a good thing. So but anyway, I think hopefully that explains the changes and, Paul, do you want to address the head count question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, let me address the head count. In the Investment Bank, as you know, we entered this turbulent period last summer with the lowest head count of any of the major investment banks. So it should I think put us in a stronger starting position here. We've made significant cutbacks in some of the more affected business areas, the CMBS, RMBS and CDOs down as much as 60%, so significant cut.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have shifted resources to areas that we have mentioned as those key areas, robust growth opportunities across some of the areas such as prime services, some of the flows areas, foreign exchange and rates. On the increase you see as well, a significant amount, almost half of that is in IT as we're supporting infrastructure for the growth in many of our businesses, prime services, electronic trading, derivatives. We need to ensure that we have a strong infrastructure to grow those client-related businesses.</p>
          <p>Additionally, there are, in those numbers, people that we've hired in, in terms of, into our centers of excellence which are moving people in more expensive centers to more efficient centers in places like Pune, India. We have new graduates and some other &#x2013; in those groups. We keep, we are keeping a very close eye on the resourcing that we have across the Investment Bank and ensuring that it is aligned with what opportunities we see in the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Can I have actually a follow-up on the positive inflow of prime broker assets and particularly in Europe, after the debacle of Lehman prime broker assets I would expect you to be a clear winner because now you have the highest core capital. Your Swiss competitor is less capitalized, even though there is probably less risky assets. But most importantly, there is not much choice because in Europe, if you take the US counterparts right now, you might end up with a Lehman to experience because of bankruptcy law. So how much, let's say, the trends you've seen in the third quarter, is it continuing into October, is it the structural trend or has it just been a panic move, and you're just benefiting in September?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I wouldn't say it's a panic move because as I mentioned, we've seen increasing flows in this business. I mean we've been improving our market position for the past couple of years in prime services. Obviously the growth in inflow of assets over this past year particularly since about mid-March has been significant. September was extraordinary in terms of the balances we've seen. I think it's very important to note that we've been very selective in terms of both the counter-parties and the collateral which we have on-boarded. Our acceptance rate just only have been about 40% of those who've come to us and we on-boarded those clients and our respective collateral of holding I think quite high standards as we've on-boarded business throughout the third quarter.</p>

          <p>Yes, I think, our view is, I mean our hope and expectation is that the prime brokerage business will continue to &#x2013; we will be able to grow it, we can grow it. We obviously want to continue to be disciplined in terms of how we do grow it so that we keep it very well controlled. We do have, I think a strong platform, but we clearly want to make sure that we grow it in a disciplined way, but I think certainly there is opportunity as you say. There is I think lots of business to do. Okay, next question.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Mr. Dougan, I have got a question about the ongoing debate about the salaries and bonuses. It's about what happened last week. Mr. Kurer said that he expects that salaries at UBS will stick above 10 million. And the reaction from the federal accountant was quite clear and fast. And after that intervention, Mr. Kurer had to apologize for his statement. And I was wondering about Credit Suisse, what do you think what will happen to the salaries at Credit Suisse in the short term future? Will they stick above 10 million or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think more generally, first of all, I mean we've had I think a pretty clear record of making sure that our compensation for people was very much reflected in performance and was very much aligned with our shareholders. And so I think there is no question that in a year like this where the firm is not performing as well as it has in previous years, and where the shareholders, and they have not done as well clearly, the employees also need to &#x2013; that needs to be reflected in compensation. There is no question about that.</p>
          <p>And in general, I think that it is &#x2013; I hope what we see out of a number of things that have happened here is that we will actually have a more reasonable approach to compensation for people in the industry. And it's something that we're hoping we see throughout the industry. So we also I think have worked hard to design our compensation in a way that does align employees' interest with shareholder interests and does have a longer tail on it so that if the people don't just get paid today for what they've done, if they get paid today, what they tail on that which links into the performance of the company and the performance of the stock over time.</p>
          <p>And we've I think put in place some very good instruments in that respect that have ensured that if the company doesn't continue to perform well, then some of that compensation that's given out is actually clawed back. And we think that's been something that's been very, very healthy as well. So I think all of those principles will I think hopefully lead us to have a good responsible compensation system that does reflect the value that's being added and is aligned with shareholders and reflects the reality or the performance of the company.</p>

          <p>I don't think I'd comment, and I can't really comment on any specific numbers. I mean it's certainly &#x2013; we don't even determine compensation till the end of the year. That certainly sounds like a very high number to me, so but anyway, I wouldn't comment on any particular numbers.</p>

          <p>Hey, guys. Thanks for taking all these questions. Last one just on the CDS clearing houses getting some press attention. How do you think this would impact your business that you managed to get a central clearing house up and running for CDS? Do you see a meaningful risk reduction or don't you think it really makes much difference? And how do you see it affecting the revenue side in terms of price discovery and that kind of thing? Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I spoke at the AGM, the ISDA AGM about six, seven months ago and sort of congratulated everyone for the 64 trillion balance in CDS. But I said at that time that I thought it would be very constructive to have a clearing mechanism for these products. I believe that it will be &#x2013; it's good structurally for the market. I think Credit Suisse is well positioned. I talked a bit earlier about the success of some of our electronic trading platforms, AES in particular. And we believe that as this market moves to do more central clearing, through electronic trading, both, it will be positive for us as a market participant and good overall for the further development in the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good morning, Paul. Thank you very much for all these questions. I wanted to follow up on the prime brokerage. I see that you're gaining great market share. I was wondering what is going to happen? What is happening to the margin of this business? Is it similar like in the reinsurance where you can charge now every price because the competitors are dropping off, or is there a big offsetting effect giving lower leverage of the clients overall?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Peter. Paul, you want to take that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks, Peter. Overall, I mean there are a couple of dynamics going on in the industry. Certainly, credit is being priced properly or in commensurate with the market conditions. We are seeing general de-leveraging across the industry, but offsetting that margins in the business are increasing.</p>
