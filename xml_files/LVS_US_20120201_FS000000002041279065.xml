      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. For our company, 2011 was a landmark year, in which we broke company records and at the same time we believe most industry records for revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share. I want to walk you through a more detailed look at the previous quarter, which includes record results in Macau and Singapore and incredible growth in our mass gaming, hotel and retail businesses.</p>
          <p>But first let me provide some additional perspective on 2011 and share my thoughts on where the company is headed in 2012. Thanks to our financial strength and significant liquidity, we're happy to announce that the LVS Board of Directors has approved an annual dividend of $1 per share, which will be paid at $0.25 per quarter, that is, a quarter a quarter.</p>
          <p>Our geographic diversity and the strength of our operations in each of our business locations, or as I've said in the past, the reliability and predictability of our operating results and cash flow has put us in a unique and enviable position, one which allows us to offer much deserved dividend to our shareholders while at the same time providing us ample resources to aggressively pursue new development opportunities around the globe.</p>
          <p>As a testament to the work of our corporate executive team led by Mike, Rob and Ken, our property management leadership teams and all of our team members worldwide, the company increased its net revenue from $6.9 billion in 2010 to a record $9.4 billion in 2011, an increase of 37%. Since gross revenue seems to be on people's minds, even though EBITDA is still what you take to the bank, I'm happy to point out the all-time industry record, $11.5 billion in total gross revenue the company produced in 2011. Others report gross revenue figures as it is a measurement of overall growth, so we felt we would share the figures with you as well.</p>
          <p>While we're on the topic of gross revenue, let me also point out, since it seems to be grabbing some headlines today, that our gross gaming market share in Macau rose from 15% last January to 19% in January of 2012. Not that we run our business for market share, but our re-affiliation with Macau's most important gaming promoters can help drive our market share above 25% or even higher in the future. I remember discussing this on a previous telephone call, that I expect that when our new relationships with new junket reps would bring us back to the mid-20%s. I'm now optimistic after moving so fast with so few new &#x2013; comparatively so few new junket reps that we moved up to 19.7% I think it is; it depends whose report you read.</p>
          <p>Now, let me get back to a topic a little closer to my heart, and that is EBITDA. Our 2011 company-wide EBITDA soared from $2.2 billion in 2010 to an industry record, an all-time industry record, of $3.53 billion last year, a remarkable 58% increase. In addition, earnings per diluted share in 2011 increased a whopping 106% over the previous quarter. These &#x2013; sorry, that should be year instead of quarter: earnings per diluted share in 2011 increased a whopping 106% over the previous year.</p>
          <p>These overall results also reflect another substantial accomplishment. In another industry first, we had two properties in two different markets, Marina Bay Sands in Singapore and The Venetian Macao in Macau, that both produced EBITDA in excess of $1 billion. In fact, every single one of our properties saw meaningful percentage increases in EBITDA in 2011 when compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>This past year truly showed the power of our Integrated Resort business model and its ability to generate tremendous revenue and, of course, EBITDA. Our company did not make its debut on the Fortune 500 until 2010 and since that time, we've been fortunate enough to surpass all of our industry competitors on that prestigious list.</p>
          <p>Also important to note, our growth is not just fueled by a single revenue source either. You could point to strong growth in retail, food and beverage, meetings and conventions, or the $1 billion in room revenue the company did in 2011 as clear evidence that we are much better described as an international Integrated Resort developer rather than simply as a gaming company.</p>
          <p>We expect to build on our success in 2012, and that effort starts with the opening of Cotai Central, which will happen just about two months from now. Cotai Central represents an important next step in the maturation of Macau as a leisure and business destination. Room capacity provided by the nearly 6,000 rooms we will open over the course of the year, along with a wide variety of non-gaming attractions and amenities, will help Macau continue to build even further on its fast-growing tourism sector.</p>
          <p>We believe there are three important components to long-term growth in Macau: transportation and infrastructure development, which is being enhanced as we speak; hotel room inventory, which of course, we will be meaningfully contributing to with the opening of Cotai Central; and lastly, the continued growth of the Chinese urban population, who, equipped with sufficient disposable income, will visit Macau and significantly expand on the record 28 million tourist arrivals that occurred in 2011. So, it goes without saying, the opening of Sands Cotai Central is an important catalyst to what we expect to accomplish in 2012.</p>
          <p>I expect 2012 will also see us make significant progress on the development front, which is important because at our core, we will always be a growth company. Mike and I have made it our personal priority to aggressively pursue and ultimately secure new development opportunities for the company this year and we have made recent trips to Asia to support these efforts.</p>
          <p>As we've mentioned before, we are highly interested in exploring opportunities specifically in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. And our efforts are clearly progressing as our most recent conversations have advanced to the point where details such as site selection, programming and the IR have been discussed.</p>
          <p>Finally, before we get to a discussion about fourth quarter results, let me specifically highlight a  segment of our business that I am particularly excited about. Together, tenant-related gross revenue from our retail models in Macau and Singapore rose to $106 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, an increase of 47% compared to the same quarter a year ago. The combined operating profit margin from that segment, 83%. For the full year of 2011, sales per square foot at the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian Macao was $1,087. I might add that that is 280 &#x2013; almost 300 tenants. So we're averaging &#x2013; that includes restaurants which are typically lower per square foot sales. At the Four Seasons mall in Macau, it was $3,386. And in Singapore, Marina Bay Sands, sales per square foot was $1,231</p>
          <p>Just to put a little prospective on that, the largest mall in the United States was &#x2013; the highest producing sales per square foot was the Forum Shops here in Las Vegas, across the street from us that went up originally to like $1,200 a foot. And then we started our Grand Canal Shoppes here at The Venetian Las Vegas at $1,000 to $1,100 a foot. So when you talk about $3,386 average for about 100 tenants, the DFS high end luxury tenant that we have on the first floor of the mall, The Shoppes at Four Seasons, was $5,500 plus or minus sales per square foot for 2011. That is really a whopping percentage. No mall in the world to the best of our knowledge and inquiries of other real estate to mall developers even get close to that number.</p>
          <p>As we mentioned before, being in the retail mall business and owning some of the largest properties in the region will provide meaningful value to us, particularly as the retail market in Asia continues to grow. It doesn't take a big leap of faith to add another growth factor. But just on today's number, and so take 106 you can extrapolate that &#x2013; you can annualize that and you could apply four times &#x2013; a 4% cap rate.</p>
          <p>In Asia, there was one of the top real estate guys &#x2013; in the United States, went to the mall, saw it, came back and said, I wouldn't argue with the possibility that you might get a 3.5% cap rate. But we're not looking at that. If you take a 4% to 5% cap rate &#x2013; say, 4% and you multiplied it by the hundreds of millions of dollars, so that's 25 times that amount of money, you're talking about huge amount of money that equals our debt, which means if that those malls were sold, we would be net cash debt-free.</p>
          <p>Let me now take a minute to summarize our fourth quarter results and then we'll take a quick look at our operations by location before we get to your questions.</p>
          <p>For the 10th straight quarter, the company increased its EBITDA from the previous quarter. Did I say something about reliability and predictability. We once again produced company records in EBITDA, $961 million for the quarter; and net revenue, which was $2.5 billion; and once again applying the metric others use, our gross revenue was $3.1 billion. Our EBITDA margin increased 110 basis points to almost 38%, and adjusted EPS increased nearly 36% to $0.57 versus last year's fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>For a review of our operating results, let me start Macau with the properties operated by majority-owned subsidiary, Sands China Ltd., turned in, as you could guess, record results. Our adjusted EBITDA for Macau property operations was $434 million for the quarter, an impressive 27% increase from last year's fourth quarter. At The Venetian Macao, EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2011 was a record $283 million, an increase of 20% over last year's fourth quarter and EBITDA margin was a record 37.1%.</p>
          <p>On the gaming side of the business, Rolling Chip volume, VIP, was a record $13.6 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the same quarter last year. Non-Rolling Chip drop to the mass market also increased nearly 15% to a record $1.1 billion and slot handle increased 52% versus last year's fourth quarter and was a record $1.1 billion. The legend of The Venetian Macao continues to grow and it clearly remains Macau's most visited destination.</p>
          <p>The growth in non-gaming revenues was significant during the fourth quarter of 2011. Food and beverage revenue increased 30%. Room revenue increased 15%. Mall revenue was up 35%, and additional non-gaming areas such as conventions revenue were up 32% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. At the Sands Macao, adjusted property EBITDA was $88 million for the quarter. Non-Rolling Chip drop was $687 million, and Rolling Chip volume was $7.6 billion. Both were increases versus the same quarter last year. Slot handle at the Sands increased 58% to a record $621 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, the initiatives we have undertaken over the past several months to improve our VIP business in Macau are now bearing significant fruit. Evidence of that success is reflected in this past quarter's results where Rolling Chip volume at the Plaza Casino and the Four Seasons increased 64% over the fourth quarter of last year and was a record $7.5 billion. The property also had its best EBITDA quarter ever, recording $63 million over the three-month period. Slot handle at the Plaza Casino reached $244 million, up 82% versus quarter four of last year.</p>
          <p>As with The Venetian Macao, non-gaming revenue sales results saw significant increases over last year. Specifically, The Shoppes at the Four Seasons where mall revenue increased 54% over the same quarter last year and was a record $24.5 million.</p>
          <p>Let's move down to Singapore, and to give this section a little perspective, let me start by saying that when we opened our first Integrated Resort in 1999, The Venetian here in Las Vegas, it cost approximately $1.1 billion to build for the first 3,000 suites. Fast forward today, that figure turns out to be less than the $1.5 billion in EBITDA Marina Bay Sands generated in 2011 alone.</p>
          <p>It cost us a little more to build than the original Venetian, but with these results, you'll hardly hear me complain about that. And that is &#x2013; to give that a little perspective, I want to point out to some of you who know that there were competitors of ours and some analysts, perhaps, that estimated in our first 12-month period &#x2013; the one just ended &#x2013; we will earn &#x2013; people made money wagers on the over and under number was $300 million EBITDA for the year.</p>
          <p>I'm happy to report that when I said years ago that I thought we could earn $1 billion in 2011, sorry, I was wrong, I'm very happy our competitors were wrong and they lost their bets. We are only five times what that bet was that we would make only $300 million.</p>
          <p>One has to wonder where the upside potential is for Singapore. If you're of the school of thought that says that we've already hit the top and we have no growth left, you have to make the assumption that we're the most phenomenal marketing people in the history of the casino industry, because we found every VIP player that exists, and therefore there are no more VIP players to exist and there won't be any more players &#x2013; potential players that have made money and will make money and therefore we can't grow.</p>
          <p>Now, if you're of the school of thought that we think we are, and you are more objectively and independently making the judgment about where Singapore is going to go, you have to consider the fact that nobody in the history of gaming ever saturated a market by bringing up &#x2013; by saying that we've eaten up all the &#x2013; and we've identified and we have contacted and we have interacted with every single player that exists in the 1.3 billion population of China, the 128 million of Japan, the 44 million of Korea, the 24 million of Taiwan, the 90 million of Vietnam, 75 million of Thailand, 240 million people in Indonesia, and 28 million people in Malaysia. Did I miss a few countries?</p>
          <p>So add a few hundred million more. I would like to feel that we are the best and we've accomplished things that nobody could ever dream of, but let's be realistic. We have a long way to go. And there is nobody that believes that there is a threshold that we won't go beyond. The hurdles are falling at every threshold and we are of the belief that our growth &#x2013; actually my middle name, my parents didn't name me &#x2013; did not name me Gary, which they did. My middle initial in SGA would stand for Sheldon Growth Adelson.</p>
          <p>The success of Marina Bay Sands continues to roll on as the property delivered record results for the fourth quarter of 2011. Property EBITDA was $427 million, a nearly 40% increase over the $306 million from the same quarter a year ago. Gaming volumes in Singapore were very strong during the quarter. The Rolling Chip volume up 32%, Non-Rolling Chip drop up 22%, and slot handle increasing by nearly 50% compared to last year's quarter. Did I forget to say something about growth? Total mass win per day compared to last year's fourth quarter &#x2013; total mass win per day during the quarter was $4.6 million, an increase of 44% from the same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Talk about growth, the property saw huge percentage year-over-year increases in several revenue streams. Food and beverage revenue was up 41%. Mall revenue was up 56%. And hotel room revenue increased by more than 50%, with ADR, RevPAR and occupancy all up significantly compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Back here in the U.S. &#x2013; let me just make a comment that I believe that the mall revenue here is on a stand-alone basis, when we extrapolate and estimate what it's worth, will go up to &#x2013; will be very significant, that we'll easily be able to sell the mall and pay off all our financing and put some more money back in our pocket.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; but back here in the U.S., The Venetian and The Palazzo in Las Vegas delivered $81 million in EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Strong group meeting and convention business drove a 16% increase in cash revenues from the sale of hotel rooms compared to last year's fourth quarter and food and beverage revenue also increased 10% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Table game drop also increased during the fourth quarter. It was $532 million versus $463 million last year.</p>
          <p>In Pennsylvania, Sands Bethlehem turned in EBITDA of $22.5 million for the quarter, which was a 15% increase over last year's results. Table game drop was up 91%, and slot handle increased 14% versus the same quarter last year. In addition, the hotel generated over $2 million revenue and will continue to grow as the property adds even more amenities, such as the event center, which will host its first show May 15. The retail mall at the property will celebrate its grand opening on February 15 and new meeting rooms at the complex are expected to be completed by March 1.</p>
          <p>So that completes an overview of our operating results for the quarter and year-end 2011. At this time, along with Mike, Rob and Ken, who are all here with me, we would be happy to answer &#x2013; I don't know if we would be so happy, but we will &#x2013; of course we will, we'll be happy. Don't ask any tough questions, just give us soft balls. Operator?</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Mark Strawn with Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions in Singapore, first, given the sequential declines you saw in the 4Q in both mass and VIP, can you comment on the trends you're seeing there overall? And is there a consistent seasonality to that business? And the follow-up to that is what are you doing on a property level basis to drive that business forward in terms of whether it's international marketing or things in the local level on the mass side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mark, I think you know we have obviously a very intense marketing program in Singapore throughout the region with regional offices for the premium direct. We are somewhat restricted by the government in terms of local marketing inside Singapore itself. But to answer your question, we're in this property about 20 months since we opened it, and again, I think the success of it speaks for itself. We far exceeded our own expectations, the billion dollars in full year-one.</p>
          <p>The seasonality issue has yet to be determined. I think it's clear that we're finding our way as we go, and every quarter is a new one. Obviously, the year-on-year comparisons are terrific; the quarter-to-quarter, not as strong. It's a highly concentrated market in terms of the VIP rolling direct. As you're aware, there's not a junket involvement there. So we deal directly with those customers, both from a credit and marketing perspective.</p>
          <p>The team here I think is excellent. Larry Chiu and his guys are out there in the field. We're constantly looking for new customers, and I think we saw in the fourth quarter a lot of people in Asia gambled, perhaps they didn't gamble in Singapore as much as they came to both Macau and Las Vegas, and as you know, we're players in both those markets. And I think the shifting concentration will create volatility, as we've said in the past, as it relates to the rolling segment. We're convinced that segment is far from mature, as Sheldon referenced. If anything, it's still growing and I think will continue to move.</p>
          <p>As far as the mass side of the business, I don't know how we can be more honest than we're just thrilled with the success of that segment. What started as a $1.6 million-a-day combined slot table income on the mass side, we exceeded $4.6 million a day. I think that's &#x2013; it's an astounding tribute to the team there. I think Andrew MacDonald and Eric Pearson and the guys they work with every day in the field did a terrific job, and I think that market &#x2013; we're moving towards $5 million in my opinion. When that happens, I don't know, but I think it's achievable at the $5 million per day. And I think there's a lot of factors that drive that; there is internal and external factors.</p>
          <p>I mean, on the external side, we're really happy to say that the new MRT station opened, the Botanical Gardens opening, the eventual cruise ship terminal, and of course the growing tourism in Singapore bode well for the future of mass gaming in Singapore. But I really think the other success is the guys on the floor, the team there with Andrew and Eric, et cetera, really have done a great job, an exemplary job moving machines around to maximize their value. You're aware of our pressure in terms of weekend capacity issues and we work to avoid that. And I think we've done pretty successfully so far a good job.</p>
          <p>But to Sheldon's point, I'm a firm believer we're going to get to $5 million a day on the mass side. I'm an even stronger believer that although it's concentrated, the premium business, the premium direct will grow. There's billions of Asians, and as their wealth increases and they have an oversized proclivity to gamble, I think we're going to see more and more business there.</p>
          <p>But on a more regional, or more of a bigger picture, Las Vegas Sands, as you know, is the only company that have a presence in Macau, Singapore and Las Vegas. So wherever they gamble, we're capturing more and more of that database and getting more and more of that business. And Las Vegas was the recipient of huge amounts of play in December, which helped Las Vegas. It didn't help Singapore. Our take is that there's good news ahead.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's really helpful. One last follow-up for Ken, perhaps. Can you quantify the impact of the Singapore exchange rate on the quarter's EBITDA results?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we typically don't get into that level of detail. So, I pass on answering that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd like to make an observation. I watch the exchange rate daily, just out of curiosity. And generally, the quarter &#x2013; the fourth quarter exchange rate was relatively stable. It was between 1.20, 1.21 to 1.30 Singapore dollars to the U.S. dollar. It fluctuated. So it's all within the same range. I think it averaged probably in the fourth quarter 1.25, 1.27. It's moving back up a little bit now and I think we're knocking on the door of US$0.80 for Singapore dollar.</p>
          <p>But it doesn't have a significant impact. It does from the beginning of our development of this project when the Singapore dollar was at 1.65 Singapore dollars to the U.S. dollar. That made a big difference over the years. But that only affects our projected income at the time.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. I have a couple of buckets of questions here. First, on Singapore, if you mentioned it, I didn't catch it. But if you adjust for the above average hold in Singapore, what would normalized EBITDA and normalized margins be in the quarter?</p>

          <p>You should note, Joe, that the adjustment for the year, if you look at the entire year of Singapore, it came in I think at 2.85, exactly where it was supposed to be for the year. So in the last quarter, we had a negative adjustment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Number is $380 million.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The rolling moving average was 2.85 for the entire year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So the impact in the fourth quarter from a revenue standpoint was probably between $45 million, $50 million and when you adjust for that plus, if you add back some of the impact of the bad debt reserve, which was higher in the fourth quarter, you get to a margin that's kind of in the middle of the range that we'd talked about before for Singapore, which was, remember we talked about 50% to 55% margin approximately, you end up probably in the middle of that range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other consideration, Joe, obviously there along with the reserve is the mix of business, obviously the mass accelerates, the mass slot is going to help that margin because the mix changes. This time the mix was not as favorable as it'd been in previous quarters. That coupled with the bad debt reserves drove the margin down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then second, on Singapore and just a little bit more about the sequential declines on mass and slots, do you think that implies that you're plateauing or hitting a saturation point in yielding more on the floor? And then with respect to VIP...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then with respect to the VIP segment in Singapore, how do you view seasonality? I know it's hard. We struggle with it on this side of the fence. And we often think 1Q and 3Q should be about 50% of the roll, 40% in 2Q and 4Q. If you can share any kind of data points maybe with January to date, volumes or roll and maybe that kind of helps to understand it as well. And then I'll wait for those answers and ask one additional question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I just &#x2013; Joe, it's Mike. I just &#x2013; the reason you can't look sequentially is exactly what you said about January. January is a Chinese New Year month. Last year, it wasn't a Chinese New Year month. So, therefore, if you compare January to December, you're going to have very significant differences in the sequential roll that goes on in January to the quarter.</p>
          <p>So I think you got to look quarter by &#x2013; you got to look year-over-year to see whether in fact you're gaining, you're continuing to gain in both the mass floor and the roll. When it comes to the roll also, it can be three or four players in the course of a quarter that can make a very significant difference if they show up two weeks after the quarter or in the previous quarter. So you're going to get potential variances because of the nature of that business.</p>
          <p>But I think if you compare quarter-to-quarter, year-over-year, you've got the best way of looking at seasonality. Plus we need still at least another year of Singapore's operation to get to a relative maturity in terms of looking at the historical consequences of each month &#x2013; so December versus December, et cetera and so forth. And that will give you a lot more help, as we get a little older in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Sheldon. Last night we had dinner with some important people from Singapore. And the discussion was what percentage of the people are foreigners. Our number continues to grow every day of visitation and the foreigner percentage has increased to about 80%, which is very good because the foreigners come in with more money than the local Singaporeans.</p>
          <p>We haven't done a study of that, but it's common sense that somebody that comes in from a foreign territory will carry more money with them to play because they're here less frequently or they're there less frequently. One issue is that we are running at such a tremendous occupancy rate, in the high 90%s in the hotel, we are talking to the government about possibly getting some more land to build more hotel rooms because we turn away a lot of reservations. We're trying to fine tune the segments of the hotel occupancy so we can maximize the return. But I don't think we mentioned the ADR &#x2013; did I mention ADR? I don't think so. Well, it's very high and in the mid 3s. So that just tells us if we put another 1,000 or 1,500 rooms in, it will significantly increase the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one final question on Venetian Macao margins were 37.1%, much higher than we were expecting. Even with a greater VIP revenue skew than we were forecasting, was there anything within the VIP segment with either direct or junket in terms of adverse or favorable hold that skewed the overall margins? I guess I'm trying to get to the sustainability of a 37% margin going forward from here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joe, while we're flipping the pages find exact hold percentages, I just want to say to you that we haven't seen yet a real move in the junket side there that we're growing, but we have to &#x2013; the concentration has been on the Four Seasons. I think it's negligible in terms of the hold percentage. You guys have a hard number for the hold percentage?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So my question is did you hold lucky on the direct side, that goosed up the margin?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What you're seeing, Joe, is we're getting better &#x2013; there's four wonderful segments to make money in Macau. We're doing better in the junket segment. We got a lot of room to move there. The direct premium, we're getting much better at, but let's be honest, our strength and niche has always been and hopefully will continue to be mass tables, slot ETG segment and that segment gets better by the day. We want to dominate that segment and grow in that segment, which is obviously very margin intense, but also improve our VIP position which hasn't really happened yet that much for Venetian. So I don't think it's out of the ordinary to see what you saw this quarter. And it is sustainable, yes.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, guys. First of all, in Singapore, just to follow up on the bad debt comment, could you just give us two quick numbers, the bad debt reserve that was taken or maybe the percentage as it's compared to the prior quarters as well as the receivable balance in Singapore at the end of the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. The receivable balance at the end of the quarter was about $650 million. And, against that we had a reserve of about 18%. Now, to answer your question with regard to the expense taken during the quarter, remember on one of the previous calls we talked about percentage of rolling win as an approximate reserve that we would be taking and we talked about a 3% to 7% range.</p>
          <p>This quarter we were higher than that; we were at about  &#x2013; a little bit over 10%. If you look at it on the annual basis for the year, for the entire year, we were about 6% &#x2013; a little bit north of 6%. And so, on an annual basis, we were right in the middle of the range, if you will. And, from quarter to quarter, it's going to vary some; sometimes it'll be a little bit above that, sometimes it'll be a little bit below that. But, we ended the year really within the range that we expected to be at and feel that we're prudently reserved at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. That's helpful color. And then second question might be just a little bit broader outlook. But there's been a lot of discussion and questions around &#x2013; because of Chinese New Year shifting this year, how to think about the outlook of, I think, both Macau and Singapore for the first quarter and really throughout the balance of the year in terms of what's the right growth rate to think about.</p>
          <p>So, just directionally more than exact numbers, although we'll take the exact numbers if you'll give them to us, how are you guys thinking about the health of the consumer over there? And just what are you seeing on the ground as far as traffic levels and uptake at the property? I think we heard about some solid visitation statistics out of Sands China but just wanted to get your broader thoughts on the macro.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Shaun, let me talk about it. I think that in spite of the fact that a lot of the press is talking about slowdowns in China and all of these kinds of situation, we are essentially seeing nothing that would indicate that Macau and Singapore will not continue on their present paths upward. And our planning is on that basis, with our staffing and all of our marketing models, to go against those kinds of growth numbers. There's nothing that we have seen over the last number of months or see today that indicates that there isn't a positive outlook for all of our properties at this point.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. And, I guess, last question would be there was a lot of discussion, obviously, around the return of capital to shareholders on the dividend front. Could you maybe just give us a sense and specifically I'd love Sheldon's thoughts on how you guys balance the idea of a dividend versus a buyback and how you think about that going forward? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll try not to breathe heavily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is a board decision. I try to stay out of it because of my substantial interest in the company. And I don't want to create any appearance of conflict. But the &#x2013; we don't see that our stock &#x2013; we see tremendous upside for our shares, and we don't &#x2013; the share price is &#x2013; we think &#x2013; I believe the board has thought that we would be better off in the best interest of shareholders to distribute the dividend as opposed to buying back shares. This dividend will cost us, on a fully diluted basis, about $800-plus million a year. And we can't get &#x2013; we can't have a tremendous buyback impact for $800 million a year.</p>
          <p>It doesn't help us in appealing to those investors that are mandated by their regulations or the composition of their funds to only invest in companies that pay dividend. We thought that would be the first thing to do. But I think about &#x2013; in order to make any kind of impact on stock buyback, it would take many billions of dollars and I think that money is better put to use by &#x2013; for expansion &#x2013; holding enough money for expansion because it probably is not going to be too long as each month goes by that we end up with one of those Asian countries or more than one location.</p>
          <p>We're shooting for two locations in each of those countries, the top two cities essentially. But who knows what we'll get. Everybody believes that we're the leading candidates because of our fundamental business model and our fundamental marketing strategy that's convention-based. And the whole world knows about that and the whole world knows that we are the originators of the Integrated Resort model, notwithstanding what some of our competitors say about themselves. You can't compare a competitor with 17 meeting rooms and no exhibition space, to us with between 300 and 350 meeting rooms per property and an exhibition space plus huge ballroom space for exhibitions.</p>
          <p>So we're just in a different class than the rest of the market, but we want to make sure that we have enough money. Buying back stock will take many billions of dollars to have a substantive impact. But for dividends, it still takes a few bucks. But again, a billion here, a billion there, we all know the rest. But that's good. It's good. It makes more people happy, it thanks the shareholders for their level of confidence in us, and we become more attractive to those who have a mandate to invest only in dividend-paying stocks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm now unmuted. While we're on that topic of your balance sheet, I have a few questions there, and then I have some operations questions. Obviously, dividend is a nice positive, and if you look at the current yield relative to the gaming, lodging and leisure area, our area, it's a nice yield. But as you generate more cash flow, I'm just wonder &#x2013; you should be able to increase that yield. So, I'm wondering &#x2013; or the dividend rather &#x2013;  I'm wondering if you've discussed an optimal level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Have we discussed an optimum level of dividend pay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Like of your &#x2013; of a payout ratio basically.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How high is the sky?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's actually my question. Do you guys have a limit or as you grow your cash flow and your &#x2013; do you have a limit in mind or is this something that can just grow with your cash flow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you've said it, Felicia. Basically, as the cash flow increases, we have to balance the needs to pay out dividends with the needs for development. As we felt that this was a very adequate stock for paying the dividend, that it would satisfy our shareholders, and as we go forward in the year, we'd like to be able to increase dividends as we go but it has to be balanced with our need to develop because the earnings will grow substantially if we add more development as well.</p>
          <p>So, it's going to be a decision the board will make on an annual basis based on performance and what the opportunities for using cash. I think we're in a great position. Most companies aren't there, particularly in our sector, and we'll have the opportunity hopefully to both raise dividends and do the kind of developments while we continue to increase the earnings per share of the company.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And, then....</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nobody ever accused me of being a shrinking violet. I've been accused of a lot of other things. But this company is a growth company. And Mike and I are fully focused on growth opportunities. I, too, in 2010 or 2011, I forget, my chief pilot told me that I flew almost 700 hours. And I didn't fly that to go back and forth to Hawaii and sit on the beach. I went all around the world talking to heads of state and whoever I could talk to about putting up Integrated Resorts in their country and what we've done for other places, what we did in Vegas, Macau and Singapore, and even Bethlehem and what we think we can do for their country.</p>
          <p>So this is &#x2013; we are in a class by ourselves, and I don't think when you guys compare our EBITDA multiple or EPS multiple to the others, I mean take a look at this. Nobody in the history of this industry has ever reached $3 billion, never mind with only a first 12-month period in 2011 that we reached $1.5-something billion in Singapore. Nobody ever estimated that the first year would ever be anything like that.</p>
          <p>How many years did it take before the first company with X amount of properties emanating out of Vegas or any other company made even the first billion? So with decades of industry existence, we are in a class by itself now. We have to be the sharp point at the edge of the spear and the arrow to lead the way into growth opportunities and to, frankly I think, be priced at a much higher level than the other guys, because our growth opportunities and our profitability in terms of EBITDA margin, thanks to our Integrated Resort model, is unprecedented.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Sheldon. You also &#x2013; you spent a lot of time on the call talking about the success of the Grand Canal Shoppes at The Venetian Macao. I was wondering &#x2013; I wouldn't think that it would be something that you'd want to sell today, given the good statistics, given that Sands Cotai Central hasn't opened yet, but can you give us a sense of timing there for a potential sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no, no, because it's very tempting not to sell it now, because when you're talking about 30%, 40%, 50% and more growth year-to-year in retail, that and more and more of the almost 300 tenants in the Grand Canal Shoppes passed their basic rent and they're into 12.5% to 18% of revenue rents. So we've got basic rent plus percentage of revenue rents.</p>
          <p>The temptation is not to sell. But we're going to look at what the best value is for shareholders. If we're going to sell it, I don't think we'd reach maturity. Some could estimate we'll do it in two years. Then you'll find two years it just grew 50% from the year before. And you say, well, is this the right year. And the answer is no.</p>
          <p>So I don't know. If ever we start to level off and we become a value investment instead of a growth investment or less growth but more value, or more growth and less value, we got to give the buyer some opportunity for growth. But the point is, this is like a secret bank account, a secret savings account, that we've saved up all this money and if we chose to tap that account, we'd be debt-free.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is a very, very significant and valuable savings account. The amount of cash &#x2013; I just saw an analyst report this morning said that next year we'll have free cash flow of in excess of $3 billion. Think about the 75 or 80-year history of Las Vegas, that nobody has ever even approached that amount of money. So, again, I think we deserve a significantly higher multiple because we have both growth and we have the solidity of reliability and predictability of earnings.</p>

          <p>Thanks. And Rob and Mike, obviously the investment you've made in Macau is paying dividends; the numbers were spectacular. Just wanted to make sure I'm not reading too much into something you put in the release, because it did say that in Macau you'll continue investing in the VIP arena through 2012. And as you've talked about it before, you said that the program would be complete by the end of the second quarter. So are we looking at kind of the start of a Phase II? And if we are, can you give us some details on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not a timing issue. It's more an issue of as we see &#x2013; look, we're going to control 1,500 tables and 6,000 slot-ETG positions at the end of this year. The issue for us is how to maximize the growth and the opportunity to drive EBITDA regardless of segment. So if we can convert tables from mass, we have seen the junkets over-perform, we'll move in that direction. It's a never-ending process. We had a conference call this morning with David, talked about this very issue &#x2013; David Sisk, who has just done a really good job in this area.</p>
          <p>And I think the question &#x2013; and we have a very unique advantage there. We've got all this space on Cotai, which is where the junkets want to be. We're going to have 9,300 sleeping rooms in Macau once we complete at the end of this year, which gives a huge advantage on mass gaming side, because the number one driver of mass gaming performance is sleeping rooms.</p>
          <p>So we have all these advantages. And the problem we have is trying to manage where we can get the highest yield, be it junket, VIP direct, mass gaming, slot-ETG. And our goal is all of our managers over there are thinking about what is the highest and best use of the real estate, how to drive EBITDA.</p>
          <p>So I guess when we started this junket thing, we saw upside. But we see a much larger upside than we first anticipated, but we also see, I think, incredible growth in all the segments. So our goal as managers is to maximize that huge advantage we have with sleeping rooms, VIP, the Cotai performance. And no matter where it comes from, this will be a never-ending process. It won't end in February of this year or the year after; it's a never-ending process. And that's our goal, is to drive our performance, mass and VIP, at the highest levels in Macau.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jon Oh with CLSA.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I have a few questions. I'll start off with just on the point that Rob brought up about The Venetian margins at 37% and you said that you think that's sustainable. To the point that where do you see the most incremental uplift coming from The Venetian going forward? Is it the Rolling Chip business or is it still the mass or the premium mass market that will surprise us the most in the future? And how does that then play with this whole margin which right now is peaking at the 37% level going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to let Rob answer that question after I say something that hasn't been discussed. We have applied to the government and submitted drawings for about a 4,000-room Lot 3 development. Now, everybody &#x2013; the analyst community are giving points and value to MGM, to SJM, to Wynn because they are in line to get lots. And they don't have the lots yet. We own this lot, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
          <p>We paid for it years ago and now we think that in consultation with the government as to what they want, we're going to make a mass market plus a separate tower for VIP play on Lot 3. And so far we're getting positive reaction on &#x2013; it'll be a thematic property. And we lead the pack because we already own and paid for this lot. So we have the right to put the building up as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>The second item is that we have probably doubled the 38 VIP rooms with about 100 and some odd, in the low hundreds, tables. We've doubled that because of the VIP demand at Cotai Central. I think the industry underappreciates the growth potential of Cotai Central because it's probably taken so long, people forgot what it was supposed to be all about. I walked through it a week or two ago and it is magnificent, magnificent.</p>
          <p>We've taken some unusual steps to make it look &#x2013; there's a mountain-style casino and a mountain theme, and there is a Polynesian, or Pacifica theme. They are absolutely gorgeous, particularly the ceiling is a new step in the typical coffer and soffit. We've gotten away from that and we've created a new step. It'll be one of the most visible casinos in the world. That's on the mass side. And we put the VIP, there wasn't enough room to expand in the first level, so we put in the third level and we had a lot more space than we thought. So fortunately, we have the room to expand there. So, Rob, do you want to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Jon, first of all, somebody said something about raining cash in Macau and that's how we see The Venetian, it's raining cash. Smart guy wrote that once. And I think it's appropriate we look at our property. Look, The Venetian has a couple of exceptional advantages, right? It's themed, which I think is appropriate to the Macau market. It's got a lot of sleeping rooms, which is incredibly important for the mass. It's probably the most attractive retail for everybody to come to in terms of the mass, which drives &#x2013; which ties back and helps the gaming floor.</p>
          <p>I think Eric and the team over there and Tim have done an extraordinary job with the slot ETG. You read about our recent move on the slot side. I think that's just bodes real well but to be honest with you, I don't know where to concentrate. David believes the junkets have extraordinary upside in The Venetian. We believe so, as we fix this space and make it more appealing and get the right people in that segment working for us. But we underperformed the junket segment dramatically prior 2010. We're now going to overperform in that segment, I believe, but I wouldn't ignore the slot ETG market. It's been incredibly important to us.</p>
          <p>We're hitting numbers we never thought we'd see. When Sheldon first initiated slots in Macau people kind of chuckled and now we see it growing, we're exceeding monthly what the entire win in Macau was in 2003. So, and then lastly, our strength always will be mass tables because we've got tables and we've got lots of them, we've got lots of sleeping room. So I don't know how to identify what the most advantageous segment is to grow Venetian Macao, but I promise you that it's going to grow and grow. And I think we're very focused on the huge advantage we have in Cotai, especially as the mass market gravitates towards Cotai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And the other question I have is on Singapore. When I look at the revenues and I compare that against the previous quarter, it seems to be quite flat. I mean, it grew by a little bit. But when I look at EBITDA, it was probably about roughly 3% on an adjusted level. Could you maybe just give us some color, how much of that strength of the EBITDA could potentially be coming from the non-gaming segment, how profitable are your rooms and F&amp;B and retail, I mean retail I know Sheldon gave us some color but maybe on the rooms and F&amp;B, you know, how should we think about margins in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Jon, any business would like to have those margins. Our margins in rooms run about 83%, our margins in food and beverage close to 30%. The volumes continue to increase and our banquet margins are terrific. We have some pricing opportunities left there, of course. And we are managing our rooms in a way to maximize our room rates all the time.</p>
          <p>So I mean Singapore is an amazing place. I've never seen a property in all my years ramp to the level of this property in every area. So &#x2013; and you got the high &#x2013; you've got an 83% margin in retail as well. So all these non-gaming areas represent significant margin, and they will continue to operate at that level.</p>
          <p>Our costs continue to escalate in our buildings in Macau and Singapore because they are inflating in both places. So we have pricing power in our facilities to be able to maintain those margins as we go forward, even with the increased costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Great. And just one final question on this raining cash theme on your dividends, which I like very much. Could you give us some color on the Sands China dividend &#x2013; I know that your LVS dividend you're guiding for one quarter for every quarter &#x2013; how should we think about Sands China's dividend, the HK$0.58 that you declared? I mean, is that a biannual number, is it an annual number, or should we think of it as a recurrent or special? How should we go about forecasting that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The anticipation is that the Sands China Board will approve in June the same dividend as was given out in the first quarter. Legally, the shareholders have to approve at the June meeting. The anticipation is that it will be an annual dividend given in two slots &#x2013; one in February, and one in, I think, July.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>One newspaper said we were adherent to feng shui practice. So five, the number five, is a very good number in the year of the dragon. And eight is a perpetual good number. So that's always a good number. So, five-eight [HK$0.58], sounds good, let's do it. It was intended to be semi-annual regular dividend.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Thank you. I don't want to beat the dead horse and I know this has been talked about a lot, but I've always heard the concept and it makes empirical sense that when hold is high, Rolling Chip tends to be depressed. And I'm wondering if you guys could maybe clarify if that was an issue at Marina Bay Sands? And then I just had one follow-up about sites five and six.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't believe that's the case &#x2013; it's nice, it's a convenient excuse, but I don't think that's the case. I think it's simply a case of where the players went to, and we experienced a great year on year growth, Carlo, as you saw. We didn't experience &#x2013; the third quarter has had more players bet more money, drive more roll and I think that's a weak excuse to use and I wouldn't go there. I think you have to accept the numbers for what they are.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And then with respect to five and six, could you guys maybe talk about what's left under the table cap and how you plan to utilize that and from my understanding, a lot of that will come from the Sands. Have you guys put any more thought into how that table ramp will play out here over &#x2013; as you open the property in stages?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you saying five and six as you move tables around?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, what we're doing daily &#x2013; and I mean David and the guys over there are looking at each of the different places and it's a complicated equation. We'll move tables based on where we think demand is. Not just between the properties, but also between mass and VIP. So it's a never-ending &#x2013; it won't ever end. If we see stronger performance out of &#x2013; we can move tables out of the Sands if we find it's weaker vis-&#xE0;-vis the Cotai Strip. And I think that's going to be the goal, is to keep moving tables.</p>
          <p>And then we're seeing &#x2013; what surprised us is the amount of junket demand we have for Cotai Central and we'll address that as time gets nearer. But as long as we're inside the table cap and the government's aware of our moves, I think we'll move to the market, so to speak. Our performance in the Four Seasons has been very gratifying. And as we move to The Venetian Sands in 5 and 6, we'll continue to strive &#x2013; the goal is to get the best operators with the most tables and drive the highest win per unit per day and wherever that falls, that's what the tables do.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>By the way, if and when we do lot 3 that will be an additional, an additional tables. It's not going to be moving around the tables that we have. The tables that we have will be spread around most effectively between The Sands Macao, Venetian Macao, Plaza Casino at the Four Seasons and Cotai Central.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And we have time for one last question. Your final question comes from the line of Harry Curtis with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good afternoon. Let's go back to Macau for a quick sec. I've got a couple of questions there. The first question is, if your sense working with the junkets is whether or not they are having any collection issues. That's been out there. And I'd like to put that to rest if it's correct? The second question that I had was on the outperformance of your slot business. It's really been terrific over the past three to six months. And I'm wondering if that's more a function of marketing, is it more a function of a change in equipment or a combination of the two?</p>
          <p>And then the last question that I had is related to Sands Cotai and your expectation for how the pieces of the business are going to perform when you open. In other words, which pieces of the business might come out of the gate faster and which would you expect to have a slower ramp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take the first one, the junkets we're seeing no issues on the collections side. It's been addressed previously. We remain steadfast in our belief that we've got the best people in the industry working with us, and we're very comfortable with the exposure there.</p>
          <p>Same thing on our direct business. We have no issues that we're concerned about whatsoever. We review it monthly. On the stock performance, we appreciate recognizing what this team has accomplished. I think we &#x2013; again, not to be redundant, but to be complimentary to an extraordinary team of people we have assembled on the slot side, and people are going to &#x2013; you're going to see it continue.</p>
          <p>I predict that we're going to outperform the market on the slot ETG. We get &#x2013; the equipment's absolutely an issue, the marketing is an issue, but the real driver is people walking that floor and constantly looking. As I go back quite a bit and I was there a few weeks ago, and the floor moves consistently with the market. And we also have one incredible advantage, and that is the combination of the non-gaming amenities.</p>
          <p>We have many, many rooms. The number one driver of gaming performance is where people sleep. We have more sleeping rooms than anybody in the market, by far. As a result, we have a huge built-in advantage at The Venetian and soon to be at Cotai Central, coupled with great equipment, coupled with the best retail malls that drive more traffic.</p>
          <p>So I would be surprised if what you're seeing in the slot performance doesn't continue to grow and grow, a lot of confidence in that segment, and a lot of pride in what we've accomplished there. I think Eric and his team's performance there is exemplary, and I appreciate recognizing it. Cotai, I'll let Mike speak to Cotai, because we're very excited about it on all segments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we mentioned it last time or we mentioned it somewhere, that all of our VIP rooms are sold out on Cotai Central, so they will start very quickly as we get to grand opening. They'll probably be in there the first day. So I expect that will ramp up very quickly. And the early going, we'll get a lot of trial in the main casino on mass market, but I think VIP will start faster. These hotels are branded as you know, Conrad and Holiday Inn, as well as Sheraton coming in afterwards.</p>
          <p>We were already getting some significant inquiries through their systems on the reservation side. There's been a lot of press lately that there weren't enough rooms at the right price for many Chinese tourists. We were able to price more effectively to get that business, but I think I would look for VIP to start faster than mass, but then mass will catch up over time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to tell you that &#x2013; picking up on Mike's comments that what's been really nice for us is to watch the demand on Cotai, by the junkets for the segment. And I think Cotai Central has that unique combination of many, many rooms, wonderful retail, a sister hotel for The Venetian and Four Seasons, and lots of gaming space, ETG slots, almost 2,600 games and growing. So I think it's &#x2013; I can't tell you which performs faster, but I can tell you at the end all segments are going to perform at those buildings over the next 10, 12 months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just as a follow-up, how has the slot floor changed physically over the past six months? And then following up on the last comment, your pipeline of MICE business, is that still &#x2013; is that still in the, like the third inning, or thereabout on Cotai?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say probably in the fourth inning now, Harry. It is moving. We had an increase this year, significantly better than last year, in business that was in the properties. And I think you'll see it. It's a gradual growth, but it's going to continue to grow. Macau itself, the country, is very active in building their MICE business. In Singapore, of course, as we mentioned, we're pretty much sold out in 2012 in the ballroom, the grand ballroom and other space. But in Macau, it's a little bit slow, but we're moving up inning by inning. It's not a quantum, not a quantum leap there. We have to grow and we continue to grow, but it's better every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slot floor, Harry, continues to move. It's radical and consistent changes literally weekly. Our latest move you saw with IGT. I just think our guys are looking at the best equipment and it moves all the time. We've changed configurations. We've changed everything about that slot floor. Every time I go there there's radical changes and I think that result the kind of numbers you're seeing, couple with the non-gaming amenities of rooms and shopping.</p>
          <p>And I think that advantage is a big LVS advantage, not just for that property, but all the properties in Cotai. So it's a radical change. It's a consistent change. It's a very, very good change. It produces very strong profitability in that segment and, again, that segment is one to watch at this company in Macau in general.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>No further questions. Thank you very much for your help. I just want to reiterate that I &#x2013; it's very gratifying to me as the CEO and Chairman of the company to have entered into a new category of entertainment, lodging, hospitality, resort development and gaming to a level that if you took the top four hotel companies that have a different business model of not making investments but just getting fee income, we're &#x2013; that our EBITDA has equaled the top four with almost 10,000 hotels, the top four hotels. And we've equaled or exceeded Carnival Cruise Lines, which is the most profitable cruise line company in the world.</p>
          <p>So we're now in a totally a different category, that was before the Costa Concordia, right. Speaking of which, I hope it comes out well for them. Actually, a company I was involved with sold the first two ships to the Arison family &#x2013; to Ted Arison because he worked for us in running the two ships in a company back in the 1960s and 1970s. And he took the one ship called the Carnival, named the company Carnival Cruise Lines, and became the biggest operator in the world.</p>
          <p>So anyway, we're in a totally different category, and it's very gratifying to me to have been involved with the company. And I want to thank not only the senior management. I want to thank all the management and all the team members of the company. And we certainly have a lot to look forward to, particularly and nobody has thought about or mentioned Lot 3 in a long, long time. So we've applied for that and everybody else is getting credit for saying, well, we are going to get something with Cotai. I remember the days when I wanted other people could join me in developing Cotai when it was a swamp in a bay and other people said, they didn't think it was right; it would never work.</p>
