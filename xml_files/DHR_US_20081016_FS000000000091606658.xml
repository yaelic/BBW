        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Audrey. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>I'd like to point out that our earnings release, Form 10-Q, a slide presentation supplementing today's call and the reconciling other information required by the SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available on investor section of our website which is up and running, www.danaher.com under the heading Earnings and will be available following the call &#x2013; will remain available following the call.</p>
          <p>In addition, the audio portion of this call will be archived on the investor section of our website later today under the heading Web Events and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of this call will also be available until October 22. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the U.S. and 719-457-0820 internationally and the confirmation code is 2942719. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for any late arrivals.</p>
          <p>During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impact the year-over-year performance. Please refer to the accompanying slide presentation and other related presentation materials supplementing today's call as well as the MD&amp;A section of our third quarter Form 10-Q for details regarding additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance.</p>
          <p>Also, all references in this presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher's business unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in our earnings are certain non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition for fair value adjustments to recorded inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced total net earnings by approximately 10 million or $0.03 per diluted share in the third quarter and approximately 39 million or $0.12 per diluted share year-to-date.</p>
          <p>These charges are included in our reported results for the third quarter and year-to-date 2008, but are excluded from the adjusted earnings per share guidance that we will provide at the end of the prepared remarks. The amount of these non-cash charges related to Tektronix acquisition is expected to reduce earnings by approximately $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter and approximately $0.13 per share for the full-year 2008. Throughout the call, all references to non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix relate to these items.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to note that we'll be making some forward-looking statements during the call, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. It's possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn the call over to Larry.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Andy, thank you. Good morning everyone. Today we reported third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $1.11 representing an 8% increase over last year. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $1.14, a 13% increase over last year. Revenues for the quarter increased 17.5% to $3.2 billion, with core revenues up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 11% and we had a positive currency effect of 2.5%. Continued strength in our Water Quality and Med Tech businesses and improved performances at Motion and Gilbarco Veeder-Root was partially offset by continued soft demand at Fluke Networks and at Accu-Sort. Year-to-date revenues were up 20.5% to $9.5 billion as core revenues grew 4%.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year gross margins for the third quarter improved approximately 140 basis points to 47.1% primarily due to the impact of higher gross margins in the newly acquired businesses, leverage from higher sales volumes as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives. In addition, higher commodity costs incurred in the quarter were mitigated somewhat by price increases. SG&amp;A expenses were 25.1% of sales compared to 24% a year ago due primarily to higher SG&amp;A levels in our newer businesses and incremental investments in emerging market sales resources.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D spending as a percentage of sales for the quarter was 5.7% as compared to 4.8% a year ago. This increase was largely due to the impact of Tektronix as well as investments in our Med Tech businesses. Operating profit for the quarter was $522 million representing a 13% increase over last year. Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter increased 15.5% compared to last year. Year-to-date operating profit was $1.4 billion, a 13.5% increase over last year and year-to-date adjusted operating profit increased 18.5% compared to same period a year ago.</p>
          <p>Our operating margin in the third quarter was 16.3%, a 70 basis point decrease from last year. The impact of newer businesses including the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix negatively impacted margins by approximately 65 basis points.</p>
          <p>Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter was essentially flat compared to the adjusted operating margin last year as fall through from core revenues was offset by investments in R&amp;D and sales force initiatives, continued restructuring and hopefully, a high water mark for commodity prices. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 24.5% as compared to 23.6% in the prior year period. Our overall tax rate was slightly less than we experienced in the first half of 2008, as a result of the mix of the domestic and international earnings.</p>
          <p>We expect our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to be approximately 24%, which will include the benefit of the research and experimentation credit, which was recently extended as a result of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Net earnings were $372 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Year-to-date, net earnings were $1 billion, an increase of 13%. Adjusting net earnings for the third quarter and first nine months improved 16.5% and 18.5% respectively, compared to the prior year.</p>
          <p>Our operating cash flow for the first nine months was $1.3 billion, 19.5% higher than the prior year. Year-to-date free cash flow was $1.2 billion, representing a 20% increase. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 108% for the third quarter and stands at 122% for the first nine months. We're optimistic about our ability to deliver free cash flow in excess of net income for what would be our 17th year in a row.</p>
          <p>Our ability to generate free cash flow during these challenging economic times has allowed us to continue to strengthen both our balance sheet and our portfolio by way of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter we made four acquisitions, comprising about $150 million of revenue, making key additions to our environmental, test and measurements and dental platforms. We believe the acquisition environment continues to become more attractive and that we're well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities. We believe we are in terrific financial shape; since the beginning of the year we've reduced our outstanding debt by approximately $1 billion and our debt to total capital ratio at the end of the quarter was 21%. In addition, we had over $285 million in cash and cash equivalents at quarter's end.</p>
          <p>Now turning to some of the highlights from the operating segments. Professional Instrumentation revenues were 38% for the quarter, and 48% year-to-date, with core revenues up 4.5% for both periods. Our operating margin for the third quarter was 20.1% as compared to 22.7% last year, as the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and the non-cash acquisition related charges for Tektronix essentially accounted for the difference. Year-to-date operating margins decreased 290 basis points to 19% when compared to last year due principally to the same factors.</p>
          <p>Environmental revenues grew 9.5% with core revenue up 6% in the quarter. Year-to-date sales increased 18.5% with core revenues contributing 6.5%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate in the third quarter as our Hach Lange business continue to see solid demand in both their process and laboratory product lines including healthy growth in consumables and service revenues. Geographically, a strong performance in Europe and continued double-digit growth in China drove this performance. ChemTreat achieved low double-digit revenue growth in the quarter representing their best quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of R-Can Environmental, a manufacturer of UV or ultraviolet treatment solutions, which will complement Trojan's existing low-flow product offerings.</p>
          <p>At Gilbarco Veeder-Root core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter as increased sales of payment and point-of-sale systems was partially offset by soft dispenser sales. Veeder-Root is awaiting final California Air Resources Board, or CARB, approval, for its enhanced vapor recovery solution, which helps retailers reduce hydrocarbon emissions and comply with state regulations. We anticipate receiving this approval in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Autotank Group based in Finland, which we highlighted during our last call.</p>
          <p>Moving to Test and Measurement, revenues grew 94% in the quarter and approximately 100% year-to-date with core revenues up 1.5% in each period. At Fluke, core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate for the quarter, led by strong emerging market growth and continued demand for our lower price point thermography products. Our green initiatives aimed at increasing energy efficiency helped drive low double-digit growth for our indoor air quality and digital multi-meter products this quarter. Additionally, Fluke was awarded more than $20 million of government contracts in the quarter.</p>
          <p>During the third quarter, we also completed the acquisition of Janos Technology, which adds optical component design and manufacturing capability to Fluke's high growth thermography business. Fluke Network sales were down double-digit during the quarter resulting from continued soft sales to telecom carriers as well as the effect of slower IT spending, which has impacted our higher-end enterprise performance management products. As we indicated on our last call, we expect AFNET results to remain challenging for the balance of this year.</p>
          <p>At Tektronix revenues were down at a low single digit rate in the quarter as double-digit core revenue growth at Tek Communications was offset by weaker demand in our instruments business. Recent product launches in our oscilloscope product line drove low double-digit growth in the distributor segment of that business. Our Network Management business grew more than 20% in the quarter due in part to a multimillion-dollar contract win. Telstra, Australia's leading telecom and information services company will deploy Tek's market leading Unified Assurance network management suite, which will provide end-end monitoring solutions throughout Telstra's high speed wireless broadband network.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with Tek's performance, particularly regarding their high teens operating margin in the quarter, which excludes the non-cash acquisition-related charges. It is a testament to the hard work of the Tek team and the impact to DBS. It has been a very good first year together with Tektronix.</p>
          <p>Over at Med Tech, revenues for the quarter increased 12.5% compared to 2007 and core revenues were up 5.5%. Year-to-date revenues increased 14%, with core revenues growing 6%. Med Tech operating margin for the third quarter was 12.3% compared to 13% a year ago due to increased spending on growth initiatives, which has driven above-market growth at both Leica and Radiometer, higher cost at our cable operations and the impact of the lower operating margins from some recent acquisitions. Year-to-date, operating margins also declined 70 basis points to 11.5% compared to the prior year, a result of these same factors.</p>
          <p>Core revenues in our dental business grew at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. Sybron was up at a mid single digit rate, led by demand for general dentistry consumables and strength in both our SybronEndo endodontic and our Total Care infection prevention product lines. SybronEndo was up at a mid -- at a high single digit rate in the quarter due to strong sales of their new twisted file product line as well as the launch of RS-1, a resin-based bond used to protect the root canal wall and prevent infection after an endodontic or a root canal treatment. Also during the quarter we acquired Pentron Corporation, which provides complimentary consumable products for endodontic and other restorative applications at Sybron.</p>
          <p>KaVo grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter as continued strong demand for our imaging products was partially offset by a general slowing of instrument and treatment unit sales. At Radiometer, core revenues grew at a mid single digit rate for the quarter, driven primarily by strong consumable sales across all major geographies. Instrument places grew at a mid single digit rate with particular strength in portable applications due in part to the launch of the ABL80 analyzer.</p>
          <p>Leica core revenues grew at a high single digit rate in the quarter driven by compound microscopy demand as well as more than 20% growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostics business. We experienced growth across all major geographies with solid demand in both Asia and Europe. During the quarter, we launched the new DCM 3D confocal microscope, which provides fast and accurate surface assessment required for metrology applications. Customer demand here at launch has been very positive.</p>
          <p>Moving to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 6% for the quarter with core revenues up 3.5%. Year-to-date revenues increased 6% with core revenues contributing 2%. The operating margin for the third quarter was 18.2%, a 120 basis point increase compared to the same period last year, a result of restructuring efforts undertaken earlier this year. Year-to-date operating margins decreased 40 basis points to 16.7% due primarily to a prior year gain on indemnity proceeds from a litigation matter and the sale of real estate, which benefited 2007 margins by approximately 60 basis points.</p>
          <p>Product ID core revenues were down 3% in the quarter. Our traditional marking and coding business grew at a low single digit rate in the quarter, led by strength in consumables. Offsetting this performance was a continuation of large parcel project delays and a reduction in traditional USPS projects at Accu-Sort. Year-to-date product ID sales increased 3% with core revenues down 1.5%, due again to the softness at Accu-Sort.</p>
          <p>Over in Motion revenues were up 8% in the quarter with core revenues contributing 5% growth. Growth in our aerospace and defense, elevator, flat panel display and medical vertical markets were the key drivers to this performance. Partially offsetting this growth was continued soft demand in the US and Europe for standard motor and drive products. Year-to-date, sales are up 6.5% with core revenues contributing 1%.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, Kollmorgen announced an agreement with Volvo to produce electrical motors and drives for Volvo's fleet of heavy-duty hybrid vehicles. These hybrid applications represent a multimillion dollar strategic opportunity for the Kollmorgen team.</p>
          <p>Finally moving over to Tools and Components, revenues for the quarter and year-to-date are up 1% with core revenues contributing about half a point in each period &#x2013; half a percentage point in each period. Operating margin for the quarter was 14%, a decline of approximately 190 basis points from the prior year largely due to increased commodity costs principally steel and the impact of lower production levels offset somewhat by price increases. Year-to-date operating margins decreased 60 basis points to 13% due principally to these same factors.</p>
          <p>Mechanic's Hand Tools revenues increased 1% in the quarter, primary due to the initial stocking order of our GearWrench brand of tools and advanced auto parts, which we referenced during our last call. Year-to-date Mechanic's Hand Tools core revenues declined 2.5%.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up our prepared remarks, we are quite pleased with our growth, earnings, cash flow performance and the strength of our balance sheet. We have continued our restructuring investments that we began late last year and believe these actions have helped our businesses deliver these good results. Given the events of the last month, more challenges are clearly on the horizon. We are keenly aware of the impact the constrained credit markets and the effect the constrained credit markets are having and will likely continue to have on the global economy. Accordingly we believe it is prudent to accelerate the pace of our restructuring activities.</p>
          <p>As a result we are currently estimating an additional investment of approximately $75 million or $0.17 per diluted share in the fourth quarter to fund additional cost reduction and restructuring activities. These activities will likely result in the reduction of over 1000 positions and the closure of a dozen facilities. We believe these actions, which will affect a number of our businesses, will better position us in 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p>With that as a backdrop, we expect adjusted earnings in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.17 to $1.25, excluding the non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition and before the restructuring charges.  We expect our full-year 2008 adjusted earnings per share to be $4.29 to $4.37, which excludes the acquisition charges related to Tek, the benefit of the $0.03 per share of the three tax items realized in the second quarter and again the fourth quarter restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>The midpoint of our full-year adjusted guidance represents a 13% increase compared to prior year's earnings per share and a 9% increase after taking into account a $0.17 per share impact from the anticipated fourth quarter restructuring.</p>
          <p>We have often said that Danaher is positioned to outperform during difficult times and now is certainly one of those times. We believe that the composition of our portfolio, combined with our disciplined execution via DBS and the strength of our balance sheet will help us achieve positive results going forward. I'm confident that our talented and seasoned team can execute on the business plans we have in place. In turbulent times we believe our ability to be nimble and to react quickly to changing market conditions will help us capture additional market share from our competitors and to set us apart from many of our peers.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Larry. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready for questions Audrey.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And our first question today will come from Bob Cornell with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, guys. You gave the fourth quarter guidance and earnings, Larry, but not the core growth comment. What is the core growth contribution in the fourth quarter that drives the fourth quarter earnings you mentioned?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, it is interesting. I think if you look across the portfolio and the way we finished the third quarter, we're actually continuing to see I think a good level of strength across many of the businesses. But as we look to the fourth quarter clearly we have got a rather tempered outlook in line of the headlines and the concerns about the macro economy. I think right now, when we look at the fourth quarter, we think core will be positive, but at a rate below the 4% year-to-date number that we've registered.</p>
          <p>I think if you take a quick run through the segments, I think Instrumentation will be up low to mid single digits. We would expect T&amp;M and Water to continue to set the pace. I think will we see some softness at Gilbarco again because of the soft dispenser demand. Obviously with prices at the pump coming down that means margins are good, maybe visible by the year-end money there &#x2013; we'll see.</p>
          <p>At Med Tech, I think we are probably in the same range there, low to mid. We just had a few weeks back we were over in Europe with a number of the businesses for their strategic reviews, feel very good about the share take at Leica, at Radiometer, I think we're also very pleased with where Sybron is. Obviously work to do at KaVo, I'd say at KaVo clearly the 179 tax incentive is a bit of a wild card here in the fourth quarter. We will see how that plays out. And keep in mind I think with instrumentation and Med Tech we're talking about two-thirds of Danaher today. Industrial tech is  probably pretty much in line, maybe slightly below where they were in the third quarter, call that low singles and I think Tools will be down, down probably be low singles again largely because of the retail softness and what may come in that regard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, a second question would be just a -- when you did you start putting together the $75 million plan and maybe give us a little more detail. 12 plants sounds like &#x2013; it sounds like a lot, but then in the environment we're in, and it's sort of understandable. So maybe flush out just how you guys evolved the $75 million restructuring plan and how much it might benefit '09 and 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob it's hard to pick a date, as to when we began, simply because we're always in this mode. We've been on a steady pace, I think of restructuring since the second half of last year when we began to have concerns about the trajectory of the economy. Obviously couldn't call what's happened here in the last month, but certainly given recent events we're of the view that we should accelerate the plans that have been on the drawing boards as we get ready for 2009.</p>
          <p>So what really talking about doing in essence is pulling forward many of the plans, thoughts, what have you that were under discussion and were likely to have been put in place over the next, say four to eight quarters. So we are pulling those in and we're accelerating, clearly we're at a point now where we want to be respectful to our associates. These are plans that are still being worked through and finalized. So I want to be careful about the specifics that we provide externally until we complete our internal communications. But as you would guess, the businesses that are going to be perhaps most impacted are those with lower margins currently, those that are feeling or likely to feel the impact of the economy most directly. But again it's widespread and even some of our higher margin, better performing businesses will be taking some actions here to get ready for what may come.</p>
          <p>So again, we are talking about 1000 or more net positions being reduced, a dozen facilities and we're looking at that as again a $75 million number approximately that could &#x2013; there is a band there probably of plus or minus 5 or 10 million, given what we can get done this year. The majority of it will be a cash charge and we would expect to get more or less a one year payback on what we do. We'll keep you very well apprised of the details, Robert. We're going to be together here, once we get through the budgets in November at our analyst meeting in early December in New York and we'll give you a full update at that time. That's really where we are right now. I think it's the right thing to accelerate these actions given the environment we're in.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Deane.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could we start with Dan to give us a quick update on the current financing status? It looked like &#x2013; just to clarify on where you stand on commercial paper, your ability to term that out and if you're also on the other side seeing any stresses on the credit situation on your customers today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Deane, I will take the first one. As Larry mentioned, I mean really first nine months have done a lot to really substantially improve the balance sheet. We've paid down $1 billion of debt, our debt to total cap is all the way down to 21%. At the end of September, we had approximately $500 million of commercial paper. That's backed up by a bank facility that's three times the size of that, current borrowings and a facility that does not expire until 2012.</p>
          <p>In terms of CP, we are really benefiting from two things; one is we are a top tier credit in A1/P1 credit; but two, as importantly in this environment just the absolute size of our program is relatively modest. So we have had no issues accessing capital. We just paid off yesterday our $250 million U.S. Bond. We did that entirely with CP. We had no issues accessing that capital and we also have a favorable interest arbitrage on that. We paid off the bond, which was at 6%, and we were able to issue CP with about a month duration, that's at approximately 2% today. So at least to date we have had no issues accessing the CP market.</p>

          <p>Deane, this is Larry. We can't point to a distinct trend in any way. I think what we've seen thus far has been episodic. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, clearly in the consumer facing businesses, small part of Danaher of course, but that's where we're seeing softness. I think you can relate that to what's happened here. I think we're seeing some of our larger corporate customers delay, push out, some cases cancel some higher-ticket discretionary purchases. I'm not sure that' as much a function of their inability to access capital as much as it is them taking actions not unlike our own.</p>
          <p>I think we have seen a number of situations though &#x2013; this is episodic &#x2013; where I think some of our businesses that go to market through distribution are picking up some share and in partnership with some of our larger distributors, who clearly are able to finance their operations, probably taking share from some smaller distributors, smaller businesses who I think are having &#x2013; who are on the front lines if you will of what we have all been reading about.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to clarify on the Med Tech at 5.5% core revenues, are you immune from some of the headwinds of hospital CapEx freezes because of the price points on the Radiometer products and so forth and are you feeling any sort of pressure there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say that we are immune Deane, either at Radiometer or Leica. That would be sheer hubris on our part. But obviously the performance of the business speaks for itself. But I think we have seen in the U.S., certain projects, certain purchase decisions being pushed out, taking a little longer to get approved. But we haven't seen wholesale cancellations or anything getting hung up, because as you point out, our instrument price points are rather modest. And again, particularly at Radiometer, 70% of that business are the consumables that are really a function of procedure and patient flow, not capital financing.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, John.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. So -- maybe just if you could put this charge into a context, how this does compare given you've done some restructuring action earlier last year, throughout this year, and then how does this compare with 2001, the charge you took then and then the portfolio today? I mean does this &#x2013; what's sort of a backdrop perhaps more importantly, Larry, again does this kind of assume? Are you assuming as bad a recession as then, or just a little bit more color, because we obviously want to know what are the obvious sort of risks that you are going to have to do this again in six months if the economy continues to deteriorate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, again, this is an acceleration of the work that we began in the second half of the last year. Without trying to pinpoint our outlook for '09, John, I think you should interpret the announcement here this morning as Danaher accelerating a program well underway, Danaher doing as much as it can here in the short term to get ready for what I think will be a very challenging 2009.</p>
          <p>We will take the businesses through budgeting, as you know, here in the month of November, and come back or come out of those sessions and brief you on the detailed outlook for 2009. But I &#x2013; because we're always in the mode of taking cost out by way of DBS, taking these sorts of actions, I don't think this is necessarily the sum total of what we are going to do, but we'll take you through any additional updates or actions in December. But what we do in '09, I think will fall short of what we're talking about here this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, what we did six, seven years ago, was a number that was a little bit smaller than the 75 million, but of course the business was about a quarter of the size. I would add that over the last four quarters, through the end of the third quarter, we've done probably a little bit &#x2013; we've probably done approximately $40 million of restructuring, kind of averaged about 10 million a quarter during the last four quarters and almost regardless I would expect that sort of pace to continue in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So the 75 doesn't pull forward all your anticipated restructuring in '09. You're saying that's a &#x2013; that's kind of in response to the environment. You're still going to do this continuous kind of pay-as-you-go restructuring of <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and there will likely be some tails on some of the restructuring we're doing right now but there'll be other pay-as-you-go. That is kind of a normal course here for us particularly in any sort of challenging environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, just as we think about the environment, I mean tools obviously, I mean I guess the core growth could go negative there next year but how are you guys thinking about the rest of the portfolio? I mean do you believe that despite &#x2013; well there's obviously a big drop off in the last few weeks. Do you think that the rest of Danaher can sustain positive organic growth through 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would certainly be the headset we've taken to budgeting John. I mean, I think we all recognize here on the call that we are in a rather unprecedented situation here as what's happened on Wall Street spreads out to what the politicians keep referring to as Main Street. I don't think our crystal ball is any more clear in this regard that anyone else's. I think we are pleased with the way the businesses performed in the third quarter and while there is uncertainty, obviously we think we've got a much better portfolio going into tougher times when we did back in 2001.</p>
          <p>These Med Tech businesses for example, we were with all of them recently for our strat reviews just walked away feeling very good about the investments they want to make, the opportunities they have and that's not to sell short anything we have going on our instrumentation or elsewhere. I think our business can play offence in this environment. We're going to play offence with respect to M&amp;A; but I think it would just be sheer folly for us to sit back and not be in a mode where we're accelerating this activity -- this restructuring activity, preparing the cost structure while protecting our investments for what could be a very challenging period here in the months to come.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Nicole. We are here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Feeling good. I guess, Larry, could you just characterize kind of what you felt September looked like for us? Maybe you guys were more conservative throughout the year in terms of just bracing for a downturn. We heard a lot about Europe falling off a cliff in kind of July, August and then also with just the credit crunch what happened the last two weeks of September, maybe give us a sense by geography what you saw?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Nicole. I think for the quarter again we saw positive growth across all geographies. The U.S. hung in there and even there at the end, at a low single digit rate. Europe certainly decelerated and came in at a low single digit rate. I think in the spring, I may have said that Europe may be a year behind the U.S.; they're catching up fast. It was very rocky as things deceled there. And obviously I'm sure a lot of companies have shared with you, I mean the emerging markets, the so-called emerging markets by and large were still very strong. We were up double digit with that group. September specifically was in line, slightly lower than the July and August were. But I think we were pretty pleased with what we saw.</p>
          <p>Again, I think where we see the weakness tends to correlate pretty well to the headlines, consumer soft, discretionary spending for big companies clearly getting more attention, but again, we have a lot to be pleased with. Again I think we are taking share at Leica, Radiometer, Fluke, Water all had very good quarters coming in with record backlog at Trojan. Don't forget, we've got a third of mix now in consumables and aftermarket. Didn't have much of that -2X on a relative basis what we had last time we went into the fog. So I think we are navigating cautiously here as we end '08 and get ready for '09, but that said, I feel very good about our ability to outperform in what may come here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just one question on M&amp;A, you mentioned there are lots of attractive things out there and you're well positioned to capitalize. As you sit here and think about just the environment in general, I mean do you feel like, you'd be more inclined to wait just given kind of the market environment, rather than kind of Danaher's own liquidity situation. Just given how much cash you have and firepower and I guess as you step back and just think about the market, is it reasonable to think that you guys will step in now that we've seen prices fall off a cliff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well Nicole, I mean as you know &#x2013; I mean, you can tell from our cash flow statement, we've been pretty quiet the first nine months of the year, and I would say that a number of assets, a number of companies we were talking to, those businesses have not traded and they're by and large at lower prices today. And we don't try to pick the bottom here but we're obviously closer to the bottom than we were six months ago and we feel very good about the opportunities right now. We have a fair amount of discussion going on. We're obviously trying to make some judgments here on when bottom might be on some of these businesses and &#x2013; but I think our &#x2013; we feel very good about the balance sheet right now and I think you can expect us to be relatively active here. Now whether it's this quarter or '09, time will tell, but we've done a lot to really put the balance sheet in a position so we can be active here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nicole you will remember that back in '01, '02 we basically built out product ID with the Videojet acquisition and between Viridor and Gilbarco, we doubled up the size of the environmental business. So I think history is a bit of a guide, a bit of a lesson here for us as we think about the opportunities that should present themselves in the months and quarters to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood. And just not to beat a dead horse on the pay-as-you-go restructuring, can you give us a sense in terms of just &#x2013; obviously you guys are always continuously DBSing everything and proactively restructuring the businesses. Can you give us a sense of what that number has been that you've absorbed over the last couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd say over the last four quarters, we've averaged about 10 million a quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So about &#x2013; probably 30 to &#x2013; 35 to 40 million in the last four quarters, but I would say 2007 other than the fourth quarter that was a lower amount.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just jump to Dan first just on the &#x2013; back to the financing question. Dan is that using CP [to take this bond out, was that just kind of your normal transitional funding or are you making a proactive decision here to actually place CP a little bit more actively to work the arbitrage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no &#x2013; I mean, I think that was more of a discrete event than it was -- it was 250 million bond, so it was not a huge bond we were taking out. As well as the fact that we expect pretty strong cash flow here in Q4. So maybe sort of a timing issue where we could end up back at a sort of sub-500 million CP level, though that's not necessarily a goal &#x2013; but that could happen by the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what is your appetite or thought about testing the market with a longer-term bond offering here if an acquisition materializes or should we think about kind of smaller scale things where you would be using some transitional CP and just kind of cash flow to get there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that being an A1/P1 commercial paper issuer is very important to us. It's always important, but I think particularly in this environment. So I think because of our cash flow, because we're at ratios that would even suggest a rating probably a notch above where we are, I think we have a fair amount of latitude, though it does suggest probably in the near term, something very large would be less likely.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then Larry it sounds like great progress at Tek, so you jump off '08 with high teens margins. Could you give us sense of the confidence level there in a down revenue environment continue to take the margins up in '09? To what degree is revenue an important part of the equation or is it still just a lot a heavy cost out, redundancy out that can take the margins up?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, I think Jeff you are right. It &#x2013; we are rather bullish on where we are with Tek. We're about a month away here from the one-year anniversary. It has been an excellent year. I think as we look at '09, we've generated a lot of momentum here. Yeah it has been kind of flattish revenue year at Tek, but frankly that was very much in line with our expectations. Obviously a number of good things going on; the emerging markets have been good high single digit growers for Tek. I mentioned the new scope line, what we are doing in network management.</p>
          <p>Clearly DBS has had a lot of impact. You talked about the margin expansion, we are probably up over 300 bps at the op margin line this year, but I don't think we're anywhere close to being finished with respect to that cost structure. But that said I think as we move forward, clearly we've got a growth expectation unchanged from what we said when we bought this company. We think this is going to be contributor, an adder to Danaher on a stand-alone basis let alone in concert with Fluke where we continue to see and gain traction with the synergies.</p>
          <p>I think with everybody we are going to be I think somewhat conservative as we think about revenues for '09. So we will continue to push those growth programs, but at the same time make sure that we are using DBS to lean Tek to the extent possible. Again I feel that the team there has embraced DBS, has a year now in place that we really build on.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Finally you called out cost. Are you actually behind on price cost year-to-date, so theoretically we have kind of a narrowing of that negative spread or you just kind of thinking in aggregate, obviously cost has downward pressure and therefore we just naturally get some help?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in the Tool business, price is definitely behind cost year-to-date. I wouldn't say that for the other segments. We should get &#x2013; in the Tool business, we should get some relief here starting this quarter in commodities. The offset here as I think we will continue to see volume declines.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of kind of questions here. One thing that hasn't come up is &#x2013; and you talked a little bit about distributors gaining share, but what's your sense on inventory levels through the system? Do you sense as you walk through early October, end of September, that there is any panic in the system where people were starting to destock or that inventories were built up pretty aggressively maybe ahead of price increases, anything that leads you to believe we may see some change there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I haven't seen panic. But I think in a number of instances we've got some well-run distributors &#x2013; distributor partners who are looking at all aspects of their business as they think about '09 just as we are. So I don't think we've seen anything radical take place. But at the same time, we want to make sure that we're working with our distributor partners to make &#x2013; to set their inventory levels, let alone ours, in the right way for what's going to be a tough '09. But again, nothing dramatic yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I know this question has been asked every quarter I think for probably a year now, but &#x2013; given just the wealth disruption at the consumer level, can you talk a little bit about dental mix? I mean, is your view changed as far as the cyclicality of this business at all from 2Q? I mean, it's a big unknown, I think for a lot of people, but are we really at risk here of seeing a big decline in that business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the business to the extent that it has that exposure to patient flow, those patients obviously are consumers, has held up rather well. The bread and butter type of procedures that result in products for our general products businesses, be it restorative, be it endodontics and the like, that's held in there pretty darn well. Clearly, when you look back over 30, 40 years, through a number of downturns, dental spending has continued to chug along. And that's U.S. government data. I think a lot of people look to that as a foundation for being optimistic around the space and its ability to not swing wildly with the economy.</p>
          <p>That said, clearly on the KaVo side, where we do sell some higher ticket items, be it our 3-D imaging systems or our operatory treatment units and the like, I would not be surprised to see dentists be somewhat conservative relative to their capital spending not only in the US, but also in Europe in light of the uncertainty out there.</p>
          <p>I think in the US, here at year's end, we will be working against a very tough comp; I think the positive, albeit a wild card, is the 179 incentive that will be out there. Everyone I talked to is still, I think at this point, Scott, somewhat unclear but that's really a short-term measure. I think as we look at the business that we've built out with, Sybron, those businesses &#x2013; KaVo and the related equipment business, we are very pleased to have these businesses on board. Clearly, Sybron has made great progress; we've got work to do at KaVo on the margins. Specifically, this business will I think outperform in its market as we go through this tougher period and be a very strong contributor to Danaher for years to come.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. And then just last on &#x2013; just to understand a little bit the order patterns in Tek; I know '07 has some big telecom orders. Is that something that &#x2013; the lumpiness there, particularly in telecoms, is that something that comes around every two years, three years as some sort of pattern or was that a bit of a one off?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean clearly the win at Telstra is exciting for us, but that is an order &#x2013; in the network management business that I mentioned, the orders may be big tickets, but in essence the shipments or the revenue recognition is more of a steady-eddie type of situation, Scott. And we celebrate Telstra win, but we'd like the network management growth, because it is not lumpy at the revenue level. Back to business at Tek, which was growing before, and we have been able to go in as we've not only have improved the margins, I think we've also been able to improve the quality, delivery execution, network management and free up some resources to continue to fund the growth potential the team continues to see there.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning Steve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on price, I don't recall the Q's previously having all the detail, I mean almost every segment you talked about how much price you're getting. I'm not sure if you had that before. But can you talk about maybe the dynamic we have &#x2013; it's great raw materials costs are coming down. How quickly does this pretty positive front-end inflation environment turn on you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, I would say that for &#x2013; I could kind of exclude Tools for the moment, our ability to sort of get 1.5 to 2% price in our other businesses is largely driven by our consumable business, and that tends to be less commodity and more of the ability to just get that year-on-year. So I think we have done a much better job on price outside commodities and in outside Tools, and I think our ability to sustain that is much better than it's been at any point in our history. I think we have just got better processes, better approaches on that and better execution.</p>
          <p>I think within Tools that is a risk where we will get less price, however price has not been offsetting the significant rise we've seen here at least through August in commodities. So we may get less price, but I'll take that in Tools, because I think we're going to get some commodity benefit here and are starting to see that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you just talk outside of Tools about &#x2013; on the commodity front. How much that base is as a percentage of whatever sales or cost. Or you can even throw Tools in there, and then what you're talking about, because you guys have highlighted these commodity pressures pretty specifically in your Q, so I am just wondering if you could put some metrics around that help us out, to better analyze the dynamics here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve I'd have to look at it and come back to you. I mean again outside Tools and the metals, things like copper within Motion it's not a significant number relative to our cost of goods sold, but I'd have to try to look at it and come back to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve &#x2013; and just to add a little bit of color to what Dan said, outside of Tools, what has been the most insidious pressure that we faced hasn't been in any single commodity per se, but really in transport and logistics surcharges.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That was my question. I guess that was my question &#x2013; the base of what you're talking about here, maybe you can just give some more color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we will come back as Dan suggested. It is that T&amp;L dynamic that has been most challenging, and there will be a lag effect obviously from price per barrel to the surcharges but it's by and large formulaic. We didn't get much of that in third, we'll get a little bit in the fourth, but I think come the new year, that should be &#x2013; if things hang in just where they are today should be a positive for us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And Larry, you guys have always had a pretty good insight into what's going on in China, maybe you could just comment on what you are seeing specifically in China? There is a lot of debate around the economy there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I'm headed over there in a couple of weeks Steve, so I will be more current then, but going through with the team a few days ago I think the team had a good quarter across the board. They are optimistic that they are going to continue to perform but recognize that even China is not immune to what's happening globally, and we may see a decel but at this point that's really the team extrapolating from headlines as opposed to conversations with customers let alone order books. But again I will be over in a couple of weeks, I think that's obviously going to be an important factor for us come next year.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>We will now hear from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks good morning.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, obviously you are a different company to 2001, 2002. Have you done some work pro forma in both that period for your current portfolio and how your organic growth trended over that time, given Danaher as it is now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nigel, I'm not sure we've &#x2013; I've got the specific math in front of me, but you know a period where we were down sort of high single digits, the different mix, if we kind of would layer in the Med Tech businesses that by and large we're slower than the mid single digit, but we're still positive. In an environment where we were down eight &#x2013; a number of our other peers were down double-digit, that number might have been low single digit to flat. And I don't know if you could ever say what's a comparable environment, but it would have been five, six, seven hundred basis points probably better core growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That is great, good color. And then assuming if revenues do go negative next year, which is &#x2013; it sounds like it's possible, do you think you can still grow margins in that kind of environment? And kind of adding on to Steve's question, do you have any sense on how much margin you've lost in the last four or five years from negative price commodity inflation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we would certainly be of the view, Nigel, that on a net basis, we've been reducing material cost spend for like items. So while we've been dealing with metals in tools, as Dan suggested, and some other pressures here and there, we've also been accelerating our low-cost region initiatives, sharpening our purchasing capabilities as well, and that has been helpful to us. How much on a gross basis? How much pressure we've seen? How much of that may be relieved here over a 4, 5-year period? We don't have that for you this morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We can follow up on that. And then finally, and then just do you think you can still grow margins next year, if we have say negative 2% revenue growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we'll, give us the time to get the businesses through budgets, but clearly we are taking the actions we're announcing this morning as well as other activities to make sure we've got the best top line and the best bottom line we possibly can deliver come next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then just one final one for Dan, for 4Q, what FX rate are you baking in for 4Q?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's -- I think the euro, if we use that as a proxy averaged about 1.45 a year ago; it's 1.35, 1.36 today, so that would be probably a negative 2%, 3% hit to revenues. So that will be unlike it's been the last couple of year; that will be a headwind here in Q4.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">

      <speaker id="14" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A quick question on your cash flows and uses of cash flows, just looking at your share authorization, share buyback authorization. So at what point do you start finding the shares so attractive that you start sort of buying your own shares as to what is happening in the broader market and potential acquisitions? And then on the second front, you haven't made a large acquisition for awhile, which means that you do have a lot of firepower right now. So the scale of acquisitions that you are looking at, do you have something that potentially could be significantly larger than the scale of Tektronix or a portfolio like that? Could we have some color over there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Ajit, on the buyback, as you know, we do not have a systematic sort of buyback program. We tend to be sort of opportunistic. At the end of every earnings period Larry and I and the team sit down, and sort of evaluate the situation and obviously may be a little bit more opportunity today than in the past. But we do not, for obviously a variety of reasons, foreshadow what we may or may not do in the open market.</p>
          <p>Regarding acquisitions and potential size, as I mentioned earlier I think we will be very active in this environment. There is a lot of good, small, medium-size, bolt-on and sort of adjacency type opportunities across Med Tech, Test &amp; Measurement, Product ID and Water that I suspect our activities will be not unlike what it was during the last downturn; not one very large &#x2013; it could be, but if I had to predict not one very large opportunity, but a series of medium-size, small and medium-size opportunities that would build up our existing platforms.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And on the share buyback, you still have an authorization there, is there &#x2013; are there any plans to expand that authorization and what drives the math on that decision? When you sit down after the quarter and you decide that whether to do a share buyback or not, is it more to do with opportunities out there or is it more to do with acquisitions and other uses of cash? Is it more to do with the accretion that you will have, if you actually buy back your own stock?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it is a function of all those, but it's largely a function of what we think our return on invested capital is on that buyback. And again we will be sitting down here shortly to discuss that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just circle back for a second, as we've tracked through the September quarter, the trends in &#x2013; let me think of the trends geographically, but certainly in North America as well as the emerging markets seem to be relatively consistent, where they were in the first half. It appears to me that obviously Europe has turned down fairly quickly. You mentioned it decelerated fairly quickly, has caught up to the U.S. Is Europe the primary reason that we've accelerated the cost reduction efforts and then secondly, on the same note the strength in the dollar, Dan if I do the quick math, it would appear as you commented it will be a -2 or -3% hit to revenue. That would &#x2013; at a conversion rate of 12%, that would look like maybe four pennies of adjustment to the fourth quarter guidance due to currency?</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, good morning. I mean you're right. Europe is decelerating here. We saw that through the summer, we saw that in September, but I think what we are talking about this morning, the acceleration of the ongoing restructuring activities is primarily a function of our macro call that there is great uncertainty. The risks clearly are to the downside and our balance here really have to be more weighted toward making sure the cost structures across the portfolio are in place to allow us to invest, to allow us to outperform in what could be a very tough economy here for a while. I think Europe is one manifestation of that. The headlines and some of the early signs of the credit crisis that we have seen per, I think Dean's question is another representation.</p>
          <p>Maybe we're wrong, maybe this will all pass, maybe the government's activities here will make this a short-term event, but again I don't think we do shareholders, we don't do our team or our customers any favors by looking for the silver lining here, because it's an operating environment, I don't think any of us have ever really been in. So we want to make sure we are ready. And I intend to make sure that we are very ready.</p>
