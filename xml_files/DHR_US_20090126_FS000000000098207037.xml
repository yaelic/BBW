          <p>Good morning, my name is Trisha and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Danaher Corporation Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions.] Thank you.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andy Wilson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Wilson, you may begin your conference.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. On the call today are Larry Culp, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Dan Comas, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>I would like to point out that our earnings release, a slide presentation supplementing today's call, and a reconciling and other information required by SEC Regulation G relating to any non-GAAP financial measures provided during the call are all available in the Investor section of our website, danaher.com, under the heading Earnings, and they will remain there following the call.</p>
          <p>As our year-end Form 10-K has not yet been filed, we have included as a part of the earnings release the fourth quarter and full-year income statement, year-end balance sheet, and full-year cash flow statement. In addition, we have included data in the release reflecting our business segments, as well as supplemental income statement data to facilitate your analysis. Also, the audio portion of the call will be archived on the Investor section of our website later today under the heading Web Events and will remain archived until our next quarterly call. A replay of the call will also be available until January 30. The replay number is 888-203-1112 in the U.S. and 719-457-0820 internationally with a confirmation code of 4986181. I will repeat this information at the end of the call for late arrivals.</p>
          <p>During the presentation, we will describe certain of the more significant factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Please refer to the accompanying slide presentation, our earnings release and other related presentation materials supplementing today's call for additional factors that impacted year-over-year performance. Also, all references in this presentation to earnings, revenues and other company-specific financial metrics relate only to the continuing operations of Danaher's business unless otherwise noted.</p>
          <p>Our earnings for the period include the results of operations of Tektronix, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2007. Included in our 2008 earnings are certain non-cash charges related to the Tektronix acquisition for fair value adjustments to recorded inventory and deferred revenue, which reduced total net earnings by approximately $5 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and approximately 44.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share for all of 2008. These charges are included in our reported results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2008. Throughout the call all references to the non-cash, acquisition-related charges for Tektronix relate to these items.</p>
          <p>In addition in 2007, charges for purchased in-process research and development, as well as fair value adjustments to required inventory and deferred revenue related to the Tektronix acquisition, reduced earnings in the fourth quarter and full year by approximately 66 million or $0.20 per diluted share.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to announce that we will be making some forward-looking statements during the call, including statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings. It is possible that actual results might differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today. And these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date that they are made and we do not assume any obligation or intend to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to turn the call over to Larry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.92, representing a 5% decrease from last year. Included in fourth quarter earnings were pre-tax charges at $82 million or approximately $0.18 per diluted share related to restructuring activities previously announced during the quarter, as well as $0.01 per diluted share related to the non-cash acquisition charges for Tektronix. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter were $1.11, essentially flat compared to last year.</p>
          <p>We deployed approximately $82 million toward restructuring initiatives during the quarter, of which approximately 60% related to SG&amp;A activities and the remaining 40% impacted cost of goods sold. These actions resulted in the elimination of more than 1,800 physicians and the closure of 13 facilities globally, and are expected to generate in excess of $100 million of savings in 2009.</p>
          <p>For full-year, earnings per diluted share were $3.95, which also reflect the $0.18 of restructuring charges and include the impact of non-cash, acquisition-related charges for Tektronix. Adjusted earnings per diluted share for the full-year 2008 were $4.23, an increase of 10.5% compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Revenues for the quarter increased roughly 1% year-over-year to $3.2 billion, with core revenues down 1%, acquisitions contributing 6% and a negative currency effect of 4%. Continued growth in our environmental, acute care diagnostics and life sciences businesses was offset by softening demand in certain segments of the portfolio, including KaVo, Fluke Networks, Product Identification and Tools. Our full-year 2008 revenues were up 15% year-over-year to a record $12.7 billion with core revenues growing 2.5%.</p>
          <p>Year-over-year gross margin for the fourth quarter decreased approximately 50 basis points to 45.7%, primarily due to the restructuring charges. Gross margin for the full year increased 110 basis points to 46.8% due to the impact of higher gross margins in recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, leverage from higher sales volumes in the first three quarters of the year, as well as the positive impact of cost savings initiatives, which more than offset fourth quarter restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses were 27.1% of sales compared to 24.5% a year ago, due primarily to fourth quarter restructuring charges, incremental investments in emerging market sales resources and higher SG&amp;A levels in our newer businesses. For the full year, SG&amp;A expenses as a percent of sales increased 170 basis points to 26.3%, primarily due to the same factors.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, research and development spending as a percentage of sales decreased 160 basis points to 5.3% due to the write-down of in-process R&amp;D or IPR&amp;D in the fourth quarter of last year related to the acquisition of Tektronix. Absent this prior year charge, adjusted research and development spending as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points as we continue to invest for the future.</p>
          <p>Operating profit for the quarter was $424 million, representing a 9% decrease over last year, which includes the approximately $82 million of restructuring charges. Adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased 4%. For the full year, operating profit was $1.9 billion, a 7.5% increase over the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating profit increased 12%. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 150 basis points decrease from 2007. Restructuring actions and related charges, partially offset by the Tektronix IPR&amp;D charges in 2007, accounted for the majority of this change. Core operating margin in the fourth quarter was essentially flat compared to the prior year, despite a modest decline in core growth and the increase in R&amp;D.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our operating margin was 0.7%, a 110 basis point decrease from 2007. Restructuring actions and related charges negatively impacted full-year margins by approximately 65 basis points. Core operating margin was essentially flat compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 24% as compared to 26.3% in the prior-year period. Our fourth quarter tax rate includes the benefit of the research and experimentation credit, which was extended as a result of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.</p>
          <p>Net earnings were $306 million for the quarter, a decrease of 4.5% compared to the prior year, primarily resulting from restructuring charges, softer revenues and a negative impact of currency fluctuations. For the full year, net earnings were $1.3 billion, an increase of 8.5% over last year. Adjusted net earnings for the fourth quarter were essentially flat compared to last year and were up approximately 13% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Despite the difficult macro economy, we continued to generate record operating cash flows in 2008. Operating cash flow increased 9.5% to $1.9 billion for the full year. Our free cash flow was $1.65 billion, an 8.5% increase over 2007. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio was 126%, making 2008 the 17th consecutive year in which our free cash flow has exceeded our net income. The Danaher Business System is the driver behind this significant and sustained cash flow performance.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we purchased approximately 1.4 million shares of company stock at an average price of just under $54. There are currently two million additional shares remaining under the existing authorization.</p>
          <p>Our ability to generate free cash flow during these challenging economic times has also allowed us to continue to strengthen our portfolio by way of strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we made six acquisitions, comprising about $85 million in annualized revenue to strengthen our environmental, test and measurement and life sciences businesses. For the full year, we completed a total of 17 acquisitions, representing approximately $325 million of annualized revenue. We believe the acquisition environment is becoming more attractive and that we are well positioned to capitalize on strategic acquisition opportunities.</p>
          <p>We remain in excellent financial shape. In addition to the acquisitions I just mentioned and the share buyback, we deployed our robust free cash flow towards reducing our outstanding net debt position by more than $1.2 billion during 2008. Our debt to total capital ratio at the end of the year was 21%.</p>
          <p>Let's turn now to some of the highlights from the operating segments. Professional Instrumentation revenues increased 13.5% for the quarter with core revenues up 2.5%. For the full year, revenues were up 37.5% with core revenues contributing 4%. Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 17.8% as compared to 16% last year, driven primarily by core margin improvements of 130 basis points. For the full year, operating margin decreased 140 basis points to 18.7% when compared to 2007, due primarily to the impact of new acquisitions, principally Tektronix, and the impact of restructuring actions and related charges.</p>
          <p>Environmental platform revenues grew 7.5% in the quarter and 15.5% for the full year with core revenues up 6.5% in both periods. Water Quality core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the fourth quarter as our HACH-LANGE business continued to see solid demand across all major geographies.</p>
          <p>The team once again delivered a stellar performance in China, where our revenues were up by more than 20% in the quarter. Sales of our ultra-pure analytical solutions grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter, the result of continued strength from new product sales, including our new TOC, or total organic carbon, analyzer utilized in pharmaceutical applications.</p>
          <p>ChemTreat's revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter as continued investment in ChemTreat's best-in-class sales and service organization continued to drive share gains. Detergent's revenues grew at a mid-teens rate in the quarter with broad-based strength across most major geographies and applications. In China, Trojan was voted the number-one disinfection brand for the second year in a row by a leading trade group. Trojan is entering 2009 with another record backlog.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed four acquisitions in Water Quality, the largest of which was Sea-Bird Electronics. With approximately 25 million in annualized revenue, Sea-Bird Electronics provides connectivity, temperature and depth instrumentation and provides calibration services used by research institutions and government agencies to help explore and research the relationship between ocean dynamics and climate change. Sea-Bird more than doubles the size of HACH's hydramet business.</p>
          <p>Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, due in part to increased sales of payment and point-of-sale systems, particularly in the U.S. In October, Veeder-Root received regulatory approval from the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, for its enhanced vapor recovery solution. Following this approval, Veeder-Root shipped more than 1,100 vapor recovery solutions to retailers, contributing to their mid-teens growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>Moving to Test &amp; Measurement, revenues were up 20.5% in the quarter with core revenues down 3.5%. For the full year, revenues grew 70.5% with core revenues coming in flat. Fluke core revenues decreased at a low single-digit rate in the fourth quarter as robust demand for thermography products was offset by reduced sales of more traditional industrial products. Inventory reductions in distribution also negatively impacted the quarter, as did currency exchange rate volatility in emerging markets, particularly in Eastern Europe and in Mexico.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Hawk IR, a manufacturer of infrared panel sightglasses and ports used in many of Fluke's thermography products. Fluke Network sales decreased at a mid-teens rate during the quarter, resulting from continued soft telecom demand as well as the effective slower IT spending.</p>
          <p>At Tektronix, revenues declined at a low single-digit rate in the quarter. At Tek Communications, our network management business grew at a high single-digit rate with a large number of new carriers added during the fourth quarter. Tek is entering 2009 with the leading share position in network management solutions and the highest backlog levels the business has ever experienced. In Instruments, sales of oscilloscopes declined at a high single-digit rate, primarily a result of softening market conditions and distributor partners working to reduce their inventory.</p>
          <p>In November, we marked the one-year anniversary of the Tektronix acquisition. Looking back over the past year, we are very pleased with the progress we've made on all fronts at Tek. The Tek team has embraced CDFs and as a result, we are now working a growth plan, which should help us, long term, drive sustained growth. We remain committed to investing in innovation while at the same actively managing our bottom line. We've far surpassed our one-year cost reduction objectives and improved operating margin by more than 400 basis points. Despite the challenges we face on the top line, in the near term, we continue to believe that Tektronix represents a compelling, strategic acquisition to Danaher that will deliver excellent returns to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Moving over to Med Tech, revenues for the quarter decreased 2.5% compared to 2007 with core revenues essentially flat. For the full year, revenues were up 9.5% with core revenues up 4.5%. Med Tech operating margin for the quarter, fourth quarter, was 10.7% compared to 15.3% a year ago, due largely to restructuring actions and related charges, as well as the impact of newly acquired businesses. Core operating margin declined 80 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to lower volumes in our cable business. Full-year operating margin declined 180 basis points to 11.3% compared to the prior year, primarily a result of these same factors.</p>
          <p>Starting with dental, Sybron grew at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter, led by strong sales of SybronEndo's Twisted Files and Total Care's disinfection products, as well as continuing demand for our general dentistry consumables at Kerr. Sales of our traditional orthodontry products declined in the quarter, as many patients postponed orthodontic procedures due to the general economic situation.</p>
          <p>Cable revenues declined at a mid-teens rate in the quarter with a general slowdown across all major geographies and product categories. The economic downturn has significantly impacted sales of new dental equipment with many dentists delaying new investments in their practices. Notwithstanding this tough environment, we experienced robust sales growth for the Gendex CB-500, our new medium field-of-view 3D imaging unit, which we launched in Europe in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, core revenues for all dental declined at a mid single-digit rate.</p>
          <p>Leica core revenues grew at a high single-digit rate in the quarter, driven by confocal microscopy demand as well as more than 20% growth at Leica Biosystems, our pathology diagnostic instruments and consumables business. We experienced growth across all major geographies with solid demand both in Asia and in North America. In 2008, Leica's revenues surpassed the billion-dollar mark, more than double its revenue when we acquired the business in 2005. We are extremely pleased with this achievement and with the continued success of the Leica team.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we acquired Surgipath Medical Industries with annual revenues of approximately $40 million. Surgipath is a manufacturer of consumables and stains used in pathology laboratories. The acquisition broadens Leica Biosystems' core histology offering and furthers its objective towards becoming the leading provider of complete solutions for pathology labs.</p>
          <p>Radiometer's core revenues were in a mid single-digit rate for the quarter, driven by strong consumable sales. Instrument sales were also healthy, growing at a mid single-digit rate due in part to shipments of our new compact ABL80 analyzer, which was launched during the quarter. Sales of AQT in Europe are progressing well, with more than 100 units currently in the field.</p>
          <p>Moving to Industrial Technology, revenues declined 4.5% in the quarter with core revenues essentially flat. For the full year, revenues increased 3.5% with core revenues contributing 1.5%. Our operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.7%, a 260 basis point decrease compared to the same period last year, due primarily to restructuring actions undertaken in the quarter. The core operating margin improved 80 basis points in the quarter. Full-year operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16%, due primarily to our restructuring activities.</p>
          <p>Product Identification core revenues were down 8% in the quarter and 3.5% for the full year. Continued growth of consumables, sales and service in our installed base was more than an offset by slowing sales in new equipment as many customers delayed making purchases.</p>
          <p>Despite the challenges faced in the broader equipment market, we have been very pleased with the early results of Videojet's new 1000 Series family of small character inkjet printers. These printers provide customers with industry-leading uptime and a more predictable maintenance schedule. These products address a wide variety of coding applications in such verticals as food, beverage and pharmaceuticals. Since launching the high-performance CIJ-1510 in the third quarter, we have seen strong demand, with December being our highest shipment month thus far. And during the fourth quarter, we launched the lower price-point CIJ-1210, which is ideal for lower-volume printing needs.</p>
          <p>In Motion, revenues were down 3.5% in the quarter with core revenues contributing a 1% offset by the negative impact of currently fluctuations. Our Aerospace &amp; Defense elevator and flat-panel display businesses benefited from backlog reductions during the quarter but were mostly offset by soft demand in the U.S and Europe for standard motor and drive products and in factory automation as a result of widespread capital spending reductions. Due to the weakening of many of the major end markets we serve here, we are not forecasting this level of sales performance in 2009. For the full-year, Motion sales increased 4% with core revenues up 1% with net positive currency effects.</p>
          <p>And finally, moving to Tools and Components, revenues for the quarter decreased 15% with core revenues down 14.5%. For the full year, core revenues decreased 3.5%. Our operating margin for the quarter was 9.8%, a decrease of approximately 200 basis points from the prior year largely due to increased commodity costs, primarily steel, and the impact of lower production levels, as well as restructuring actions and related charges. These negative factors were partially offset by insurance recoveries collected in the quarter related to a plant fire that occurred in 2007. In 2009, we expect some relief from these higher commodity cost levels as we've consumed the majority of inventory purchased in 2008 at these record price levels. Full-year operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 12.2% due principally to these same factors.</p>
          <p>Mechanics' Hand Tools core revenues declined 14.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower sales to both the consumer and professional channels. During the quarter, we began shipping the General Mechanic's Toolkit for the U.S. government. This is a contract that's expected to generate over $100 million of new revenue over the next five years. For the full-year, Mechanics' Hand Tools core revenue declined 6%.</p>
          <p>So to wrap up, despite an unprecedented global economic slowdown, we are pleased with the progress we've made over the last year. We entered 2009 with a stronger balance sheet, having reduced our outstanding net debt by over $1.2 billion. We completed 17 acquisitions in 2008, strengthening our Med Tech, Test &amp; Measurement and Water businesses. Our restructuring investments that began in 2007 and which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008, and our talented team, many of whom were a part of the company in the last downturn, have contributed to the solid results we delivered in the year and give us the ability to outperform in what we believe will be a challenging 2009.</p>
          <p>With this outlook, we expect earnings per share in the first quarter of 2009 to be in the range of 70 to $0.80. And we're reconfirming our full year 2009 earnings per share guidance of $3.70 to $4.70.</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. We'll go to Nicole Parent with Credit Suisse.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nicole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Larry, you gave us some sense on Motion trends and what you are thinking for 2009 versus the fourth quarter and full-year '08. How should we think about some of the other sub-segments in terms of core growth relative to what we have been seeing? And maybe could you give us a sense of margin performance as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Within Motion, Nicole, or more broadly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, more broadly...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You gave us a sense in your comments of what, that Motion was going to be below the current trend levels.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think that as we reconfirm the full-year guidance, Nicole, we are probably not of a much different mindset than we were in when we saw you in December. I think the core outlook for 2009 is still going to be in that down two to down six range for Danaher, with the first quarter representing a very challenging start. The first half is likely to be tougher than the second half.</p>
          <p>I think if you just, if you look at the full year for a moment, if you just take the mid-point of that down two down six, what we would anticipate is that the defensive businesses, the businesses that have clearly demonstrated already in the fourth quarter here that they are resilient, they should be, say, call it flat to slightly positive. Obviously Water, Dental Consumables, Sybron, Radiometer, and there you're talking obviously about 4 billion of our 12 billion in revenue.</p>
          <p>I think the businesses that we would expect to be down, call it low to mid single-digit, Fluke, Gilbarco Veeder-Root, possibly, KaVo, Product ID and certainly Tools. And then I think the businesses that are going to be down mid-single, maybe a little bit more, FNET, Tek, and the company mentioned in your question, Motion, given what we know and given what we don't know right now. Is that helpful?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Nicole, from a margin perspective, for down in kind of that core being negative four, we would expect core margins to be down slightly year-on-year, call that 25, 50 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then within the Test &amp; Measurement sub-segment, could you give us a sense of the end market strength and weakness that you are seeing like you did in the Motion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think what we are seeing is on balance at Fluke, general softness, and as you know we've got a very hot product line-up in thermography, it's a new application across a number of verticals. But I think as we look at just the general industrial, electrical and electronic markets that we serve there, customers have pulled back, channel partners are taking a cautious position in inventory as we both ended the year and have started the year.</p>
          <p>I think at FNET, we certainly have seen both kind of a core telecom business there and more importantly this general IT spending get pushed out and get deferred, which is why they were down so much and why we think they could have a very tough '09.</p>
          <p>At Tek, we really have two different dynamics going on there, again as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Nicole, very good performance on our network management business. We think that's a segment, a market space that has held up well. We believe we are taking share. And just, the team there is doing a very good job.</p>
          <p>In the General Purpose Instrumentation, where we have about two-thirds of that business, clearly a global slowdown that was pronounced in the fourth quarter, which again is why we have, I think, the sober outlook for that business that we do here in '09.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of things. First, on restructuring, minor nuance, but I think you actually spent a little bit less than you were indicating. Any thoughts on just that and the ability to find more to do?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, we spent approximately 82 million in the quarter. I think, when we were together in New York we thought we'd be somewhere in the $90 million range. I think the other interesting data point there is we, I think, talked about 1,700 physicians being eliminated as part of that. We actually got more positions out in the quarter. We ended up about 1,800. So I think that probably the best way to characterize this is we were, perhaps planned a tad conservatively, and the business is on balance and they executed well.</p>
          <p>We also, I think, stand by what we said in December relative to the commitment to do more in '09. We set aside, I believe in our roll forward, 40 to 60 million of additional restructuring spending this year. That of course is embedded in the guidance that we've offered up. And I see no reason for us to pull back from that level of expectation given the uncertainties that are out there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on M&amp;A that's done in the pipeline, Dan, what type of revenue impact are we looking at just what you have in hand, a point or two, or not even that much now that we've left Tek?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we added about 300 million annualized, and probably if you took half of that. So it's probably about a 1.5 benefit going into '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then just finally on Dental, Larry, I missed what you said on Sybron. Could you just repeat that and give us a little additional color on how weak ortho was and just the trends you're seeing among some of the more discretionary items?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think that of the major pieces at Sybron, the ortho piece is probably the most discretionary. But hopefully people still will invest in their children's oral health. But as we look at that business, we were down modestly in the quarter but had some very nice offsets. We mentioned in the prepared remarks what we're doing in the endo field, a number of new products there I think helping us drive share. Our disinfection business, given all the concerns in that space generally, both in dental and in medical, had a very good quarter; some of the other smaller businesses at Sybron did as well.</p>
          <p>So I think on balance, we are pretty pleased with the performance. Kerr, certainly in the General Consumables business, saw some slowing. But it was not nearly as pronounced given that many people would look at those general products, if you will, more in the pain management category, far less a discretionary item than something like orthodontia or implants.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, just to be clear then, ortho was down modestly or the whole Sybron franchise is down modestly?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Good morning, everybody.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Bob.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I want to just go back and flesh out the sequence of the quarter, the fourth quarter. I remember, we talked about October was up a little bit I think and November was flat, and then December started out so weak, you guys understood the quarter was going to be negative, but you came out negative just 1%. I was wondering if December finished a little better than it started and maybe you could give us an idea of how January started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right, Bob. We did a little bit better than we thought relative to core in the quarter. I think that when we entered December, like most companies, we had no idea when people were going to head home for the holidays in terms of customers. But things were not anything to brag about. I think we did a little bit better than we had anticipated. So we were pleased with that.</p>
          <p>I do want to note, though, that as we mentioned a couple of times already, we were working down backlog in a number of areas. We certainly saw orders weaken through the course of the quarter. And I think that in large part is why we've offered up the type of framework, the thinking about '09 that we have. I think thus far, while it's early, things haven't been horrible, but again, I wouldn't say they've been anything to brag about it. I think by and large they have been in line with what we would have, what we were thinking and what we were discussing in mid-December.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The other thing is, a lot of companies talk about destocking as well as end-market issues, and are you able to gauge what destocking effect you're seeing as a depressant on your organic growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's hard to quantify that, Bob, on a pan-Danaher basis, but we certainly saw in a number of our businesses that go to market though distribution where our sales out the door were softer than the sell through at the counter, at retail, as a result of those inventory reductions. This definitely happened across a number of our businesses, and I would offer up that I don't believe that that has settled out yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned <mark type="inaudible" />, I mean what were orders, up or down in the fourth quarter, if you referenced those? I don't remember hearing what you said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, they were down about two or three points more than the negative one on the shipments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, final question for me is what's going on with pricing, and are you starting to see customers come back at you with lower commodity costs in the headlines and put pricing on you, or, and how are you matching the price issues versus the commodity declines?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we certainly are seeing isolated examples where that's surfacing in our conversations with customers and our conversations with businesses. I would suspect that will be an increased topic of discussion as we go out through the year, just as we are with our vendor base, given what's happened in a number of the commodity markets and obviously with the economy at large.</p>
          <p>But I think we continue to believe, Bob, as we think about '09, that we can get some positive price and get more than our fair share of the reduction in the decrease in commodity prices broadly across the portfolio. So I think that net-net will be a positive for Danaher, those two elements in 2009.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey guys. So just to pick up on that last point and to dovetail with what you said about Tools and Raws. What sort of &#x2013; assume raw material costs, now that you've anniversaried sort of the higher input costs, now that, assume that raw material costs sort of stay where they are today, Larry or Dan, what kind of a profit benefit does that give the Tool segment in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, John, across the company, at current levels, it could be a kind of 20 to 30 basis point benefit to margins. Within Tools, that would be the lion's share, so it would probably be north of 100 basis points of benefit. I think the offset here is the continued challenges here on the top line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, do you have to give some of that back in terms of price? I want to sort of, when Larry is describing that price is going to be up, is that disproportionally weighted to some segments and then Tools, you expect price to be down or how should we think about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think we got about two points of price in the fourth quarter. That will prove more challenging though we think it will positive here in '09. The areas where I think price will be sticky will be our Consumables businesses, across Product ID, Med Tech. And it will be more challenging, clearly, to get price in Tools, though right now we are not looking to give up price.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry Dan, was Tools down in price in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Tools was, we had positive price in Tools as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Lastly, just emerging markets, you guys are a big company in China. What are you seeing there? I understand that you are probably outperforming, but could you give us a little bit more color on what you are seeing in end markets, specifically China? And then you read about the economy in India has taken a real hit. I mean, just how about a little bit of an update in terms of what's going on in these important economies?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I think with respect to China, John, we certainly saw solid performance across the portfolio, really up until early November. And I think since then, China has softened significantly. We mentioned in the prepared remarks certainly Eastern Europe and Mexico, other parts of South America, have been wrestling with the currency issues as well. Some of that has stabilized. But by and large, the turmoil that you read about certainly is marked in what we saw toward the end of the year. It's been reduced a bit in those places, India included here, at the beginning of the year. But I think we still have a cautious view about what we can expect from those geographies in '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Worse than what you thought before, Larry, or does it ultimately not be that, is it not that significant?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the currency noise just added to all the underlying macro weakness in December, John, as you saw those currencies fluctuate as they did. So I think on the margin we are probably more cautious about emerging markets in '09. But I think in general, as you heard us in December, we are trying to go in here real sober about the environment that we are wrestling with this year.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the working capital front, you guys did a good job on the inventories and receivables. Could you just talk about the dynamics there and was there anything unusual? I think receivables was a particularly strong benefit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we've, the little bit of the softer top-line can help a little bit but if you look at the last couple years, we've been able to generate pretty good cash flow out of working capital. So for the full year, we've got about 100 million of working capital contributing to cash flow. I think that's something we strive for every year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then also year-to-date the bad debt reserve was up about $10 million on a flat receivables basis. Anything specific going on there or is that just mix from Tektronix?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a couple of things. It's a little bit from the new acquisitions coming in adding some revenues, but it is also a function of the environment; we are putting a little bit more provision on the balance sheet to recognize the more difficult times.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then one more thing just on M&amp;A environment. Any kind of high-level comments there? Is there anything that's changed? Has the sellers' expectations come down or are they all still sitting out there thinking these valuations are actually low?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think everybody is a little different, Steve. But I think we view '09 as a year in which we should have plenty of opportunity to make good, smart investments to build our portfolio. And we know that in both public and private situations, the havoc that this economy is laying in will create situations where valuations will come in, companies may lose some of the strategic options they once had. And that I think will make a conversation with Danaher attractive, and certainly that'll be attractive to us as well.</p>
          <p>So we are optimistic that we're going to be putting some capital to work this year to build out Danaher for the future.</p>

          <p>The first question is just about Western Europe. I think you talked about Eastern Europe and China being sort of weakening towards the end of the year. Could you give some color as to linearity in Western Europe and your expectations going into the first half of this year?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that we saw Western Europe, not unlike the U.S., soften through the quarter. We actually, we're just slightly positive in Europe in the quarter. But very much would expect Europe, not unlike the U.S., to come in, I think, in '09, or at least Danaher in that context, to come in in that down two, down six range. I don't think we're expecting a wildly different '09 in Europe than we are, Western Europe, than we are elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Ajit, through the first three quarters we're probably up approximately double-digit, low double-digit for the fourth quarter China with flat year-on-year. And I think the expectation is for the full company, as Larry mentioned being down 2 to 6%. I think China could be in that range, maybe a little bit better, but we're not expecting a lot of growth in any geography in '09 right now.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And then last question would just be looking at your share buybacks. I think you talked about priorities of cash, could you walk us through right now about how you are looking at share buybacks? At what point you'd be more aggressive there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we did buy back about 1.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. We do, as you know in our history, we'll find periods of time where we think it's a very attractive opportunity an opportunity to take some stock out of the system. But given our significant debt reduction in '08, given the strong cash flow we expect in '09, I would expect that the lion's share of that liquidity goes towards building out the portfolio, though there is always a potential element for a small portion of buyback.</p>

          <p>Hi, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Scott.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Most of my questions were answered but I did want to dig in to a little bit of the M&amp;A side. And the question is, where is the sweet spot now, where deal multiples are coming down and there's a reality among the seller that not only do multiples have to come down but the denominator also has to come down as far as what's perceived as kind of mid-cycle earnings? Is there a certain sweet spot or is it, do you have to go to larger or is it a lot more smaller deals? Kind of what, what do you think there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I'm not sure I could give you a good generalization there. I think we're, the market's really been down here for two quarters; I think that helps. I would say that people are more nervous out there. And again, that makes it more challenging for all of us here on the call, but I think that bodes well for the environment where you have companies, public and private, both showing bad numbers but also forecasting tougher numbers as well. And I think that tends to be where you begin to see a more rational seller. So I'm not sure we're quite there yet, but I think it's coming.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on restructuring, which segments do you feel like you still have some wood to chop to get capacity down to match up with the demand outlook?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Scott, I'd give you just a kind of a simple answer here and share with you that I think all the businesses still have opportunity. So we talk about somewhere in the $50 million range being set aside in '09. I would anticipate that that will be broadly distributed across the portfolio.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>We will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the acquisition question. I mean, from <mark type="inaudible" /> do you think you'll do anything transformational this year, or more kind of bolt-on in nature?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think like a lot things in '09, Nigel, it's a little hard to say given what may come. But I think the general approach that we've used in the past is likely to be the one that you see play out this year. We put capital to work. We're going to be focused on the bolt-ons that you saw us do in '08.</p>
          <p>But I suspect the larger deals, be it 500, be it a billion, will be a larger part of what we do in '09 than they were last year. Because I think those are the situations that Dan was referencing a moment ago that will be good additions for us. I think that as we go through the year, clearly the focus will be on adding to the Environmental, the Med Tech, the T&amp;M, the Product ID segments. Could there be another platform flag out there planted in '09? It's possible, but I think there is so much going on just in those four businesses where we do about eight of our 12 billion in revenue, but that eight is against the market backdrop of about 50 billion.</p>
          <p>So I suspect we will stay close to home. The transformational situation, those are always unlikely, but if they are going to happen and they may be more likely to happen in a tumultuous environment like this, but I suspect most of the capital, if not all, will be spent close to home.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, that's good color. Couple of quick ones here. On the Consumables I was a little bit surprised to see that grow in the mid single-digits given that IP is down maybe 5% in both U.S. and Europe. Do you think that continues to grow into '09 or do you think it will weaken as we go through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think the reference was to the Consumables business at Sybron.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sybron or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, this is at Videojet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm sorry. I think that's one we're going to watch very closely. We thought that part of the Product ID portfolio was more defensive, more resilient. I think it's demonstrated as much, but it is one that we are going to watch. Keep in mind that a lot of the verticals that we serve there are going to be a little bit more stable than IT, just broadly defined, food, bev and the like.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's a fair question, Nigel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. And then finally on FX, there was a little bit more of a headwind from FX this quarter than expected. The Japanese yen has been pretty strong, and you do have a bit more exposure to Japan. Is that going to be a slight positive factor for you in '09, you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is, but it pales in comparison to the impact of the euro. So what we said in December of it being about an impact of 0.05, $0.06 in the first quarter, it may be more like $0.05 now, but it's pretty small.</p>

          <p>Good morning, Wendy.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned, Larry, in your prepared remarks that you'd gained some share at Tek. Can you talk about your strategy, your market share gain strategy in these kind of tough times? Is it strictly new products or geographies or markets or does it say something about your willingness to address pricing <mark type="inaudible" /> share?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as Dan referenced, Wendy, we certainly don't want to display the price card in any environment. We did a nice job in that regard in '08 getting price in, I think getting share in a lot of places. I think what we want to do in an environment like this is make sure we continue to stay focused, first and foremost, on the customer. When you are taking a lot of costs out, it's easy to get focused internally. So much of what we are trying to do with our sales and marketing teams is make sure we still have that external orientation. Much of what we have implemented around our I2E or Ideas to Execution initiative the last several years has been geared toward being more effective in the marketplace with our sales force, with our marketing messages and the like.</p>
          <p>And when, we are at a point where we are in several businesses where our R&amp;D investments over the last several years are delivering new products. You see that at Tek, you see that at Videojet, Sybron has got a number of nice offerings right now. Those two come together and give us the ability play some offense. We talked a little bit in New York as well around our dynamic resource allocation approach to funding. I think the key in this environment is to be tight on costs, but not at the expense of the growth drivers in the business. So we really do all we can to protect the short-term investments around sales and marketing, the longer-term investments around R&amp;D and go get the costs out elsewhere. And it's maybe a little bit of a long winded answer, I apologize, but diving back to the mindset, that's the approach, the DBS approach, to taking share in '09 that we are going to work in all of our businesses this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And finally, do you anticipate any, given all the restructuring, any meaningful management changes in '09?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we just announced, as you saw a few weeks ago, a handful of group executive promotions, which we were excited about, a number of people who have grown up in the business taking on additional responsibilities and being so recognized. But no, we've got a heck of a team here and we want to make sure this team stays together and does what we know we can do to outperform in '09.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And due to time constraints, we'll take our last question from Richard Eastman with Robert Baird.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just, good morning Larry, Dan, Andy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just two questions; one is on the Water business. Larry, you bundled that into kind of the Med Tech group in terms of an ability to show growth this year in '09. Could you just quickly walk through HACH-LANGE, Trojan, is the backlog still there? What gives you the confidence here that that business will grow?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that you are right, Rick. When we talk about perhaps the most resilient parts of the portfolio, we certainly look just to the fourth quarter and we see Radiometer doing what we thought it would do, certainly Leica as well, Sybron, so most of Med Tech. I think Water has many of the same structural characteristics. That's held in well. And then those businesses are about 4 billion; there is probably another billion of Consumables, at Videojet aftermarket businesses. So we have about five of the 12 that you would lump together having that sort of resiliency.</p>
          <p>I think as we look at HACH-LANGE, whether it's the regulatory issues, whether it's the optimization and efficiency initiatives that many of our customers are pursuing, the emerging market trends, all of that kind of comes together and gives us the view that that business will do better than most of the portfolio in '09. And I think with what the president has proposed over the weekend with respect to waste water and drinking water funding, if that comes about, clearly both HACH-LANGE and Trojan should be well positioned.</p>
          <p>Trojan's certainly well positioned from a backlog perspective. We came into '08 with record backlog. We've come here into January with a better level of backlog for '09. So I think we're bullish about that. And ChemTreat has continued to hold up well, continues to take share. So a lot of good things going on in Water right now. But we all know the type of environment we're dealing with, there are very few certainties. But I think those businesses, in part led by Water, should lead the way for us this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just last, from a macroeconomic context and maybe top down, when you look out into '09, are you expecting a recovery in the second half globally, or is our, I know we're talking about down 2 to 6%. But does it graduate up? Do we end the year at flat to slightly up? Does it take that type of macro perspective or are we pretty much assuming the economy stays down and flat?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rick, I think the framework that we are offering here is really rooted on the comps getting easier for us in the second half, at a minimum. Clearly, you have a lot of government activity around the world trying to stop the hemorrhaging. At some point, that has to take effect. And as we mentioned in answering your first question, there are some things within our control. So it's really that framework that we offer up here as a way to think about 2009. But we are going to make sure that we continue to stay tight on costs given the uncertainties. We are going to work to protect our downside so that we can outperform this year come what may.</p>
