          <p>Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2007 Praxair, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Amanda and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question and answer session towards the end of today's conference. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I'd now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. James Sawyer, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed sir.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Amanda, and good morning to all of you out there and thanks for attending the earnings call and webcast. Pat Clark, Vice President and Controller; and Liz Hirsch, Director of Investor Relations, are with me.</p>
          <p>I'll begin by giving an overview of our 2007 results, Liz will then review the fourth quarter, and afterward I will discuss our business outlook and earnings guidance for 2008, and then we will be available to answer questions.</p>
          <p>Today's presentation materials are available on our website at www.praxair.com in the Investors section. Please read the forward-looking statement disclosure on page 2 and note that it applies to all statements made during this teleconference.</p>
          <p>Turn to page 3 for a full year summary. Praxair had another year of outstanding results, reported record sales, earnings, and cash flow. Sales have reached 9.4 billion, 13% above 2006. Sales growth came primarily from volume growth and higher pricing. In addition, several core business acquisitions we made during the year contributed 2% to sales growth and we also had positive currency impact.</p>
          <p>We grew our operating profit 18% to 1.8 billion. The faster growth in operating profit as compared to growth in sales came primarily from a 60 basis point increase in gross margin. We continue to drive this margin up through our focus on higher pricing and good cost control. Productivity programs and a tight rein on SG&amp;A expenses also contributed to the overall improvement in operating margin to 19% for the year.</p>
          <p>Full year net income was 1.2 billion, 19% above net income in 2006. Earnings per share were 3.62, grew 21% versus the prior year, again demonstrating our ability to grow earnings faster than sales.</p>
          <p>Our higher earnings combined with our capital investment discipline resulted in an improvement in our after-tax return on capital from 14.6% to 15.3% for the year.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 4 to look at the summary of our full cash flow. We generated over 1.9 billion of operating cash flow which was a 206 million increase from last year. This was a result of net income growth and a tight control of working capital. Capital expenditures were just under 1.4 billion for the year and this was about 300 million above our CapEx spending in 2006. This primarily supported the record number of growth projects that we are building to supply customers under contract.</p>
          <p>Our current backlog of 42 large projects is at a record level. Consequently we expect a similar level of spending in 2008, but our investment discipline remains rigorous and we are not lowering returns for the sake of topline growth.</p>
          <p>We spent $437 million in acquisitions in 2007. About half of this was to buy two core industrial gas businesses. First, we purchased Linde's gas business in Mexico. Mexico's economy is growing rapidly and we have a strong business in the country. And the acquisition allowed us to add a high-quality core business with strong growth prospects combined with significant synergies, and the results have exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we also closed a joint venture in Scandinavia with Yara International's industrial gas business. This is an exciting opportunity to add to our European presence by entering a growing market with significant opportunities in the energy sector and to bring new customer applications as well as our best practices and distribution logistics.</p>
          <p>Finally, we acquired a number of U.S. packaged gas distributors, where the integration of their own business offered synergies and an extension of our national footprint. In general, we continue to be very selective about acquisitions and highly disciplined in terms of risk and return.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we purchased $636 million of stock, net of issuances. 545 million of this occurred in the third and fourth quarters under the $1 billion stock buyback program which we announced in July. So we've completed more than half that program in the first six months while funding a record level of capital spending in acquisitions.</p>
          <p>Our strong cash flow generation comes from our high and increasing return on capital. We also paid out 281 million in dividends. As we announced this morning we are increasing our dividend by 25% in the first quarter of 2008. This is a strong indication of the confidence we have in our ability to continue to grow our cash flow while funding a significant growing opportunities in our business. We will continue to balance dividend increases and share buybacks as part of our financial strategy.</p>
          <p>Liz will now review our fourth-quarter results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jim, and good morning. Please turn to page five. We ended the year with a very strong fourth quarter. Sales grew 19% to $2.5 billion. 7% of this growth came from currency appreciation, but underlying organic growth was a solid 9% from both higher volumes and prices. We had higher volumes in all geographies with the strongest growth in Asia and South America.</p>
          <p>By end-market, highest sales growth was in energy and manufacturing followed by chemicals and electronics.</p>
          <p>Underlying business conditions were strong during the quarter in most locations and markets, but we are beginning to see the effects of a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing activity in our U.S.-based business volumes.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased 23% to $484 million. The higher profit came from volume growth and higher price and productivity savings, which exceeded cost inflation. Net income of $316 million increased 17% but would have grown 23% had we not had a one-time lower tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2006. Earnings per share of $0.98 grew 20% but would have grown 26% excluding the different tax rates.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from operations was 587 million, which primarily funded capital expenditures of 402 million and the Yara joint venture, which closed in late November. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 43.4% and after-tax return on capital for the quarter was a record 15.7%, due to our strong earnings growth.</p>
          <p>Now I will review our results for the quarter in North America which are summarized on pages six, seven and eight. Sales in North America were 1.38 billion, 17% above the prior-year quarter. The acquisitions of Linde Mexico and packaged gas distributors contributed 6% to the quarter's sales growth.</p>
          <p>Underlying organic growth of 8% versus the prior-year quarter was driven primarily by higher sales to energy and general manufacturing markets. Higher sales to the energy sector came from strong growth in hydrogen volumes to refiners and in nitrogen and carbon dioxide sales to the oil well service market in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.</p>
          <p>Sales to the manufacturing sector, excluding currency and acquisitions grew 5% in the quarter, which is slower than what we saw earlier in the year and last year. We are seeing signs of a sequential slowdown in this end market in the U.S.</p>
          <p>On-site sales were 17% above the prior year period driven primarily by hydrogen sales. Our refining customers are running well and taking increasing amounts of product and we expect this growth to continue. Pipeline oxygen sales were strong and also above prior year.</p>
          <p>Merchant liquid sales grew 15% year-over-year from strong pricing trends and moderate volume growth. Production capacity remains tight in many locations and demand is particularly strong for argon, rare gases and specialty gases. Helium is in short supply and global demand for the product is growing for solar, flat-panel, and healthcare applications. Overall, new business activity is coming from applications in food, oil and gas, metals and mining markets.</p>
          <p>Packaged gases' sales in North America grew 20% versus 2006. Acquisitions contributed 13% of this growth.</p>
          <p>In PDI, our U.S. and Canadian business, same-store sales growth was 5% in the quarter versus prior year. Gases volumes are steady on a year-over-year and sequential basis, but sales of hard goods in the U.S. are softening in line with slower manufacturing growth. Mexico had another strong quarter with sales up 27% versus 2006. Operating profit grew 26% to 255 million from volume growth and higher pricing and we leveraged this further with cost savings from productivity program.</p>
          <p>Please turn to page 9 to review our business in Europe this quarter. Sales in Europe were 354 million, grew 16% versus prior year. Underlying growth ex-currency effects was 4%. On-site merchant and packaged gas sales showed moderate growth in Spain, Italy and Germany versus prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>We are successfully signing new merchant contracts, as we migrate energy and environmental applications into many end markets. We closed our joint venture in Scandinavia with Yara Industrial Gases in November. This business had sales last year of about $180 million. We purchased the 50% interest in the company and so the revenues will not be consolidated into our financial statements, but our share of the ventures income will be included in equity income and should be accretive to our earnings next year. We expect to grow the business from new on-site opportunities in the region and by bringing our focus on operating efficiencies. Overall operating profit in the quarter grew 18% from the prior year to $86 million, increasing our margin to 24.3%.</p>
          <p>Page 10 summarizes our results in South America. South American segment sales grew 26% to $444 million with currency appreciation representing 17%.</p>
          <p>The economy in Brazil is stable. Exports remain strong and domestic growth continues to improve. 2007 industrial production in Brazil through November was a solid 6%. Underlying growth in our gases business was 15% this quarter. Merchant and packaged gases sales grew 13% and 18% respectively. On-site sales growth was moderated a bit by temporary customer outages.</p>
          <p>We have rationalized some of the non-GAAP business portfolio and divested a few small businesses. In addition, this quarter our sales of automobile compressed natural gas conversion equipment were lower than prior year. These sales fluctuate depending on the relative level of energy prices set locally by the governments and are not an indication of the strength of the industrial economy.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew to $85 million in line with sales growth and included some ongoing restructuring costs in the quarter. We started up several projects in Brazil, which will add revenue growth next year and we have won a number of new projects which are in our backlog. As many of you know, we are planning an investor meeting in Brazil in March in which we will highlight in more detail our strong business in the region and the numerous growth opportunities that we are pursuing.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 11 for our results in Asia. Sales in Asia were up 24% compared to last year, primarily from strong volume growth. On-site and merchant liquid sales grew to customers in China, India and Korea. Demand in the region for helium, rare gases and specialty gases is growing. New business opportunities continue to be robust in China and India. We are actively working on a large number of proposals for GAAP supply to electronics, steel and manufacturing facilities.</p>
          <p>We are expecting that growth will slow in the Beijing area this summer during the Olympic Games when businesses in certain locations must shut down temporarily. But more than offsetting this will be the growth we expect from eight new projects planned to start off in the region in 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased to $34 million. The level of operating margin in Asia is well below its long-term potential because we are staffed to execute more and more projects and to operate the business that are much larger sized than it is now.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 12 for Surface Technologies result. PST's results continue to be strong. In the fourth quarter, sales were $134 million versus 115 million in the prior year. Underlying sales growth was 11% excluding currency appreciation. Demand for airplane engine coatings and industrial gas turbine continues to increase.</p>
          <p>In December we started up a new EBPVD coater in Indianapolis to meet GE's needs for more parts and more coatings per part for their next-generation aircraft engines. This will increase our coating production capacity by about 20%, all under contract, and will support revenue and earnings growth beyond 2008. PST will also be adding capacity to coat oil well service parts for FMC in India. This plant will start up towards the end of 2008.</p>
          <p>Operating profit grew 50% to $24 million from volume growth, higher prices and the benefits from productivity initiatives. The business' operating margin percentage increased 400 basis points from the margin in the fourth quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>Now I will turn this call back to Jim who is going to discuss our end market trends, our outlook for 2008 and our earnings guidance.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Liz. And please turn to page 13, which shows our year-over-year sales growth for the primary end markets. And I think as you know, we can slice and dice our numbers by region, by country, by end market and also slice and dice them by product line, that would give you tonnage gases versus merchant gases and so forth. But I think the end market is useful for most people.</p>
          <p>And sales in the energy sector continue to be strong and were up close to 30% in both fourth quarter and the full year. This year the growth came from our North American hydrogen and oil well services business. We expect that energy markets will continue to be a major source of growth for the foreseeable future. High oil and gas prices, environmental regulations combined with strong demand from fast growing emerging markets will continue to fuel the growth. We anticipate significant growth in our global hydrogen, enhanced oil recovery and oil and gas well fraccing business.</p>
          <p>Gasification projects for cheaper chemical feedstocks, and further out for power, require large oxygen supply systems. In addition to the large onsite projects I am referencing, combustion efficiency applications will continue to drive growth in merchant gases.</p>
          <p>Global electronics had a strong year and fourth quarter. Our sales in Asia outpaced other geographic regions as this is where semiconductor and flat panel display manufacturers are building new production capacity with new technologies. As we look into 2008, we do expect to see a slowdown in wafer production, which would reduce demand for our consumables.</p>
          <p>We continue to rationalize pieces of our portfolio and focus on opportunities for onsite supply, so that process gases and material science consumables, where we have unique technology.</p>
          <p>We are also rapidly entering the sales of gases and deposition equipment for the solar cell manufacturing industry with several important contracts signed in 2007. Sales for the metal sector were up 16% in the quarter and 8% on average for the year. The relative strength in the quarter was because U.S. steel production was weak in the fourth quarter of 2006 and therefore the comparable was different. But the overall trend rate is up about 8% a year. Less than 40% of our global sales for the sector are the U.S. producers. Growth is coming from Brazil, China and India, countries that are advantaged in terms of input cost and raw materials. These industries are large oxygen users and we have strong market positions in each of these countries, which bodes well for new business opportunities.</p>
          <p>Manufacturing was one of our strongest markets in 2007 with growth of 19%, but excluding acquisitions it would have been 12%. For the fourth quarter sales were up 28% and 16% less the acquisitions. This market includes a diverse set of customers and industries including glass, cement, construction and metal fabrication, and growth in the last several years has been driven by nonresidential construction and infrastructure building out in emerging economies including transportation and capital goods manufacturers. We sell onsite merchant and packaged gases into this broad segment and so far we have been largely insulated from the slowdown in housing, but as the economic condition slows other places, we could be impacted.</p>
          <p>As some of you have noticed in December, U.S. industrial production was flat, although some industries were positive and some negative. In Canada, with industrial production slowing steadily through 2007, we've seen our base business volume growth slowing as well although our total volumes are still a lot higher due to our new applications technologies and exposures to segments of the market which are still growing.</p>
          <p>Global healthcare has showed solid growth in 2007, up 9% year-over-year. Our global business reached 1 billion in 2007 about 50% of which is in North America. Our businesses outside of the U.S. are all growing nicely. Our U.S. hospital business is growing very well from new technologies and services and a expanding list of hospital networks as customers.</p>
          <p>The growth and profitability of our $300 million U.S. homecare business continues to be problematic due to ongoing reimbursement rate reductions by Medicare, which impact about 40% of our revenues in the business. We continue to reduce our cost structure to offset the price declines.</p>
          <p>Sales to aerospace sector are primarily from our PST business, which is very strong due to jet engine builds and new coatings in the hot section. We're also a large supplier of gases, including liquid hydrogen to NASA and generally for aviation. Food and beverage market continues to be highly resilient and non-cyclical and we're growing the business every year through new applications.</p>
          <p>Page 14 gives you some detail on our planned capital investment in 2008. We expect our capital spending in 2008 to be about 1.4 billion on par with our spend in 2007. 20% of this amount or about 250 to 300 million is for maintenance CapEx in our base business. We'll spend another 65 to 75 million on cost reduction projects. These projects are projects where we will, for example, replace compressors or turbines in an existing plant to improve energy efficiency. We typically look for a three-year payback on these investments.</p>
          <p>A major portion of our capital spending will be for new production plants, which are supported by contracts with customers. Most of this capital is for new on-site air separation plants backed by 15-year take or pay contracts with our customers. In addition, we've announced a few projects where we are adding production capacity to existing plants in select regions where customer demand is strong and the market is very tight. In these cases, we know where the incremental product will be sold and we also reap the cost reduction benefits by eliminating in many cases premium distribution costs, which we incur if we have to truck product long distance to keep a local market supplied.</p>
          <p>As you can see from the pie charts on this page, just over half of the capital will go into projects we're building in North America. The largest projects are energy related, including hydrogen plants for refiners, such as the large hydrogen plant in Northern California for Chevron's Richmond Refinery, which we are building and which is scheduled to start up in 2009. The second largest region for investment is Asia. We're building a large number of projects in China, India, and Korea for customers in steel, copper, chemicals, refining and electronics. We'll also be investing in a number of growth projects all over South America. The region is growing rapidly and our strong market position enables us to be very competitive winning new projects.</p>
          <p>The end market chart shows the diversity of our customer base. Energy is still the largest growth market and the projects are mostly in North America. Going forward, we expect continued growth in this sector from hydrogen outside the U.S. and from EOR and gasification projects for chemical and refining feedstocks. The metals projects include oxygen supply system for steel and other commodities like copper, nickel, zinc, aluminum and so forth. And they are primarily located in South America and Asia. The diversity of our capital projects and our customer base is one factor that adds stability to revenue and earnings growth in our business.</p>
          <p>Now, please turn to slide 15 for our financial outlook and earnings guidance. As we look at 2008, we are quite positive on global business fundamentals, particularly in the sectors of the economy we serve like energy, mining, environmental protection, infrastructure replacement, food and healthcare. Outside the U.S. we expect continuously strong growth in South America, Mexico and Asia where the capital investment cycle is very strong. For the full-year of 2008, we expect year-over-year sales growth of 10 to 14%. If demand in our end markets continues to hold on par with 2007, we could reach the top of the range. On the other hand if we have the recession in the U.S. with flat GDP and negative industrial production we would likely end up towards the bottom of that range. This forecast also assumes the foreign currencies will be generally stable at the current rate of exchange.</p>
          <p>Expected earnings per share will be in the range of $4 to 4.20 which represents growth of 10% to 16% versus 2007. This guidance excludes a negative $0.03 impact that we expect in the first quarter related to a lump sum pension settlement for retired senior executives. Our earnings guidance assumes a slightly higher tax rate in 2008 in the range of 26 to 28%. For the first quarter of 2008, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.93 to $0.99, again excluding the $0.03 pension settlement charge. This represents 15 to 19% growth versus the first quarter of 2007. EPS is slower in the fourth quarter as the first quarter is typically slower due to holiday's seasonal beverage demand and slowdown in winter construction and large customer plant turnarounds in the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>Please look at page 16. Based on our outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 25% from $0.30 to $37.5 per share per quarter. This chart shows that in the last five years, we have increased our dividend on average by 26% per year, which is faster than our rate of earnings growth. This demonstrates that we have a lot of confidence in our ability to continue to generate cash flow in excess of our requirements to fund our significant growth to capital spending. This is the payback of running the business with a high return on capital.</p>
          <p>And as you can see on page 17, we have increased our after-tax return-on-capital by over 400 basis points in the last 10 years to 15.3%. And this has allowed us to grow our operating cash flow by an average of 10% per year over the same period. And you can see how the two charts track each other. But during this time, we have internally funded the significant increase in capital projects while simultaneously reducing our debt-to-capital ratio and buying back stock. These capital projects are adding strong profitable growth to our business, thereby augmenting our ability to generate more cash flow for shareholder value creation. We feel confident and we'll continue to deliver outstanding performance for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders in 2008 and beyond.</p>
          <p>And now I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim, the slowdown in the base business you referenced: when did that begin, and can you quantify the magnitude of that slowdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I am going to talk, I'm really talking very specifically about U.S. manufacturing, okay? And that would be the leading indicators for that, are really our PDI weekly sales, okay, and we measure the PDI weekly sales both in terms of gas sales, also in terms of hard goods sales and then even within the hard goods sector, we break it down between what we call capital hard good sales, which would be drill presses and welding equipment and laser cutting equipment on the one hand, to consumables sales.</p>
          <p>So as the cycle builds up what you typically see is that the capital sales in the hard goods grow the fastest &#x2013; the first, and then along comes the gases and along comes the consumables. But what we saw was that the growth in the capital goods orders really peaked about a year ago and the rate of growth has been slowing in that. So that to me is the leading indicator and that started over a year ago. The sales of gases still continues to grow nicely but not as fast as it was growing a year ago, and the same thing with the hard goods.</p>
          <p>Now let me just make one more point on that question, which I think makes it difficult in my mind for everybody to watch, you know, exactly what's going on in the economy. Because we have not seen anything that looks or feels or smells like anything that's going off of a cliff, unlike what you hear a lot of people talking about. One thing that we do see change from seasons just from year-to-year, is that December sales and volumes are always difficult to predict and they are difficult to report in 20:20 hindsight because a lot of factories take a week off during the Christmas holidays. And depending on when the holiday, when New Year lands or when Christmas lands, they may top off fewer or more days. What we found is that a lot of customers decided to take two-week shutdowns during the end of December, and that reduced our volumes during those months. And I suspect that it also reduced things like the industrial production index for December and so on and so forth. But I'd just like to reiterate that we, you know, we are just seeing -- it's kind of gradual slowdown in heavy manufacturing for about a year, but we haven't seen any inflection point.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Germany is growing very strongly. Growth in Spain is -- Spain used to be the country where we always had the fastest growth. Growth in Spain is moderating a little bit, but Germany is very strong.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of questions on behalf of Bob, and first of all, I have a question about this Asian margin, operating margin. We saw, you know, that margins obviously have declined year-over-year for three consecutive quarters. Can you please just give us some color on that, and then now what's your expectation for the Asian margins in 2008? And then if you have any long-term target, can you just discuss about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you got to look at and we look at our Asia business as a sort of a start-up business, which is going through a lot of growth. And for us, it's about a 600-million business on a reported basis, about $1 billion of some with combined sales and joint ventures. But we got it staffed up to be equivalent to a $1.5-billion business, which means that we've just got people already working there for where we think the business is going to be a couple of years down the road. And that's what I mean by looking at it as sort of a startup business where your current expense is ahead of getting revenue. But for example in Asia, our backlog right now is 12 projects; we started up one in the quarter; we had three new wins in the quarter; we've added over 200 engineers to Asia; we are building two specialty gas labs over there. And it's just a question of making permanent investments, which adds fixed costs and so forth, but as the projects come on stream, the average project will have an operating margin, well into the mid-20s. So as they come on stream, you will see the operating margin go up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got you. And then a second question related to the merchant pricing competition in Asia. We are continuing to hear about that strong merchant pricing competition in, particularly in China and India. I was wondering what Praxair's pricing strategy in those two countries and then also, were you able to hold your merchant margins in those two countries?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh yeah, absolutely. We are on -- merchant pricing has gotten a lot better. For a while there electricity price was going up and merchant pricing wasn't following that, but at this point in time, we are definitely holding the margins and getting price increases to pass on higher electricity cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, understood. And then lastly, I have a question on your steel exposure. If we are heading into an economic recession or a significant slowdown in the U.S. over the next two to three quarters, will you worry about your large exposure to the steel industry in the U.S., given that the U.S. steel industry has been economically a sensitive factor and is very important for Praxair's on-site business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well, and you see that from time to time and we have had times where they've closed for inventory management and two years ago we went through a couple of quarters of volume being off 20%, but it came right back again. At this point in time the U.S. steel manufacturers are very bullish for 2008 and that's really from a couple of reasons. The first one is that the inefficient producers in the U.S. really all shutdown about five-six years ago, so the ones that are left are world-scale efficient producers. Secondly, with the dollar where it is &#x2013; U.S. is normally about a 30% importer of steel &#x2013; with the dollar where it is and the other currencies where they are, those imports are not -- don't make sense anymore, and so there will be more U.S. steel production. And then lastly, we are really starting to see some exports of U.S. steel, particularly in the areas of stainless steel and drilling pipes, which really aren't available in many parts of the world. So we are pretty positive on it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning; nice quarter. Jim, when you take a look at your year-over-year sales growth for 2008, at 10 to 14%, how much of that is, I guess, to some degree insured from the backlog that is expected to come on stream this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, normally, and what we've said over the forecast, 5 to 6% is new projects on top of the base business, okay? And on top of that, we've got base business growth going on, and for sure we will have a couple of small acquisitions, so that kind of gets you at least to the 10% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that formula, if you will, in terms of the new project backlog, pretty sustainable for the next few years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. It's just the backlog just keeps getting bigger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and just a quick question on just a little, sort of, color on PDI. Are you expecting, you know, you certainly didn't see that much of a slowdown in same-store sales in the fourth quarter, it was up 5%, do you see that 5% slowing in the coming quarters and maybe you can give us a feel for, you know, of the 5% was it more volume, was it price, was it about even?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you want a comment on the 5%. It's probably about what I expect to be going on for the next, you know, for the next while. There is a little bit more price than volume in that number and I think there is more room for price going forward, significantly more room for price going forward. And then it depends on what end of the economy you are selling into and there is going to be, you know, the economy's going to be spotty in 2008, there are going to be some good sectors and some bad sectors and you know, healthcare, food, utility infrastruction, oil and gas, equipment, farm equipment, mining equipment and so forth are all going to be strong. On the other hand, probably chemicals, electronics, housing materials, autos and appliances will be weak. So you've just got to pay attention to the end market there. And then as you look across the geography, where are strong and weak, Mexico is very strong, Western Canada is very strong, Texas is very strong and the Pacific Northwest is very strong. But you start to see a little bit of weakness in Eastern Canada, in Ontario where there are a lot of auto parts shops and a little bit of weakness in the South Coast and the West Coast where those economies are probably going to be more impacted by the housing issues.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's a function of primarily private individuals who own businesses deciding that they don't want to own those businesses anymore and put them off for sale, and that's just sort of a continuous process that goes along.</p>

          <p>And on Asia again, I think on the last call you mentioned maybe over the next two to three year timeframe as some of these new projects come on line and you layer on revenue on your fixed costs that you are putting in today, that you expect margins to approach about 20%, are you still relatively confident on that target?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and secondly, Jim, you talked about your project backlog, 32 or 36 projects. I think you mentioned something like you've finished seven, you added eight, I mean can you talk about in dollar number, I mean, we don't know whether the new ones that are added are smaller than the old ones that you completed, are they bigger, can you just talk about a dollar number?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Which probably will give us a better idea?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You know, I prefer not to go into the dollars of the backlog because it's hard, when you look at the numbers that way, they spread across multiple years and it's hard for people to think them up with any particular year's capital spending number. So, it tends to get people more confused than it does help, but what I will point you to is the CapEx guidance that we gave, which is continuing to go up and that really just reflects the larger backlog.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, are these projects sort of similar in size?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They are getting larger. The average project size is definitely getting larger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and one last question on your PDI business in cylinders, you know, as economy slows down and you are seeing volumes come down there but you are making more acquisitions, is that the strategy, to consolidate the business while the market goes down?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you would think so, but most of the decisions by sellers are really lifestyle decisions and it's really when they decide they want to retire and not manage the business anymore. So, I think the valuation of the businesses would come down as growth came down, but not necessarily the number of businesses that come up for sale.</p>

        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Kevin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A broad question about the financial guidance that you issued for 2008 and it relates to operating leverage. If I look at 2007, you had sales growth of 13% that resulted in 21% EPS growth, it seems like you are forecasting a fairly similar sales growth rate for 2008, yet, resulting in only 13% EPS growth, if I look at the midpoint. Obviously, natural gas can wreak havoc a little bit with your top-line, but can you help me, Jim, understand some of the factors that might be causing somewhat less operating leverage and at least, implicit in, in the numbers here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, one of the factors is just a mix issue, and it has to do with the hydrogen business, because in the hydrogen business, you know, you'll invest a dollar of capital and get $2 of sales, but you'll get them at a relatively low operating margin percent, maybe 10 to 12% because your sales dollars of hydrogen are 80%, just pass through the natural gas cost, okay. So as hydrogen comes into your mix, it will lower your operating margin percentage, okay, relative to your sales. So, on the one hand, we got more hydrogen coming into the mix, which would tend to depress the operating percentage margin, but we are getting nice operating leverage out of the base business and so, you know, we feel very comfortable at sustaining and improving the operating margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's helpful. So if I look at your business on a product-by-product basis, you know, in an apples-to-apples fashion, it sounds like you would not be forecasting any margin compression, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely not. No, because we're, you know, and we point to the gross margin percentage, I think a lot of people don't look at that and a lot of people don't show that, but that's really your sales minus your variable costs and that's what you got to manage in the business to make sure that your energy cost goes up, so you are getting it back in sales and so we focus very hard on keeping that variable margin high and higher each year. And then at the same time, you know, what we are looking at 10 to 14% growth in the top line, you will be seeing fixed cost growth of 4 or 5%, SG&amp;A growth of 4 or 5% and so forth. So, when you get down to operating profits, you are going to get faster growth in operating profit than you will in sales.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Understood and then finally, if I look at your North American merchant sales growth of 15% in the quarter, what are the constituent contributions from, from volume and price there, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's, I don't have that directly in front of me, do you have that? I think it's about half and half. No, it can't be that, it's probably about 10% volume and 5% parts.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it sounds like merchant volumes are growing significantly faster than packaged gas volumes, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and that, some of that is related to fraccing business. The fourth quarter was a very strong fracing quarter and that's all merchant product. But let me just take this opportunity to give you some numbers on a different slice-and-dice direction, because you know, we can give them any way you want, but our competitors, you know, they are organized by global tonnage and global merchant and show numbers that way and we have our, those internally, but our global tonnage sales were up 13% versus 5% and on the other side and our global merchant sales were up 12% versus 8% on the other side. So, I think we are doing very well in the marketplace.</p>

So that's bringing a lot of equity income and then likewise, on the minority interest line, we've got minority shareholders of some of our businesses in China, as well as in Europe and as those businesses grow, you know, the minority number will grow as well.

          <p>Okay, just back to CapEx for a second, I mean, if you are suggesting 1.4 billion for 2008, does that reflect just what you know now or will that expand if you sign more contracts throughout the year because it's not really, it's not that much of an increase over 2007 just trying to figure out how to look at it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that really reflects the number of projects that we've got signed, sealed and delivered.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi Laurence.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess first question in terms of the projects you have in the backlog, does it seem reasonable that CapEx will probably move higher again in 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think so. But that really remains to be seen how many of the very, very large projects we sign up. If we sign up a lot of the large gasification 10,000-tons-per-day projects, then that would require CapEx to be going up in '09. But absent that, I think we're getting very good at managing our capital spend. I think most of you know that we have an extremely disciplined cost estimating process where we've locked in 80% of the cost of a project before we sign a contract with the customer. And we just keep getting more capital efficiencies by building a better plant for less money, and so I think we will probably be in the 1.4- to 1.5-billion range through the end of the decade.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of productivity which &#x2013; can you just discuss the backlog of initiatives and whether as if the &#x2013; if economic demand slows you have levers to pull to improve productivity in the back half of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Yeah, let me just talk about that. First of all, even though it's not raining here we've battoned down the hatches already and are holding our fixed costs flat from the fourth quarter into the first quarter in spite of a significant amount of sales growth, and we'll keep doing that as long as we don't see the economy growing. Now our total productivity number forecast &#x2013; our total productivity for '07 was $273 million, and I think the number in '08 will be just under $300 million, but the places &#x2013; and that's obviously we're doing &#x2013; we are stretching ourselves doing the most we can with that. So if you said, what can you do more, I would be doing more already. But the places where we do have discretion are in other places like building more specialty gas labs and stuff like that that we could put on hold if we really had to.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of the end-market outlooks as what gave your assessment of the trends, was that taking into account recent trends in January? And if not, can you briefly address what you have seen so far in January, particularly in the U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me explain January this way. Volumes in the first couple of weeks of January have been very strong. Some of that may be a bounceback from people being closed over the holidays. I don't have that number sliced and diced by end-market and won't get that slice and dice by end-market till the end of the month.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then lastly, in terms of the hit that you expect to see in Asia from Beijing, is it big enough to be noticeable in terms of a swing from '08 versus '09?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That project got delayed basically for two reasons. It's a two-train project and so one of them is up full; the other one is on its way up. And it is a very large plant. We had difficulty with the turbine supplier, installing turbine that when we started up the turbine had problems and that weeks and weeks to go back and get a new turbine there. And then the other delay we had was on &#x2013; there was a very large hurricane down in that area in August, September and so forth which didn't affect our plants, because our plant is built up above the flood level. But it basically flooded out where all the workers lived around there. And so we lost a couple of weeks there, just because of that, but we'll see it operating full steam in 2008.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically because as we grow the business each incremental dollar of earnings tends to be coming in at closer to the statutory tax rate and so the average would be going up. But it's still moving target and the best guidance we have is 26 to 28%, but it could be anywhere in that range.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>When you think about the resiliency of your backlog in terms of when you get paid and with some of the concerns about a potential even global recession. In the event that some of your customer either start to delay projects or even cancel them, when do you get paid? I know you don't intake or pay contracts for these. Is it when your end of the facility is basically built when you basically delivered on what you needed to or is it when they actually ramp up plants, can you give us a little bit color on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, and sometimes that's a little bit of a negotiation with the customer. But for the most part once our plant is up and running and meets the performance test, the facility fee starts getting paid. In some cases you have got customers who say well, I want the window to be three months or something like that in case my plant is late and that ends up being a negotiation with the customer. But for the most part we get paid when the plant starts up.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great, and then the second question would be on your homecare business in the healthcare area, it seems like it's continuing to see headwinds with regard to reimbursement rate cuts. Is there at least a decision on your part that may be coming where you may be getting rid of this business at some point or thinking about a way of rationalizing it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a good business, and we think we can weather through the storm on the reimbursement rate cuts. We're getting a good 8% margins in it. So we're sticking with it for now but if we could find a way to get some more scale, I think we can improve the margin of the business there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Could you just talk a little bit more about your PST business in terms of the major drivers '08 versus aftermarket and sort of leave-lag relative to the end markets you are participating in there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we're pretty much out of the aftermarket in PST. We sold the aftermarket business about a year ago. And that part of the business was just very poorly positioned strategically. So, on the aircraft engine side, which represents about 60% of the business, you know, we got very strong demand coming from all of the engine manufacturers, GE being our largest customer, but Pratt and Rolls as well. And that demand's really got a double trick to it, first one is the demand for engines is going up and the second one is that the new engines are run more fuel efficiently than the old engines and the way they do that is they run them hotter, and because they run them hotter they need more thermal barrier coatings in the engines, which means that I guess you would call it penetration into each engine is going up as well. So, that's very, very good news. Now on the other hand some of the end markets that we supply coatings to are not doing all that well which would be the textile industry and the printing industry and so they tend to be a little bit of a drag on the really with stellar results in the aircraft segment.</p>
