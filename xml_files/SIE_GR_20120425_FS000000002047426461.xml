          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome here in rainy London and welcome to the ones watching us per webcast. We will present to you our Q2 fiscal year 2012 numbers and outline to you the assumptions for the outlook for the remaining of this year, for fiscal year 2012.</p>
          <p>All documents, the earnings release, the presentation, the flash slide and all other documents are on the Internet, and you can download them as you wish. And the webcast will be replayed also on the Internet, Investor Relation of Siemens.</p>
          <p>I would like to refer to the Safe Harbor statement on slide number two of the presentation. And I would like to ask you to please switch off any BlackBerrys, mobile phones you might have. Also, as this is being webcast, I'd ask you to please clearly state your name before asking the question. We will have ample time for Q&amp;A after the speech of both Peter L&#xF6;scher, Siemens' CEO, and Joe K&#xE4;ser, Siemens' CFO.</p>
          <p>And with that, Peter, the word is yours.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mariel. Good afternoon also from my side to the second quarter analyst conference. It appears that we are last on a busy day, or you had a very exciting Champions League game and everybody is so exhausted.</p>
          <p>Let me summarize the key takeaways. In a nutshell, the performance in the second quarter was mixed, with positive developments particularly regarding revenue growth but also some disappointments in order intake and transmission. We have been putting a lot of emphasis to work on the transmission topics. And I will give you more background in a minute including the implications for the full-year guidance.</p>
          <p>The macroeconomic environment remains volatile, but the expected softening of growth rates has only materialized in selective regions like China or parts of Europe, while the U.S. and Germany have held up well.</p>
          <p>For Siemens, this resulted in a very robust development of our short-cycle businesses in industry, where we saw particularly strength in the U.S. business. We may see a slight shift of regional growth dynamics during the second half of 2012, but global GDP growth is still expected to be on a moderated level of around 2.8% for the full year.</p>
          <p>Overall, our order intake decreased significantly by 16%, mainly due to a much lower number of large orders in Energy and Transportation and Logistics. Due to this fact, our book-to-bill decreased to 0.93, but we see this only as a temporary development. Our backlog remains at a very healthy level of around &#x20AC;100 billion. We accelerated revenue growth to 7% across all sectors, driven by continued backlog conversion in Energy and above-average growth in emerging markets of 10%.</p>
          <p>Profitability was substantially burdened by further charges mainly for the German offshore grid connections in Power Transmission. As indicated, the fundamental restructuring of NSN weighted on our equity investments results. This led to a significant decrease of profit from total sectors by 48%. Major part of the difference was also the Areva disposal gain of more than &#x20AC;1.5 billion in the second quarter of last year. Together with the additional NSN effect, this led to a 67% decline in income from continuing operations. We saw some moderate improvement over the last year in our free cash flow, but net working capital stayed on a high level during Q2, and Joe will discuss this topic in more detail.</p>
          <p>From a strategic perspective, we continued our selective approach to do bolt-on acquisitions. For example, we strengthened our portfolio in Industrial Software through the acquisition of RuggedCom, a specialized Canadian company providing communications solutions for harsh environments, such as in electric utility substations, oil refineries and rail applications. In Oil &amp; Gas, we complemented our subsea power grid offering by taking over the Connectors and Measurement division of Expro Holdings.</p>
          <p>For records, here you just see as an overview of the key figures of the second quarter, which you have already received this morning. The regional perspective for orders and sales in the second quarter provides a mixed picture. The base business in Industry and Healthcare showed solid growth rates but we lacked large orders, particularly in Energy and also in the Rail business. For example, the decline in orders and revenue in China can be explained by missing business for rail equipment in China due to delays in investment decisions.</p>
          <p>In Energy, the comparables were particularly tough in Germany where we won three major orders for offshore wind parks a year ago. But also in emerging markets like the Middle East where we booked a major Combined Cycle power plant order in Saudi Arabia in Q2 of last year.</p>
          <p>The U.S. showed strength both in orders and revenue in a better-than-anticipated economic environment. Our sales growth was very broad based with particular strength in emerging markets, such as in India with remarkable 48% growth or Brazil achieving 18% increase. For the second quarter, this resulted in a further shift of our revenue distribution towards emerging markets with a share of 31%b up one percentage point over the second quarter of fiscal 2011.</p>
          <p>What were the key developments in each of the sectors? First, sector Energy. As already mentioned, orders in Energy went down substantially by 36% due to a broad-based decline of large projects in all divisions. The Energy market remains highly competitive but our sales funnel for the coming quarters looks promising. And we expect a book-to-bill ratio above one for the full year.</p>
          <p>Intentionally, we were more selective on orders and walked away from low-margin businesses. The sector's backlog was at a healthy &#x20AC;56 billion at the end of the quarter. A major highlight in Q2 was the order for the 834 megawatt Combined Cycle power plant in Ansan in South Korea where we will deliver, among other equipment, two world-leading H-class turbines to Posco.</p>
          <p>Second quarter revenue rose by 10% on the conversion from Energy's strong order backlog with substantial growth in Asia, Australia, and a sharp increase of 42% in the renewal business. I want to point out that besides the challenges in Transmission, the sector Energy delivered a very solid quarter regarding profit and once again proved that our position as the only integrated energy company is fully intact.</p>
          <p>Fossil delivered 17.5% profit margin and continued its excellent project execution in the solution business, also achieved a strong earnings contribution from the service business. We were very pleased to see Renewable Energy rebounding from the weak Q1 and also taking up profitability sharply to 8.2%, which was basically volume and top-line-driven.</p>
          <p>Our clear number one position in Offshore Wind gives us a competitive advantage since we achieved a healthy revenue mix of around one-third of Offshore and two-thirds on Onshore businesses in the first half of fiscal 2012. We are working hard to maintain the lead in Offshore Wind and stay competitive in Onshore to be successful in the expected difficult market conditions ahead. Besides ongoing pricing pressure and expected industry consolidation, this is mainly caused by the uncertainty over the extension of the U.S. tax benefit scheme beyond 2012.</p>
          <p>Power Transmission reported a significant loss of &#x20AC;169 million in the second quarter, major factors were additional charges of &#x20AC;278 million we had to take, mostly related to the grid connections to Offshore Wind farm projects in Germany.</p>
          <p>Let me give you give you some background about the situation in Power Transmission. I will touch on the project challenges in Germany as well as how we address the structural margin erosion the entire industry faces in important parts of this business.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we conducted a very detailed and thorough review of all of our offshore grid connection projects in the North Sea. As a consequence, we had to rework our installation schedule for BorWin2 and HelWin1 platform, whose installation dates are anticipated to be delayed to 2013.</p>
          <p>We will apply the experience gained from the initial projects to improve and accelerate the installation processes of the following two platforms but anticipate also a delay for the SylWin1 platform. And we are working very closely together with our customer, TenneT, to ensure that the commissioning dates are delayed as little as possible. Main reasons for this unsatisfactory development are: firstly, that we underestimated the execution challenges and the complexity of these projects.</p>
          <p>I don't want to sound like providing an excuse, but this kind of offshore grid installations have not been done before. An 800-megawatt platform has a weight of up to 19,000 tons in around 70 meters water depth and 100 kilometers off the coast. The timeslot for installation work is restricted to the period from May to September because of weather conditions. And for all this &#x2013; those reasons, it's also much more complex compared to existing AC offshore platforms we have successfully installed already in the U.K.</p>
          <p>Secondly, the required authorization and documentation processes turned out to be more complex since they are in part unclear and not yet harmonized. And thirdly it became clear that our resources have not been sufficient to execute multiple projects in a very time &#x2013; timely time schedule.</p>
          <p>For mainly these reasons, we booked additional charges of &#x20AC;78 million at Transmission in the second quarter to cover for the expected extension of project durations. The additional resources and requirement and required material and liquidated damages as consortium leader.</p>
          <p>It is fair to say that we now have a better understanding of the situation and have put a lot of effort into measures to mitigate and to contain the risks. One example is the set-up of a joint working groups with the authorities, with the grid operators and our peers to work on the standardization of the regulatory environment and the approval processes. In addition, we have massively ramped up our resources in the offshore grid competence center in Hamburg. We feel we get this major mistake step-by-step under control and can learn from these experiences for future tenders and future projects.</p>
          <p>Are we completely through with charges on these topics? I cannot rule out entirely that we will see some more impact in coming quarters, but this certainly should be more limited. One thing is clear; HVDC is a very promising technology and a very promising growth market for us where we expect globally around 250 gigawatts of new installations in the current decade. For comparison, the globally installed base has been 100 gigawatts so far.</p>
          <p>In particular, in Europe, there will be a number of further tenders of offshore wind grid connections and other HVDC projects similar to the recently awarded Western Link between England and Scotland. We want our fair share in this attractive market but with a clear focus on risk control and profitability. If a project does not meet these standards, we will have the discipline to walk away.</p>
          <p>Now, I want to come back to the structural challenges in parts of the Transmission business. As we all know, the margins in the transmission market have suffered across the industry in recent quarters, particularly the high voltage substations and transformers area due to aggressive Asian competition from China and Korea. Furthermore, there are significant overcapacities, particularly in the transformers area. And for these reasons, we have taken initial steps to improve competitiveness in Transmission.</p>
          <p>First, as a clear sign of accountability, we decided to change the leadership of the division. Yesterday, we announced that Karlheinz Springer will take over the divisional CEO role with immediate effect. He is a very experienced manager who was previously responsible for the excellent development of Instrumentation &amp; Electrical business unit in the Fossil division. He has experience in project management and project execution and will be of great help in this regard.</p>
          <p>Second, Transmissions, the organization, we changed it. We streamlined it from four business units into three. We have created two product business units, clearly focusing around substations and transformers. And then we have combined a third one into the solution division. So, there will be a combined effort across different product areas in this division really focusing on the solutions. And therefore, we have also bundled all the relevant project management.</p>
          <p>And third, the new leadership team will work out a comprehensive structure concept to sustainably improve competitiveness in the months to come. So, Karlheinz has, I think, the opportunity within the next 100 days, together with his new team to work closely and to identify for us exactly which type of measures has to be taken, what should be done and how do we move forward.</p>
          <p>Let me move on Healthcare. Healthcare delivered a strong operational performance and was diligently executing on Agenda 2013 to improve competitiveness and drive innovation. Order growth was 1%, mainly driven from double-digit growth in Asia, Australia while the Americas were below last year due to some weakness in equipment orders in U.S.</p>
          <p>Revenue growth improved to 5%, with China showing, again, substantial double-digit increases also, and also strength in Americas. Healthcare's well on-track to execute the Agenda 2013 as outlined during the recent Capital Market Day. We recorded charges of &#x20AC;38 million to reposition radiation therapy and improve the cost position of Diagnostics. And we expect further charges for the program in coming quarters amounting to around &#x20AC;200 million in total for the fiscal 2012, as guided during the Capital Market Day.</p>
          <p>We continue to launch new competitive mid-range product innovations, so-called SMART products. And a few weeks ago, we launched the MAGNETOM Spectra, a 3-Tesla-MR system for broad-based clinical use. And it's another product where we fully leverage our globally optimized R&amp;D and manufacturing set-up while product ownership lies in China.</p>
          <p>Diagnostics contributed to the overall Healthcare performance with 3% revenue growth, driven also by strength in Asia. As expected, the underlying margins saw a decline due to a less favorable business mix. And I think this was also already explained during the Healthcare Capital Market Day. Industry showed a very strong performance in a robust business environment. Revenue in the sector was up 8% year-over-year, while orders went down slightly by 1% due to a soft development in Asia. Main revenue driver was a strong increase in the U.S. and healthy growth in Europe, particularly driven by the export-driven German machine builders benefiting the motion control business and the strong automotive industry.</p>
          <p>Profitability in Industry Automation improved 20 basis points due to revenue growth related margin drop, through which overcompensated for increased selling expenses and footprint expansion. Industry Automation continues to strengthen its software business and has launched, besides the already closed RuggedCom acquisition, a successful takeover bid for German quality management software company, IBS. As indicated in Q1, Drive Technology returned to double-digit profitability with 11.5% due to the successful OpEx management over the last quarter.</p>
          <p>And finally, I want to briefly highlight the key developments in the sector Infrastructure &amp; Cities. Order volume for the sector declined by 8% due to fewer large rolling stock orders. Nevertheless, Rail Systems was again able to win a contract for 20 Desiro regional trains in the U.K. for the customer London Midland for around &#x20AC;170 million.</p>
          <p>Profit in Transportation &amp; Logistics division achieved 5.3%, 110 basis points below the prior year level, due to lower revenue and some impact from lower margins in long-term contracts. The Power Grid Solutions &amp; Products division saw a nice improvement in profitability to 6.1%, due to improved revenue growth and drop-through in the low- and medium-voltage business.</p>
          <p>Building Technologies profit margin decreased slightly to 5.3% despite revenue growth of 7%, driven by strong U.S. business. It was held back partially by higher expenses for growth initiatives.</p>
          <p>After six months into the fiscal year, I want to briefly update you also on the performance in our One Siemens operational framework. Our growth rate of 4.5% is 4.7 percentage points below the 9.2% reported by our peers. And one reason and the major reason is obviously that we have clearly more focus on organic growth versus the acquisition effects by our major competitors. But also on the organic side, we are slightly growing slower than our competitors.</p>
          <p>Over the last quarters, we have taken significant investments in growth, be it sales force or additional research and development. And it's our goal to reap the benefits from these investments in the quarters to come and, at the same time, limit the OpEx increase for the second half of 2012. And also going into 2013, there is a clear focus on productivity, cost control and ensuring that we have set the base for our future growth initiatives and reaping the benefits of it going into the rest of the year and into 2013.</p>
          <p>After six months, Industry and Healthcare are well within the targeted EBITDA ranges, while Infrastructure &amp; Cities is catching up with a lower &#x2013; from the lower target range, and Energy is also just shy from the range at 9%, strongly impacted by the Transmission challenges which I've just highlighted. Despite the abovementioned headwinds, we still delivered on our ambition of capital efficiency by achieving return of capital employed of 16.4%. Our capital structure ratio is &#x2013; with 0.3, still below our target of 0.5 to 1 for adjusted net debt over EBITDA, although the dividend payment in Q1 and the weaker cash flow development during the first six months brought us closer to the target range.</p>
          <p>And with that, let me now turn over to Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Hi, everyone. Very warm welcome also from my side. What I will do now in the next three or four slides is to take you through our cash flow development and move on to the debt, for which I'll give some input on top line gross margin pricing and OpEx development. And then, obviously, finally, last but not least, try to shed some light into the so-called below-the-line items of our company's P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>If we take a look on the free cash flow development, you should see here as a green line, then I guess there are a couple of things I want to mention. First of all, in the first six months, we have significantly increased our inventories by &#x20AC;1.5 billion, and also accounts receivables by almost &#x20AC;600 million in order also to reflect the continued revenue growth and expected growth also in revenues for the second half. And there has been a material decline on the prepayments including the biddings in excess, and that amounts to &#x20AC;700 million for the first half of fiscal 2012. And the ones who have been following us for a longer period of time already know and remember that it's been consistently mentioned in that item that there is some behavioral change if it comes to bigger, or especially from the public sector as far as prepayments are concerned.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously looking into the second half of the year, what one could expect from free cash flow is that we assume that we will follow the trend as the second half usually is stronger than the first half. And if, I guess, we assume to move along the purple line of the free cash flow developments, I would expect that to be shy of the purple line for 2012.</p>
          <p>Again, we have delivered very, very strong fee cash flow in 2010 and 2011 when bookings have been growing and so obviously did prepayments at that time. Now, those projects are being called to notice and we need to ramp up our working capital in order to also fulfill and make good on those projects.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, this has a cumulative catch-up. So, over time, that will normalize. But for 2012, and likely the first half of 2013, we continue to expect a somewhat weak free cash flow due to that development. In general, as far as cash outflow is concerned, please also remember that we still expect some cash outflow from accruals taken during the course of the SIS transaction which we reserved for in 2011.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look at the net debt bridge, obviously, net debt has increased from &#x20AC;8 billion total net debt in Q1 to &#x20AC;10.6 billion. If you look into the mostly operating activities, you can see that the income development and improvement obviously has contributed by &#x20AC;2.4 billion. And the increase in inventories, as mentioned, but also with the dividend have contributed to the increase in net debt. We do expect net debt to, without any major other topics such as M&amp;A and the like, to be brought back to levels which we have seen in Q1.</p>
          <p>Now that shortly for this one, let me now spend some more time on the topic of what we expect in the top-line, in pricing, and the like going forward. If we look at the chart, which you might remember from our last presentation in November 2011, when we talked about what we expect for 2012 going forward, as far as customer price change is concerned within the P&amp;L environment and in the revenues, we kind of expect a level between 2.6%, 2.8% on average. So that comes in as expected in the P&amp;L on the revenues.</p>
          <p>So, the pressure, what we have been seeing quite for a long time, is more on the booking side. And that one predominantly in large projects or infrastructure and power such as substations, as well as in commodity like of products, but first and foremost, in the environment of distribution transformers. And that definitely has become a commodity, latest due to the fact that a lot of Chinese players have used the so-called financial and economic crisis to boost their strengths in 2009 and 2010, and you see that now to come to market.</p>
          <p>Now, on the gross margin for 2012, in the first half, you've seen that's been having a gross margin of 28.6%, and obviously, also negatively affected by the fact that we had to book those charges in Transmission, due to cost of goods sold. For the second half, one can expect some ease of gross margins will be stable, maybe a few ticks up mostly in Energy, in parts also in Industry, and we expect Healthcare and IC, Infrastructures &amp; Cities, to just be about flat as far as gross margin is concerned. So, we do continue to offset the pricing pressure in the revenue environment by productivity and innovation in our factories and to go to &#x2013; and the logistics all along. So, as far as the underlying gross margin is concerned, we do expect, as I've said, to maintain the levels in the second half of fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Revenues will obviously also grow over the first half of our fiscal year, half year-over-half year, but obviously, we do expect that growth dynamics if we compare first half and second half of the year to slow down in the year-over-year comparison.</p>
          <p>In the OpEx environment, Peter has mentioned that already. We've invested a lot of resources into the go-to-market to strengthen our regional footprint, as well as engineering for second-wave emerging markets. It's been &#x20AC;1.2 billion in 2011. It's been a significant amount of money now in 2012, in the first half. And we expect now that investment to deliver in the second half but predominantly also in 2013. So, what the market can expect is that there will be some OpEx increase in 2012, which is just about below the corridor of &#x20AC;1.1 billion to &#x20AC;1.3 billion. And that's what we are targeting for 2012. We also will make sure that there is quite a focus on OpEx as far as productivity is concerned during the budget season for 2013.</p>
          <p>On the CapEx, you can also see that it's been investing about &#x20AC;2 billion in &#x2013; or expected to be invest about &#x20AC;2 billion. We'll maintain that level, and that level will be on the lower end of the corridor. Maybe just a bit high of the &#x20AC;1.9 billion which we have been setting as a lower target for CapEx.</p>
          <p>Now, that brings me to the item on &#x2013; below the sectors. If we take a look on our fiscal Q2 below the sector line, you can see a few matters, obviously, the huge charge we have been taking on our NSN equity investment. NSN had &#x2013; besides some weakness in the operational environment, also took significant restructuring charges of about &#x20AC;770 million, about &#x20AC;500 million of that being Germany. So, the good news on that is NSN was able to finish the negotiations quicker on the agreement with the union in Germany as originally anticipated. So, that should save some time to apply to focusing of the market.</p>
          <p>And at the customer environment, there was a write-off of about &#x20AC;190 million on tax assets and some PPA and financial expenses which all add up to more than &#x20AC;1.2 billion in total. And obviously Siemens gets just about half of it. Are we satisfied with that, obviously, that's a rhetorical question, and we made it increasingly clear that the company now needs to step up and deliver on its restructuring and refocusing on the market. You might have heard that NSN is now going after broadband mobility and they will focus on that one rather than all the methods which are possible in the telecommunications environment.</p>
          <p>SFS has delivered a decent income, &#x20AC;74 million, a bit shy of what it had in Q1. We've seen some smaller credit hits, mostly in the U.S. No reason to be concerned; and we do expect the SFS to maintain its strengths on operating performance. The so-called centrally managed portfolio assets are mostly sold. There are &#x2013; some remain this year, and we do not expect any major volatility going forward.</p>
          <p>The second extraordinary item, above and beyond the NSN charges obviously has been the corporate items and pensions with a positive &#x20AC;105 million. If I add everything up, it has been some sort of positive one-off. I could easily add up a total of about &#x20AC;150 million which contributed positively as one-offs in that environment. Obviously &#x20AC;95 million legal and regulatory matters, a positive on our asset retirement obligation, which we have for a very long time. This obviously also is depending on the development of discount rates and the like, so very difficult to manage; this time it was positive. And there have been a few other positive impacts which cannot be expected as an underlying contribution going forward.</p>
          <p>Corporate treasury, same matter. Obviously, this is about interest hedging overlays on currencies and the like, which do not qualify for hedge accounting. So, there's a quite some volatility there. Tax obviously being in terms of tax bracket, it's rather high because of the NSN losses could not be deducted. We do expect the tax rate to be in the 28%, 30% range going forward, so that should be a safe place to add to the model.</p>
          <p>SRE has been also at zero due to the lack of disposals. We continue to dispose of items which are not needed in the company. However, obviously, we also need to look into the market environment as it develops going forward.</p>
          <p>Now, if we look what to expect in the second half of the fiscal year, obviously on NSN, we do expect some more repositioning charges, but obviously the maturity has been done in Q2. There's been a few more areas outside Germany which still need to be agreed upon with the union. The maturity, as I said, obviously has been done. Bosch appliances will be somewhat flattish, so one could expect a significant ease as compared to the first half, but still NSN, different market remains to be volatile over time.</p>
          <p>As far as the savings of NSN are concerned, they will kick in at a very late stage of calendar year 2012. So, it could easily be that we, in our fiscal year, which obviously ends in September 30th, will be some of that early returns. So, they should actually be coming by the end of the calendar year 2012 and positively affecting the NSN cost structure as we move along.</p>
          <p>On SFS and CMPA, should pretty much be actually in line with fiscal 2011. So, I would not expect any major deviations on those two items as compared to 2011. SFS might be a bit up, maybe the CMPA a bit down. But all in all, that should be a good ballpark to assume.</p>
          <p>SRE, obviously dependent on the disposal of real estate. We should see some gains mostly in Q4. So, if someone puts some &#x20AC;80 million, &#x20AC;100 million into that bucket, that should be a decent way of looking at it. The most volatile topic, obviously, are the pensions and the asset retirement applications because that could go both ways.</p>
          <p>So, for the remainder of 2012 second half of our fiscal year, if someone puts about a &#x20AC;200 million on average into each quarter, it should be on the pretty safe side. Q3 obviously being a bit less in costs, and Q4 to the year-end usually is a bit higher. So, &#x20AC;200 million each quarter for the remainder of fiscal should actually play it pretty safe. As far as this is concerned, corporate treasury, again, if someone puts in a &#x20AC;50 million expected run rate on cost for interest hedging overlays, depending how the currency goes, should also be a decent way to cover for that item.</p>
          <p>So, that pretty much, ladies and gentlemen, covers what I thought I give the market in terms of disclosure on those items. And I hand it back to Peter for the final remarks.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Joe. Let me finish off with the revised guidance for this year. We confirm the moderate growth in revenue. Also, in terms of order intake being above one in relation to turnovers to a positive book-to-bill. We continue to anticipate strong earnings performances in most of our businesses, including the industrial short cycle businesses. And last but not least, in November 2011, if you remember, at the height of the European crisis, we set out an ambitious, but at that time realistic, target of &#x20AC;6 billion for our income from continuing operations. And due to the challenges mostly in our Power Transmission business, the level we have &#x2013; we are reducing this number by &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;800 million.</p>
          <p>So, with this, Joe and myself are happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>So, we'll start the Q&amp;A right in the middle of this room. If you can have Frederic Stahl, please.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Frederic at UBS. I have two questions on Transmission. Is there a positive &#x2013; given what's happened in the business in the last two quarters, is there a positive impact on how you run other project-related businesses across Siemens? Is there a reason for you to review the operations elsewhere because of what's happened in Transmission?</p>
          <p>The second question is I've understood from some of your customers that there's a trend now from among buyers and grid operators to split up or separate the tendering process. For example, you would have a tender for the substations, you would have a tender for the cables rather than just have one large tender for the whole package. Is that correct and is that &#x2013; well, is that something that you're seeing in your markets right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me make one thing very clear. I mean, this is &#x2013; if you remember, first of all, Siemens has not project issues across the board because obviously one concern could be &#x2013; is Siemens now having not learned enough from the &#x2013; if you remember 2008 when we talked about the fossil power issues. Clearly, when you talk in terms of execution of big projects, we are doing extremely well, and if we take learnings from the Fossil Power division, one of the reasons why this business has actually accelerated in terms of earnings power was not just the mix effect, but also in terms of how it is executing.</p>
          <p>So we are doing and we are executing outside this business. Unfortunately, this is a very specific issue which we &#x2013; quite frankly, we have underestimated the complexity. We should have clearly looked into the issues that this type of technology was never implemented. Even the regulatory authorities are learning along the way, so we're not talking in terms of executing against a very clear cut regulatory environment. We have underestimated that roughly 50% of the value add of this business is actually outside our own competence. So you're really talking about highly complex shipyard type of building in terms of platform building. And on top of it you have to integrate actually our own business and equipment onto these platforms.</p>
          <p>So, the challenge is the integration of it. And therefore we have made all the assessments and it's a combination of picking the right partners. It's a combination how you share risks among the partners, and then ensuring that from a competency profile we ensure that we are successfully implementing these projects. So, this is a highly specific issues which we're addressing.</p>
          <p>And quite frankly, in hindsight, but if I share with you the learnings, one of the learnings is we should have taken one project. Unfortunately, the first one was won by ABB, then we have won four in a row in a very, very short timeframe basically in the window of 12 months. And then the last one was again won by ABB.</p>
          <p>So, in the ideal scenario, we should have taken one, learn from it, taking the best practice, sharing with it, and then move on to the second one. So this was one of the key learnings of it. And we will certainly benefit from it, in terms of the additional projects which will be there in Germany because the first four, when you think about in terms of that at least 16 to 20 of this type of projects coming on the northern shore of Germany in the upcoming years. And we are certainly using this as a very expensive learning experience for the company.</p>
          <p>In terms of the issue of splitting it up, we don't see this that this is actually split up in terms of splitting up cables versus substations. We rather see &#x2013; first of all, there's no blueprint. I mean each customer and each project are different. And having said this there's certainly an issue in terms of joint and several, so you have to very carefully look into contractual issues which you take on, and the liability having Siemens as a partner is in the ideal case for many customers, a more integrated one.</p>
          <p>And we have to very carefully assess, and this is what I said earlier, when we bid for such projects, we have to ensure that we perfectly understand the risk reward profile of such projects, carefully assess it, having the right competencies to really assess it carefully, and then make sure where do we bid and where do refrain from bidding. That's the core issue here.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Andreas from JPMorgan. I would like to follow up on transmission more on the underlying business where I'm still a bit puzzled about the margin decline over the years. Given that you were probably the first and most consistent in terms of highlighting the price pressure in this area, why did it take so long then to basically hit the 3% margin before we have this more structural review? And why didn't that come earlier because this was a known issue to the company, given you've always highlighted the problem.</p>
          <p>And the second question on pension and IFRS 19, other companies have started highlighting the negative impact from that or impact from that for 2013. Will you implement it in 2013 or 2014? And what's the impact for Siemens mainly on the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Andreas. On the rest of transformers, if I may, we definitely have been highlighting the massive pricing issues on substations predominantly. And also continued pricing pressure on commodity transformers back to distribution ones, which face significant competition from China and &#x2013; I mean that was related to the backlog. As far as the backlog in Q1, someone was asking what are the areas that you are most concerned about and without the knowledge of the platform in the North Sea it was that division. And at some point in time, this margin pressure in the backlog has materialized. Should one have been doing the structural changes earlier, definitely could have done in a way but they are there now. And the division has been quite successful in getting a lot of productivity out of the resources still over the last two, three quarters. But at some point in time, working harder, working more comes to an end. It doesn't incrementally help to bring down the cost and bring up the margin; then you need to go into structural changes, and this is where we are at this time. It's mostly substations and it's distribution transformers where pricing pressure and margin deteriorations have happened in the division.</p>
          <p>Pensions, definitely, IFRS 19 will affect the company too, into 2013. On the other hand, obviously, the counterpart is always the expected return on pension assets. So we need to see how we will guide going forward when we come to 2013. But this definitely is a topic, which needs to be addressed at a time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have in the second row Peter Reilly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. It's Peter Reilly from Deutsche Bank. Peter, 18 months ago, you stood here and told us that Siemens is now a normal company. Since then, you've had the particle therapy. We've had the Areva fine, and now we've got Power Transmission. These are not things I would associate with a normal company. And they're all, in some way, issues of management judgment. Two questions, really. How can you reassure us that there aren't further surprise us in the backlog?</p>
          <p>And secondly, you were talking about a target of &#x20AC;100 billion of business volume. With hindsight, did that target encourage excessive risk taking inside the company in order to grow the business faster than it was really capable of being grown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Peter, I thank you for this question because I want really to clarify. What we have said all along the way is capital-efficient growth. And for this reason, we have actually developed a cockpit and we go through every six months where do we stand in terms of &#x2013; in relation to this cockpit. Once.</p>
          <p>Second, there is a good reason why I have never specified a specific date for the &#x20AC;100 billion. So what we have communicated to the teams is that there's ambition level that we have to grow and that we have to capital-efficient outgrow our competitors. But we are not running against a wall of a certain year or a certain quarter where we should hit, precisely to avoid what you have insinuated. That all of a sudden, you have basically the idea within the businesses that we just have to drive for growth, exactly to avoid this.</p>
          <p>Now, there is always an issue. I mean, you have different issues in terms of what is &#x2013; the question is what is the normality of the Siemens organization, the size we represent and the scope we represent and the global aspects of the company we represent. We are a 400,000-employee company, an &#x20AC;80 billion &#x2013; almost &#x20AC;80 billion company. So, we will always have, in some businesses issues, which we have to deal with. And the key issue is do you have the accountability in place that you identify the strategic issues, and if you have to correct the accountability that you take absolutely all the right measures to correct them? Now, unfortunately, be assured that this is not the proudest moment where I sit in front of you as representing our shareholders, or Joe and myself, and to say and explaining the situation we're in in these businesses.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, we are.  And then the question is what do we do about and how do we drive the accountability and how do we make sure that we correct it, and this is done from a strategic perspective and long-term perspective. And this is how we now try to drive the Transmission areas. But at the end of the day, we will always have businesses which were doing extremely well, businesses we are &#x2013; basically we are &#x2013; where dynamics are changing.</p>
          <p>In the other two businesses of substations and transformers, indeed, what Andreas has said earlier, we have flagged this issue already since several months that the underlying and then the assessment comes &#x2013; the underlying competitive dynamics of Asian competitors going for aggressive market share strategies, is this a long-term trend or is this a short-term trend and then you have to counter? And we came to the conclusion, we clearly have to structurally look into these businesses and to reposition these businesses for defending our strong position that we have and to making &#x2013; and to ensuring that we have a capital-efficient growth element in this business long term, footprint wise, standardization issues, supply chain and so, there are many, many aspects where Karlheinz and his team are now addressing. And as soon as we have it, we will have it.</p>
          <p>But we will never, Peter, it would be unrealistic if I would stand in front of you and say a normal Siemens company means that we will have never surprises. Hopefully, we are much more credible in terms of how we drive our performance culture across the business. And I don't like these surprises and I certainly share the sentiment of your question very much. But be assured that we are taking action and that we drive to change as necessary.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we'll continue with the last row, Martin Prozesky.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe before I move on to the next one, the other one is obviously, I mean, I think a company &#x2013; the size that we have and the leadership that we have, we also have to have innovation leadership. We always had it and we &#x2013; so, we always have to go for where are the boundaries in the businesses we are operating in. And this is always a question how far can you go and how fast can you go in terms of moving technologies from a research technology environment into a pilot environment, and then from a pilot environment into a first application and then basically a complete rollout.</p>
          <p>And this business had &#x2013; and I have to say it very frankly and very openly, didn't have the competency in-house to really fundamentally make a complete judgment about the complexity of this project. And, unfortunately, all four orders &#x2013; all four tenders were won. Subsequently, business felt very good, and now we realize that implementation is very different. So, it's also an aspect of having made the wrong judgment.</p>
          <p>So, we will always &#x2013; but we have to preserve an innovation culture in the company but not forfeiting profitability aspects as we implement the first rollout of it. And I think a great counterexample of this is in another part of the business, it's the H-frame. In the H-frame, we clearly have decided, actually strategically, we will do this with one customer, E.ON, in Irsching in Bavaria. We will gain all the experience. And as soon as we feel comfortable with the performance of this frame, we then, if you remember, rolled out six, selling to the United States, and now we have sold another three in Korea. And we continue to roll this technology very successfully out. But you can never completely avoid making misjudgment in a situation like this. But we should not have done what we have done.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Martin Prozesky from Bernstein. Two questions on energy sold, please, but in different divisions. Can you give us a bit more guidance on Renewables? I knew Renewables has been very volatile. And what I understood was that mix has been very important, solar versus offshore versus onshore in terms of the disappointing margins we saw in Q1. Now, this margin was much stronger. Can you give us a sense, is it mix? Is it execution? Is it better projects being booked in the quarter, and does it mean margins are going to be volatile from here on or is it going to be at a higher level?</p>
          <p>And then the second, in terms of the Fossil, for Q1 which I understand or Q1 calendar, which is quite a big service quarter. The margin was a bit weak. Is that because there was more turnkey in that mix or &#x2013; and how should we expect the margin to develop for the rest of the year? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you very much. Look, I would like to counteract your key argument to say the Fossil Power margins are weak. I mean, you go back into &#x2013; this is a cyclical business environment. Go back only a couple of years where we would be extremely happy to having achieved the double digit, or a 10 to 12 or whatever the margin used to be. And we have actually had now a period of time where we have actually &#x2013; where we were able to execute exceptional margin quality.</p>
          <p>And you heard me saying a couple of times when we were talking about the 20-plus or whatever it was, the 21 actually, that all stars were aligned to really make this possible. So, it was clearly execution, product mix, and obviously you have a margin quality in the Fossil business of 17.5% is an extremely good margin. So, the key focus right now is how do we sustain the margin quality, because at the same time, we gained market share. So, this is not &#x2013; actually, so this is a combination of gaining market share, having the right technology, having a good mix and, between Q1 and Q2, there was always the slight mix effect and this went in, and therefore we have targeted overall to say we want to have one-third solution, one-third products and one-third services. And you have the combination of it. So I would say this was a pretty good performance of the Fossil business.</p>
          <p>On <mark type="ph" /> Link (57:22), this definitely is &#x2013; there is no change to the underlying dynamics, and you know this and see this through other companies. This is an environment where margins are impacted, where aggressive pricing is happening, where projects are taking, where you have different dynamics in different parts of the world.</p>
          <p>In terms of pricing pressures, you have highly competitive Chinese player now going global. I mean, you have an onshore environment in the United States, which is now benefiting from the PTC [Production Tax Credit], and the key question is when and how long will PTC last? Should PTC not being continued, you would have a totally different dynamics in the United States for this type of business. And so, therefore, we as a company being in this business, we have to prepare ourselves for different scenarios because there is no clear-cut answer and nobody knows exactly will it continue, won't it continue, so you have to prepare yourself for different scenario.</p>
          <p>So, I would therefore continue to state we have to absolutely execute what we set out for ourselves, and this is industrialization of these businesses, standardization, looking for productivity, looking for cost, looking for core platforms within the business and having the right mix between off- and onshore. And then we should do well.  But we cannot expect &#x2013; this will be a highly dynamic environment going forward, an environment where consolidation will happen, who will pick up which company and changing the overall dynamics, who is able to do this organically. We clearly have set out we have the technology. We are sitting in the right projects and offshore and being the market leader there. But this should be an interesting dynamic environment and we are very happy that we will be able to turn it and this was a volume effect. I mean, in Q1 and Q2 it was slightly mix, but mainly it was also driven by volume and then having obviously the impact on your manufacturing margin.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We have on the second row, in the middle, Ben Uglow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Ben Uglow, Morgan Stanley. I have three questions. One was from Friday last week, GE on their conference call sounded extremely enthusiastic about their gas business for the first time in a while. I think the quote was, "All roads lead to gas." Can you just talk very generally about tendering activity that you see at the moment? And over what timeframe could we begin to expect some improvement in the pricing environment for Fossil Power? So, that was question number one.</p>
          <p>The second question, Joe, on your slide on OpEx, I couldn't completely understand exactly what you were signaling. It sounds like you're saying OpEx should slow down in the second half of the year. I think this is a 0.6 number out of 1.2. My question is culturally, philosophically, is Siemens changing direction on OpEx? Are you now trying to get a handle back on the businesses and get the margins back up? So, simple question there.</p>
          <p>And final question is really just on the actual guidance, what I wanted to make sure was within that &#x20AC;600 million to &#x20AC;800 million of lowered guidance, have you made additional provision in that number for any further bleed either in Transmission or even, dare I say it, I don't want to mention it, but I will, the operating side at NSN? So, do we think that that takes care of all business for 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, I'll start with the first one. I'm not commenting on, obviously, on other companies. But statements all roads lead to gas is &#x2013; and this will be an exciting environment. This is certainly what we also share for sure. And for this reason, we have actually globalized our footprint. If you remember now, we have the benefit that we have a U.S. operation. We can access export/import financing from the U.S. for overseas market. And this is now a platform, which we can use not just for the United States, but also for overseas markets.</p>
          <p>So, in the United States, shale, gas and everything else, I mean, the key question is only how quickly will the economy pick up and the reserve margin which exists in the United States be lowered, because currently &#x2013; I mean, this is a major determining factor. But that this business will, for example, in the United States, is picking up in the near future. It's no time. The question is actually when.</p>
          <p>So, U.S. &#x2013; Europe is actually really impacted by the financial crisis. So here, we see clearly delays happening in terms of &#x2013; this is a pure replacement investment market. And then, we see actually new capacity in the emerging markets. And obviously, you have highly interesting, but also highly competitive markets like Saudi Arabia where we are building our manufacturing footprint. You have &#x2013; I think it would be very nice to be able to leverage the footprint that we are building in Russia. So, the setup that we have now is set forth for a growth market environment of gas. Now, in the short term, 2011 was a good market. And we anticipate probably 2012 being a similar market environment overall. And the two companies, the other company and ours, what you have mentioned, are having their fair share of successes.</p>
          <p>So, with having the right product, we don't see any increased pricing pressure in this environment, but we see selectively very interesting competitive moves. So, the funnel is there. You have different market dynamics in different parts of the world, which we have to consider. And you have, on a project basis, sometimes different behavior by different companies, not necessarily the two that you have mentioned, but there are a few others also in the game, but an interesting market environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Then on the &#x2013; first, the clarification on the OpEx slide. You remember that slide was saying that OpEx shall increase between &#x20AC;1.1 billion and &#x20AC;1.3 billion, between 2011 and 2012. That's what the original assumption was. And the latest guidance now is expected to be below the lower end of the corridor. So, that actually means it would be less than &#x20AC;1.1 billion. And that means that there will be a significantly slower growth in the second half as compared to the first half. So, if we have to slow down a massive approach, we've got to give them some room to break. And so, that's the first thing as a clarification as far as 2012 is concerned. For 2013, we actually do believe we have spent enough credit for our businesses now. And they need to deliver first, and then we'll take it from there.</p>
          <p>So, if you remember, we increased our OpEx, SG&amp;A and mostly application-based footprint, engineering, as well as R&amp;D by about &#x20AC;1.2 billion from 2010 to 2011. So now that counts twice, 2011 and 2012. Then we've got another, let's assume, I don't know &#x2013; let's assume &#x20AC;1 billion or maybe &#x20AC;900 million in 2012. So, that's up to &#x20AC;3.2 billion. We spent &#x20AC;1.6 billion and &#x20AC;1.9 billion on CapEx, so we have as a resource allocator to the business, have given the business about &#x20AC;5 billion, to get something meaningful done and create value.</p>
          <p>And we said that all along, capital-efficient growth doesn't &#x2013; in the short term doesn't look like it has been achieved. We did not expect that to be achieved in the short term because obviously if you invest into R&amp;D, it takes time. But we believe the time has come now in 2013 for the businesses to show us the money. And that will definitely mean that the assumption for our budget process, which starts as early as May, June in the region and then will be added up to corporate, could as well mean that we'll be extremely tight on OpEx increases, if not freeze them.</p>
          <p>So, that basically means now is delivery time. And we expect the business to show us the money from what we have allocated in terms of resources. That's as easy as that. And if there is something on top of it which changes, if all roads lead to gas and that the road is not that long, then we may as well continue to invest selectively as we'll be picking our &#x2013; we'll be picking our places where we continue to invest and increase the OpEx.</p>
          <p>So now on the &#x2013; is everything in, I think obviously if there was anything which had to be considered, they would have considered that in our fiscal Q2. What we have been adding mentally was a ballpark number of about &#x20AC;100 million for the structural realignment of Transmission. That's not been set in terms of content, but we just put a number in for Mr. Springer to get some way of being quick and do the right things quickly.</p>
          <p>On NSN when we're explaining the assumptions in the guidance in November, we said we put a &#x20AC;500 million charge for restructuring and now that appears to be a bit more than that, but that is covered. There will be some, as we said, some ease in some areas in the second half. So, all in all, we feel comfortable with what we've been putting into the market and we'll work on it as we speak.</p>

          <p>Okay, we'll continue the Q&amp;A from the right side with Simon Smith, second row and then James Moore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's Simon Smith, Credit Suisse. I had two questions; the first was with regard to the balance sheet. You obviously are, even after paying the dividend, in a financially very strong position. And I wonder if now isn't the time to start considering a return of capital to shareholders? I think as you &#x2013; all of the discussions we've had here point to plenty of challenges for the management team with the existing assets of the group. I think strategically, there's not, from what you described, glaring strategic holes that you're looking at. And from the last time you considered it at your full year, the crisis has eased in terms of financial markets considerably. So, I'd be interested on your thoughts on that.</p>
          <p>Second question is with regard to China, through this reporting season, we're getting some very divergent trends for companies in China, and also you showed there sort of orders and sales down, but be very interested here how that varies across your groups, automation compared to construction, compared to power, etcetera. So, I just wondered if you could give us any further insights into that region.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, let me start with China first. I mean, China obviously is, A, number one is slowing down from a very high level.  And China has always proven that they manage towards &#x2013; when they set out goals, that they achieve goals. And my first assumption is the 7.5% GDP growth is something that the government is targeting, and there will probably be a number very close to it, what China will achieve.</p>
          <p>Now, on the short-term basis, how is the environment for our business? We see an extremely &#x2013; overall, you have the numbers in our books. So, you clearly see also that our orders are down, reason being &#x2013; main reason being that obviously the Rail Component business is today very different than it used to be last year, with all the reasons which you probably know as good as I know. So, we see certainly a slowdown in the Rail environment in China.</p>
          <p>Also on the Energy front, there's a certain slowdown. We see a very good environment for our Healthcare business growing very strongly. The Industry Automation business has a very good environment in China, and due to the fact that productivity is very important and Industry Automation business for the upgrading of productivity and counteracting high labor and increased labor cost is something where the business is perfectly positioned in China. So, that's kind of on the short-term basis what is currently happening. So, I continue to stay optimistic about China, and we continue to invest in China.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Simon, on the return on capital, maybe before I move to that one, another consideration on China. Obviously it's been slow, but one should always have in mind that China almost completely has revamped its public and political and government environment. So, everyone now is in a new place, and they literally have been starting a new era of leadership which has been uncertain for many, many months because nobody knew exactly where he or she would be at. Now this is clear, and I would not be too surprised if that also would resume activities on areas such as infrastructures and the like.</p>
          <p>If we look at the growth to come from in the near term in China, the resumption of growth, I would rather point to automation more than anything. China has deliberately said that they want to go into high level manufacturing, and this is about automotive tools. It's about automotive parts, not so much where we have a 5% or 10% failure rate <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:12:38) something new. If you go into automotive, OEM parts manufacturing, it's 5 to 10 parts per million. And automation, high-end automation means high-end quality. High-end quality means definitely, again, automation. And this is where we are just really good at. And if you haven't had the chance to go to the Hannover Fair, you really should go have a look because then you will clearly see what Siemens Industry is all about and compare because everyone is there so you can compare notes within a mile-and-a-half roundtrip.</p>
          <p>Now, let me move to the return on capital. You heard Peter say earlier, and I wholeheartedly agree to that, One Siemens is our operating model. And One Siemens has a very clear notion about what to do with capital or, if you know, over a long period of time, we are above or below certain targets we have set ourselves.</p>
          <p>Now, it's a key commitment that we will do so. On the other hand, obviously, we really need to hunt the bear first before you divide the fur. And that's what we are focusing on now. We've had some bumpy roads in execution, as you obviously all know. We need to go fix that and we continue the year and work hard on our &#x2013; achieving our new framework on profitability. And then we'll take that one for &#x2013; as a focus.</p>
          <p>Now, obviously, no one has surprisingly asked about OSRAM. Maybe it's still coming. I mean, there's a very, very clear commitment. It has no change, that we will float the asset sooner rather than later. From what we assume, it's doable, in the best interest of the company, the shareholder and all the stakeholders; would be an area like late summer, early fall. If for some reason that window was not to be taken, we definitely would seek for other methods to dispose of the asset and float it in the market. And that may be also be a good idea to help the shareholders receive what we believe is their own.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll continue next to Simon &#x2013; James Moore, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A couple of questions on margin, if I could, and also a question on one-offs. It's James Moore at Redburn. You've given us a clear view on the Transmission side as to what the issues are with TenneT. But I just want to be clear in my mind where we are on other one-off risks. Am I right in saying that Particle Therapy is now fully reinvented? Am I right in saying that OL3 is largely built, and therefore, the risk is quite low? And should we worry about ICx? I've seen some press reports talking about delays. Could that be the next project-based issue? And are there any other long-cycle project-based contracts in your backlog at the moment that you worry about?</p>
          <p>In terms of margins I wondered if you could help us a little on the good industry margins in IA&amp;DT. Is that just volume or is there a mix issue there between the chemical drives, large drives, etcetera? And in the Rail business, the slightly lower margin you explained, but how should we think about that going in the Transportation business in the Rail business, how should we think about that going forward in the coming quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>James, thank you. I mean, obviously, as I said earlier, if we had seen any risk, which was not covered, we would have put it into the &#x2013; in our quarter close. So, obviously, there is to the best of our knowledge and judgment, there is no open risks in the company, neither in execution nor in the backlog. Now, PT definitely is ring-fenced, so there should not be any charges coming from that. And Olkiluoto 3 has always been good for surprises. We know that, and if I tell you today it's over, it would be the same as if I told you that a year ago. So we are diligently working on our part. We know what we are doing. So the &#x2013; once we receive the steam, we'll be fine. We'll be fine; on the conventional outlook we'll be fine.</p>
          <p>The unknown, obviously is that when are we going to receive the steam because that needs to start earlier than our steam turbines so there is a certain unknown here. On the other hand, in judging the timeframe, we've been somewhat more conservative in our current reserves as the ones who had still the obligation to build it.</p>
          <p>So therefore this is as much as I can tell on this one. Obviously, the final debate will be with the judge &#x2013; with the customer on damages, how does that all go? Are we to believe that we have a good stand here and there's also a lot of counter &#x2013; potential counterclaims, but that is just an unknown which definitely will also be part of legal proceedings, just as a disclaimer, even though we do not believe it's probable in that particular aspect.</p>
          <p>ICx, we all have our customers. So sometimes you also to respect criticism, which may not necessarily be factual based. So, therefore it is what it is. We're also working hard on it. The factory <mark type="indiscernible" /> (1:18:40) and is positioned very well. I just went and looked at what &#x2013; there are people in place, the resources in place. It's all there, so that seems to be doing all right.</p>
          <p>So to the best of our knowledge, I mean, the most unknown definitely is still that &#x2013; unfortunately, I mentioned it for the fifth time now, is that matter in the North Sea because the average percentage for completion of about 30%, 33% of those four projects still means you have 70% outstanding to complete. And I mean, obviously, this is something to always consider once you go down the learning curve.</p>
          <p>On the margins, Industry &#x2013; Industrial Automation is doing well. It has been benefiting a bit from the very, very active business development in the German high-end toolmaker environment more than the Chinese. If you look at the regional spread, Chinese business hasn't been that strong in Industrial Automation. The German business was stronger. That is usually an indication that there're some positive mix impacts here.</p>
          <p>Interestingly enough, late in March and now in April, we do see some decent pickup in China on Industrial Automation. We do expect this to be a follow-through from the fact that there was some distribution destocking happening in the end of 2011, early 2012 in China that seems now through, and the businesses start again to restock. So that has not been particular project. In OEM, it's been mostly a point of purchase. So that's an indication of a more broad-based potential recovery.</p>
          <p>DTE definitely has been benefiting from a strong motion control, definitely overcompensating some weakness in the so-called Winergy environment of that aspect. And then Rail and Logistics, I mean, they've been pretty successful in getting new orders, decent orders in terms of margin; now the thing is execution. They'll have a few slower quarters still to come, but we do expect Rail to be decent, if not strong in revenue growth in 2013. So this is at a bulk, now has been coming in terms of executing on the backlog. So, not much in a nutshell on margin run through in industry.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll continue with the last row, Olivier Esnou, and then we'll move over to the middle to Daniela Costa.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Olivier Esnou, Exane BNP. Two questions, please. I want to come back on corporate cost. Even when I back up the unusual positives, it's still almost in profit for the first half, which is quite a change compared to history. So I was wondering is there anything structural which has changed in the way you allocate profit between corporate and the division or is it still an underlying run rate of &#x20AC;800 million charge per annum? That's the first question.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on M&amp;A, we start to see Chinese companies, emerging players in general, trying to move into Europe with some acquisition strategy. How does Siemens view that? I mean to some extent, do you think you have a role of &#x2013; or is there a possibility for you take defensive action in protecting your competitive landscape by purchasing suppliers or smaller competitors to protect the competitive landscape in Europe as well? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with China first. Quite frankly we welcome China going global because it's an industrial maturity of a big nation like China. It would be totally unheard of that a given country would not try to also expand their global businesses. And part of expanding the global businesses is obviously that you look for organic growth, and then you look for M&amp;A opportunities.</p>
          <p>So there's no specifics of competing for M&amp;A targets. We're competing for M&amp;A targets everywhere. So this is a rather normal thing. And that this is happening, there's no question. There's a strategic intent of go out, so &#x2013; by the government and by strategic industries and Chinese players that they also want to participate in M&amp;A activities globally and certainly in Europe as well. So I see this rather relaxed and nothing special to a given country, so &#x2013; and now, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Olivier, on the corporate cost, I mean, obviously, it has been a positive &#x20AC;105 million, as we can see on the chart, and it could be as much as &#x20AC;150 million, which we could consider to be a positive one-off. So, obviously, if you consider that you'll be a negative &#x20AC;45 million or &#x20AC;50 million. So there hasn't been any hidden positives in there which ought to continue. I mean it is what it is. We disclosed the regulatory and legal matters to do with Greece and a release of reserves on a legal case. So that is not going to happen again. We had to change the approach on the Greek settlement from continued to discontinued. That was a technical matter since all the allocations the company has been faced with in Greece, very little communications businesses. So we needed to move that to where the communication business was considered to be growing. So, that was a pure technical item.</p>
          <p>And as I said going forward, if we consider together with &#x2013; the pension matter which is usually also negative, at this time, it was just about plus one or flat zero. If you consider about a &#x20AC;200 million for both, a bit less in Q3 and a bit more in Q4 for those two items together, you'll be on the safe side. If you'd be a bit more aggressive, you'll deduct a little bit. If you want to be really cautious, you'll use the &#x20AC;200 million and you'll be okay for the remainder of the year. And we'll be updating you on that item again in November for 2013.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And we continue with Daniela Costa and then just next to her, <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:25:51).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Daniela Costa from Goldman Sachs. Two questions. One on the rate of decline on the prepayments, which you've talked for a while that there's a structural decline there. Is it all an industry trend or is there perhaps that you're willing to take a faster rate of decline there because you have a bigger balance sheet than others and have SFS, and you could use that to gain some market share at the expense of the immediate impact on the prepayments?</p>
          <p>And the second question is, there were some news on SEN, the enterprise networks on the press a couple of weeks ago of a potential IPO. Is that &#x2013; how realistic is that? Do you have any comments and what could be the eventual size or timing? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, thanks, Daniela. The second one is easy. The question was do I have any comment. The answer is no. We'll take that along as we go. We are a minority shareholder, and we welcome every meaningful, sustainable forum of exit. The business has been well-restructured. The gentleman who is running it, the former number two of Deutsche Telekom, did a hell of a job to get that matter well-positioned, and we look forward to what we see.</p>
          <p>On the prepayments, it has not been tactically measured. This was not meant to be stimulating orders or give into some unreasonable expectations of our customers. We do see that cash still has its meaning. The public sector, interestingly enough, is more apt to accepting capital cost charges in the order intake calculation rather than do the &#x2013; if you want, the historical way of financing the net assets for the project. So, I would not expect, given the development of public debt and the like, I would expect that to continue.</p>
          <p>Now obviously, as I said, the &#x20AC;700 million down in the first half had two impacts. First is the structural change on customer behavior, and the other, obviously, is the bookings are down so you get relatively less bookings on top of it as compared to what you lose if you want to get back up to the revenue side. So, if you ask today what the split was, it probably was like 50/50 as a ballpark, but we definitely do see in infrastructure, this is happening. Prepayments are less a habit as compared to how it used to be. That definitely will mean an impetus to make more money on profit in order to cover up for the return on capital employed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We're getting to the end of the conference. I still have Timm. Anyone else? Any questions? Timm, we'll finish with you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A lot of responsibility. It's Timm Schulze-Melander from JPMorgan. Two questions, if I could, one for Peter and one for Joe. Peter, you've had the recent growth agenda. I heard Joe talk about 2013 is a year of "show us the money." And I think investors will be curious. Does that mean that we should be thinking about an OpEx plateau, or could we be talking about maybe a swing back of the primary focus towards maybe back towards costs and efficiency, maybe a new cost-saving program that would signal that "show us the money" ethos next year? So, that's the bigger-picture question.</p>
          <p>The question for Joe is really sort of a bit of a housekeeping, an update question; it's on OSRAM. Could you just give us an update in terms of some of the puts and takes in the operating margin and what you see as the outlook for the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Timm, I'll start with the first one. It's obviously about what Joe was highlighting and what we have discussed already intensively with all the operating board members is that we will ensure that we drive continuously growth and that we have an extremely tight operating budget. So, relatively speaking, we are asking the operating units to really show us the incremental growth path and the incremental margin in a very different context than we have seen at the &#x2013; over the last couple of quarters. So, that's the notion of it, of the direction that we are taking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And second, on OSRAM, the revenues on a comparable level have been up about 2%; on a nominal level, obviously, much higher because of the help of the currency as well as some acquisitions in the space. Operating profit is somewhat difficult now to really compare because we have this "what if" kind of thing. If we hadn't had that and discontinued, what would have happened if? So, it's very difficult to really compare like-for-like and not mix up apples with oranges. But if we kind of are looking for a underlying margin, operating underlying margin, what one could expect from the ordinary course of business, I would add considerably in the area of 5% to 6%. EBIT, not EBITA. EBIT.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Very well, that ends our Q&amp;A for the Q2 fiscal 2012 earnings release. We will be present in the next couple of weeks and months at a number of conferences. We look forward seeing you there. Thank you very much for your attendance. Thank you. Bye.</p>
