          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon and welcome to the presentation of BNP Paribas Second Quarter 2012 Results. For your information, this conference is being recorded. Supporting slides are available on BNP Paribas Investor Relation website, www.invest.bnpparibas.com. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /></p>
          <p>I would like now to hand the call over to Jean-Laurent Bonnaf&#xE9;, Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. I am here in Paris with two Co-COOs, Philippe Bordenave and Fran&#xE7;ois Villeroy de Galhau, as well as with Lars Machenil, our CFO. Afterwards, we'll be pleased to take your questions jointly after my introductory presentation.</p>
          <p>I will not be commenting each single slide in the presentation, but I would just like to make a few introductory comments from the main feature of our quarterly results, and then give you an overview of the performance of our business lines.</p>
          <p>As you well know, the second quarter of the year was characterized by difficult market conditions, as worries on the Eurozone re-emerged and market volatility increased. Despite these, BNP Paribas showed quite a resilient performance; confirmed first its profit generation capacity with &#x20AC;1.8 billion of net income booked in the quarter, continued to grow its retail deposit base as shown by the 2.8% increase in our Domestic Market deposits and by even strong figures in other countries, it succeeded even further, optimizing and adapting its cost base to the environment, marking a 4% reduction compared to the second quarter 2011, and it maintained a strict risk management approach as shown by the cost of risk which we remained at the low level of 50 basis points compared to customer loss.</p>
          <p>At the same time, we've been continuing to deliver on our adaptation plan, which is largely in advance considering what we have already achieved, 90% six months in advance, as you can see from slide six.</p>
          <p>We've been successful in implementing the plans swiftly, while at the same time containing implementation costs. For example, in terms of losses on sales that we initially anticipate at &#x20AC;800 million, we now expect to book less than half that amount, confirming once more the strong underlying quality of our assets.</p>
          <p>This, in turn, translates into extremely high solvency ratios. The real news is that at the end of the second quarter, our fully-loaded Basel 3 ratio already stood at 8.9%, almost matching our objective of 9% by year-end six months in advance and making BNP Paribas &#x2013; and making BNP Paribas one of the best capitalized banks according to the Basel target metrics.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide 12, you can see our first half reserves, which again proved the resilience of BNP Paribas performance in this challenging environment. If we focus on the evolution in our operating divisions, we can see that revenues contracted by just 5% while cost control was confirmed. At the same time, cost of risk actually showed a slight improvement.</p>
          <p>Overall for the group, the semester closes with a net income of &#x20AC;4.7 billion, which as shown by the following slide, page 13, positioned BNP Paribas among the banks with one of the highest profit-generation capacity.</p>
          <p>I would now like to look in more detail at the performance of the different businesses, starting with Retail Banking and most specifically with Domestic Markets. As a reminder, this segment consists of four markets, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, and specialized activities; Personal Investors, Arval and Leasing.</p>
          <p>As you can see on slide 15, business activity remained sustain, especially in terms of deposit gathering which grew at an average 2.8% with an improvement in all markets. We also continued to benefit from the significant synergies existing between networks, as shown by our One Bank for Corporates initiative, thanks to which the corporate clients of our Domestic Markets opened some 700 new accounts in the global network of BNP Paribas in the first six months of the year.</p>
          <p>Revenues were essentially stable, as resilience in interest income was offset by weakness in financial fees. Cost remained under control, decreasing by 1.2% at constant scope, and contributing to a positive 1.3 jaws effect. In turn, this also led to an improvement in the cost/income ratio of our three main markets, as you can see in the bottom-right of the slide. Cost of risk remained moderate, with a manageable rate in Italy, and hence, pre-tax income remained stable at a significant level.</p>
          <p>Outside of those domestic markets, Europe-Mediterranean and BancWest have also shown dynamic activity and strong deposit gathering. Indeed, Europe-Med, slide 19, delivered deposits up 14% and loans up 5%. Let me single out Turkey, which enjoyed particularly strong volume growth, speaking to a 38% increase in revenues, while cost control helped reduce significantly the cost/income ratio, from 90%to 68%.</p>
          <p>BancWest, on slide 20, showed very strong deposit gathering, which increased at a rate of 8.3%, while loans were up 3.3%, benefiting from a positive trend in corporate loans. The cost of risk confirmed a declining trend, which contributed to a near 10% increase in pre-tax income excluding the benefit of the U.S. dollar depreciation. As you can see, BancWest's contribution to group's results is quite significant and back on an upward trend.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, Personal Finance continued to implement its adaption plan on the mortgage front, where outstandings continued to decrease as well as cost. Good risk control meant that PF's good profit generation capacity was maintained despite an unfavorable environment.</p>
          <p>A quick zoom on Investment Solutions, slide 22 and 23. In the first half, Investment Solutions showed net asset inflows of &#x20AC;8.5 billion, as the positive intake in Q1 was only partially offset by the negative intake in Q2. Wealth Management was by far the most important contributor, with good inflows in the domestic markets and in Asia. This brought total assets under management to &#x20AC;873 billion at the end of June, up 3.6% compared to year-end 2011, although it is below last year's levels.</p>
          <p>Compared to Q2 last year, revenues are up 2.2% on the back of good performance from Insurance and Security Services, which continued to grow, somewhat mitigated by Wealth and Asset Management given the overall lower level of assets under management. The contribution in terms of pre-tax income was stable at &#x20AC;531 million, which shows the good overall resilience of the business.</p>
          <p>Let us now turn to CIB, which, as you know, consists of Advisory, Capital Markets and Corporate Banking. Let's start with Corporate Banking, slide 26, and let me just remind you that we are talking of a business comprising of some 11,000 corporate and institutional clients, with a global reach and a commercial set-up articulated with the retail banking. Also, remember that Corporate Banking is finalizing its deleveraging plan, which reduced the credit portfolio, leading to a reduction of revenues in Q2.</p>
          <p>Even so, Corporate Banking maintained its strong position in origination, ranking first for number of syndicated loans in Europe at the end of June. On the deposit front, we have set up a dedicated Corporate Deposit line to enhance the commercial effort, while our cash management has gained several large mandates in the quarter from corporate clients in Europe and Asia.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to Advisory and Capital Markets, slide 25. Revenues were affected by low client demand against a backdrop of market crisis. In this difficult environment, we continued to manage the different businesses cautiously, as shown for example by the low level of our VaR in the quarter. In particular, equity was hampered by low volumes due to reduced client demand.</p>
          <p>Rates and ForEx posted a good performance, but Fixed Income was impacted by the low level of primary bond issues. Notwithstanding this and despite the significant volumes contraction, we managed to retain our number one spot for all bonds in Europe, and number six for all international issues.</p>
          <p>Focusing briefly on CIB's cost at constant scope and exchange rates, excluding the adaptation cost, I want to underline that they were marked at 20% decrease, benefiting from the continuing staff reduction which is proceeding according to plan. The cost/income ratio at 62.6% remains one of the best in the industry.</p>
          <p>Let me wrap up CIB in mentioning that we booked some landmark transactions in our Originate and Distribute approach, by successfully combining our strengths in specialized financing with those of our Fixed Income.</p>
          <p>And before I conclude my introduction, I would like to give you a quick update on where we stand in terms of medium/long-term funding, balance sheet evolution and solvency. Starting with slide 28, you can see that our mid/long-term funding program already exceeded our &#x20AC;20 billion program for 2012, having funded &#x20AC;22 billion with an average maturity of close to six years and at an average spread of 112 basis points above mid-swap.</p>
          <p>If you turn to the following slide, you will see that we have maintained the significant surplus of stable funding, which stands at &#x20AC;52 billion. In U.S. dollars, the surplus stands at $38 billion, while I remind you that we have fully achieved as early as April our deleveraging plan target of <mark type="ph" /> $65 billion (11:38).</p>
          <p>Slide 30, solvency. We have virtually reached our 9% common equity Tier 1 ratio under Basel 3. This is six months early. Under Basel 2.5, we stand at 10.9%. This is by further strengthening our capital, amongst others, due to the scrip dividend, which I remind you achieved a success rate of 72%.</p>
          <p>To conclude, let me draw your attention to our net book value per share, which I'm proud to say, continues to increase and now stands at close to &#x20AC;60, as you can see on slide 31.</p>
          <p>So the messages I hope to have passed on to you are; that is that in the challenging environment of Q2, we showed good performances; that we have virtually achieved our adaptation plan, and that's with a fully-loaded Basel 3 ratio of 8.9%, we are, today, one of the best capitalized banks in the world; and third, that we continue to play an active role in financing the real economy and supporting our client in their different needs.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much for your kind attention. And together Philippe, Fran&#xE7;ois and Lars, we shall now be glad to take your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We have a question from Lorraine Quoirez, HSBC Bank. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. A couple of questions, please. What sort of revenue and costs growth do you expect in French Retail for the rest of year? And also, to what extent do you think re-pricing can offset the increase of the cost of funding? And can you provide a guidance for the net interest margin? Finally, it will be nice to have some more color on the cost of risk going forward. What sort of level do you expect for French Retail, BNL and Personal Finance especially? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Fran&#xE7;ois Villeroy speaking. For French Retail, we expect, for the months to come, the risk to remain more or less at the level we had. I would say, the same global picture, because you raised a question for Belgium and Italy. Regarding more specifically, revenues and costs in French Retail, we had a slight contraction of revenue in this second quarter due mainly a strong increase in financial fees. This trend in the quarters to come will depend on the evolution of financial market. We could have this kind of evolution for some months, but depending again on the level of financial market.</p>
          <p>We will go on being very strict on cost control, not only in French Retail but in all our domestic networks, and you saw that in all domestic networks we had a strong positive jaws effect. We are confident that we will keep this trend for the rest of the year in our most important domestic markets.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And for the net interest margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Net interest margin in...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In French Retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In French Retail?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you expect the re-pricing basically to offset the increase of the cost of funding, or what sort of decline do you see, if any?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Notice, re-pricing is taking place and we explained it to our clients, be it households or corporate. There is no credit crunch or restriction of the volume of credit. Also, we see a decrease of demand in France, as in other domestic markets. But obviously, the price of the credit is increasing a bit due to the new regulation of Basel 3. So it's clearly what we explained to our clients; no restriction on volume but a slight increase on prices due to the new regulation, and this one is taking place. And you saw on slide 16 that we have a positive evolution of net interest income in France. Our slight decrease of the old revenue is concentrated on financial fees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois Neuez, Goldman Sachs. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, good afternoon. I have three quick questions, please. I noticed that you stopped increasing the liquidity buffers this quarter, whilst they were progressing very, very fast in the previous quarters from last summer. Just wondered whether that meant &#x2013; should I read into this that you feel okay now where your liquidity ratios are, and that we more or less at the cruising speed here, or you intend to continue building up later, but there was a pause in Q2? My second question is, just out of curiosity, have you run mark-to-market of the 40 bps of the EBA sovereign buffer as of today?</p>
          <p>And my final question is on the financing businesses, it looks as though the run rate of revenues looks to be less effected than maybe what I myself previously thought, based on your guidance on the deleverage revenue run rate loss with the loans size and so on. So are you also running a bit ahead of expectation there? Because we get, essentially, underlying revenues of &#x20AC;950 million or so, and it's actually still quite high as far as I can see, at least. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll answer, Jean-Fran&#xE7;ois. On the liquidity buffer, yes, we are, it's very high, it's even probably too high. But we think that it's necessary to have that kind of high liquidity buffer in the period of instability and market, I would say, kind of, panic, sometimes, and volatility. So, we prefer to have too much further than too little. But certainly, we don't need to have more than that.</p>
          <p>About the mark-to-market of the government bonds, we actually made the calculation at the end of June and it's the equivalent of 40 basis points at this level. So it's a coincidental, but it's the same figure as the EBA figure calculated last September.</p>
          <p>And about the loss of revenues coming from the deleveraging in the Corporate Banking, well, we are more or less in line with what we had said, indeed. So, if you take the first half -</p>
          <p>if you look at the first half and you look at the difference with the first half of 2011, we've got reduction of revenues. That is equal to &#x20AC;390 million exactly. So, it's a half year, so it's equivalent of &#x20AC;800 for the full year. And of course, as the deleveraging is still underway, the actual figure next year will be higher. You remember that we had said &#x20AC;1.1 billion. Really, it's more than &#x20AC;1 billion as a full year effect, so we are not far from that. If you add also some losses on the Capital Markets side, the losses of revenues at the Capital Markets side, because they are also somewhat impacted by the reduction of the inventory. So overall, it will be a little more than &#x20AC;1 billion like we had said on the full year full effect basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Delphine Lee, JPMorgan. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. I just have a few questions. First of all, just to come back on capital and your guidance of 8.9% end of June, so I understand your Basel 3 impact is 180 basis points, 190 basis points, and then you have to add on top the 40 basis points for the mark-to-market of sovereign. So just on the improvement side, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on the improvement on what mitigates that? I understand there's something around <mark type="ph" /> PPF (21:26).</p>
          <p>Secondly, also on the loan &#x2013; the losses on disposals of loans in the IB, just on &#x2013; could we have maybe a number of how much has been done, what's left really, on the delevering side? Because if you're only having &#x20AC;400 million, if you achieve so far &#x20AC;150 million of losses, I mean it sounds like a very big number, which is less given what you still need to achieve, which is not much.</p>
          <p>And then, maybe just lastly on Italy, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on how you could improve a little bit funding as you are in most of your geographies in the medium term given the very high loans-to-deposit ratio? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Delphine, good afternoon, Lars speaking. Maybe, on your first question on the capital. Thanks for raising the question and allowing me to clarify it. If you go back to the presentations, as we've done it so far, what we basically guided on is that in the transition from Basel 2.5 to 3, we had a 40 basis points impact from EBA and we had 180 impact of the remainder of Basel, so 220 bps. And then, we said that we have structured Kl&#xE9;pierre basically bringing us a relief of 30 basis points. So all in all, a total of 190 basis points. And as we said earlier, by chance, today, the impact of the sovereign stand at 40, so it's around 190. And you see, we're at 10.9% in Basel 2.5, and we're at 8.9% at Basel 3. So we're basically in-line with how we guided you over the previous quarters.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About the losses in CIB because of the selling of some portfolios, we have said while it's less than &#x20AC;400 million, if you look closely at this slide, less than &#x20AC;400 million, so yes, we hope to be below that figure at the end. But we want to be conservative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And on average, what kind of discount do you have? I mean, it looks quite small, but just to get an idea of what the &#x20AC;150 million so far relates to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Based on average, it's 3% to 5%. And while there's 3% to 4%, indeed, we had said 3% to 5% at the beginning. And indeed, in fact, this is rather between 3% and 4%. And of course, in that figure, we have included the gain, indeed, of the gain we made by selling the Reserve Based Lending business in Houston. So this is mitigating the cost of selling the portfolios &#x2013; the planned selling of portfolios with a small discount the figure is net.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Jean-Pierre Lambert of KBW. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions, please. The first one is, if you could quantify the effect of the adjustments from Basel 2.5 &#x2013; to Basel 2.5 into Basel 3 in the investment bank? You indicated the number roughly for the financing, but I was wondering what would be the number this quarter.</p>
          <p>And second question is since you are close to your target of 9%, what does it mean in terms of change for you in managing the bank? Are you thinking of adjusting the dividend, are you thinking of expanding in some areas? Maybe, if you can comment on that. Or maybe, you're going to change your target to 9.5%?</p>
          <p>And finally, if you look at the cost-to-income ratio in Belgium, a few months ago, you pointed out that it could go down to 65%. Is this still in your view or &#x2013; and what kind of speed that would be achievable? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jean-Pierre, could you repeat your first question? I missed it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. What is the impact of the adjustments, the deleveraging, in the investment bank in terms of revenues, the impact? Because this is mentioned in slide 25, I think. You indicate a balance sheet deleveraging in connection with the adjustment to Basel 2.5 and Basel 3, so I was wondering if you could quantify the effect on the revenue.</p>

          <p>It's a few hundred million, indeed. We had said when -well, we had said that we were expecting most of the deleveraging costs, of course, to be borne by the corporate bank, of course. But &#x2013; well, as far as markets are concerned, it's more difficult because it's less mechanical than in the corporate bank, but you can take something like &#x2013; what in line, may be &#x20AC;300 million, &#x20AC;400 million as a ballpark figure.</p>

          <p>Annual basis, yes. Yes, of course. About the cost/income ratio in Belgium, maybe Fran&#xE7;ois.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Fran&#xE7;ois speaking. If you go to page 51, about the figures in Belgium, you have the new cost/income levels. I will explain, by new, which is as you can see in the first half of this year, 71.9% compared with 74% last year. So we already had a decrease of more than two points of the cost/income ratio. If we go to the absolute level, because you mentioned the objective of 65%, there is an important difference between the time where we announced this objective and the present level, we can see, which is unfortunately for all the Belgian banks, introduction of a strong deposit and systemic tax by the Belgian government, which is more or less four points of cost/income, a bit more. So if we have to look at the absolute level, we should take into account this new base of about four points of cost/income. If you look at the evolution and the trend, our objective of 65% was consistent with the diminishing of more than five points of our cost/income and we are on the way on this road, with already a diminishing of two points in this year. Did that answer your question?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thank you. Two questions, please. The first one is on the cost of risk, which I think was very good this quarter. But as you look forward, where do you think that group's 50 basis points might go to, given the weak economic backdrop in Europe? And which divisions do you see the upward pressure?</p>
          <p>And then, the second question is I think you made some comments this morning about your ROE outlook and achieving a figure of 10%. So I just wondered if you could clarify what your thinking was there. Is that a short-term observation on the market, and how you think still about the longer-term ROE? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the cost of risk, I think as we've said, the current stability is the result of some businesses achieving a decrease in the cost of risk, as you have seen in, like BancWest or Personal Finance and other being more on the somewhat of a poor trend, especially in Italy, BNL. We think that while views from now and for the next few months, we don't see why the current situation would not more or less be, well, the same or stabilize their EBIT the same way, because the underlying trends at work are going up. They're going to remain the same.</p>
          <p>Now, for me, it's too early to speak about the cost of risk of 2013, because I mean what can happen between now and the end of the year, it can be very different. This will be depending on different scenario. So, I think it's too &#x2013; it will be too ambitious to provide you with an outlook of the cost of risk for more than the next six months. On the return on equity...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It was just to mention that under the current environment, it's difficult to get 10% return. This was just to point out the situation for anything that might be is mid or long-term target. We haven't said anything. The only point is that if you are looking at the financing industry, the banking system has all average returns are fairly low compared to, I would say, other type of industry. So in the mid, long term, some things should be rebalanced. So, this is the point. But for the time being, 10% is very aggressive.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. My first question will be back on the BNL, because Delphine asked you to give us an update on the intergroup funding on BNL. You have been able to increase slightly the deposits and to reduce the &#x2013; the loan, sorry. I just want to be sure, have you been able to sell more bonds into the network? Or are still standing with an intergroup funding in the range of &#x20AC;15 billion to &#x20AC;17 billion?</p>
          <p>The second point is can you give us what is the residual exposure on your Ukrainian book? And the third question is I'm a little bit surprised by the pickup of the revenues in the custody activity, especially with the rates falling. Is there specific items?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>The Securities Services, okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Why the revenues are picking up in such low interest rate environment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on this set of question, you know that the second quarter, there is seasonality in favor of the Security Services business, if you compare with the first quarter. This is why we always compare with the second quarter of the previous year. And so, if you compare quarter-on-quarter, there is a good seasonality because the second quarter is the year of the dividend payments and the Annual General Meeting so it's a period where Security Services have a lot of work. And so, they are billing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And year-over-year, the increase is really due to the development of the volumes. I mean the business is developing pretty fast. And both in new grounds and in Asia, and even to some extent in Brazil, and even on &#x2013; in Europe, we are gaining market share. Because more and more &#x2013; more and more banks or institutional investors are subcontracting that type of business, because the size is of the essence for that business and we are able to provide our customers with solutions that are cheaper than what they are doing by themselves.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, this is really a growth area for the group.</p>
          <p>And now, moving up to, maybe, your first question about the BNL funding by BNP Paribas, you know that in the &#x2013; well, in the past, until recently, for optimization purpose, we had funding policy that was, well, that used to be centralized and then redistributed towards the different entities. The evolution of the regulation and the new liquidity ratios that are looming have triggered a change in this funding policy. And so, indeed, we are adapting the way we are working. And in this respect, of course, it's progressive. But we have progressively re-localized the funding policy, and especially as far as BNL is concerned, we have been able to reduce the funding of BNL by the group from &#x2013; well, almost &#x20AC;30 billion to &#x20AC;18 billion at the end June 2012.</p>
          <p>This is going to continue through ongoing securitizations through local retail bond insurances during &#x2013;  or the period we &#x2013; that BNL was issuing or selling &#x2013; were selling BNP Paribas bonds to its local Italian saving customer, asset savers. And so, now, we are resuming the issuance under the name of BNL so its re-localizing the long-term funding. And also, through an overall monitoring of the loans-to-deposit ratio, so we &#x2013; well, we expect this figure to keep going down progressively.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The Ukraine?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. That's about &#x2013; the Ukraine are representing now 9% of the total distribution of total outstanding loans of the Europe-Mediterranean division, so 9% of &#x20AC;23 billion, so it's the equivalent of &#x20AC;2 billion. So it's now relatively small. And the most important is that we have renewed the nature of those loans, so we are now less and less, now, mortgage loans, and we are replacing them more and more with the small short-term consumer loans due to our &#x2013; in hryvnia, denominated in hryvnia, while a significant part of our previous mortgage loans were denominated in our currency. And that created the risk. So this is completely stopped now. So we are lending short term in hryvnia, and also we are developing the corporate lending to subsidiaries of international corporate clients that are developing their business in the Ukraine. So, it's a much less risky business that is being developed progressively.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello. Good afternoon, everybody. Also, I've got three quick questions. The first one is on Belgium. I think you get your deposits rates on the savings deposit, so I would like to know if there will be margin uptick in your Belgian business in the next few quarters. So only, maybe, just quickly, to explain what the normalized run rate in the corporate center, because it seems it is relatively lower than what you guided for during the last quarter, so I mean I don't include that negative among the annual compared to a flat guidance. And if I may, just to explain quickly as well the &#x20AC;19 million sovereign losses that you booked in corporate center, because looking at your sovereign book portfolio, it has not decreased massively, or if anything, it decreased momentarily in the French and German and elsewhere, would get you &#x2013; you would have made gains in there. So, thank you for clarifying. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Thibault, regarding Belgian and the interest rates for deposits, we reduced it. As a matter of fact, from the 1st of April, about a 25 basis point on the main saving accounts. And we were more or less followed by the market. And it was in-line with the general evolution of interest rates. We didn't see any significant move in volume and in market shares, so it has been a successful move. Did I answer your question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more in order to see how much of the margin uptick is booked into this quarter, and how much more are we going see when it kind of fully booked for the quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, it was from the first of April, so you can consider that in the result of the second quarter, you had a full quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>The next question &#x2013; sorry</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there were two further questions...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So if I take the one on corporate center. So, a couple of things. On corporate center, we &#x2013; indeed, last time, we guided to zero, which was around zero. So that means, it can be bit above, it can be a bit below. And there's basically a slew of little things which are negative, which bring it a bit down &#x2013; a bit down. But I think there is one other important element that I need to guide you on, which is an element which is there and which might stay for a couple of quarters, and it has to do with the LTRO.</p>
          <p>I'll remind you that we took on-board the LTRO for a prudential stance, and that's why you also see it in our cash balance sheet. We've identified it as short term, we don't consider it as long-term. We took it out of, let say, prudential reasons, which basically means that it puts this product in competition with other repos and basically makes it more expensive, right? I mean, the LTRO, it's more expensive than you would have a typical repo. And that additional cost that comes out of this prudential stance, at this stage, we have booked it in corporate center. And it represent for this about, &#x20AC;55 million. And so, this was not into the guidance of zero, so you should take into account as long as we have the LTRO, that there will be something of a cost which will be into the corporate center.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Is it on a quarterly basis or...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And about the sovereign bond sales, it is the reason of your question, is that last time we gave the snap shot at the end of April, and so you don't see much difference between April and June. But indeed, we had sold a certain number of sovereign bonds in April, and this is why it cost us somewhat in the second quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, afternoon. I got a few questions, please. Just coming back to the &#x20AC;18 billion funding cap at BNL, obviously you've achieved that through securitization, but I just wanted to see if whether those assets, whether they would still remain denominated in euros if there was theoretical Euro break-up scenario, or whether they would be &#x2013; that would be devalued into say, Italian lira?</p>
          <p>Secondly, just coming back to Jon Peace's question about your capital adequacy, obviously it's very strong now and comfortably ahead of your target. What does that imply in terms of your strategy going forward with regards to dividends or growth or a special return of capital?</p>
          <p>And then thirdly, I think you've made some comments before as to the impact of the trading book review by the committee on your own market risk weighted asset. Would you able to comment on that again, maybe if you got some of the findings that you'd like to disclose? Many thanks.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, on the trading, I think you make reference to some of the documents that came out from Basel but this is something which will take time. It is not something we anticipate to happen. It's a process which we understand it will take years. So there is basically nothing you to say on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we are not going to answer to the first question. That is a kind of science fiction question. And maybe about the future policy on capital, I mean we think it's very important to have put Basel 3 behind us in terms of capital requirements. I think that, and you see, that a lot of us banks are still struggling to get there and are going to be either to dilute their shareholders' maturity or to be obliged to shrink their risk weighted assets significantly. And hence, to give way on their business. And so now, as far as we are concerned, we are going to be able to work for our clients, again, only, instead of working for the supervisor, so we are going to focus on our clients and on the midterm and until the issues kind of back to normal issues, so I think it's important.</p>

So there's probably an increase of &#x20AC;9 billion somewhere else, and I just wanted you to comment a little bit on where that happened. I saw some moves in the French Retail.

          <p>Okay. And then, to come back on the question on finance division, yes, cost of risk is down year-on-year but it's up 20 bps quarter-on-quarter. I just wanted to know there whether you see &#x2013; what do you expect on the short term?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>About finance, we have said in the slide that the figure of the first quarter was somewhat lowered by a one-off write-back. It's written on slide 11, bottom-right. And so, if you look at the trend, you should kind of adjust the figure of the first quarter because it's abnormally low. And the second quarter figure is more in the trend, so it's a downward trend but I would say going down slowly but steady.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no deterioration in asset quality on the Personal Finance, you expect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no. Not quite. I don't know the future, I mean this is a strong recession. But in the current situation, in the different countries where we operate, things are is quite okay and the cost of risk is moving slowly down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just final question on the Basel 3 impact, it seems you are now guiding for 160 bps if I exclude the 40 bps mark-to-market. You are getting a full 180 bps, so it's just a small decrease of 20 bps. Where have you seen the decrease mainly, just to understand where it comes from? And whether it &#x2013; we could expect potentially a river so long on some of those items in the coming quarters, or that's &#x2013; the 160 bps looks really, really clear for some quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Allow me to read it once again. If you picture yourself again, the flow that we've presented, we indeed talked about 40 bps and we talked about 180 bps. But you have to take the two. So when we said &#x2013; when we talked about 180 bps, that was the remaining impact of going into Basel 3 after we had taken into account the impact of sovereigns which are no longer still there. And at that time, we thought that the EBA was a good guidance, so we took 40 bps. So you should always have read it as 40 bps plus 180 bps. And so, by chance -and I know it's misfortune maybe. But by chance, the reality is as we look at it today for the sovereigns defined under EBA, it's 40 bps again. So, we're still at the same thing, so 40 bps plus 180 bps. As I said, it's 220 bps. But we also did Kl&#xE9;pierre, which immediately brought relief for 30 bps. So that is basically the 190 bps total impact, which if you subtracted from our Basel 2.5, you arrive closely to the 8.9% that we guided on.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Anke Reingen, RBC. Madam, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Anke from RBC. Good afternoon. I had three questions, please. The first one is coming back on the capital and the leveraging. Now, as you've almost achieved your risk weighted asset reduction target, I was just wondering what your view is on the balance sheet, given you also showed us the leverage that should be assumed on the balance sheet could potentially grow again, or is balance sheet or balance sheet reduction continues to be on your agenda.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the CIB division and the sort of like jaws, you gave us the adjusted cost development for FX, down 10% first half, first half, but I was wondering if you could give the similar on the revenue side. And then, also, because your cost base came down quite a lot in CIB in Q2, I was wondering the outlook for the rest of the year, would there be more of a reduction because of benefits of restructuring, or is it very much a function of revenues from here. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question, Anke, all the benefits of the plus savings due to the adaptation plan in CIB are not yet seen. We are in the process. I would say that on the course &#x2013; our adaptation plan on the cost side is there only for 70% or something like that. We still have 30% to flow in. And so, probably, we will see the dull effect only next year. There will be further improvements in the next few quarters, and the full effect will be seen in 2013. So there is still some improvement to come.</p>
          <p>The foreign exchange shift on revenues and CIB, we are looking at the moment.</p>
          <p>On your first question about the balance sheet, we &#x2013; well, you have seen &#x2013; we have put a slide with our leverage ratio somewhere in the appendices, and you have seen probably that we are now at 20 times. It's on slide &#x2013; towards the end, I think, slide 40. On slide 40, sorry. Yes, slide 40. So we are 20 times. And according to the way the U.S. are calculating this, meaning not taking the derivates into account, and also adjusted for intangible assets, so the U.S. way, we think that with the end of deleveraging, with the end of adaptation plan that is going to come in the next few quarters &#x2013; the next two quarters, probably will be below 20 by the end of the year probably.</p>
          <p>And what? And then, it's okay. I mean, if we have 19-some-senior-times, the U.S banks are in region of 15 times, but as you know, the way they are working is completely different and they are selling &#x2013; they're confirming mortgages to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and they are also selling their good consumer credit and securitizing them and selling them. And the B corporate are not borrowing from them at all, directly funding themselves through the market. So we are totally &#x2013; we are going to remain slightly over or significantly over the U.S. leverage, but that's below 20. We are quite well.</p>
          <p>And you know that the Basel 3 regulation is not &#x2013; requesting a maximum of 33 times, but 33 times after having taken into account the off-balance sheet commitments and the credit lines and liquidity lines and so on. That part is smaller in Europe compared with the U.S. So as far as we are concerned, while being at 20 times for the balance sheet part, it's going to be -we're going to be much, much below 30 times in total. So, we are going to be happy with that and we are going to stop focusing, really, on the size of the balance sheet. It's not going to become an issue or to be an issue anymore.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. My question is actually on sovereign debt holding. Because I saw some comments this morning, which I think you made during a press conference, that apparently you intend to reduce your holdings of sovereign debt and limit them to around &#x20AC;10 billion max by country. So I was just wondering, because obviously you are above these levels in your domestic country, so I was just wondering whether that means that you're going to keep up with the sale of sovereign debt, and whether this could make be, at least, partially offset the lower guidance that you're giving on deleveraging cost since you will potentially record some more losses on the sale of sovereign debt. And I was also wondering whether that will have consequence on your liquidity ratios. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. We are almost there. If you look at the figures on page 44, you see that as for France, we stand at &#x20AC;10.1 billion. So, it's up from &#x20AC;10 billion. Italy, &#x20AC;11.5 billion, it's not very distant either. And the most &#x2013; the biggest is Belgium, is &#x20AC;16.3 billion. But if you look at the last column on the right, you'll see that the group share is only &#x20AC;12.2 billion. And so &#x2013; well, and on top of that, from the Belgium side, the Belgium portfolio is shorter. I mean the maturity is lower compared with the two others. So we considered that the bulk of the effort is done now, and then we'll have the natural redemptions that are going to come. It's going to be enough not to replace the natural redemptions to get there. So we are not expecting any significant move now. And normally, it shouldn't be a lot of additional cost on that front.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, sirs. I was just wondering if you could disclose your non-sovereign credit exposures in Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland, as well as the related intra-group liquidity lines to fund your various businesses in those countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, we &#x2013; as far as Ireland, and by the way, Greece by themselves and in the countries, currently, a rescue plan by the EC, we have given a precise detailed figures in the actual interim financial statements. So I'd say you refer to the consolidated financial statement that has been posted this morning, and you will find all the details of those &#x2013; for those countries.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For the sovereigns.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For sovereign and &#x2013; for sovereigns, okay. Now, as far as non-sovereigns are concerned, we &#x2013; if we take Ireland and Portugal, we have very limited exposures. I think &#x2013; this is Greece, I'll start with Greece then. Greece, we are giving the figures on slide 36. So if you exclude companies that &#x2013; well, the shipping companies that have some Greek-related interest but are not dependent on the economic situation of Greece, our exposure of &#x2013; on non-sovereign Greek clients is &#x20AC;1.1 billion, of which &#x20AC;700 million for corporate and &#x20AC;400 million for individuals or &#x2013; mostly individuals. We &#x2013; well, through the Personal Finance and Wealth Management businesses. So this is very small.</p>
          <p>The figures for Portugal and &#x2013; figures for Portugal are very small as well. And so, we have figures in the region of &#x20AC;3 billion all together as far as corporate are concerned. And that one, that is around of the same magnitude for the Personal Finance business, plus a few other businesses.</p>
          <p>And then, on Ireland, we have extremely small figures. I think we are not really significant.</p>
          <p>And then, we come to bigger countries. As far as Spain is concerned, almost half of our exposure is on large Spanish corporates and institutions with international activities which offer a very satisfactory risk profile. So we &#x2013; I mean, we don't see that kind of exposure as being, really, bearing a lot of risk.</p>
          <p>And as far as Personal Finance is concerned, we have &#x2013; as you know, we have two businesses. We have a consumer finance business, and those figures are reported also in the Financial Stability Board report. And we have the consumer finance business, and we have a joint venture we signed from there in residential mortgages. The consumer finance doesn't show any deterioration at the moment, the total amount is something like &#x20AC;6 billion. And we don't have here &#x2013; we don't see any deterioration in the consumer profile.</p>
          <p>And this is due to the fact that I remember that we had some increasing cost of risk in that business in 2007. And at that time, we strengthened the scoring rules, going less profile. And so, now, we hold the whole existing portfolio, and it has been originally within this new guideline, and these are of good quality.</p>
          <p>And in residential mortgages, the situation is quite satisfactory, with a limited deterioration of the portfolio, but nothing really worrying. So this is &#x2013; and now in Italy, while you know that I have already answered a few minutes ago about the P&amp;L spending by the group that has been progressively reduced from &#x20AC;29 billion to &#x20AC;18 billion, and should continue to move down. And our credit exposure in BNL amounts to &#x20AC;70 billion, &#x20AC;32 billion in private individuals and &#x20AC;38 billion on corporate. There's a slide on page &#x2013; what? The detail is somewhere in the presentation in the appendices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And outside BNL within Italy, are there &#x2013; I mean, I get that there are some consumer loans, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, in domestic, we would continue domestic as well, with around &#x20AC;10 billion outstanding amounts. Very good quality, extremely profitable and no problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And is it fair to say that the intra-group liquidity lines to Spain is close to &#x20AC;20 billion, and that to Italy, if we take all your businesses in Italy, is closer to &#x20AC;40 billion?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For Spain, for such a figure, I don't think so. For Spain, we don't have a retail networks in Spain, and our exposure was &#x2013; let me look at it, it was &#x2013; a large part of &#x2013;  well, yes, indeed a large part of our credit exposure on Spanish clients is made out of &#x2013; well, they're lent outside Spain, to Spanish client elsewhere in Latin America or <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:04:30) through group branches. And the subsidiaries I have mentioned are funded through securitizations to a large part, and some local resources as well. So the overall funding gap of Spanish affiliates amounts to less than &#x20AC;7 billion, I would say, the main elements being the funding, the co-funding &#x2013; our share of the funding of the UCI, our joint venture with Santander.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">

          <p>Okay. It's very clear on Spain. And on Italy, sorry?</p>

          <p>Italy &#x2013; Italy, to the &#x20AC;18 billion I have mentioned, well, you should had in domestic, yes, it's &#x2013; and also, less in domestic also partly from the securitization. So while the figure must be somewhere, probably, in the mid-&#x20AC;20 billion, &#x20AC;25 billion or something like that if you add both.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone. Actually, I have a few follow-ups on the previous question, if I may. Regarding the funding of Italy, I'm sorry to be back on this again, but how much &#x2013; what is size of the amount of the bonds sold to retail clients in BNL at the moment, and to which amount do you plan going in the future?</p>
          <p>The second question is on the common equity Tier 1. Once you have achieved the 9% threshold, that means that all the future earnings plus dividend are going inflate the number. Then, to which level you call it stop, and does it change your previous scenario of a possible dividend policy with payment in share for 2012, at least?</p>
          <p>And the last question; is it possible to have the split in Q2 between the gains you made on the Reserve Based Lending asset sale and the losses you booked on the other asset sale in the CIB deleveraging process? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the last question, we can't confirm, sorry, but we committed not to disclose the price. The client asked price not to be disclosed, so we can't disclose it indirectly either.</p>
          <p>On the question about the &#x2013; well, going to question one, I have answered already to that question. I think capitalization is not going to be a concern anymore. So we are going to be back in normal life and not working just to build up a certain required level of capital. And this is going to give us much more flexibility than our competitors, and this is extremely important in the years to come. So, flexibility in the front area, and that's it.</p>
          <p>And on the funding of Italy, I think we have answered already to all these questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I was just wondering which amount you are thinking, you can arrive within the retail network of BNL by selling bonds. And the other question was, we can forget then the 20 bps you were mentioning in the slide in Q1 about the dividend payment in share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The dividend payment in share is clearly not going to be a must to get to 9%, most probably. So, as I said, some additional flexibility, and we'll see a tradition that is taken at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>About Italy, I think we don't want to give precise targets. We only say that we intend to keep reducing the funding from the mother company, given that the regulation imposes that we have to build 100% liquidity coverage ratio for BNL also. I mean, each subsidiary will have to comply with liquidity ratios on its own. So now, we have to re-localize the funding, and this is what we are going to do.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Just two quick questions. First question, I have noticed that when I look at your medium and long-term refinancing, the average maturity is 5.7 years compared to 6.7 years SocG&#xE9;n and 7.7 years with Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole. Does it mean that your financial strength give you the opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive regarding transformation, and thus structural competitive advantage in terms of profitability? That's my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question is what did you use as cost of equity in your impairment test on BNL? Because six years after the acquisition of this subsidiary, we must recognize that the profitability remains quite significantly below, I would say, 6%, 8%, which is certainly below the cost of equity and wouldn't &#x2013; judicious to make an impairment on the residual goodwill &#x2013; on the goodwill on BNL.</p>
          <p>And my last question would be, as you know, there has been, I would say, some up-sell with U.S. securitization regarding some beneficiary participation on some contracts &#x2013; collective contracts on personal loans and mortgage loan. What is your view on this legal case, please? Thank you.</p>

          <p>So, if we begin with the last one, so we took note of the decision by the so-called <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:01) regarding past regime between 1994 and 2007. Our understanding is two-fold. First, that what we think of what they have said as comments regarding this decision is not adequate, that it is some kind of over interpretation of the decision by <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:25). It doesn't create, and this is very important to stress, individual rights from clients to say we have a right on such or such participation. This is the first consideration.</p>
          <p>The second is that we are studying very precisely what are the exact implications of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:12:49). At this stage, our interpretation is that all the set-up we had with our clients is in line with what is implied by the decision of <mark type="indiscernible" /> (01:13:05). We studied very precisely with regards this, but we don't expect significant effects of this decision, what concerns our clients. Did I answer your question?</p>

          <p>Maybe not sure entirely if I understood the first question and the second question, but on the first one, indeed, what &#x2013; and let me remind you that you may know that we attract. Basically, as we said, we attracted it at level to basically use it to fund several of our activities. And to that extent, basically both to the pricing and the way we choose to do the funding is reflected in the overall tenure that we have.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I've understood the question. You were surprised by the fact that our average metric is lower than the maturity they're showing in Soci&#xE9;t&#xE9; G&#xE9;n&#xE9;rale and Cr&#xE9;dit Agricole for the same period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not surprised, I was just wondering if it's not the proof of the competitive advantage or something like that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe, maybe. I mean any case, the maturities are longer than in the past because of the regulation. And indeed, we &#x2013; in any case, all those maturities are much longer than what we need in reality. I mean of all of us, probably, the appropriate maturity at origination of our loans is in the region of rather four years or something like that, rather than six or seven years. If we brought that loan maturity, it's because we have to comply with the new regulation. Again, that is looming. I mean the future on net stable funding ratio, that is imposing some kind of reverse gap on banks, with the request that banks for longer maturities of what they lend. And then, it depends on the situation of each of the banks at the beginning, the rebalancing, if you want, or moving from some transformation into some results getting. The magnitude of the default depends on the starting point. And while I don't know about the others, as far as we are concerned, I mean we tend to issue on average in that kind of five to six years maturities, and we'll stick to that.</p>
          <p>It's of course in average. You have to bear in mind that it's an average, between 10 years issues and two years, it's an average.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Goodwill, well, the goodwill &#x2013; the current &#x2013; it's true that the current return on equity of BNL is not extremely good. But when you make the &#x2013; so the impairment test, as you know, we do that once a year, at the end of year, except when there are losses or obvious indications of impairment, which is not the case for BNL. And then, when you make the impairment test, you look at what is going to be the &#x2013; you don't just look at the current achievements of the subsidiary, but you look at the trend and at the outlook for profitability over time.</p>
          <p>And clearly, at the moment, the return equity of BNL is hammered two things. The first thing is that we are in a situation where the Italian economy is not good, so we are at the low point of the cycle. And this entail some additional cost of risk compared with the normal level or some lower revenues compared with a normal level. So this has to be &#x2013; when you'll make the conclusion, it has to be adjusted for that. And second, as you may recall, BNL is still in the standout approach, so the equity that is consumed by BNL is somewhat affected by the fact that we have not yet been able to move into the EFR approach. But we are now approaching to that. And normally, as the whole the test period and so on that has been imposed by the Italian &#x2013; the Banca d'Italia, so we should move into the other approach next year &#x2013; somewhere next year. So we are approaching the end of the tunnel to that respect. There are a lot of work, but it has been done and we are in the testing period and we should come to the switch over to the advance approach somewhere next year.</p>
