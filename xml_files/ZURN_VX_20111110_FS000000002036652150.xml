          <p>Good morning, or good afternoon. I am Stephanie, the Chorus Call operator for this conference. Welcome to the Zurich Financial Services Results Reporting for the Nine Months to September 30, 2011 Analyst Conference Call. Please note that for the duration of the conference call, all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded. After the introduction, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> This call must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mrs. Debra Broek, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, madam.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good day to everyone. Welcome to our call. I would just like to remind you that since for the last while we've been &#x2013; for the first and second and third quarters have been putting the video up on the system. We will just have a few short remarks before we go right into the Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>So first of all, it's my pleasure to turn it over to Martin Senn, our CEO.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Debra and thank you all of you for joining us today. Good morning, good afternoon and hello. I would like to welcome and introduce Pierre Wauthier, our new Chief Financial Officer who together with me will take questions later on after some introductory remarks as well from Pierre.</p>
          <p>Let me also make a point that we are pleased with the results we have just presented. I think the results highlight that we are in a strong position even though the economic environment is very challenging. We want to demonstrate these results, the success of our strategy and particularly, our focus on profitability and market risk mitigation.</p>
          <p>And with this short introductory comment, I'll hand over to Pierre. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Martin and let me say, I'm very pleased to be here presenting the nine months results for the first time. I know you've read and seen the slides and various disclosures so I'll be brief. Just as a reminder, we generated a strong Q3 net income supported by sound risk management actions. I think we delivered solid underlying operating results with continued focus on underwriting discipline. We're pleased to see improved growth in the third quarter supported both by good growth in the emerging markets and also seeing our actions to improve performance in mature markets paying off.</p>
          <p>We maintained the quality of our capital as well as our solvency, despite these volatile markets and this is very much in line with our risk mitigation strategy. And of course we remain focused on what we can control and we'll continue to execute on our strategy towards the delivery of our announced targets.</p>
          <p>And with that I am now happy to take questions from the audience.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>So this is Debra again and just a brief reminder as we go into the Q&amp;A. I would ask that you please keep your questions to two per participant at a time, so we can allow everyone to ask their questions because we do have a number of people on the line. So if I can turn it over to the moderator please.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> First question from Mr. Spencer Horgan will come from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Three questions for me. The first one is &#x2013; thank you very much for the update on the Swiss Solvency Test. It's actually quite comforting to stay still at such a healthy level. I was wondering if you could give us a perspective on where the balance sheet looks, for example, in the rating agency point of view, so under the Standard &amp; Poor's model. Is that any sort of a constraint at these levels? Is it sort of an alignment fee AA level, maybe you could give us a view there?</p>
          <p>But then the second one is a little bit detailed, I'm afraid. But if I try and back out what the combined ratio was in Germany in the third quarter, standalone, it looks like it's in the order of 130%. I know, obviously, the weather was fairly bad in Germany in the third quarter. But is there anything else strange going on in that number. And so where does this sort of restatement going on somewhere? So I'm just trying to understand what the underlying underwriting look like in Germany in Q3? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Spencer, thank you very much for your questions. So the first question is less SST, but I think you're wondering about the rating agency and our capital adequacy with regards to that. First of all, let me remind you that we enjoy very strong rating with Aa3 from Moody's perspective and AA minus from S&amp;P. We're also a A plus with A.M. Best and all of these ratings are with a stable outlook. And as you also know, we have a regular contact with <mark type="ph" /> NI (05:36) and the rating agencies, and we do not expect a change from that perspective. Moody's does not hold a formal capital adequacy model, and as I already indicated, believe that our rating is stable and we don't expect that to change. On the S&amp;P side, the pure capital adequacy is one of the many elements that S&amp;P takes into account for the rating. There are many other elements, such as interest coverage, such as the quality of capital that also take into account. Surely from a capital adequacy perspective, we're a little bit lower than the pure AA rating would indicate but as the rating agency itself says, the overall strength as well as the overall elements on leverage coverage et cetera easily offset that.</p>
          <p>With regards now to Germany, you indicated a combined ratio estimated of 130%. I will not &#x2013; I'll let you do your own calculation. But what you we need to understand indeed is there's a several things that have happened in Germany. One is that, we &#x2013; Germany has been affected by hailstorms of about $35 million in the third quarter. The other part is that we took a number of corrections. One is we re-evaluated the reserves, in particular, on five years for both medical malpractice and architect &#x2013; architect liabilities, sorry, of $100 million where we saw some further deteriorations in trends. And there's also some change in unearned premium reserve of about $50 million. So if you add all of these elements, it's a $185 million, which explains mostly all of the deterioration of the combined ratio. I think it's important therefore to stress however that all of these elements are one-offs in nature. We do not expect &#x2013; the strengthening was following a detailed analysis of that book, of course, catastrophes that's unpredictable. Does that answer your two questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks very much. Just on the S&amp;P, I think I'm right in saying as we have been slightly under the quantified level of capital for AA for a while, as mentioned otherwise hasn't really acted as a problem in the past?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct. I think I indicated that. It's not that far off. As I've said there are many other elements that more than offset that. S&amp;P also recognizes that they've got &#x2013; they're tied by their own model which does not take into account other elements, for example, they don't fully take into account SST ratio and that is also taken into account in the actual capital adequacy itself in terms of offsetting factors with regards to the pure number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question Mr. Brian Shea from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Two questions, please. First of all, on the life insurance BOP, just remind us what &#x2013; the Latin American acquisition that you announced this February, I don't think any of that is in the consolidation yet. If you just remind us on the kind of timeline for that entering the consolidation and any help at all if you give us in the mechanics of how that will affect the BOP would be great &#x2013; very, very, very much &#x2013; I'd be very grateful for that. I'm not asking for a forecast. It's more just the mechanics to help us quantify how the BOP is going to change and when Latin America comes online.</p>
          <p>And then secondly, the &#x2013; what is your new money yield? I'm trying to get a feel for how the running yield will be progressing as you go into 2012. I calculate the running yield of the nine-month stage as an annualized 3.7% and I just would be interested in hearing how the new money yield compares to that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hello Brian, so first on the Latin American acquisition. As you saw, we just closed all five countries and the last countries were done actually still this week. So we're very pleased with that. What will happen in terms of the consolidation process is that we will look to a consolidation really in 2012. So in 2011, this will be probably just one number that we will show.</p>
          <p>I think at this stage, it's a bit too early to give you any specific indications. What &#x2013; I think you can say is that the nature of the business should allow us to recognize quite quickly in BOP because these are short-term products. And so that should be indeed a significant contribution to BOP as well as new business value. And then, when we're ready we will give you the numbers.</p>
          <p>With regards to the new money yield, we're currently reinvesting and as you know, we have both life and non-life. So the average yield right now is around indeed the 3.8%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you for that. That does &#x2013; how.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, Brian, my mistake. Indeed, I thought it was also high. I'm giving you the running yield. Now the new investment yield on new money is actually around 3%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have it split out by life and non-life?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we do. It's a 2.5% in non-life and 3.4% in life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And yeah on running.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Two questions, could you tell us on the Solvency I update you provided, you're accruing a dividend &#x2013; on the SST ratio, can you tell us are you accruing flat dividend in that number as well in the same way you used to do with your economic capital ratio?</p>
          <p>Second question, I actually want to revisit Germany again. I mean, you described the reserving as one-off but it's being a consistent issue obviously not as much this year, but it was an issue last year to do after tax and <mark type="ph" /> net now (12:43). Can you tell us any other sort of reassurance that this won't continue to drag several quarters? What happened there is a severity issue, frequency issue, any sort of other color on that will be helpful. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Certainly, I'll be keen to answer that. First question, I think was the &#x2013; whether the SST ratio also included the accrued dividend, which in principle it does. So it's not different from Solvency I. And then on the second question, which was about the reserves, I think we &#x2013; specifically what we had and I think was already flagged as indeed a preliminary &#x2013; we increased the reserves on the architects and hospitals &#x2013; and that was already in 2011 based on the preliminary estimate. What we've done is we deepened the analysis, which then leads to further reserve increase. So that's what I meant by saying this one was specifically should be one-off. I am not sure what you're exactly referring to with regard to reserve increases specifically in Germany last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. It's actually earlier this &#x2013; no there were some last year, in  second half of last year as well I think.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On this issue, on the same class of business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, so it's my confusion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to be clear, what you're saying is that &#x2013; okay, the reserve was, say for argument sake, was started 12 months ago because it looks like the German combined ratio start to pick up from the second half. It was initial reserve and then there's been a final sort of additional or thorough analysis of the issue and that's what we're seeing in this quarter. Is that how I should think about it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's how you should see it indeed. And just sorry, I thought it was earlier this year, but I think it was last year. Sorry, I got mixed up with the time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And on &#x2013; back on the SST, is it still a good rule of thumb to take the SST and divide it by 1.8 to give us an idea of what your kind of internal old economics obviously number would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It does work as a general rule of thumb, yes. So &#x2013; we haven't made any significant changes to either model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I should also take up -- and remind you this is still provision of approval from FINMA. So there the final approval, as with many other Swiss companies, is more probably going to take place in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question from Mr. Andy Broadfield from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Two questions. I guess someone have picked up on the reinsurance cost later. But the first question, just remind me what the Farmers' surplus ratio, what are the sort of ranges do they try to run that? I'm just thinking quota share has been taken down as suggested, but it's a tougher world out there. And I'm just wondering what point you would stop considering presumably taking or potentially offering some more quota share capacity if that surplus goes down?</p>
          <p>Second question is the strong performance in the UK Corporate Pensions I think is predominant in the UK performance. Just interested, is Zurich paying commissions on that? And I guess the question to rise also we've seen from weaker performance in the UK for those that didn't pay commission value returns for RDR into 2012. Can you just let me know are you paying commissions and if so, what the transition period might be to fulfill to moving that in terms of the new approach and what you might consider to be the impact on growth and margin there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So your first question about the surplus ratio of the exchanges back in 2009, I believe -- but the point is when Farmers presented at the Investor Day, they indicated that the target range for the surplus ratio of the exchanges was in the 32% to 40% range. So I think you need to put therefore the 36% that we have at Q3 in context of that rate.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Corporate Life &amp; Pension, this is basically a growth that we're very pleased with that is happening not only in the UK but actually also internationally. We are using consultants and we do not take commissions with regards to the product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. You do not pay commissions. And can you just tell me roughly how much is in the UK if it's down that way internally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, I didn't understand the question...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How much of the Corporate Pension business is coming out of the UK and how much of it sort of from international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think this is detailed question, so IR will get back to you on that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Fine that's okay. Thanks so much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">

          <p>Next question from Farooq Hanif from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Just want to go back on the question on new money rights in the non-life business particularly. Could you remind us of the kind of the duration and the proportion of assets being reinvested every year? I should we get an idea of how to model that in the numbers, three months of that.</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the hedging gains and losses you had. Can you give us a little bit more detail on what came from where and what might have change in your hedging policy in the fourth quarter so that we can take that into account looking at market movements in the quarter-to-date, just an idea of what are the kind of one-off affects you might be looking at? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with regards to the new money yield, we basically have a duration of about 3.4% in General Insurance and about seven year in Global Life. As you know, we manage our assets with regards to our liabilities and we work around matching these within given guidelines. So the portfolios tend to be relatively stable. Of course, we may change that over time, but that has been relatively stable over time. So this is a duration not to be also mixed up with average insurance and which more five and seven plus.</p>
          <p>With regards to the hedges, the principle around the hedges is to protect the balance sheet. And so what you're seeing really in this quarter is that because markets have been very volatile, you're seeing gains being realized which is offsetting the drop in equity, for example, equity hedges. Some of these hedges are actually relatively old. The one with regards silicon, the destination portfolio which has a zero net income impact has been put in place all the way back in March 2010. The hedge that we have on our UK Life operations has also been in place for quite a while. The only one that's relatively recent is indeed the hedge on the euro stocks equity where we have indeed -- are looking into what we may be doing with that given the developments in the markets and as and when we change that that will be disclosed if material.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Maybe if you could clarify just what you mean there, in these hedges do you also have &#x2013; have you also sold upside? I mean what we see -- is there a risk of reversal as markets improve? And what is the further kind of gain that you get it markets for, just give an idea, I guess with the shape of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So absolutely. That &#x2013; because of the nature these markets improve. Our equity will increase but then you would see a partial reversal of that with regards to market movement. I forgot to mention one other hedge, which was actually to protect our German life book against lower interest rates. So we also thought a while ago some swaps and the impact of that would also be reversed if interest rates were to rise again. But that's generally good news for us that interest rate is rising. So we'd be quite happy about that.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon altogether. I have two questions please. The first one is about the claims. The charge is pretty material to 800 million more claim. The frequency is pretty high. And so my question is, is it already enough to figure a different stance towards reinsurance? Will you go for more insurance coverage going forward?</p>
          <p>And the second question is about the Thailand flood. Here if I am not wrong, looking at your reinsurance coverage, I think that you should have &#x2013; now the question is first, does it enter into the global program as a claim and businesses like this, is it that you will have a first claim link of 250, which is your attention? On top of that, some 750 million coverage of some reinsurance company. And then on top of that you will face the claim on top of that, and of course, first question is if you are affected at all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So thank you for your question. So I think there should be the structure of the reinsurance on page 11, which I believe is what you're referring to. I know it's half year number. Okay, so we had it at half year. Our philosophy with regards to our reinsurance strategy -- compared to that, I don't believe is meant to change. We may make some marginal adjustments to that structure but this is a structure that has worked well in the past. That actually is working also quite well this year. For example, the aggregate cover that we put in place is because of the high frequency is now entering into its end phase. We have booked actually in the first quarter close to 50 million in reinsurance recoverable.</p>
          <p>With regards to Thailand, I think it's really early to give you an answer of how this can really turn out. So it's really recent day and we're evaluating &#x2013; actually, we're not sure we are even in the position to start evaluating other claims look like because the areas are still flooded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. In that case, I was unprecise on formulating my question. Irrespective if you are affected or not or how big you are affected, is the reinsurance program that you have covering also Thailand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It should be covered in the international top layer yeah because there's no exclusions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So it included &#x2013; so $250 million as a first hit and then 750 per protection and on top of that, all the rest at your charge, correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but what you have to understand is the global aggregate had cover is in euros already to the first 25 I think. And therefore, it's not the international layer that you should look at but the global aggregate whether the threshold is much lower.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Stefan Schuermann from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So I have two questions. First one is on the restructuring charges you basically booked in non-life and life. If I'm not mistaken, it's like a $134 million in Q3 for non-life and then $97 million in life. Should we expect more to come here for the rest of the year?</p>
          <p>And the second question is basically on reserve releases. I think growth is $300 million in Q3. Could you maybe just give us some insight where the biggest movements happened? I mean, we heard that Germany was basically accounted for $100 million negative. Where were the positives really coming from?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'll answer the reserve releases first. Look the reserve releases come from mainly across the board. Yes, we do take a fresh view. Where we did see some strengthening actually is in this areas such as Germany as we mentioned as well as in the U.S. in workers' comp.</p>
          <p>Releases are really based on our reserve review, and we're seeing our underwriting discipline continuing to <mark type="ph" /> point us (27:21) give us some favorable development. The thing perhaps also Stefan is that from a reserve margin perspective, we believe these are &#x2013; actually there's no change at all in our reserving philosophy.</p>
          <p>With regards to the restructuring charges, there are several in GI, particularly this is related to building our future strategy, which is a strategy that we've communicated earlier about reviewing re-underwriting and all the measures that we are taking in order to further combine ratio effective and more effective.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But should we expect more to come here or?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our strategy is evolving and as we develop it, there could be some further restructuring charges, but it's too early to give any indication here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I hope you can hear me on my mobile. I has a little problem on my phone, so I hope you can hear me. I have two questions. The first one is on the underlying loss ratio. That's in your lovely workflow chart. It was 64.2% at the six months and 64.4% at the nine months, so it was. And I didn't like that. I was thinking, hang on, you first accounted non-increases. So I'm just wondering what happened there and what should we expect to happen? In other words, was it to do with Germany or to me that was quite mysterious. The impression I had, if there was such a big improvement in the six months, it is almost as if what we've done that for the year and any more would be for next year. So that is my first question.</p>
          <p>And the second, is on the &#x2013; so you reduced your exposure to Italy a bit, roughly from $7 billion to just under $6 billion, and I just wondered if you realized a loss during that. You have increased certain unrealized loss selling in Italy, so and where would I see it in the accounts? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, Michael. Yes, we can hear you very well. Thank you. So I hope you can also hear us as mobile communications don't necessarily work both ways.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to the underlying loss ratio, so if you look actually sideline that we indicate the total products, so our underlying loss ratio in Q3 was 64.7%, certainly not as good as in Q2. I can assure you that GI is not resting on their lows. And what really is triggering that I think is two points. One is I don't think you can expect even an underlying ratio to stay flat and behave properly in a very, very regular line. There will be ups and downs.</p>
          <p>The second is, as you thought, indeed there is some of the reserves and with some of the events in Germany that has been also affecting that ratio to the tune of around 0.4%, so that also has an impact. So I think what's really important is -- keep in mind is that we were running at an underlying loss ratio of around 66% last year. And we're now running at somewhere around 64%. And there is definitely more in store in terms of improving both the loss as well as the expense ratio in terms of identified actions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question was on Italy. So just to remember, we had $8 billion at the end of Q2 -- dollars. With regards to Italy, we reduced that to $5.7 billion at the end of Q3. This is mostly due to an active reduction of our Italian exposure. And we did not incur any significant losses as we did that. And then most then of the variation that would be flowing from that point would be going to equity as these are available for sale securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just I understand so the change in value of 5.7 would go to available for sale and you didn't realize any significant loss -- reduced imposition.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is correct because we did that more in the June, July period rather than the September period. So that was good timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi. I actually was also wondering about the underlying but I think it's been discussed. Just on the prices, you mentioned in your presentation that workers' comp increased 9% in third quarter. Just wanted to get that right whether now that is just like of getting claims inflation in your view or is it &#x2013; is that now going to flow in some form or the other in these underlying loss ratios?</p>
          <p>And this is a broader question as well that the continuous price momentum last two quarters, in fact last three quarters, positive price momentum in any fee, is that at some point in your minds coming to &#x2013; going to flow into this underlying level or not? I think that's really the main question. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look the 9% is really, as you know, we did take some reserves strengthening in the workers' comp line. So the price increases reflect what we believe is necessary to write this business profitably and meet our return hurdles. As you know, this is also a general philosophy that we write business so that we meet our hurdle and that is pretty much what we're doing across the board. So the rate increases we're taking is in order to achieve that together with the underwriting rate actions. As we take this rate increases, we obviously take into account expected claims inflation, which does vary from line-to-line. And what we're seeing in the workers' comp is trends that are probably partially linked to the economic environment that are trending higher. And this is why we are reacting and as you know, we've been reacting and as you know, we've been reacting faster than the competition. I wish I could tell you yes, we're increasing by 9%, the current trends are completely flat and we're going to make fantastic products -- profits but that is not the case where just writing to meet our hurdle.</p>

          <p>Next question from Mr. Michael Klien from Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I had two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the high amount of realized gains that came through in the P&amp;L. I think the gross amount or the number was about $1.6 billion and about $1.1 billion attributable to shareholders.</p>
          <p>And now my question is how much of this come through to the bottom line or go through into -- earnings is about $730 million. Am I right in this number? And if yes, how would this be splitted in terms of the various areas of the realizations gains? Or in other words, are there some of the hedging that you do is not perfect in terms of movements on the derivatives, on the hedges going through the P&amp;L not being perfectly offset by the other side?</p>
          <p>And my second question is, maybe a little bit less important, but I saw in the Swiss business on the Life Insurance side, strong growth, could you give a little bit indication where it was primarily coming from? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it was a long question. I think I got the one on the realized gains. I would appreciate if you could repeat your question on the Swiss business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, on the Swiss business, if I look at the APE numbers, they're up something like 44% and the new business value is up even stronger year-over-year. So I'm just wondering which product has been driving this and how the profitability has changed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Right. So first of all, on the realized gains, your assumption of the $1 billion being about $700 million to the bottom line is actually a very good estimate. You have a reconciliation table from BOP to NIAT, which gives you that detail. What you have to take into account then as you move from your BOP to your NIAT is on page 20 of the financial supplement is you have the $720 million is the portion of the capital gain do flow to the bottom line, and then there are some restructuring and similar adjustment that are also negatively impacted and then of course, you've got the tax which then gets you back to the $1.2 billion.</p>
          <p>And then you can look at how this impacts this with the line, so the realized gains is mostly in Life where you got $384 million and the other is the other operating business $260 million. This one is linked to a realization of gains because some of the hedges are held centrally. And then there are some smaller gains in GI and very small ones in non-core businesses.</p>
          <p>With regards to the Swiss business, this is primarily driven by the Corporate Life &amp; Pensions. So as you know, that goes back to my earlier comment that we're very pleased with the progress we're making and this is a product where we've got a very strong proposition, which allows us to earn business in Switzerland, in the U.K as well as in emerging markets. Is that all...</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon to everybody. I have two questions left. I would like to have some color on loss inflation trend in your &#x2013; in your U.S. commercial lines business, you mentioned some details regarding the worker's compensation business we would like to have some overall picture of your net North American commercial business.</p>
          <p>My second question, if you can provide us some details regarding deferred acquisition cost in your Life business, the variation during the first nine months as well the other items in life business spreading profit in nine months also? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Loss inflation trends &#x2013; I think the worker's comp is really the one that we're seeing the most. I think general liability we're still seeing some very live trends. This is something we're watching very carefully though. Otherwise, property that's really car repairs, some repairs nothing very special there.</p>
          <p>With regard to DAC, one thing that I think is worth highlighting is that the UK licenses has been affected indeed due to the fact that there's mostly unit-linked business and that as equity markets went down, that has a negative impact on the DAC amortization. This, however, is offset not in BOP but in NIAD indiscernible] and by a hedge that we had put in place. So again, economically, that reduction is offset, but it does not show into the accounts. And that's an impact of about $50 million.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I have two questions please. The first one relates to the small charge you took in connection with you uncovered &#x2013; in the conversion of your books from German GAAP to IFRS.</p>
          <p>Can you give us a bit more background here for us to understand the context of how the mistake came to light? And I'm curious to see what the next part of the a broader process, Pierre, that you put in place coming in as a new CFO and whether is a risk of uncovering same errors in other business units.</p>
          <p>And the second question has to do with your North American commercial business. I note in the video presentation that you alluded to the weakness in the construction and auto sectors to explain the lack of momentum in premium growth, for instance, in North American commercial.</p>
          <p>But frankly, it's been a number of years now. Those two industry sectors has been experiencing very significant pressure and our understanding were big for Zurich back in 2007. By now, when you would expect Zurich to have gained share in other industries? So can you give us a bit more color as to what is being done to reduce your reliance on those industry sectors in North America?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So first to your first question, HGB to IFRS. What will happen is that we uncover some in the conversion of our books from German GAAP i.e. HGB to IFRS, which affected a variety of our loss reserves on premium reserve and for acquisition cost. This was, however, purely on very specific product where we restated prior periods.</p>
          <p>So the thing that you need to keep in mind is, first of all, that HGB and IFRS are probably among the most different accounting treatments or conventions and therefore, there are more adjustments than in other. Other one to remember is that this is very specific to complex products. So as a result, we see this as being rather a unique event. Frankly, you're giving me too much credit for having identified and corrected this. However, I think it's important to note this is something that was uncovered by management, and we correct the entries as we uncover them in the interest of transparency and being open.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The other question on refinancing, construction and automotive, look, obviously, we do our best in terms of moving the business. You have to keep in mind, we are one of the major insurance companies in the U.S. Actually, we will be &#x2013; Zurich will be 100 years old next year, so we've been there a long time. We obviously tried to develop the business and have also a very developed relationships in many other sectors and our book of business will evolve as the economy is and where we see opportunities.</p>

          <p>Would you repeat the question? I'm not sure I understood it very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, with your government bond exposures to Italy, Spain Portugal and the like. Could you give us some idea of what sort of level of unrealized losses you're currently carrying on these holdings? And of that, how much of that goes straight to shareholders' equity and how much can be absorbed by policyholders sort of underway?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So these peripheral bonds, there are some details on Page 52, but in essence, these bonds are available for sale. So the variation in the market value will flow through equity, will not flow through P&amp;L. It will only flows to P&amp;L as we sell these bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And being available for sale, they are therefore mark-to-market. So the market &#x2013; that value that we have in our books, reflects then the market value that we had at the end of September.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and I think you cannot, at this point in time, ascertain to what is the proportion that goes to shareholders or policyholders. That depends on how the book develops. The only thing I can say is that with regards to views on government and supranational, the split is we have 28% in General Insurance and about 70% in Global Life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the market value you disclosed, how do they compare to the book values of the bonds? And sorry of the price of the bonds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So you have some more details on the Slide 52 of the nine months results if you would like to have a breakdown per country.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">

          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Did you have another question or was that not clear enough or.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will take the next question from Maarten Altena from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen, two questions also from my side. First is also on European peripheral debt. Would you be able to comment on your European peripheral strategy in the fourth quarter? And should we suggest the positions have remained stable into the fourth quarter since during the second quarter results, you mentioned you have lowered your Italian exposures into the third quarter already. And that's my first question.</p>
          <p>The second is more or less a follow-up on the previous one but then on the subordinated bank bonds of $3 billion. There's more small trenches I got from the video call, which is good, obviously. Would you be able to comment on the unrealized revaluation reserve that is attached to these subordinated bank bonds so we can see more or less at what value they are trading right now? That's it. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So just to keep things in context, just &#x2013; well, like as a reminder, our exposure to the PIGS countries is $12 billion, which is about 6% of our total investment. So it's relatively limited. And we got most of it in Italy and Spain. The strategy I think will really depend on the risk return. As I mentioned, we've got a disciplined approach. We look at &#x2013; we have a certain appetite for some risks and then we look at the relative risk return that we have.</p>
          <p>I mean ultimately we have $200 billion we must invest them somewhere. And where we look at is where we believe we've got an appropriate risk return strategy. The principals also are not going to change. It will remain stable i.e. that we have a disciplined ALM approach and that we will keep a high quality to our portfolio and we will keep it diversified.</p>
          <p>In the end, we think this is the best way of protecting our risks. You see it, for example, indeed in our subordinated debt exposure where it is very split between many counterparties. As a general principle, the lower we get into the credit rating, the lower the amount per single counterparty, so that we minimize any big risk.</p>
          <p>So what we will do in the fourth quarter, we'll see whether markets develop and we'll adjust the portfolio as we see the best risk return profile. I think it's extremely difficult especially in those volatile markets to predict. Wish I had a crystal ball, but yeah &#x2013; wish also you had a crystal ball unfortunately, we don't.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so much agree with it. And maybe -- well I think it's right to assume that the unrealized <mark type="ph" /> REVO (05:29) attached to the subordinated bank bonds is rather well substantially negative I would say though?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that number with me. So you can -- I would suggest you go to IR and ask for a clarification on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers, really helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the important thing is the market price is already reflected in our equity number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We'll take one more question then.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question Mr. Ren&#xE9; Locher from MainFirst. Please go ahead sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. Well, just a follow-up question on Italy and Spain. I mean just wondering are you forced &#x2013; no it could be other way around. I mean, you have still quite a substantial amount of Italian bonds in Q3. Now I'm wondering what kind of investment do you use in all the assets at the balance sheet to match Italian liabilities?  Or again, are you forced by Italian or Spanish insurance law to hold Italian or Spanish bonds? Or could you have an interest in euro, you could just sell all Italian, Spanish bonds and reinvest them only in German bonds. So that's I might believe it <mark type="indiscernible" /> (51:44) but I'm just wondering if that would work?</p>
          <p>And then, second question I was a little bit too aggressive on these unrealized capital gains reflected in equity. So perhaps if you could give me how much of that was the covered bond portfolio appreciation then how much was negative on credit spreads and how much was the equity portfolio re-evaluation? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Ren&#xE9;. And so on the Italian bond, I think, the few principles. We, of course, comply with the local regulations and laws. Our principle is that we match domestic assets and liability not completely in the specific case of Italy, our liabilities are actually greater than our -- then the amount of Italian bonds we have. I mean, generally speaking, if we do go towards the mismatch then it would go towards moving to a higher quality of assets in that regard.</p>
          <p>With regards to the unrealized gain, there were several impact, I mean, broadly speaking what we did see is an increase in the unrealized gains on the government bond portfolio, which was partially offset by a decline in equities. And there is also some impact on the increasing credit spreads. But the two big movers are really the government bond increase and the lower equities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you give me a figure or I can get in touch with IR, if that's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You can get the details from IR.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that's fine. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I think then that concludes our Q&amp;A time. And I will turn it back over to Martin then for closing remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Debra and thank you very much Pierre. Also thank you to everybody calling in for joining us today. As for the aspect this has been, I would say, solid performance in a challenging environment, which will leave us well positioned for the future. And I must say, I feel good about the strong result and I also feel very good about the strong growth we have in net income.</p>
          <p>What is very important and I think some of the question have been alluding to us remains focused, disciplined in everything we do and particularly, I take the last question with regard to management activities. We got to keep calm hands here, not trying to be influenced by mark-to-market. Our strategy in investment management is very clear and straightforward. We manage assets as well as liabilities. We do that on a very constructed basis. If the risk reward ratio is changed, then we act but we always act in a way where we keep the overall balance of the portfolio in place and take that as well to get maximum diversification benefits. And that is really the key and that's what has basically helped our diversity since the financial crisis has broken out and this will help us as well, no matter where the current price is leading to.</p>
          <p>So we continue to expand our presence and size in fast growing, emerging markets. With that, we also maintain a strong position in material markets. And probably, most importantly, and I here tie back to what they have talked before in these days, in these times our capital insolvency position has to remain strong and that is also the basis of hedging given whenever they are necessary.</p>
          <p>And with that I hope to see you all at our Investor Day in early December. It's on December 1. I hope you have all saved the date and I would like to thank you again for joining us today. I wish you a good day and good luck in the markets. Thank you very much.</p>
