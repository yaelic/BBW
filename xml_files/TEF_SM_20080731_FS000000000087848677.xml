      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you Mar&#xED;a, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for attending Telef&#xF3;nica's first half 2008 results conference call. During the Q&amp;A session you will have the opportunity to ask questions directly to our Executive Committee.</p>
          <p>Also I have today here with me Julio Linares, our Chief Operating Officer; Guillermo Ansaldo, the Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a; also Jos&#xE9; Mar&#xED;a &#xC1;lvarez-Pallete, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Latinoam&#xE9;rica, and Matthew Key, Head of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe. During the first six months of the year, we have posted a set of strong earnings and we are fully on track to fulfill our 2008 guidance. Our differentiated profile in the industry on the back of our unmatched diversification, our integrated business model and our proven track record of execution has allowed us to deliver these superior results. Organic, year-on-year growth rates across the P&amp;L not only remained robust, but have even picked up notably in the second quarter at all time in operating income level, showing our capacity to maximize efficiency. In Europe, we have recorded solid results clearly outperforming our competitors in our major markets.</p>
          <p>Latin America delivered a very strong performance, consolidating its position as the major growth engine of the group. Group margin continue to expand with significant improvement in mobile in Latin America and an outstanding profitability in Spain. The strong performance across regions is combined with the high financial flexibility, which along with limited M&amp;A ambitions allow us to further accelerate the execution of our 2008 share buyback program.</p>
          <p>As of mid-July, we have already executed 68% of the program showing our commitment to prioritize shareholder returns when deciding about the use of our high free cash flow.</p>
          <p>In slide number four, we show the summary of our first half 2008 P&amp;L. Reported year-on-year growth rates in nominal terms have been negatively impacted by changes in the parameter of consolidation, forex and the capital gains on the sale of Airwave registered in Q2 of '07. However, focusing on organic growth rates and excluding the impact from capital gains, in Q2, we recorded a strong acceleration from Q1 figures, ramping up from topline to operating income and further strengthening our distinctive profile.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth remained solid at 6.7% in the first half of the year while OIBDA year-on-year growth picked up in the second quarter standing at 12% in the first half of the year versus 8.2% after March. Operating income rose 24% in organic terms in the first six months of the year, up 7 percentage points compared to the first quarter. As a proxy to cash flow generation, operating cash flow in the first of the year topped over &#x20AC;7.6 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number five, we show that the January to June 2008 net income almost reached &#x20AC;3.6 billion, below the 2007 reported figures, but up 29% on last year figures. It was due to the impacts from asset disposals Airwave and Sogecable in both periods. Reported earnings per share reached &#x20AC;0.767 per share posting a 32% underlying year-on-year growth excluding the impact from PPA, EPS would have reached &#x20AC;0.843. Despite an unfavorable year-on-year comparison, reported free cash flow per share rose to &#x20AC;0.731 per share in the first half of 2008 versus &#x20AC;0.725 per share in the same period of 2007.</p>
          <p>The strength and reliability of our operating and financial performance underlines the value of our high diversification as outlined in slide number six. Managing a whole diversified portfolio of assets as an integrated group is key to build a top-quality profile, as it allows us to extract the full potential of businesses at different stages of development to limit risks and volatility at the group level and to export synergies across operations and geographies. Customer expansion remains strong in the first half across all growth levers namely broadband, mobile and pay TV both in high double-digit growth rates.</p>
          <p>In Q2 of '08, we added close to 12 million customers, 8 million excluding the acquisition of Telemig in June with more than 245 million accesses at the group level or 15% above last year's figure with an outstanding customer growth across regions. In addition, our initiatives capture more value, for more customers are prospering with 38% of our total accesses have been voice, broadband and TV bundles.</p>
          <p>Latin America has consolidated its position as the main growth engine of the group. Our operations in the region already account for 37% of consolidated revenues versus 35% a year ago, while they already represent 34% of the group OIBDA.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number seven for the review of the contributions to group growth rates by geographies. Latin America emerges once again as a key differentiating factor of our performance recording outstanding results. These regions' revenues and OIBDA increased by 12 and 16% year-on-year in organic terms. In addition, the healthy topline expansion and the efficiencies achieved both in Spain and the rest of Europe allowed to deliver best-in-class organic growth rates at the group level. From the business perspective, mobile and fixed broadband are the main growth drivers with a 26% year-on-year organic increase in mobile broadband revenues and a 14% year-on-year organic growth in fixed broadband sales.</p>
          <p>Turning to profitability and cash generation in slide number eight, we show our continuous focus on cost management along with the benefits of our scale in our integrated business models are driving the expansion of OIBDA margin at the group level. Organic OIBDA margin stood at 38.2% in the first half of the year, 180 basis points above last year's figures. In nominal terms margins for our key divisions range from the 29% of Telef&#xF3;nica Europe to a solid 50% of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a. We have a proven track record in managing both OpEx and CapEx preserving cash flow generation.</p>
          <p>In the first half of 2008, operating cash flow was up 13% year-on-year in organic terms. The high cash flow generation in the European region that topped the &#x20AC;5.3 billion to June, up 15% year-on-year organically came from the growing contribution of our Latin American operations, which posted an operating cash flow of &#x20AC;2.3 billion, 7.7% higher in organic terms than a year ago.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number nine for an update on guidance. The growth reported in the first half of the year for all metrics we have guided on are fully aligned with the year-end targets, despite the headwinds from more challenging operating conditions in Europe, as we leverage our diversified portfolio, our integrated business model and our strong execution skills. Under guidance criteria, consolidated year-on-year growth rates in revenues, OIBDA and operating income were 7.1, 8.7, and 17.2% respectively within the guidance ranges. CapEx up to June stood close to &#x20AC;3.5 billion. However, mainly due to a seasonality these figures should not be annualized as an estimate for the full year.</p>
          <p>Delivering on guidance is an objective the whole group is committed to with all three regions across the group being on track to meet their guidance as the slide number ten shows. We reiterate our 2008 guidance both for the group and for the three regions. In Spain, we are better positioned versus our competitors to face the current environment leveraging our strengths. We are the market leader and this allows us to influence market performance. At the same time, we reap the benefits of being an integrated player with a better quality customer base and a strong track record of successfully executing efficiency measures.</p>
          <p>Let me now walk you through the operating and financial performance by regions starting with Spain. Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a posted solid results in the first half of '08 with revenues to June up 2.1% on a comparable basis. Wireline revenues recorded a very robust performance increasing 2.5% in the second quarter and 2.2% in the first half on a comparable basis. Most of the businesses improved slightly quarter-on-quarter. Internet and broadband revenue continued as the main growth driver with a steady year-on-year growth rate above 10% both in Q2 and for the first half.</p>
          <p>While as revenue growth decelerated versus the first quarter strongly impacted by a significantly different year-on-year revolution of wholesale and handset sales revenue and a 0.7 percentage points slowdown in customer revenue growth will still continue to grow at a healthy 2.7% in the second quarter of '08. Roaming and interconnection revenues were down mainly on target reductions and volume discounts. Handset sales decreased year-on-year as we have now a more linear profile of handset upgrades for us over the last year's handset activity was greater in the second and fourth quarters of the year. Let me remark that we have not noticed any significant change in the handset upgrades cycle.</p>
          <p>The combined picture of wireline and wireless shows a solid performance underscoring our more defensive profile and the fact that although we are not immune to the current operating environment being an integrated player has a significant value. Our top priority, maintaining our customer base to sustain future revenue growth, is reflected in the true contention across mobile, broadband and TV services. We are capitalizing our leading position in high-value segments where our share is significantly above our total market share. We are capturing changes in usage patterns in both fixed to wireless and wireless to fixed substitution. Corporate clients and public administrations are positively valuing our integrated approach and our integrated distribution channels are proving very successful not just on cost efficiency terms, but on upselling every  opportunity as well. The differentiating factors are showing on the topline but will be more clear further down the P&amp;L, as you can see is slide number 12.</p>
          <p>Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a's OIBDA is growing ahead of revenues even <mark type="inaudible" /> factors affecting year-on-year comparisons. Our capabilities to manage the cost side are showing up in the margin evolution within almost 4 percentage points improvement versus the first six months of '07 to reach a 50.1% benchmark margin or 49.2% excluding one-offs. These enhanced profitability shows the benefits of cost-cutting measures taken in 2007, a continued focus to enhance efficiency across businesses and synergies derived from fixed and mobile integration. Noteworthy is the sequential margin improvement in our wireless business from 43.7% in Q1 of 08 to 45.4% in Q2 of 2008, but not only margins are benefiting from further efficiencies achieved. Operating cash flow in the first half of '08 grew at an almost 2% rate already exceeding the &#x20AC;4 billion by midyear.</p>
          <p>Slide number 13 reviews the wireline business evolution through its KPIs. The Spanish traditional access market keeps posting some growth rates close to 2%. However the continued activity in unbundling with a change in unbundled load approach towards the naked share model already seen in Q1 of '08 plus an increased pressure from direct access competitors have resulted in a line loss of 172,000 accesses in the quarter with total lines decreasing 1.6% year-on-year. Though we expect this trend -- despite this trend is to continue throughout the year, we are confident to remain within the long-term target of losing up to 2% on a CAGR basis from 2006 to 2010, placing the company as a benchmark in terms of limited line losses.</p>
          <p>In broadband, the market keeps growing at a lower pace than previous years, though trends have improved over the last six months and we continue to strengthen our leadership with an estimated share over 57% by the end of June. Broadband ARPU posted a solid performance with the year-on-year decline of 3%. In pay TV there are no major changes in terms of client growth, while our efforts to drive double and triple play adoption are progressing steadily, pushing up total ARPU 3.5% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Please turn now to slide number 14 to review our wireless operations in Spain. In a highly competitive market, with 113% penetration rate, our focus remains on high-value customers with over 61% of our customer base being contract. Contracts and net adds reached 311,000 in the quarter leveraging our benchmark churn rates, which remains stable at 1.1%. Despite a flat MOU versus the second quarter of '07 with a better performance versus the first quarter of '08 due to consumption forcing initiatives ARPU declined 6% in the quarter and 5% in the first half.</p>
          <p>Incoming voice ARPU was down 14% in both second quarter and first half of 2008 due to the 16% currently move on to initial rates over the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>Total outgoing ARPU decreased 4.8% in the second quarter and 3.6% in the first half impacted by several factors. One, the different profile of promotions, whereas in the second quarter of '07, there were no promotions. In Q2 of '08, we're having the effect of the Christmas promotion is not specific commercial to  stimulate usage. Two, the higher penetration of lower-priced type schemes launched last year for the residential segment, which are impacting ARPU but having a positive impact on churn levels. Three, changes in usage patterns since our segments of the consumer market -- the consumer market optimizing their usage by shifting to cheaper voice and data options, such as SMS.</p>
          <p>In other countries, data ARPU continues to record a very strong performance with outgoing data ARPU rising over up 10% versus last year, both in the second quarter and in the first half of '08. The healthy boost in connectivity revenue, up over 55% in the second quarter year-on-year along with a strong push in content SMS due to the <mark type="inaudible" /> taking place over the second quarter -- second half of '08 drove the 16% year-on-year growth of data revenues, 12% <mark type="inaudible" /> of SMS volume continues strong.</p>
          <p>For the fourth consecutive quarter, we have led the growth in the 3G market, and now more than 1 out of 5 customers have a 3G handset.</p>
          <p>In slide number 15, we start the  review for Latin America properties. We continue our focus to capture growth in the main fields, the mobile business and two higher growth areas in the fixed business, namely broadband and pay TV. Accesses expanded across markets and businesses reaching 148 million accesses were up 21% on June of '07. Telefonica Latin America posted solid revenue growth exceeding the &#x20AC;10.5 billion mark in the first half of the year up over 12% in organic terms driven by the robust growth rates recorded in mobile, Internet and TV revenues. By countries, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina contribute each with more than 2 percentage points to revenue growth.</p>
          <p>I'd like to highlight the performance of our businesses in Argentina under <mark type="inaudible" /> strong acceleration in revenues in the mobile division as well as in the wireline operation. OIBDA year-on-year growth rate in Q2 picked up significantly versus the first quarter of '08 leading to a close to 16% growth in organic terms in the first half or four percentage points higher than the first quarter. This performance was driven by the strong acceleration in mobile OIBDA and the better performance of the wireline operations. By country, Venezuela and Mexico contributed over four percentage points to OIBDA growth each. The OIBDA margin expanded 120 basis points year-on-year to 36.4% despite the higher commercial activities across all businesses.</p>
          <p>In slide number 16, we show an overview for Latin America wireless businesses. Please notice that that from -- this is from last April to <mark type="inaudible" /> is included in our figures. The company had close to 4 million customers at that date. In organic terms wireless net adds in Q2 reached 5.8 million, up 17% year-on-year driven by robust gross adds in most markets which is to that over 14 million, of the back of the successful commercial campaigns and churn contained in the region.</p>
          <p>Growth in gross adds was special remarkable in Brazil and Colombia. It is worth highlighting the strong growth recorded in the region despite the increased penetration versus year ago. Total wireless customer base surpassed 113 million, a 22% increase in organic terms with double-digit growth rates in most single market and a very strong performance in Brazil, Mexico and Peru. Customer growth in Argentina and Chile was outstanding, despite the high penetration levels reached in these markets.</p>
          <p>The weight of GSM continued to increase to 72% of our customer base between 12 percentage points rise versus June of '07. ARPU performance in constant terms was impacted by this strong customer expansion, commercial promotions and lower mobile termination rates. Outgoing ARPU performance continued to be strong approximately 2.7% year-over-year organic increase in cost and currency boosted by the 23% advance in outgoing minutes of use and higher data usage. Data revenue recorded strong growth rates 41.5% year-on-year, increasing their contribution to total revenues to 14% in the first half of '08 up over 2 percentage points versus year-end of '07. Data revenue continues to show a strong growth potential leveraging the introduction of 3G services and the development of wireless broadband.</p>
          <p>Moving to the next slide, we show that our efforts to transform our wireline businesses are showing up as noticed in Brazil and Argentina for a better traditional service performance and solid Internet and TV growth, led to notable topline acceleration versus the first quarter of '08. Total accesses in the region recorded a fast expansion ranging from the 2% advanced in fixed line accesses to the 69% growth in Pay TV with an outstanding 26% year-on-year growth in Broadband accesses.</p>
          <p>Let me highlight the strong broadband net adds posted in the second quarter in Argentina and Colombia, which were up 23 and 46% quarter-on-quarter respectively. Contribution from the internet and TV revenues continued to rise on the back of the robust bundling offering uptick shifting the revenue mix of our wireline operation and reducing the exposure to regulated services.</p>
          <p>Across the region these revenues weighed 18% of total wireline revenue in advance of over 3 percentage points versus the first half of '07. The higher penetration of bundles continues to drive the increase in average revenue for wireline access, which was up 3.5% in cost and currency versus the first half of '07 while at the same time proving to be a good retention tool. Total bundles are already over 55% of our fixed accesses, 7 percentage points higher than in June 2007 while double and triple play reached 42% of the DSO base in June of 2008 or 16 percentage points more than a year ago.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, let me quickly review our main operations in the region. As I just mentioned revenue growth in Telesp in Taza posted in acceleration quarter-on-quarter with an increase of 114, 190 basis points respectively from the first quarter of the year, reflecting the benefits of the business transformation. In terms of profitability OIBDA margins also improved versus the first quarter by over 300 basis points in the case of Telesp to reach a 42.4% and by over 200 basis points in in Taza  to 35.7%. This performance show our ability to contain costs and to leverage workforce restructuring measurers.</p>
          <p>In Brazil we've posted solid results gross adds in the first half of '08 increased by 47% in organic terms on the back of the strong campaigns on Mothers' and Valentine's days and with gross adds in Q2 up 41% year-on-year. The strong customer expansion along with greater profit promotions in a very competitive environment and a higher proportion of SIM-only adds versus last year impacted ARPU performance. Minutes of use showed a robust growth in the second quarter up 24% on organic terms boosted by the commercial campaigns in over 30% increase in CapEx.</p>
          <p>OIBDA grew a 13% on organic terms in the first half of the year excluding Telemig, OIBDA margin in the second quarter showed a healthy year-on-year expansion of around 150 basis points despite a strong commercial activity. In Mexico we continued to record robust results. The customer base grew 38% year-on-year in the first half to 14.1 million leading to market share over 19%. Churn continues to go down due to the better quality of the customers we are adding. As a result outgoing service revenue grew 53% year-on-year while economies of scale led to an over 22% margin in the first half of '08 or 13 percentage points higher than a year ago, with a remarkable 25.7% in the second quarter. Operating cash flow improved significantly to reach &#x20AC;38 million in the first six months of 2008.</p>
          <p>To sum up, Latin American region. We're capturing a strong growth potential of Latin America, capitalizing on our unique integrated management model. The mobile business along with broadband and TV backed a solid topline performance across markets. Broadband and TV revenues recorded outstanding year-on-year growth rates from 16% in Peru to over 100% in Colombia. Mobile service revenue posted double-digit growth rates in most of our markets driven by the good performance in outgoing service revenues.</p>
          <p>Colombia's revenue performance was strongly impacted by <mark type="inaudible" /> mobile termination rates. OIBDA growth was robust across the region driven by higher margins across mobile businesses leading to an enhanced profitability at the regional level versus June of '07. Finally let me remark the strong margin expansion in Colombia mobile, 8 percentage points higher versus January-June of 2007.</p>
          <p>Moving now to slide number 20, Telefonica Europe delivered another quarter of very sound results. The exit of Airwave from the group in April 2007 and the weakening of sterling versus euro impacted reported growth rates in the first half but like-for-like revenue and OIBDA grew by 6 and 4% respectively. Customer base growth was driven by strong contract net adds along with a good performance on churn. Telefonica O2 UK now has the leading contract rate in the market. OIBDA growth slowed in the second quarter compared to the first, mainly due to customer growth at Telefonica O2 Germany, which added 1.1 million customers in the first half, over double the figure of last year. 02 UK continues to outperform the market with strong revenue growth and a flat margin on a like-for-like basis year-over-year. ARPU growth of 3.7% year-on-year in local currency in the first-half demonstrates the focus on currency customer growth.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we continue on track with a turnaround of the business with revenue growth accelerating to 3.8% in the quarter giving 2.7% for the first-half. The business again posted strong net adds especially on contract. In the Czech Republic, line loss was reduced year-on-year and revenue growth of 1.1% in local currency in the first half was impacted by timing of revenues of ICT contracts, which will come later in the year. Slovakia, diluted margin by under three points in the first half and during the second half the OIBDA loss in the Slovak business will begin to decline year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Online contract net adds in the second quarter were again one third higher than last year and we have regained momentum in the prepaid market with positive net adds versus net losses last year. Revenue in OIBDA declined year-on-year due to the lower prepaid base and the investments from the customer. We expect to see better performance in the second half reaping the benefits of the good customer growth in the first half.</p>
          <p>Turning to slide 21, which show that 02 UK recorded another strong quarter of contract net adds on the back of the iPhone but also a traditional handset connections in the increasing popularity of SIM only tariffs. Total ARPU continued to grow reflecting the focus on quality customer growth. Although, contract ARPU is difficult year-on-year in the second quarter driven by optimizing behavior of customers and the growing base of SIM only customers. As previously mentioned, contract churn in the quarter fell to 1.4%, a market leading figure helping the net adds performance.</p>
          <p>Mobile service revenue growth did slow during the quarter but there was not a step change in the growth rate from Q1 to Q2 of '08. Minutes of use is performing well, there is a strong demand for iPhone 3G on a good mix of high-end tariffs and bad debt levels remain stable. In broadband we launched our mobile proposition in April while our DSL service is delivering high quality and satisfaction adding 124,000 customers in the first half.</p>
          <p>In Germany, we are on track with our turnaround strategy. The first quarter saw  strong net adds with both O2 and partners such as Tchibo, Fonic and HanseNet delivering a good performance especially on contract. Revenue growth accelerated from Q1 levels to 3.8% year-on-year in the second quarter with mobile service revenues still impacted from the migration of customers on to new better value tariffs. 61% of the total contract base are now on the new tariffs and as 1.1 million contract customers are expected to remain on their existing tariffs. This means that around 75% of the expected migrations have already taken place. Therefore the impact of migrations in the second half of 2008 should be reduced allowing for an improved service revenue trend in the second half of 2008. Although OIBDA grew quarter on quarter, it declined by 8.2% year-on-year like-for-like due to investment in growth evidenced by the increase of almost 200,000 in net adds in the second quarter of 08 versus the second quarter of '07. Margin expanded over the first quarter as we saw the benefits of restructuring, scale and a positive contribution from the ULL business.</p>
          <p>If we now turn to our financial profile. I would like to highlight how we continue improving. First we have devoted 3 billion to shareholder remuneration in the first half. Second, we have enabled to make a compatible decent remuneration with another reduction in our leverage ratio by moving net financial debt to  2000 OIBDA in June. This has been the result of close to &#x20AC;1.3 billion debt reduction in 2008 coupled with OIBDA ongoing increases. When adding our commitments to financial debt the ratio stands at 2.15 in the lower part, which is in the lower part of the range that we set in our last investors conference. Third we have been able to reduce 25 basis points, the effective interest cost of our debt reaching our 6% target for 2008. Fourth, our liability mix keeps on benefiting from the depreciation of sterling in the semester more than offsetting the Czech koruna <mark type="inaudible" /> and leading to a nearly &#x20AC;285 million savings in the euro value of our debt.</p>
          <p>Finally we have smooth maturity profile for the coming years with cash exceeding debt maturing in 2008 and on top of that we have close to &#x20AC;9.5 billion undrawn credit lines, more than two-thirds which are long-term. Despite current credit market conditions we were able to price a prudent and opportunistic &#x20AC;1.25 billion seven years deal in May, which allows us to keep an average debt life around six years, which is the term we estimate long enough to be fully repaid out of cash flow if we wished.</p>
          <p>In conclusion, in this first half of 2008, we have posted strong earnings clearly ahead of the pack. We are fully exploiting our differentiated profile, leveraging our highly diversified asset portfolio, our integrated business model and our strong execution capabilities. We have delivered solid organic growth rates across regions and businesses and the ramping OIBDA and operating income year-on-year growth rates in Q2 show our focus to preserve our high cash flow generation profile leveraging cost initiatives and disciplined CapEx management. Our unique footprint in Latin America is boosting our growth, while in Europe our solid results well above our competitors outline our business strengths.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, on the current credit market conditions we maintain a robust financial position with leverage ratios down year-on-year and in line with our targets. We continue to prioritize shareholders remuneration as shown by the accelerated execution of our share buyback program. Close to 90% of the total free cash flow generated in the first half of '08 has been used to pay dividends and buy back our old shares. Finally I would like to reiterate our confidence to deliver once more on our commitments. We're well on track to meet 2008 guidance.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen thanks very much and now we're ready to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's David Wright here from Deutsche Bank in London. Three parts for my question please, firstly in Spain. I'm looking for the revenue of boosters I guess in the second half; revenues in Spain are trending towards the low end of guidance and I guess we would expect some ongoing pressures from the GDP slow down. So, in terms the boosters to offset that, could you give us some idea of the EO ego materiality, the roaming contract to come on in each two. And also maybe some indication of roaming elasticity so we can clean out our Q4 number year-on-year roaming reduction cleans out.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Latin America is the Telesp margin trend something we should be comfortable with now? Can that be sustained? that reduced margin pressure? And maybe also a question for Matthew, on '02 if you could give us some indication of how you plan to address a very tough operating performance I guess we could call it. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David this is Guillermo Ansaldo. The question regarding the Spain revenues in the second half. We see several factors, at least seven factors that we should consider as positives for the revenue in the rest of the year. First of all, as you remember deceleration started up to the summer. We started feeling up to the summer, so the performance especially in the first Q of this year will be compared to the performance, which is already slowed down first Q of last year. So, year-on-year we expect that, that the growth rate would improve assuming the same slow down situation in the economy.</p>
          <p>Second, as you mentioned, there was a sharp roaming tariff cuts in September last year, so the revenues in the rest of this period from September to December will weak in this revenue stream. But we favor comparing to tariff that we already cut last year. So this is a second effect. The third one you mentioned <mark type="inaudible" /> in your question very well. We switch -- we finished switching the traffic <mark type="inaudible" /> contract last June.</p>
          <p>So I mean the rest of the year will see an additional revenue stream coming from this contract. Unfortunately we cannot disclose the numbers of this contract but as you can assume the better Eurogo does the better traffic in this contract will become very significant additional revenue stream. The full factor is related to wireless data. Wireless data we are, as you've seen in the numbers, showing a very good growth in data ARPU and data revenues. And we will continue pushing these initiatives in the rest of the year and also obviously in this arena the iPhone will be instrumental. Remember we launched the iPhone in Spain last July 11 and picked up this summer in the middle, so the effect of the iPhone will be very positive from September to December.</p>
          <p>A fifth factor that we mentioned in the last call is that in the first part of the year, in the first quarter we saw a small slowdown in IT revenues, which is already recovering in the second quarter and especially in all of the IT contracts related to the public sector. Once the general elections are over we are starting to see a lot of decision-making, a lot of projects coming in. So we expect that in the rest of the year we will have a positive effect coming from this area.</p>
          <p>The sixth factor is regarding to the universal service fund. We expect -- we hope that the 203, 204 and 205 universal service fund will be issued in the rest of the year and as you know, we will be net receivers. In the mobile <mark type="inaudible" /> we will be a net payor and the wireline business will be a receiver as any other universal service fund. This will be an additional revenue stream.</p>
          <p>And the seventh one is the fiber. We expect to have -- we hope to have a positive green light from the regulator and so we expect to start selling fiber, a high definition, another value-added service over the fibers in the rest of the year. Obviously this will start in September and we will hire -- hiring into '09. So we see several factors of that differential vis-&#xE0;-vis the first half, and that will be, probably just be much more concentrated in the last quarter of the year but that would help us to meet the guidance that we already projected.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just follow-up on that, I mean that's a very comprehensive answer. Obviously, the EBITDA is running way ahead of guidance, if we clean out all the property retiree effects, would we be looking to invest some incremental margin in the second half to drive commercial activity, you can see that EBITDA trend more towards the guidance range rather than ahead of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you mentioned we have in the last part of the year is a metric. We have a push on our OIBDA because last year we have a very strong provision of the redundancy program this year we don't have any expected. As you see the numbers in the first half profitability and even netting out all the one offs the margin is improving and we will keep on focusing on capturing synergies from the integration of the mobile and the wireline business, we are also profiting from the industry alliance with Telecom Italia. We are doing all of those efficiency programs that started a few years ago. So efficiency, will continue to be a priority and that will help significantly on the OIBDA front. We will maintain our commercial activity as long as we see opportunities to grow so we will not step down on that front.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Telsp margin evolution question, well the evolution of this quarter is the result of several actions; first, we have been able to contain the line loss in the neighborhood of 60,000 negative net adds figure and that has helped to stabilize the average number of accesses. Second on that front also we have been able to slightly increase ARPU at the traditional line a little bit below 1% increasing ARPU year-on-year. Third, broadband expansion, massive broadband expansion on -- I would say widely appreciated by the market in terms of increasing speed of access and bundling with traditional lines and with pay TV and on that front, we have also been able to include for the ARPU in the broadband side about roughly 5% year-on-year.</p>
          <p>Fourth, I would say that the bundling strategy is paying off and the fact that we do have now a competitive product bundled with our broadband in the most intensive competition zone in S&#xE3;o Paulo help us to recuperate market share gain in terms of net adds in those regions.</p>
          <p>I would say on top of that, we have been able to run and accelerate the efficiency program in terms of reducing the work source level of Telesp in the second quarter and that's going to be starting to pay off in terms of more efficient growth structure, also the fact that we are setting up significant effort in the region all around the region in terms of boosting further efficiency regionally from the wire line businesses. And finally, I would say that there are two effects that are going to be helping us in the second part of this year to sustain or even increase this level of margins in terms of the tariff increase that have been approved in July in the neighborhood of 3% and also the comparison year-on-year because of the ongoing comparative effect of bad debt clean up that we have all around last year. So the answer is yes. We feel comfortable with this evolution and we keep fighting to even improve this position.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi David. It's Matthew. I guess a two-pronged approach in Ireland. First we had to regain customer relevancy and I think if you look at some of the propositions that we've launched in the first half that are certainly cutting through in the marketplace in new prepaid proposition in O2 Clear which is a little bit like Simplicity in the UK. What that shows actually in our first half number is we've grown by 42,000 customers in the first half 25,000 in the second quarter and if you compare that to last year we actually didn't grow at all for the first three quarters. So first is customer relevancy to get some customer momentum and then get the top line going.  And the second is clearly the cost space; got a lot of operations going on there you may have seen that we outsourced our IT functions for IBM during the first half and we are now really starting to leverage the scale from the group but particularly from the UK, so as an example when we rang our MMS platform and our visual voicemail platform for the iPhone from the UK for Ireland so customer relevance, need to get the topline going and driving down the cost space.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Christian Kern. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Christian Kern from Lehman Brothers. I was wondering if you could quantify the positive impact that Easter had this year by having two more trading days this quarter versus last quarter. Second question is I'm trying to find or to close the gap between your 6% ARPU decline in domestic Spain and the service revenue, which is up half a percent with about 217,000 net add. I think that is a little bit of a gap and if I understand your initial roaming contract only kicks in July and the final one if you could be &#x2013; help here with regard to the roaming, there has been a steep decline in the roaming in revenue growth in domestic. It was I think 12% up in Q1, 17% down in Q2. What are your thoughts there on the Q2? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Christian, let me start by the second question. If I understand correctly, you're trying to reconcile the ARPU decline in Spain with the revenue growth, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, we have a -- the increasing customer base as one clear effect on the side and also we have -- as you mentioned, some of the wholesale income coming in -- the YoYo contract is starting in the beginning of June. So we have only one month of revenue coming in the semester. Also we have the &#x2013; what the ARPUs already in there. It was basically planned and some of the wholesale income like the YoYo one. I think that was your question, not why the 6% but the reconciled GAAP, no?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the other question I think, you're asking about the domestic roaming. What happened with the roaming in? Is there a change quarter-to-quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, from you presentation I see, there has been a big swing in the revenue growth from top 12 to negative 17.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two things first. These roaming contracts with the International operators are very volatile in the sense that, our annual contracts and discounts are applied depending on the traffic that is coming in and coming out with this operator. So, the relevant measure for us and the relevant measure for us is to see the margin between the roaming income and the expenses of roaming out with the same operators. In that sense, we also have a decrease on the roaming on expenses. So the margin is basically the same. Unfortunately, it plays funny numbers in the income and in the expenses. But in the margin of these operations is quite sound and is growing in line with what we expected. And regarding the first week, the first question, I didn't get it. Can you repeat it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's on the Easter effect. This Q2 will have for any operator positive Easter effect, because last year Easter was in Q2 whereas this year, Easter was in Q1. I was wondering if that is something you can quantify and that you've looked that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I don't have the ramped up number right here. But you right here is positive effect on the Easter, because it was in different quarters and we can provide you with information after -- with the Investor Relations team. But I, unfortunately don't have the number here. But if you're right, this is a positive effect in the second quarter. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from the line of Jesus Romero. Please go ahead announcing your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jesus Romero from Merrill Lynch, in London. I had a question on the line loss in the second quarter. You mentioned in your release that the market was growing 2%. But in spite of that, we saw a decline in your line of 1.6%. When you talk about 2% decline over the next three years, till 2010, what assumptions are you making for market share loss and what do you think the market will be doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. According to our, Jesus, our estimation of the market has grown close to 2%, actual number is 1.9. Basically what has happened in our access space is two things. First, an effect that we saw in the first quarter, which is this change of nature of this new feature of naked share un-bundling, which to give you a flavor of the net gain of this type of un-bundling was close to 160K in the first half of the year. That was something that was not existing in the previous year. And that explains a good part of the loss.</p>
          <p>There is a second factor to be and especially in this quarter, we saw more commercial activity on direct access meaning some cable operators and some other competitors that have direct access to customers. So we lost some lines to some direct access <mark type="inaudible" /> smaller effect. But it does have an effect. We don't see yet an effect on the market so far. So basically the first quarter was basically 100% due to this new shared un-bundling and the second quarter is, maybe two thirds due to the share and naked un-bundling and one third to more activity on the hands of some competitors in direct access.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But what is the possibility in in the second half? Did you see the market is slowing down or declining and on top of that you continue to lose market share.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will see some, this trend of the naked share will continue. I'm not sure about the pace it will continue because we've seen both migration from plans from shared to naked shared and obviously some players are directly going into these feature instead of going to wholesale ADSL or to shared un-bundling. So that trend will continue, the pace will depend on seasonality and on the strategy of these customers.</p>
          <p>Regarding the market, we will see -- so far we haven't seen a change in the market but something that we have to be, honestly we have to be very cautious and see what's happening in the future. So far we haven't seen any change and you also asked before about the long-term. We still believe that a 2% is doable obviously, we see what have that last year positive number, a very good number in terms of line loss, so that helps in the arithmetics. This year, well I don't have the number but obviously will be above two and once this negative effect is start to ease up because the migration will finish and we will have only the new adds, we see that will help to get into the 2% number that we share with all you in London.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Jonathan Dann from JP Morgan. I have two questions and the first one is -- to better understand naked shared access. So, which of your competitors are using and which should we expect? Is it the half a million wholesale DSL that you'd expect to migrate? So, perhaps line losses above worse than the trend for a year but then returns below 2%?</p>
          <p>Secondly, could you provide a number for I guess mobile data cards that you sold over the last year? I think in the release you say you sold 2.1 million 3G handsets if you had any figure. And then finally, I think in the press yesterday one of the other shareholders in Teleco in Italy was talking about a capital increase. What's Telefonica's latest thoughts there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John this is Guillermo. Well, naked shared is basically used by Orange <mark type="inaudible" /> so basically several our players but basically is Orange and the Orange Group. And also we have to see -- if we get that numbers strategy they will follow in the future and aggressively put in the market to see what's happening. To switch a customer from shared to naked shared you have to call the customer and basically tell the customer that he will not have any more commuted voice and that he would have or she would have a Voice Over IP and of course they will save money because they will save the monthly, part of the monthly fee, depending on the offer that in this case, Orange, for example will make.</p>
          <p>So, it depends on contacting the customer, convincing the customer to drop the traditional voice lines. But it is very normal maybe very accepted by some segments and not very accepted by other segments and there of course they will agree to the new offers. So, the trend will continue but it is not possible to get 100% of the customer base, to convince 100% of the customer base. So we have summarized what this is but to be honest, it will depend on the strategy that, for example, Orange will follow, no?  Just for example is much more on the full unbundled so they have the different strategy they're improving in market share, they are doing very well but they are full unbundling and that's also hurting us in terms of market share of robust which has not been an issue so far.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second question let me give you a couple of numbers. First the total number of <mark type="inaudible" /> have so far is 300, a little over 300,000. Additionally if you add that all other type of BlackBerrys and other types of advance male type of Smartphones or woman type of terminals we have almost three-quarters of a million, 750,000 roughly. I really hope that answered your question or but, basically that's a gross figure.</p>
          <p>Then you mentioned also before the 3G that's in general that doesn't mean that 3G terminal has a data contract and so one but basically to give that number you have like 300,000 people with either cards or <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>I'm calling from Fidentiis. I've got two questions; one on Spain. I wonder if you'd give us an idea where bad debts stand currently as a percentage of sales and whether you've seen any significant increase in the second quarter or recent months and then on Latin America I was very pleasantly surprised by the EBITDA margins. That's been done in an environment as you said, a very strong growth and I think you main competitor actually shows more fall in EBITDA margins. What's behind this? Is this operating leverage, i.e. is your EBITDA excluding percent has that increased 400 basis points?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Regarding about this question our numbers are still below the 1% over sales in the provision over sales. To give you an idea first quarter if you correct the effect of the sale of the long portfolio result we had a positive effect on the provision; if we correct that will be 0.8 and second quarter is 0.9. So it is increasing a little bit but not significantly and obviously is below the 1%. So they are still good numbers so--</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that a big increase on last year for example.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Last year to give you a flavor I have the figures here for the third quarter was 0.7.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it looks like it's increasing a little bit but it's not very relevant. Obviously when you put in the first quarter the sale of a better portfolio the number is 0.3 but when you correct that it's a little bit more,  but clean numbers we see maybe 0.1 percentage point decrease if you took back in the whole of our operation, I mean our margin is at <mark type="inaudible" /> but it's minor, no?</p>

          <p>Taking your second question James on the evolution of margins, I understand that you are addressing the question on the wireless side and I think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly yes. Sorry.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, on that front I think that for us what is paying in our favor is scale. In first part of the answer I mean the increase in size, the increase in volumes, if our customer base is helping us to boost on operating leverage on a having highly controlled base of fixed cost. Also the fact that we run the region as a unit in terms of not only identified brand but also unified asset purchasing and a significant amount of initiatives help us to have better margins that the local competitors but clearly the most significant effect when compared to previous years is the fact that we are hiring more and more clients on our GSM networks. And we will be progressively switching off the other networks. And that's also is helping to boost efficiency.</p>
          <p>Also the fact that we have a controlled bad debt and the fact that we have been able to have highly segmented subscriber acquisition cost approach is helping us to highly control, I would say, the net adds of our customer base. So we are certainly positive about the future evolution of our wireless margin. We have been also working significantly on the wireline side but talking specifically on the wireless side I think that the trend is solid.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And I mean, if I can follow-up. I mean if I obviously look at Saks and associates as a percentage of sales would you be able to give me a figure as to how that's evolved over the last year ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm afraid that we don't disclose that figure. But those figures are turning down and we will think that it will continue to be the fact. We ended also that, we're running a best practice approach and we're pretty effectively transferring the successful products on one corner to the other of the region. So, I think that, I can tell you that as we are speaking, we have been reducing subscriber acquisition cost in double-digit arena and we will keep trying to do the same in the future. So I think that the trend is solid, that I was saying early in the beginning.</p>

          <p>Yes hello, it's Luis Prota from Morgan Stanley, Madrid. Two questions if I may, first of all on shareholder remuneration. Now that you have 50% of the buyback done. What are the chances of increasing the buyback before GRN? The second question is really a follow-up on the question on Telecom Italia. The speculation on the capital increase was also on the Telco level requiring a capital increase because they have done -- could be, if the Telecom Italia share price comes down that prevails around 1, 1.05. If you could elaborate a bit on that, could be helpful. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Luis, this is Santiago. On your first question of the shareholder remuneration, we have spent more than 90% of the free cash flow that the company has generated on shareholder remuneration on the first-half. And in the second-half, which will have a second leg of the dividend coming up and we shall have one-third of the 100 million share buyback pending execution. As you will recall, we have already said that the shareholder -- I'm sorry the share buybacks will be determined depending on free cash flow generation and the share price. Certainly, we continue the share and the share price is very attractive and to the extent that we think almost certainty that the cash flow generation ability of the company will continue, we will complete that and we will update you in the market on future increases in remuneration later on in the year. So, now we think that remuneration is high enough and attractive and we shall have one third of the program pending execution.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, this is Terry Sinclair with Citi. Three very quick questions. First of all, on Spain I hoping your guidance imply that you still think it possible that you may grow sales of 5% in the second half. I would just like make sure that there were no trends within the quarter that diminished your confidence in that. Specifically has there been any deterioration across the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Secondly you mentioned a number of issues in Spain that has helped wireless ARPU to fall. One of them is trending spin downs towards SMS instead of voice. There were also SMS promotions out at the moment. I wondered how long you expect to have special promotions are around SMS and perhaps data growth. And thirdly very quickly I just wondered when you're expecting unbundling in some parlors to have an impact on Telesp?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Terry, this is Guillermo. Let me try to answer the first question. Obviously the environment is challenging and but the fact that I mentioned at the beginning the seven effects are positives that will help in any case. Obviously if the environment changes dramatically we will have to think about new things to compensate. But basically we are assuming that the operating environment is similar to the one we have seen the second quarter going on. Also that demonstrates many of the factors that I mentioned before are more loaded on the fourth quarter by definition because of the seasonality of the Spanish market. Regarding the second question I don't know, if I get it right, but I think you're asking about the SMS promotion, the premium SMS. No?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That was a very relevant factor in the first quarter but in the second quarter we didn't have any premium SMS promotion right now in the summer and for the rest of the year. I'm sorry we cannot disclose our strategy due to competitive reasons, but data roll is one of our priorities and we do have actions to continue based on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Guillermo, <mark type="inaudible" /> work this out for myself what would the like-of-like boost be from I mean, the seven factors you mentioned, in answer to David's question, a number of them involve an automatic list because the comparative number for 4Q'07 is going to be easier than for example 2Q' 07. And can you just help us to quantify that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry Terry. I don't have the quantification one by one, we are trying to do some estimates and some of these factors will depend on third parties for example the YoYo we do have the contract. But it depends on what YoYo does, we do have an hypothesis but we cannot disclose that. The two factors that are related to the regulator like there universal service and the fiber we're positive, we are optimists by of course it depends on the regulator and it will depend on how it is issued by the regulator. <mark type="inaudible" /> quantify one by one and as soon as we have more sympathy will share this information with you for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question, about unbundling in S&#xE3;o Paulo first there is already an offer of an unbundled, it was offer in S&#xE3;o Paulo which has not been affects taxes with an attractive for new entrance but after all, because of the fact that most of our major competitors have their own infrastructure in S&#xE3;o Paulo. I don't remember exactly the number of operation and networks right now but it's something close to 7 in the probably the most intensive competition cells in S&#xE3;o Paulo not only in terms of cable operators like NET but Brazil Telecom or <mark type="inaudible" /> (1;05:52) their own infrastructure in S&#xE3;o Paulo.</p>
          <p>It is also true that the current environment and regulatory changes in Brazil because of the creation of these national campaign is posting some additional changes in the regulation. But, in terms of having a more intense competition environment in S&#xE3;o Paulo it's already highly intensive based on the infrastructure based competitors. So we do not expect any major changes on that regard.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon everyone Guy Peddy from Macquarie; couple of quick questions. During the quarter Orange announced a significant plan to roll out a lot more distribution shops in Spain and the plan to increase the distribution network in the UK, just wondering how you are going to respond to that. Secondly, as the Orange UK clearly had perform very well in Q2 and a sort of caught up with O2 UK from a revenue growth perspective. I was just wondering whether you feared that actually Vodafone and T Mobile who clearly are underperformers are likely to be a bit more aggressive in H2. And then finally you've got comments saying that you're on track in Germany, but <mark type="inaudible" /> going to be really critical your service revenue growth rate obviously gone backwards in Q2. So, where can we find that confidence that you are on track and when do you think you will be able to get to a more neutral service revenue growth position in Germany. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi Guy, Matthew here. I'll pick up the two Orange questions and then talk about Germany. As far as our distribution network is concerned in the UK we've got 450 stores, are very happy at that level. We think that's the optimum amount and clearly also trade <mark type="inaudible" /> . So do I see a need to respond to Orange expanding a distribution network in the UK. Absolutely not.</p>
          <p>As far as their revenue growth is concerned, yes, they've had a couple of quarters of about 9%. But I will just encourage you to look at the numbers lapping from last year, which are I think pretty low in terms of about 1% and 4%. But we're lapping numbers of double-digit with double-digit growth. So, yes, they are increasing against last year's number, but from a lower base.</p>
          <p>On Germany, I think the key thing to understand about Germany as it effectively two compensating factors happening at the moment. The first is that we're increasing our base by circa 0.5 million a quarter and have done for the last four quarters which is clearly driving service revenue up or it's pushing revenue -- service revenues the other ways, migrating our existing customers onto the higher-value or the better value tariffs that are in the market at the moment. Now I think we declared that actually of the base that will migrate on to the better value tariffs, we've now already done 75%. We will complete that during this year. So as those two items move into different level of balance because it's broadly imbalanced at the moment. You'll see a start to go into service revenue growth during the second half of 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a complement guide, the Spanish part of the distribution question. We have a very capillary or large exclusive division like one in Spain. What the two initiatives that we're pushing last year are twofolds: first is to have as much store possible selling both wireless and wireline products. This is going very well and is one of our synergies that we're bringing into the revenue side.</p>
          <p>And we do have a program to improve locations, meaning we're trying in large cities to analyzing which one is -- which location is primary location we should cover. So we are changing locations or recovering some holes. We call this a tough distribution network. But there is not a significant increase in the number of stores. It is mostly an increase on the number quality and the profile of the stores.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Michelle Collett from Cazenove here. Three questions if I may. Firstly, can you quantify the expected termination rate reduction in Spain on both revenue and EBITDA. And secondly, you mentioned in the presentation and the handset sales had flattened across the quarters. Can you give us a feel for why that has happened and thirdly can you say -- as you say in the presentation that GSM handsets in <mark type="inaudible" /> announced 73% of the total and what can we expect that to trend towards? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is -- Mitch, this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the handset sales, this is another volatile component of our income because it depends on the amount of terminals that we provision into the channels and the needs of stock of the channels and also depends on the value of the terminal -- the inner value terminals we provide. So if it goes up and down quarter-by-quarter, month by month but there is no change in trend behind those numbers, so there is something that I know and always because it changed month by month but is no change in trend. And it depends on how the wholesalers are stocking and what type of terminals they are demanding.</p>
          <p>Regarding termination rates, basically is on the revenue side is 16% of our decrease, sorry, you have a decrease of 16% on our income side, semester over semester, that was the question. And obviously when you look at the whole of Telef&#xF3;nica Espa&#xF1;a, you have to take it account on the fixed side with our savings because we feel as in the traffic that is re-united on the fixed side and is ended on the Mobile side and also on the Mobile operation, in the re-united traffic would be less. The impact in margin, I don't have the number right now. we're trying to -- we could try to calculate it, but is neutralized by the wireless and is particularly by the Wireline business as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your questions about the GSM handset evolution as a percentage of total handsets in Latin America, it's been a very natural trend. I mean we're not forcing these or accelerating these this part-- I mean, we're just having a little bit like something like close to 90% of gross ad space on GSM and therefore is not in our rotation of handset is helping us to decrease the CDMA based effort and therefore we will progressively switching off the CDMA network. So probably you will see that in the next kind of two years we will have an evolving these rates close 00% and therefore country-by-country we will be switching-off the different networks and therefore that will boost also efficiency in terms of having one single network with all our clients. You should expect that to happen in the next two years.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Andrew, mobile broadband from our perspective is clearly a growing market in both Germany and the UK and in Ireland. I think the first thing is as your questioning implies is to the space of fixed broadband market and in Ireland for example we're relatively underdeveloped in the fixed broadband market. We see a lot more potential to grow mobile broadband, but in the other countries if you look at our approach in the UK, where clearly we've got a mobile broadband offer as well as fixed broadband offer. Actually today we've announced that we got a proposition that's going to combine the two. So you effectively get a home broadband with a mobile broadband subscription, which is &#xA3;20 a month. So very much depends on market by market as far as how far the market develops and the relevant pricing in the marketplace.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is David George from Wallon (1;15:14). I have got two questions. First is on Spain. So you mentioned from the impact of outgoing revenues in mobile, impact of the promotion effect and also economic slowdown with the acquisition of TRS. Could you give the break down between the three effects. Secondly in the Latin America because in Q1 Argentina in fixed you mentioned that the impact -- the negative impact in EBITDA margin was partly coming from the inflation. In Q2 we see a very good performance in EBITDA. So it seems you are able to manage efficient <mark type="inaudible" />. And do you think you will be able to do that durably or do you see the risk from the inflation and nobody in that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>David this is Guillermo Ansaldo. Regarding the evolution of our wireless revenues there are several factors we are taking into account. First is a regulatory factor which is the incoming voice ARPU, which is down because of the mobile terminates rates cuts that you know we have been presented with another cut twice a year so when you compare year-over-year we are almost 14% in ARPU terms, voice ARPU terms down year-over-year because of this they were to retained.</p>
          <p>When you look at the outgoing ARPU we have a lower drop than the total drop this is basically 3.6 in the first half and 4.8 in the second quarter, and here we've got different effects. One, this has to do with the nature of the promotions that we used in the second quarter, vis-a-vis the second quarter of last year. As you remember, as we explained in the last conference call, increased <mark type="inaudible" /> launch at the campaign that was much more focused on churn, on improving churn, which basically we're giving to our customers a time to the promotion one week free of on net traffic at the end of each month, and the number of months, the number of weeks they get depends on the number of years they have been with us with us, with mobiles. Since we have a significant base of clients with four or five or six years of aged with us, to put it in some way, we got a lot of traffic, a significant part of traffic that is implied in the promotion.  That's why you see improvement in mobile immediate use and some decrease in the average rate per minute, so this  has to do with the promotion and not with the market.</p>
          <p>Second we launched the second quarter of last year several target schemes and basically we are reducing price in order to improve also churn, this impacted on ARPU in the rest of the 2007 and it is impacted on this year, since this tariffs are doing very well in terms of net adds. The third is the change in use patterns and it has to do with the change in the operating environment meaning that we are seeing that some segments of customers especially what the call the consumer market, the residential market, they are moving the shift in traffic from more expensive traffic to less expensive, for example shifting from mobile to SMS; we're doing very well in SMS and also the traffic mobile-mobile to fixed-fixed. In fact, if we look at our numbers in voice traffic revenues in the fixed business you will say that our revenue relations is only at a 1% decrease which is much a lesser than before and obviously which is on an expected factor that this related to the overall market condition.</p>
          <p>Basically overall that the outgoing traffic and client in Spain grew 3.6% and in the first half and there are some factors that are related with the market like the one I mentioned to some factors that related with previous decision that were focused on improving churn. Churn is very stable and this is part of our core strategy we will try to protect our customer base, we may suffer a little bit on other rate per minute or on outview. But we believe that we have to maintain our customer base and then we will elaborate when the market and when the products are the right ones.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Taking your question about Latin America and inflation picking up in the region, while first it is not a <mark type="inaudible" /> there are some countries that are more exposed to that fact than others, but globally speaking on the wireless side as we have more commercial flexibility in terms of moving targets and playing with different campaigns. We have enabled to transfer part of that effect; also the cost structure of the wireless business of our company <mark type="inaudible" /> exposed in terms to a inflation moments and therefore we have also been able to be more agile in terms of restructuring and in terms of reducing debt exposure. So basically speaking on the wireless side, we think that we have been able and we should &#x2013; we will be able to keep going on that trend and observe and increase efficiency in spite of inflation.</p>
          <p>On the wireline side there are different environments and we have been able to increase margins in Brazil on the wireline side or in Argentina in spite of the fact that in Argentina we have a significant pickup in inflation. The only problem we have in Argentina is that are roughly 50% of our revenue is, has been with the tariffs frozen for the last six years so we have been doing a significant effort of reduced the exposure to this tariff freeze in our products, and that's why we have been evolving to roughly 50% of revenues exposed and also we have been running globally in all the wireline business a significant efficiency program; we have been reducing the label force of the wireline business in the Latin America roughly 3000 people in the first half of the year and we keep boosting efficiency through regional products, so far we have been able to absorb inflation and to increase margins in the second quarter and we feel that regionally speaking we should be able to manage the <mark type="inaudible" /></p>

          <p>Will Milner<mark type="inaudible" /> Research. Firstly I was thinking about Spanish line loss: of the 600,000 you owned that used to be built in Spain over year, do you have any idea what proportion ended up coming in new line for Telef&#xF3;nica and secondly on Latin America. Your year-over-year organic EBITDA growth sort of jumped from 12% in the first quarter to 20% in Q2, which -- I guess it looks -- was a great result. It didn't look wholly sustainable, do you think and do you agree perhaps that some of the commercial activity has been held back and in the second quarter that an increase and perhaps you could maybe talk about some of the promotions you've</p>
          <p>already launched in some of the key Latin America markets?</p>

          <p>Will this is Guillermo. Regarding your question about new lines linked to new houses or new buildings, I have a figure which is slightly different but I just explain the effect at where we have seen in the past -- in the past for -- some two years is like depending on the quarter, 30 to 40% of the new lines that we were adding to our plant in terms of fixed lines were linked to new buildings. The rest were linked to -- 30 to 40, the rest were linked to existing buildings. There are still many people in many units or families without fixed-lines and they have <mark type="inaudible" /> the needs with mobile for example. But they are doing in the -- fixed lines due to the to broadband may be spread. The figure that we do track in the past is that, 30 to 40 depending on the quarter of our gross adds in fixed-lines were linked to new houses. So that's basically the exposure that we make up in the future.</p>

          <p>I'm taking your question of Latin America and growth in the second quarter. In terms of commercial activity, the second quarter is always more intense than the first one because of the modest campaign, which is the second most intensive commercial campaign of the year, after the Christmas campaign. So yes, we're having more commercial intensity. But in terms of the growth, that we're having in revenues, this is based on several factors.</p>
          <p>First of all, the fact that we have been significantly increasing the number -- the average number of customers and as a result year-on-year, the impact of the other hundred of customers in Spain and is reflected on the revenue side. Also because of the fact that we have been able to do that with stable ARPUS and just do that in the second quarter, because of the commercial intensity it has been peaking down a little bit. But, the fact is that globally speaking year-on-year, having broadly a stable on the wireless side.</p>
          <p>And on the wireline side, we have been able to contain line loss. We have also been able to expand broadband massively in the region. We have been able to increase the ARPU on growth line side. We have been able to bundle and to increase the bundle effect and on top of that, we have been able to combine all those effects with positive efficiency. So I think that it is not a quarterly effect. I mean we have commercial intensity because of that campaign. But globally speaking the client in terms of revenue growth is pretty recurrent I would say. It is not a seasonal effect.</p>

          <p>Yes. I think it's more of a -- you have EBITDA growth guidance and Telefonica Latin America 12, 16% and as you say that most heavily intensive commercial activity quarter, the second quarter you've done 20% organic growth. So I mean, if EBITDA expansion in Latin America is much better than you'd expected across the full year. Should we be thinking that 12, 16% is actually too low?</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> the fact that during this quarter we have including Telemig and Telemig was according to the guidance calculation. So let's wait for the remainder part of the year and see how the Telemig effect is progressively diluting in importance in the next quarter but, yes, we are happy with the evolution, but it is too soon to say.</p>
