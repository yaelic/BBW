          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Novo Nordisk Q3 2011 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation, followed by a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> I must advise you that this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, the 27th of October, 2011.</p>
          <p>And I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. And ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Novo Nordisk conference call regarding our performance in the first nine months of 2011, the outlook for the remaining part of 2011 and preliminary outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>I am Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, the CEO of Novo Nordisk. With me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release and the slides that will be used for this call will be available on our home page novonordisk.com and the conference call is as usual scheduled to last approximately one hour.</p>
          <p>We'd start with the &#x2013; an outline of the presentation on slide number two. The Q&amp;A session will begin in about 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number three. Always, I need to advise you that this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subjects to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, see the earnings release and the slides that we have prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Note, that the conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on our website after the call.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number four. We're satisfied with the performance of the first nine month of 2011. Sales increased 11% in local currencies. The key drivers have been Victoza and our modern insulins.</p>
          <p>The solid sales performance is realized in a challenging economic environment. In the first nine month of 2011, healthcare reforms are impacting sales growth negatively by approximately 2.5 percentage points.</p>
          <p>In September, Novo Nordisk reached the very significant milestone with the filing for approval of Degludec and DegludecPlus in Europe and United States. The filings are based on the results from the BEGIN and BOOST clinical trial program, which involves nearly 10,000 type 1, type 2 diabetic patients.</p>
          <p>Data from the trials has shown Degludec to effectively lower blood glucose level while consistently demonstrating a significant lower rate of hypoglycaemia relative to insulin glargine, especially during the night.</p>
          <p>The trials also show that Degludec can be administered once-daily at any time of the day with the possibility of changing injection time from day to day according to the needs of the individual patients without compromising glycaemic control or safety.</p>
          <p>I'd also like to highlight that Levemir, our current market at <mark type="ph" /> one stated (2:37) basal insulin analogue was approved as add-on therapy to Victoza <mark type="ph" /> appeal (2:43) type 2 diabetes on the 24th of October.</p>
          <p>Finally, in October, our new prefilled insulin device FlexTouch was launched in the U.K. together with NovoRapid, our fast-acting insulin analogue. The U.K. was the first country getting access to FlexTouch following its approval in the EU in July.</p>
          <p>Turning to financials, reported operating profit grew 12% in the first nine month. The financial outlook for 2011 is updated, and we now expect sales growth between 10% and 11% in local currencies and operating profit growth of 17% to 19% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The preliminary outlook for 2012 indicates high single-digit sales growth and operating profit growth close to 10%, both measured in local currencies. The outlook is associated with unusual uncertainty given the challenging financial situation in major countries around the world.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five for a walkthrough of the sales development of the first nine month of 2011. Victoza continues to perform strongly and modern insulins continue to grow at double-digit percentages. In the first nine month, the biopharmaceutical franchise grew 7% compared to the same period last year. Diabetes care represents 75% of overall sales while NovoSeven and Norditropin represents 13% and 8% respectively.</p>
          <p>Victoza was the prime growth driver accounting for 54% of growth in local currencies followed by modern insulins accounting for 42% of growth. Sales of Victoza reached close to DKK 3.9 billion and the performance reflects the steady penetration across key markets including United States, U.K., Germany, and France.</p>
          <p>Sales of NovoSeven increased 7% in local currencies, sales growth was primarily driven by International Operations but also Europe and North America contributed to growth. Sales of Norditropin increased 5% measured in local currencies. The sales growth is driven by International Operations as well as Japan and Korea.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk remains the second-largest company in the global growth hormone market with 23% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the regional split of sales. In the first nine months of '11, North America and International Operations were the main contributors to growth measured in local currencies. North America was the main contributor accounted for 59% of growth measured in local currencies, followed by International Operations accounting for 21%.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in North America was 17% in local currencies, reflecting a solid performance of Victoza and continued market penetration of the modern insulins. The sales growth in the first nine month of '11 in North America was negatively impacted by approximately four percentage points due to the U.S. healthcare reform adopted in March of 2010.</p>
          <p>Looking to the third quarter, insulin sales in North America has been especially encouraging with a quarterly growth of 13% compared to last year measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>European sales grew 2% in local currencies, supported by continued solid performance of Victoza and progress for the portfolio of modern insulins. Sales are negatively impacted by declining sales of human insulin and NovoNorm as well as healthcare reforms implemented during 2011.</p>
          <p>Sales within International Operations grew by 16% in local currencies in the first nine months. The key contributors to sales growth were the modern insulins, NovoSeven and Norditropin, together accounting for 74% of growth. Victoza is also starting to pick up, accounting for 12% of growth in International Operations.</p>
          <p>Sales in Region China increased 14% in local currencies in the first nine months. The main contributor to growth was sales in modern insulins, especially NovoMix, but also NovoNorm and human insulins continue to add to the overall growth in the region.</p>
          <p>Sales in Region China in the third quarter has been negatively impacted by price reform on human insulins and NovoNorm <mark type="ph" /> in-er-khi (7:28) in 2011. Sales in Japan &amp; Korea has increased 6% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number seven for an update on the market situation. In the last decade, the global diabetes care market has grown more than 8% in value with injectables growing more than 13% annually. Novo Nordisk continues to expand the leadership position within diabetes care and currently holds more than 24% share of the global diabetes care market measured by value.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the global insulin market. Global insulin volume growth is now close to 7% driven by strong growth in International Operations in China. In North America, we see volume growth rates close to 6% driven primarily by basal and fast-acting insulins.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on U.S. market shares. We have maintained our strong position in the U.S. where we currently hold 37% value share of the total insulin market. This has been achieved by maintaining our share in the growth of modern insulin segment where we currently hold 37% of the value market share.</p>
          <p>In the last two to three years, we have seen our share of lower price human insulin segment decreasing due to intensified price competition.</p>
          <p>Next slide please. When looking at scripts data, the stable development in our share of modern insulins is confirmed. As previously mentioned, we did in the beginning of 2011 see an impact from the loss of fee managed care and Medicare Part D contracts especially in the fast-acting human &#x2013; in the fast-acting insulin segment. This has led to a slight decline in market share in the earlier part of the year within the fast-acting segment. But the most recent script data, as indicated, shows a stabilization of our position. In the modern insulin premix segment, we also saw a slight decline in the beginning of the year which has now been fully reversed. Finally, Levemir continues to perform well with a steady increase in share of the long-acting insulin segment.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number 11 for an update on Victoza. In United States, Victoza sales continues to be encouraging. We estimate that more than 250,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treated with Victoza daily. We now hold a market share of close to 53% of the total GLP-1 prescriptions and we are capturing more than 60% of new GLP-1 patients.</p>
          <p>Since the Victoza launch in February 2010, the GLP-1 class has grown more than 50% and now constitutes more than 5% of the U.S. diabetes market measured in value. Importantly, close to 70% of lives are now covered without restrictions and more than 60% of patients are using the 1.8 milligram dose of Victoza.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide. In Europe, we continue to see strong uptake of Victoza in several key markets. The GLP-1 class has more than doubled since launch. Victoza is the leading GLP-1 product in all the key European markets; Germany, UK and France. We estimate that more than 150,000 people with type 2 diabetes are treated with Victoza in these markets.</p>
          <p>With this I'd like to hand over to Mads, who'll give you an update on research and development.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to slide 13. As announced on the 10 of October, Victoza is now commercially available in China. Victoza was approved for type 2 diabetes by the Chinese SFDA on March 15, as add-on therapy to metformin or sulphonylurea in people inadequately controlled by these agents.</p>
          <p>In China, the process associated with the national and regional drug reimbursement listing is lengthy and hence until completion of this process, Victoza will be available un-reimbursed. Longer term, we see a large opportunity for GLP-1 therapy in Chinese patients as a consequence of their relatively poor <mark type="ph" /> beta-cells status (12:17) earlier on in type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. As Lars highlighted Novo Nordisk has reached an important milestone in the company's history with the submission of Degludec and DegludecPlus in both Europe and the U.S.</p>
          <p>The NDA submissions are the largest ever in the history of diabetes drug development and <mark type="ph" /> we've (12:12) printed in steps the many million pages of documentation with a total of 9 million electronic links exceed their height of Empire State building.</p>
          <p>We believe that the ultra-long acting insulin Degludec and its sister product DegludecPlus both hold strong potential to offer significant improvement in insulin therapy by providing excellent glucose control with lower rates of hyperglycemia and greater dosing convenience and flexibility than existing products in these two major insulin market segments.</p>
          <p>Hence, we're excited by the prospect of making the Degludec-based products available to patients upon completion of the regulatory process, which in the U.S. and EU has a duration of minimum 10 and 11 months respectively.</p>
          <p>Submission of Degludec in Japan is expected later this quarter, while submission of DegludecPlus will follow in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>Outside the <mark type="ph" /> tried markets (13:06) submission has reasonably taken place in Canada and Switzerland and individual country submissions all over the globe will continue throughout the next year or so.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide 15 for other news from the clinical pipeline. Firstly, an update on two sets of positive news for Levemir up current basal insulin analog. On the 24 of October, the European Commission approved the use of Levemir as add-on therapy to Victoza in patients with type 2 diabetes. The label improvement is based on data from a large 52-week clinical trial in around 1,000 patients investigating this loose combination <mark type="ph" /> in get-ta-ble (13:45) treatment regimen for which <mark type="ph" /> ri-sars (13:47) were announced at the ADA and EASD conferences earlier this year.</p>
          <p>Secondly, also on October 24, this year, the European Commission approved the use of Levemir in young children aged two to five years. No other basal insulin is currently indicated for this patient population. As also mentioned by Lars, FlexTouch was recently launched in the UK with Novo Nordisk's rapid-acting insulin analogue NovoRapid.</p>
          <p>FlexTouch is our latest prefilled deliver system and it will provide even greater use <mark type="ph" /> ease (14:19) of instant use for patients with diabetes in part because the pen utilizes an easy-touch dosing mechanism, that clinically has been associated with enhanced treatment satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the obesity phase 3a skill program for Liraglutide, enrollment of more than 4,000 patients has now been completed in the two remaining skill trials, the type 2 diabetes/obesity trial and the large pivotal obesity trial that includes subjects with pre-diabetes.</p>
          <p>Moving on to haemophilia, two events from the third quarter should be mentioned. Firstly, following further analysis of the phase 2 results for the longer-acting recombinant factor VIIa derivative, N7-GP, Novo Nordisk has decided to discontinue development of this compound for prophylactic treatment in haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Although the trial showed that the compound significantly reduced overall bleeding rates, with a good safety profile, no clear dose-response relationship could be established.</p>
          <p>Finally, following positive early clinical results for the long-acting N8-GP and the issuing in the phase 2 meetings with the regulatory authorities, Novo Nordisk has decided to progress this <mark type="ph" /> haemophilia-a (15:56) compound to Phase 3, which is expected to be commenced in the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>With that, over to Jesper for an update on the financials for the first nine months of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to slide 16. Healthcare reform continuously affect the sales performance of the global healthcare industry. Novo Nordisk is impacted by reforms in the U.S., most European countries, China and Turkey. In the first nine months of 2011, healthcare reforms have impacted sales negatively by around 2.5 percentage points when compared to the first nine months of 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year, we still expect a negative impact to sales growth of two to three percentage points compared to 2010 with a most significant impact arising from the U.S. healthcare reform enacted in March 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the financial results. In the first nine months of 2011, sales increased by 8% measured in Danish kroner to 48.2 billion and by 11% in local currencies compared to the same period in 2010. The underlying gross margin improved by 0.2, 20 basis points in the first nine months of 2011 compared to the first nine months of 2010. The improvement is driven by a positive mix effect, by the conversion from human insulin to modern insulins.</p>
          <p>As a consequence of a negative currency impact of 60 basis points, the reported gross margin declined by 40 basis points to 80.4% in the first nine months of 2011. Total non-production related costs increased by 4% to DKK 22.8 billion. S&amp;D costs primarily reflect increased sales promotion in the U.S. and China as well as sales force expansion in the U.S in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>Moreover <mark type="ph" /> sales and (17:26) distribution <mark type="ph" /> costs by (17:27) impacted by cost related to the manufacturer's fee, part of the US healthcare reform. R&amp;D cost remains at a similar level to the same period last year, reflecting expanding research activities and initiation of pivotal trials in 2011, offset by the completion of the phase 3a program for Degludec and DegludecPlus at the start of this year.</p>
          <p>Operating profit increased by 12% to DKK 16.3 billion. In local currencies, the growth was approximately 18%.</p>
          <p>Net financials showed a net expense of DKK 179 million compared to a net expense of DKK 966 million in the same period last year. This is primarily driven by a net foreign exchange expense of DKK 109 million in the first nine months of 2011 related to currency losses on non-hedged emerging market commercial balances compared to an expense of DKK 805 million related to hedging losses in the first nine months of 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide. This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. Further, the expected annual impact on operating profit of a 5% movement in each of our key invoicing currencies and the currency extent of hedging for the same currencies as shown.</p>
          <p>During the first nine months of 2011, the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar versus the Danish kroner was approximately 7% lower than in the first nine months of 2010. At present or at the time of giving this forecast, the <mark type="ph" /> u-will (19:10) value of the U.S. dollar is approximately 5% below the average level of 2010 and approximately 6% below the average level of the first nine months of 2010.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial guidance for 2011. Novo Nordisk now expects sales growth in 2011 of 10% to 11% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key products, as well as expectations for continued intense competition, generic competition to oral antidiabetic products, and negative impact from the implementation of healthcare reforms globally.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rates versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is expected to be around 2.5 percentage point lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Reported gross margin for the full year of 2011 is expected to be at the level of 2010 as the expected underlying improvement in gross margin of around 50 basis points is expected to be offset by a negative impact from currency of a similar level.</p>
          <p>For 2010, growth in operating profit is now expected to be 17% to 19% measured in local currencies. Given the current level of exchange rates versus the Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is expected to be 5 percentage points lower than the growth measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2011, Novo Nordisk now expects a net financial loss of around DKK 250 million. The current expectation reflects losses on commercial balances in non-hedged currencies as well as losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts. The effective tax rate for 2011 is still expected to be around 23%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is now expected to be around DKK 3 billion in 2011. The reduced outlook for capital expenditure in 2011 does not relate to significant changes in the planned investment in the world's largest insulin filling plant in Tianjin, China or manufacturing facilities for the new prefilled device FlexTouch, <mark type="ph" /> but (21:24) is due to adjustments to the remaining investment portfolio. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are still around DKK 2.7 billion and the free cash flow is now expected to be around DKK 17.5 billion.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly change business condition for Novo Nordisk during the remaining part of 2011 and that currency exchange rate, especially the U.S. dollar will remain <mark type="indiscernible" /> (21:48) level versus the Danish kroner during remaining part of 2011.</p>
          <p>This concludes the financial update. Now back to you, Lars.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper and Mads. As closing remarks, I'd like to highlight the key drivers behind our business. Diabetes care market continues to be characterized by solid underlying growth rate as more people are diagnosed with diabetes and treated with more advanced products. We are the clear market leader with 50% insulin volume market share, and with Victoza we continue to expand our share of the total diabetes care market which now is currently more than 24%.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk committed to diabetes care insulin treatment is particular demonstrated by the recent submission of Degludec and DegludecPlus for approval in Untied States and Europe. In addition we are investigating the use of liraglutide for treatment of obesity and we have a full portfolio of products <mark type="ph" /> with in general (22:49) hemophilia and later stage clinical trails.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide, please. We are now going to move on to the Q&amp;A part and operator we are ready to take the first question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Henrik Simonsen from SEB Enskilda. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two questions. Lars or Jesper could you put a little bit color behind your preliminary guidance for 2012 since we have all these budget deficits both sides of the Atlantic, do you have put any austerity measures into your guidance? And secondly, there is this issue about Prandin may be going generic in the United States. Is any of that included in your guidance? Can you give a little bit of clarity on that?</p>
          <p>Secondly, I was wondering your R&amp;D rate fell below 14%, the lowest in I think five years. What are we to expect for the R&amp;D rate this year and any say guidance or whatever for next year. Will it stay at the same low level or should we expect the R&amp;D rate to pick up again in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Henrik. This is Lars Rebien, and while Jesper is looking into the expectations for R&amp;D going forward perhaps I'd give you a little color on what is included in the guidance for 2012. And we of course noticing here that the environment is rather uncertain. There are certain known healthcare reforms which will have an additional impact on our business next year in particular full year impact of the European healthcare reforms and also full year impact of Chinese healthcare reforms and anticipation of impact from current Turkish healthcare reforms being discussed. So all of these known factors have been included in our outlook for 2012.</p>
          <p>We've also anticipated some generalization of Prandin in United States; for political reasons, of course, I don't want to disclose when and what. But we have a significant amount of sales in the budget next year but also generic competition for Prandin included. And Jesper is correct that the R&amp;D percentage has gone down this year; however, this should be a temporary issue but what of the 2012 outlook.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The guidance we're giving currently for the full year 2011 will be in R&amp;D ratio between 14% and 15%. And although I certainly refrain from giving guidance towards individual cost factors in 2012, we do of course have a lot of transparency on what programs are going to be in phrase 3 and that's the key driver of the costs. So I'd be surprised it would be very different from this level in 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add Henrik a little bit longer term perspective on this, it is certainly not our intentions to reduce investment in R&amp;D. We have major, major programs as you are well aware. In obesity we have <mark type="ph" /> both (26:07) marketing commitments on Victoza. We have potential for developing Victoza in combination with insulins. We have a full portfolio of hemophilia drugs. And we are also currently looking into whether or not we can support the overall diabetes franchise with some extended studies on the already approved products. So certainly it's our ambition to up the R&amp;D ratio. There will be occasional quarterly stops due to <mark type="ph" /> dis cautions from (26:38) regulatory agencies and the like.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hello. It's Michael Novod from Nordea. Two questions, first is to China. There is a lot of focus on whether your performance in China is varying. Should we be worried about what is happening in China or is it simply due to say, delivery shifts and also destocking in China, if you could elaborate on that?</p>
          <p>And then, secondly you say Jesper that you will still be improving underlying your gross margins 0.5 percentage points this year. It's only up 0.2 for the first nine months. Could you give us some light on the drivers for the last quarter? And perhaps, also into 2012, whether we should see the normal 50 to 100 basis points improvement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Michael, this is Lars Rebien here. I'll give a &#x2013; at least my five cents worth on China at the moment and then Jesper and talk about the margin development for the remaining of the year and for next year.</p>
          <p>Should you be worried about China? One should always be worried, it is. When we look at the Q3 sales in China, it is flat. And if you want to annualize that, we've had a negative impact from healthcare reform in China of around DKK 100 million and that is somewhat like 8%, 9% of quarterly sales. We had an usual shipment pattern of NovoNorm to China, which is normalized would account for normally 6% growth. So when you back in these factors of once-offs, we expect &#x2013; then you're looking at growth rates going forward of closer to 15%, which is what we are predicting going forward.</p>
          <p>What has happened in China is there has been a healthcare reform enacted which has had several impacts. First of all the price, listing price has been reduced on human insulins and on NovoNorm and which has some impact on our business. Then as a result of this and the essential drop listing, we have seen increased competition and we've also noted this in the past we see quite aggressive pricing activity especially in human insulins amongst local manufacturers and also some of the foreign manufacturers. So we have lost some market share in China, however, we have also expanded our sales force in China and we are sharpening our knives and our pens to be competitive in China also going forward. So you should count on growth rates in China in the area of around 15% going forward. But growth rates will be coming down as a result of these healthcare measures, but also as a result of the fact that the Chinese market is becoming larger and larger.</p>
          <p>Jesper in terms of margin?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the gross margin in 2011 has been impacted on the production side of lowering of our inventory levels and everything else being equal that had led to a slightly lower capitalization of overheads compared to prior years. That lowering level is probably flattening out now and that will then be improving on our production economy as we speak.</p>
          <p>And then looking into 2012, there is an area where we will see an assumed continuation of the improvement on our production economy and then on the mix side also see a gradual more significant impact from a relative high proportion sales coming from Victoza which is clearly positive to our overall portfolio. So I would be feeling reasonably comfortable in reassuring the market that in local currency terms and everything else being equal in terms of healthcare reform which of course can have an impact on gross margins, we would be able to deliver an improvement in our gross margin in the ballpark of 50 to 100 basis points for 2012.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking my question here. Just one question to start out <mark type="ph" /> with you (31:13) we can of course see that you have reversed the market share declines in North America. Could you try to provide us with some sort of information about how have you actually been able to do this, quite positively set a dramatic upward trend in growth rate for your U.S. diabetes franchise in this quarter compared to Q2?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Carsten. This is Lars Rebien here. Well, I think when we had the first half call we did notice that there has been some quite aggressive moves on the part of one of our main competitors in United States resulting in the loss of these three contracts that I also mentioned in my introduction earlier today. And we also stated clearly that we had no intentions of surrendering the human insulin market in the United States because we would like to be able to operate our own patients to the new products that we have. And so we have been, I guess more competitive when it comes to biding on contracts in the U.S. and that is the reason. Do you have any comments, Jesper?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Of course, when you look at our reported sales in the U.S., it will continuously be impacted by adjustments to rebate. And, of course, some of the rebate structures in the U.S. are shifting as the healthcare reform is being implemented and we have a delay in receiving those data. So the third quarter everything else equal is also slightly benefiting from an adjustment to rebates.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. It's Peter Verdult here from Morgan Stanley. Jesper, just <mark type="ph" /> with a (33:04) lot of talk about healthcare reform around the globe, and when you put everything together, could you give us some sort of ballpark quantification of what you think the impact of global healthcare reform will be to Novo Nordisk in 2012 as percentage of sales?</p>
          <p>And then just refocusing on the U.S., a lot of talk about incremental healthcare reform coming through and dual eligibles moving back to Medicaid. And, it seems if that were to happen the diabetes players, including yourselves, would be the most affected. But, I am just wondering whether that has been &#x2013; a thought to that has been included in your guidance because if that has, then it seems that your underlying growth is much stronger than you are pointing to in terms of the guidance you've given <mark type="ph" /> for nu-runi (33:44) for 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Peter. Hi, this is Lars Rebien here. I'll give you at least my perspective, and then if Jesper feels something is left out, then he is welcome to pitch in. Internal healthcare reform next year, I think it is rather difficult to say. What we can say is that this year our total impact for healthcare reform was about DKK 1.7 billion. And, we've said that additional annualization of European healthcare reforms will add another DKK 500 million to that next year. But, this is not taking into consideration what has not been disclosed and what has not been finalized. So, we cannot give you a really good fix on this. So, healthcare reforms, there will still be some additional impact next year from known healthcare reforms; non-known healthcare reforms, of course, we cannot say anything. In regards to the U.S. budgetary constraints and what that might lead to, we are of course noticing also like yourself that one obvious discussion point would be the dual eligibles in the Medicare party regime. We have not included any impact from that in our guidance to 2012. So, the underlying growth is not taking into consideration, in 2012, any additional U.S. healthcare reforms. Should they come, the impact would have to be deducted from the numbers that we have just given you.</p>
          <p>Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have four if I may. First, just a clarification to what Jesper said earlier, which was R&amp;D range of about 14% to 15% this year and next; is that a slight change to what you have said previously, which is around 15%? And, then you had previously guided to second half R&amp;D spend being ahead of the first half numbers, is that still the case? Second, moving on to FX, Jesper, would you mind just explaining; your unaccounted deferred FX gains as of the end of June was about DKK 700 million and as of the end September that's turned into a loss of about DKK 550 million. So, how should we think about that swing of DKK 1.2 billion? Thirdly, your impact of FX for the year, you're lowering the impact on the operating profit line by about 50 basis points. On my calculation that works out to about DKK 100 million, whereas your change in the hedging or financial income is about DKK 250 million, so how do we add up those two numbers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. That was a lot of questions here. And, I think I'm going to ask Jesper to try to take it in the order of sequence and then hopefully we can handle most of them actually.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In terms of R&amp;D, it's correct that we have lowered the R&amp;D guidance from originally 15% to now 14% to 15% so if we came in at the midpoint of that range, it would be roughly similar levels for first and second half. The guidance is not going to be firming up anymore at this point in time for 2012. We'll come out with more explicit guidance when we get to end of January and come with our full year results.</p>
          <p>In terms of FX, you were referring to a significant swing and that's correct and that swing has partly been related to the development for some of our major currencies which have been impacted. I should also note that the FX impact that we're seeing in our guidance for the year, which has swung around from being an expected gain for the year to now an expected loss of DKK 250 million, that swing is primarily related to the development in some of our non-hedged currencies where the losses can primarily be ascribed to the FX losses and that is currencies like the Turkish lira, like the Russian ruble, and the Indian rupee where we are seeing losses occurring in our financial lines as the commercial receivables we have there have lost in value and that will be the prime factors as far as that. Then, there was something around 50 basis points, what was that final one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, could you please repeat the last question, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. So, if I look at the change in your guidance for operating profit growth relative to where it was last year, you are saying reported growth should be about 500 basis points lower. The previous guidance was about 550 basis points; that 50 basis points delta works out to about DKK 100 million. And, when I compare that to what the change in the financial income guidance is, that's about DKK 400 million. So, just trying to work the two across each other.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I get that point, yes. There is a &#x2013; problem there is that the effect we are getting is primarily effect that's not related to the hedged currencies but it's related to the unhedged currencies. So, I don't really get the offsetting effect of the hedging from the change in the operating profit down to the effect on the FX. And, I actually to some degree get a double-whammy as the value of the non-hedged currencies are also turning into losses on the commercial receivables I have in those currencies. And that's the reason why you don't have that perfect offsetting mechanism. Historically, it has proven that the large majority of non-hedged currencies would swing back over time, but it's clear that if you compare the outlook for the financials and the reported operating profit guidance we gave from Q2 to Q3, it's a disappointing effect that the FX has given in this quarter. Whether the new, you could say, world economic order and the increasing importance of emerging market currencies will lead to a need for us to increase the number of currencies that we actually hedge, that is something that we are going to be carefully examining over the next, I would say, three to six months. And, then you may see us coming, in connection with the full year, with a broader portfolio of currencies that we need to hedge in order to able &#x2013; to be able to offset for operating profit swings in the results of hedging.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. And, there is &#x2013; this is Lars Rebien here. It is certainly possible that that will take place, because as we look at it, emerging markets accounts for 4.5 billion people. We see the strongest growth rates of the market outside the United States, from that particular reason and &#x2013; region and so it is likely that we have to revise our hedging policies as a result of that. Thank you very much.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jack Scannell here. Thank you very much. Can I just ask the China question again or in a slightly different way? Clearly, there is a number of things going on. You have had some reforms. You have had some &#x2013; looks like timing issues around NovoNorm and you also alluded to the fact that the long-term growth rate of 15% looks reasonable. How should we think about this in terms of timing, so do we &#x2013; and what's the relative magnitude of these effects, so in other words, when should one expect to see the growth rate pick up again with these things either annualizing out or else being sub-quarter anomalies? That's the first question. And, the second question relates to the long-acting factor VIII program. I think lots of us are familiar with diabetes trials. I think most of us are less familiar with clotting factor trials. How long is this going to last? What kind of size is this? And, also how should we &#x2013; what sort of endpoints are you thinking about? And, also what's the dosing frequency for the drug?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien again. On China, our estimates &#x2013; our internal guidance on China for the full year is around 15%. In nine months you have 14% so this would mean &#x2013; or imply that we are expecting to see growth rates in China in Q4 around 15%. And, those would be the type of growth rates that we'd be looking on going forward and that has been included in the guidance that you've been receiving &#x2013; the preliminary guidance for 2012.</p>
          <p>Mads, on long-acting factor VIII?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Jack, the classical situation for hemophilia A product is that you, according to guidelines, have to investigate in &#x2013; you can say non-treatment na&#xEF;ve patients, i.e., patients that have been treated for the hemophilia over longer periods. You investigate for one year therapy in different regimens, one being actually that you first of all show prophylaxis. And, the dosing frequency, I cannot allude to right now but say that we are in the same ballpark as the Biogen Idec data on factor VIII; whereas, as you know, we are quite a bit longer acting when it comes to factor IX. So that means that we will revert to you with the more protocol details later on. But, it's one-year therapy prophylaxis and you also need to demonstrate on-demand efficacy, and finally you need to show some surgical efficacy. So, there are three elements, and according to European guidelines you furthermore, as a fourth element, have to show pediatric treatment at a certain point according to the PIP Committee, the pediatric investigation committee in the EMA. So, there are a lot of discussions ongoing. We've actually had them with the agencies and we are now drawing up the protocols and we'll kick it off during the first half of next year in a total of about 100-plus patients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions. The first one is again on the healthcare reforms. You said that there is no additional reform in the U.S. in your outlook for 2012. Can we say the same regarding Europe? The second question is on the marketing costs for the launch of Degludec. What amount can we expect for 2012? And, maybe can you give us a breakdown &#x2013; a geographical breakdown, the U.S., Europe, rest of the world? And, the last question is with regards to the CapEx assumptions. What can we assume for 2012 and beyond? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. We're getting very &#x2013; into some quite detailed questions on 2012, and obviously, we'd prefer to defer many of the details until the time when we announce the full-year result. But, suffice to say, I don't mind repeating again here that and as far as healthcare reform goes, United States, no additional healthcare reforms have been included in our guidance. So, anything coming there would be a negative. In Europe, we have included all known healthcare reforms and annualized these if they have been enacted very recently in Europe. So &#x2013; and that's also why we have this &#x2013; a very cautious guidance on the top-line because more could occur, which we're not aware of today and that is in a broad term impacting our top-line guidance as such.</p>
          <p>Launch cost for Degludec, we cannot give you and we are not really willing &#x2013; it is not because we don't &#x2013; we want to be unpleasant, but that we are not willing to give you regional details on this. Suffice to say this is perhaps one of the biggest opportunities the company has ever had. And we are going to make the most out of it and taking all the learnings that we've had from the Victoza launch, applying these to Degludec and eventually DegludecPlus. And you can see on the operating profit guidance that we've taken significant cost estimates into our guidance for next year to account for that.</p>
          <p>And Jesper, on CapEx?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on Degludec, of course, it's impossible for us to give a cost estimate guidance. The reason why we put a caution in there that it included investments was that it's going to be significant. The exact timing of the Degludec launch will follow the regulatory process. And there is a number of uncertainties there including how the U.S. process going to be &#x2013; is there going to be an advisory committee meeting et cetera, et cetera which may have implication on timelines et cetera. So the exact spending and especially when you are filing towards the end of Q3, of course, the exact timing of launch cost in 2012 and '13 is going to be extreme hard to predict at this point in time and we will only get a certainty on that as the regulatory process progress in both Europe and U.S., and then of course noting that we will also be very busy on the regulatory front with continuous filing as we move along.</p>
          <p>And then moving on to CapEx, the expectation we currently have for 2012 on CapEx would be in the ballpark of 5% to 6% of sales.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Martin Parkh&#xF8;i, Danske Bank. Two questions. Firstly Victoza in Japan, you have showed a lot of class with how it had developed in some European countries. Could you talk a little bit about Japan? I understand that this is already accounted for more than 5% of Victoza sales in the third quarter. How big a share have it now taken of the Japanese diabetes market in total, and how far can we actually go?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, sorry for come back to U.S. again with the insulin growth of 13%. Jesper, could you quantify the impact from this rebate that has been reversed of what you call it in the third quarter? And could you tell a little about how has the volume growth been for you in this quarter in U.S.?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien here on Victoza and what we're noting here is that we're starting to see some significant and meaningful numbers from Victoza in Japan. This is still too early days. I remind you of the very unfortunate launch situation we had where Japanese key opinion leaders actually erroneously ended up discontinuing insulin on a couple of type 1 diabetics and as a result of that there were some fatalities which led us to focus primarily on safety for the ensuing 12 months and also now we do not any longer have any restrictions in terms of the Rx prescriptions in Japan and that is also accelerating the sales. But so far we're talking about percentages which are significantly lower than what we see in Europe. In European markets we are &#x2013; in some markets off to a 10% of diabetes value &#x2013; market share for Victoza. We're targeting more like 1% in Japan at the moment. So there is still a long way to go but it's on a positive track.</p>
          <p>Jesper, do you care to comment on third quarter 13% insulin growth, what rebate impact in volume and value, if you wish?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the reason why I made the comment was just that basically the implementation of the U.S. healthcare reform is making us very sensitive to what level of rebates that we're going to include, for example, for Medicaid. And lot of that reporting to include those and &#x2013; carefully those rebate and the donut hole cost for us, and including that those data we get with significant delays and we continuously adjust our provisions.</p>
          <p>I wouldn't want you to kind of say that there is a specific amount hitting Q3 as such. I am just saying that there is inherent an effect in our reporting that is delayed because of having to account for cost in relation to a healthcare reform where we see &#x2013; received data with six months' delay. And everything else being equal that has had a slight positive effect. I wouldn't say that it completely changes number, but it has had a slight positive effect in the third quarter alone.</p>
          <p>I do feel that the year-to-date numbers for the growth in the U.S. business is giving a very accurate sign of the value growth in our U.S. business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Let me then repeat that, so that we have that on the record. In the U.S., local currency growth in value is 8% and the volume growth of the U.S. market in the same period was 5.6% and we lost slight market share in overall volume, but not anywhere near, I mean we are talking &#x2013; perhaps 1 percentage point market share loss. So, we have gained &#x2013; we have grown volume and we've also grown value as a result of conversion to modern insulins.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks for my questions. Just two clarifying questions, firstly on the factor VIII, just to understand the dosing comment, I think you said they are similar to the Biogen program, can I read into that that weekly doing is off the table or is weekly still a possibility? And just some qualitative comments from the phase 1 data, how do you think this compound may differentiate versus the products that are out there or in development?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, just back to U.S. insulin, on pricing year-to-date, if my numbers are correct, I think you've taken roughly 10% price increase on your portfolio year-to-date, that's roughly half what I think Lilly has taken. We usually move pricing in tandem, can we assume a price catch up at some point in the near term, and is net pricing after rebates as different as it is on list prices? Thanks.</p>

          <p>If I start out with the pricing, it's about correct that we have seen list price increases of around 10% and this is of course not translating into net price take-home for us due to the rebating situation. Speculation about this going forward and how that's going to be played out between the two main competitors, I don't want to speculate on this probably as you may understand.</p>
          <p>You will see the results of our contracting on the growth numbers of our U.S. insulin business going forward. Mads, is weekly dosing of factor VIII going off the table and what do you have for perhaps color on the phase 1 clinical trials?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Sachin, first of all, I think we all realized that native factor VIII has this classic half life of 11 to 12 hours and what we are seeing, which I believe is the same as the Biogen colleagues are seeing, is a half life in the ballpark of around 20 hours or so for these longer acting molecules. So it's the simplest, the difference you can see between Degludec and glargine to make that analogy.</p>
          <p>When that is said, it also implies that moving, for instance, from three times weekly to once weekly infusion could be at the expense of efficacy, i.e. the trough level you would achieve if you in a average population go to once weekly infusion, maybe unaccepted below and you will have breakthrough <mark type="ph" /> beeves (53:36) to an unacceptable level. That does not mean to say that individual pharmacokinetic based dosing cannot take place. However, I don't think it's going to be the major element in a phase 3a program. It's something for further study for instance in phase 3b.</p>
          <p>My personal belief is that if we look at the N9-GP, we will initially launch that as a once weekly infusion but it does have the potential to go to twice monthly based on the 100-hour half life. By inference with the 20-hour half life you are nowhere close to bimonthly and you are even at risk of not achieving a robust once weekly infusion response, for which reason we will probably in phase 3a, even though we haven't kick it off yet, be targeting a slightly more frequent infusion situation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. I think just to return to the 2012 guidance, so I am just trying to understand why there is nothing in 2012 in your assumption for the U.S. reform because it seems very likely that something will happen. And perhaps you could share with us the percentage of your U.S. sales through the Medicare and Medicaid channels.</p>
          <p>And then looking outside of the U.S., are there any particular countries you would highlight as the highest risk regions for some reform next year, ones that you've particularly got your eye on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Well, the reason why we have not included anything on U.S. healthcare reform is that we don't know what's going to happen in the U.S. There is this super committee working on a proposal to find $1.5 trillion savings over the next 10 years. Either this committee comes out with concrete proposals which can be endorsed from both sides of the house and these could be implemented, and such concrete proposals could of course be healthcare related and some of the ones that we have speculated and discussed earlier in this program, in this call.</p>
          <p>If that is not achievable, then it's more like <mark type="ph" /> a haircut (55:52) across the board. And depending on how that is defined, it will have different implications for different pharmaceutical companies, and therefore it's a little bit early for us to speculate on. So we have not counted on anything as I mentioned and repeated again for the U.S.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just a clarification on what we have included in our guidance is all the effects of the current healthcare reform as it stands, and there are &#x2013; the majority of the impact has been implemented with effect from 2011. There are still elements of the healthcare reforms which will have a slight negative impact in '12. But to be clear on what &#x2013; just to repeat what Lars is saying is that we have not <mark type="ph" /> im-placted (56:38) any additional impact from a new initiative in 2012 as we don't know such new initiatives.</p>
          <p>And then moving onto the split of our U.S. sales between the various parts of plans, you're seeing that <mark type="ph" /> in part (56:55) the numbers Medicare and Medicaid is in the 25% to 30% of our total sales and you would have Medicare Part D accounting for approximately double the volume of the Medicaid channel, then you have some reasonable guidance of where it is.</p>
