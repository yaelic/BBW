          <p>Good morning and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the H&amp;M Nine-Month Report. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode until we conduct a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And just to remind you that this conference call is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I would now like to hand over to the Chairperson, Nils Vinge. Please begin your meeting and I'll be standing by.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Welcome to this telephone conference on the occasion of H&amp;M's nine months' results. The presentation slides are found on our Web site, hm.com. Our CFO, Jyrki Tervonen is with me today and we'll be happy to answer your questions after the presentation.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the slide Third Quarter 2011. H&amp;M delivered satisfactory sales in the third quarter in a very tough fashion retail market. Many countries faced economic difficulties and competition was even more markdown-driven than last year. In this environment, H&amp;M managed to strengthen its position. We see that customers appreciate our long-term strategy to always offer the best combination of fashion, quality, and price.</p>
          <p>Sales, including VAT, increased by 5% in local currencies. Net sales, converting to SEK, were largely unchanged from last year at SEK 26.9 billion. In comparable units, sales were 3% lower than in the third quarter last year, although against high comparables of plus 11%.</p>
          <p>Like we state in the report, the weather was unfavorable this summer, with wet and cold weather in many important European markets, followed by a heat wave across large parts of Europe in the second half of August.</p>
          <p>Looking at sales in our markets thus far this year, please turn to the slide Sales Per Market. Sales have been strong above all in the U.S., the UK and China, markets where we expand rapidly. Meanwhile, Norway, Switzerland and Austria were weaker, as well as Japan.</p>
          <p>Going back to the third quarter, please return to the slide Third Quarter 2011. Gross profit for the quarter was 7 corresponding to a gross margin of 58.6%, down from 60.5% last year.</p>
          <p>Unfavorable external factors led to higher sourcing costs which affected the gross margin negatively. Just to illustrate, if you turn to the chart Cotton Prices for a moment, you can see how prices rallied before they peaked earlier this spring. Cotton prices have come down since then but are still at high levels historically. In addition, there was a negative effect from a stronger U.S. dollar compared to last year.</p>
          <p>Markdowns in relation to sales were at the same level as last year, and therefore the effect on the gross margin was neutral year-on-year. This was a result of a successful assortment planning and the way of working with markdowns in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking at OpEx, we kept our strong control on costs across the group. SG&amp;A was SEK 11.1 billion in the quarter, up 4% in SEK and 9% in local currencies. The increase is explained mainly by the expansion and partly also by our continued long-term investments in marketing, IT, and online. The operating margin was 17.5%. Net financial items totaled SEK 143 million compared to SEK 79 million. And profit after financial items was almost SEK 4.9 billion compared to SEK 5.7 billion a year ago.</p>
          <p>The strong development of the Swedish krona, of course, had a negative effect on the reported numbers. Estimated tax rate for the quarter was 26%, and net profit was SEK 3.6 billion, corresponding to earnings per share of SEK 2.17.</p>
          <p>Moving over to expansion, we opened 119 stores net in the first nine months and had a total of 2,325 stores at the end of August, franchise and our other brands included. For the full year, we plan to open around 265 stores net, which is 15 stores more than the 250 we planned originally. The reason why we were speeding up our expansion this year is that we are opening more stores than planned at the beginning of the year, primarily in China, Croatia and Romania.</p>
          <p>Asia is an increasingly important region for our expansion. On the 3rd of September, the first H&amp;M store opened in Singapore, and with that H&amp;M is now present in 41 markets. It was a fantastic opening on Orchard Road. The first customers arrived already the day before and spent the night outside the store to get first in line. Since then, the response from shoppers has been fantastic and sales have exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>We see a great potential for H&amp;M in Southeast Asia. Next year, we plan to open in two new exciting markets, Indonesia and Thailand, both via franchise.</p>
          <p>We also expand in Europe. Bulgaria will become a new market in 2012. H&amp;M will open at the best location in Sofia in the shopping center, The Mall. This first store is planned for March and we see good opportunities to open many more across the country. The potential is big also for our other brands, COS, Cheap Monday, Monki, Weekday and H&amp;M Home. COS' first store in Sweden is a great success and in August, COS opened its third store in Paris in Montmartre. It has performed very well.</p>
          <p>Monki and Cheap Monday recently opened their first stores in the UK, both at Selfridges and both have had a very good start. We also keep growing our online and catalog sales. Monki and COS have just launched online sales in 18 countries in Europe. We see this as an efficient way to make these newer brands available to many more customers in several new countries and around the clock. Online and catalog sales at H&amp;M developed well also in the third quarter. Reception by customers in the UK has been great and we look very much forward to the launch of H&amp;M online in the U.S. next year.</p>
          <p>We have decided to move the U.S. launch from spring to autumn 2012. We see that we need some more time than we said originally in order to secure the best possible reception. A successful start in the world's largest online retail market will be very important for our future online growth.</p>
          <p>Those were a few comments on our expansion and now looking at some key figures for Q3, please turn to the slide Key Data. Stock-in-trade was SEK 13.3 billion, an increase of 26% compared to the same time last year and 28% in local currencies. The increase is mainly due to the expansion but also to higher purchasing costs and to the fact that third quarter sales did not increase as much as we had planned.</p>
          <p>Stock-in-trade was well composed with the large portion of new arrivals. However, the weather has been unseasonably warm in many European markets in September which has affected sales negatively. From the 1st to the 27th September, sales increased 3% in local currencies compared to the same period last year.</p>
          <p>Given a higher inventory level and a warm September, the sales development in October and November will be decisive for the markdown level in the fourth quarter. And as you can see on the next slide, in relation to sales rolling 12 months, the stock-in-trade was 12.2% compared to a low 9.9% last year, but within the range we have seen over the past few years.</p>
          <p>Cash flow from current operations was SEK 11.2 billion, which is down from the third quarter last year. During the first nine months, we invested SEK 3.3 billion mainly in new stores. Our finances remained strong, liquid funds and short-term investments amounted to SEK 16.9 billion. Return on equity was 41.1% compared to 52.3% rolling 12 months.</p>
          <p>Looking at the rest of the year, we have strong collections for the autumn and winter season. We're using more sustainable materials and after yearly increases, H&amp;M is today the world's largest user of organic cotton, which we're of course very proud of. This is one example of how we act long term to constantly improve our customer offering.</p>
          <p>We also have a new designer collaboration this autumn, Versace for H&amp;M, likely could reveal already in June, the collection interprets the very best of Versace's iconic designs. It will be launched in around 300 stores worldwide and online mid-November.</p>
          <p>Early next year, we have a new and very exciting collaboration with sports and style icon, David Beckham. Beckham has developed a new underwear collection for men exclusively for H&amp;M customers.</p>
          <p>David Beckham Bodywear will be available in around 1,800 H&amp;M stores in all our markets and online. The collection starts selling on the 2nd of February and will be followed by new product launches seasonally. We are very much looking forward to this collaboration, which is also a partnership between two strong brands.</p>
          <p>H&amp;M is present in more than 40 countries today and we have a strong position in all of them. Our business concept is fashion and quality at the best price. Our ranges are wide and our business model is flexible, meaning that we can grow globally both by expanding to new markets and by going deeply into existing markets. Our business model works well in large as well as in small markets and in economic upturns as well as in downturns. We don't divide market into mature and emerging; instead, we see opportunities for continued profitable growth in all our markets as well as for all our brands and channels. In other words, we remain very optimistic about the future prospects for H&amp;M.</p>
          <p>At the same time, conditions in the retail market remain challenging. Looking forward, it is with great respect for the economic uncertainty in many countries and the effects it has on our industry. We adjust to market conditions and we strive to improve in all areas, from cost control to the shopping experience we offer our customers.</p>
          <p>Our financial position remains strong. And we see that H&amp;M can grow with a target of 10% to 15% new stores net per year and do it with quality, sustainability and continued high profitability.</p>
          <p>We're now happy to take your questions.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> May we please ask you to ask one question at a time. The first question comes from the line of Erik Karlsson. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Erik Karlsson from AKO Capital. I just had a question on China, which has grown from nothing to almost 3% of sales now in just a few years. And I think you'd mentioned China was a reason for upgrading your rollout guidance. How is China faring compared to your expectations? And what do you see as the potential there in the medium term? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as you have realized, we are very happy with the development in China and it's doing better than expectations. And we started in 2007, I think, in Hong Kong and in Shanghai. And then gradually we have learned the market and adjusted and now we expand very rapidly as you point out. And it's true that initially when we entered this year, we had not as high expectations for the growth as now. And now we aim for around 35 new stores net this year, which is faster I think than we have expanded in any market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And how is the pipeline for next year preliminary in China?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We won't go into that in detail, but we'll come back to that in connection with the full year report.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Richard Chamberlain. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Hey, good morning, gents. It's Richard Chamberlain, BofA Merrill Lynch here. Just try to start with a question on the online launch in the U.S. I just wondered if you can explain why you've decided to delay that a little bit, that launch.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As to that we have decided to move it to the autumn, the simple answer is that we need more time for such a big project which is of course natural. When you have a big project, it's very difficult to decide the exact timing and we always want to grow with quality and we want to make sure that everything is in place before it's launched to really guarantee that the best possible reception among the customers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it sounds like a sort of logistics thing then, getting the logistics and the bureaucracy and so on sorted out, is that right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, it's a combination of a lot of different things and as I said, we really want to guarantee to have the best possible reception.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the current trading comment, Nils, on the September trading, you obviously mentioned the warmer weather in a lot of European markets. I mean, I presume H&amp;M has sold much better in its more established markets that have had more normal weather in September, is that fair?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely and that --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah and that's why we feel comfortable with the collections because we see that, as you say, in markets where they had more normal weather, we have seen good selling.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks. And just finally on the dividend, I know we're only at Q3, but that has been some cause for concern in the last couple of months. I just wondered if you wanted to make any comments on that in terms of likelihood of maintaining or intentions to maintain it for this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to the dividend it's a question for the board of directors and ultimately for the general annual meeting, so that's up to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I mean, is it &#x2013; would it be affected by the ongoing space expansion and your decision to accelerate that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, as we said, the discussions when it comes to dividends that's nothing that keeps up our mind. It's a decision for the board of directors and the annual general meeting. So, we don't want to comment on the dividend policy.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. All right, thanks. I'll leave it there. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Rebecca McClellan [Banco Santander]. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I've a couple of questions for you. Firstly, can you tell us the percentage of inventory at the quarter end, with was still spring/summer inventory versus autumn/winter inventory and how that compares to last year, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. The outgoing stock in Q3, what we can say about that is that we have a well-balanced outgoing stock in Q3 with a lot of autumn garments that we received in the end of August and it's a little bit higher than we initially planned. The increase of this stock in trade, it's mainly due to our normal expansion where we open up new stores and buy garments for those stores and also a natural result of higher sourcing cost and, of course, that we didn't sell as much as we planned during the third quarter. But the most important is that we feel that it's a well-balanced outgoing stock with a lot of autumn garments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And in terms of this autumn/winter, how committed are you now to the season? Are you pretty much fully committed to inventory inflow over the remainder of the seasonal or do you still have some open-to-buy that you can use or not?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't go into detail, but we always keep <mark type="ph" /> part four (20:19) open to buy. But as we said in the report, October and November sales will be very decisive for the markdown level for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Andrew Hughes. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi; it's Andy Hughes from UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Just looking at Q3 when you started the quarter with 28% more stock and had a weak month for the first month of the quarter and then you managed to avoid any markdown impact. Q4 seems to have started the same way, 28% more stock and a poor month. I mean, could we see the possibility of no additional markdown? Is it still possible if October and November are good, you could avoid any extra markdown?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we mentioned, as you said, in the report, October and November will be decisive for the markdown levels for Q3, but it's still too early, it's two big selling months ahead of us. And also the difference between the Q2 situation where the stock increased almost the same amount that was that the Q2 level 2010 was really low. But what the markdown levels will be in Q4, that &#x2013; it's far too early to say, but October and November, those will be decisive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just moving on to spring/summer next year, I mean, we've had a &#x2013; at least one of your UK competitors saying that merchandise prices are coming down for spring/summer next year. Would &#x2013; from orders that you're placing now, would you agree with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I agree that it looks certainly a lot better than it did compared to last fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we hope so.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, I mean, for competitive reasons we don't go into detail. But I mean, for us the ratio of U.S. dollar-euro looks better, for example. And of course, cotton prices have come down, at least, from the peaks we saw in March, but still on a high level. And of course, when it comes to capacity, it looks much better in the sourcing side than last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Okay, just perhaps one last one on your relative position in terms of pricing and the offer, I mean clearly, you've improved your position. I mean, would your view for next year be that you'll do more or less or about the same, in terms of your competitive position?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our strategy is always to have the best custom offering on each market. And what we can see, we have strength in our position and increase the gap towards our peers. So that's our long-term strategy is to always have the best customer offering on each market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">

          <p>Hi</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. The first question is on the gross margin and we've seen an improvement now, a sequential improvement, from Q2 to Q3 which I guess is the annualization of your &#x2013; the investment in the product offering that you had started at the end of Q2 beginning of Q3, the previous year. It looks like this is now done. Is it fair to assume that? Or do you still feel &#x2013; do you feel now that your product is that the quality and the price architecture that fits the H&amp;M proposition or do you think there is still some more things to be done?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's true that we have anniversaried now the substantial investments we did in the product offering last year. But, I mean, this is a moving target and all depends on the competition and we always will strive to work on improvements in the customer offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, based on market share data, it looks like you have fared a lot better than your competition in major countries these years and I presume that this investment and the product offering has helped. Do you feel now that 2012 any benefits that you're going to be seeing from [audio skip] (25:12) you have mentioned from lower cotton prices, better cost inflation, do you feel that you are going to get the benefit into your bottom line or do you feel that you'll have to invest some of that depending on the concerns around the health of the European consumer for 2012? What are your concerns in 2012 in terms of the demand?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As Nils said it's always a moving target. We are always working to have the best customer offering and we don't know. We are following both the sourcing markets and the sales markets and we always are reacting and trying to increase our gap to our peers. So &#x2013; but we don't know how the markets will react in the spring or next summer. But for sure, we will always have the long-term view on this and always look that we will have the best customer offering. That's our strategy when it comes to pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Okay. And the last one, if I may then; moving again into spring/summer '12, I guess, you're not fully bought for spring/summer '12, but there is a big chunk of that should now be done really. Orders must have been placed. Have you noticed any difference in the level of ordering for spring/summer '12 for your competition and yourselves? Or is it kind of the same level of business that you are planning for in spring/summer '12? Because for example, I have heard suppliers saying that the U.S. retailers have been a lot more pessimistic about spring/summer '12 and they have reduced orders. Is this something that you share or do you agree, disagree?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's correct. I mean we always plan for a positive like-for-like and we have this continued growth target of 10% to 15% new stores per annum. That's for sure. But for the rest of the industry, I mean, I did say it before and official statistics say that demand has come down. That's correct.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just a question on Germany. And I was wondering what you're experiencing, the sales in the third quarter seem to have fallen slightly whereas they were quite strong in the first and second quarters. Just wondering if you can give a bit more detail on that please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I mean we are very happy with the development in Germany in general but it's true that in the third quarter, I mean the whole German market was very &#x2013; much slower than previous first half and of course, we have a bigger and bigger market share in Germany so the bigger we get, the more, of course, we're affected. But also you should keep in mind that last year our development in Germany in Q2 was very, very strong. We beat the market very much last year. And, of course, last but not least, the weather has not been so favorable in Germany and the southern parts of Europe, as I said, with the rainy summer and the heat wave that hit us mid-August.</p>

          <p>Hi.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. And I have a question about markdowns as well. You talked about the markdowns being similar year-on-year in Q3. And I think one reason you mentioned for that is that you were marking down through the quarter. Have you changed the approach that you are taking to markdowns and marking more down as you go?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the main reasons for keeping the same level in Q3 this year as compared to last year, the main reasons are our successful assortment planning and the way we are working with the markdowns during the quarter. And what we include in the assortment planning, that's more or less the incoming garments, the timing of those, the volumes and also how we allocate the garments between different markets, regions and store and channels. So we feel that we have been working very good on those parts during the third quarter. And as I already mentioned, we have a well-balanced outgoing stock in Q3 with a lot of autumn garments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's great. Thanks. And if you could end up with excess stock through Q4, would you mark that down as you go through the quarter or would it be more likely to fall into Q1 and, say, the January sale next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We always have a &#x2013; keep a tight control on inventory and markdowns and we don't &#x2013; I mean it's always a balance of taking it directly or wait and we haven't made any &#x2013; as Jyrki said, we haven't made any big adjustments, but we always strive for improvements and fine-tuning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in general we can say that if we see that some garments types are not selling as expected, of course, we react quite quick on them because we know that it will be even more cost-some if we wait with them. So we don't want to roll them forward.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. And then just one more question. You said you saw great potential in Asia. And I'm just wondering why you intend to open via franchise in Indonesia and Thailand? Why not through own-operated stores?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that's a good question but the reason is very simple. If you start with &#x2013; I mean, the region in general, this is the common way for many of our peers to work through a franchise. But of course for us, the preferred way is always do it our own, ourselves. And in Singapore, we do it ourselves. But &#x2013; and when it comes to Indonesia, for example, we are not allowed to do it ourselves; we have to do it through a JV or a franchisee. So that's the reason.</p>
          <p>In Thailand, we are able to do it ourselves, but in this case, we made &#x2013; evaluated a lot of different options and we met very &#x2013; with the partner that we like and we feel very confident in working with this franchise partner.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just going back to the U.S. launch, is your planned structure in terms of the infrastructure there going to be the same? You're basically talking about a third-party fulfillment center somewhere in the Midwest as well as your existing two warehouses.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's true that the execution of the logistics will be outsourced <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:26); that's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, just generally with your supply chain subsidy, the second quarter in a row where you've been &#x2013; you appear to have substantial amount of excess stock. Now, obviously, sales have been a bit disappointing but not dramatically so. Do you feel that there are improvements that you need to make in terms of the way that you manage inventory going forward to make yourselves more responsive and to avoid these issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think &#x2013; as I said, I think we have a very good way of working with the markdowns and the stock balances, and we are happy with the outgoing stock in Q3. It's a little bit higher than planned, but it's in &#x2013; within those targets that we usually have had the past four, five, six years. So, we think we have a good way of working with the stock balances.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And, just finally, in terms of the FX your &#x2013; if you're buying, as we go into 4Q, does that become a positive for the full quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In theory, yes. In the U.S. dollar, euro becomes a tailwind for us. That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Why only in theory?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, because there are so many other parts in the equation as you know that &#x2013; you call it in theory.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>...have two questions really. In terms of the mix, also sales performance that you're seeing in terms of product mix, I was just wondering if you could give us a bit more color in terms of how much of your product now is entry price or what you would classify as entry price point given the repositioning you've done over time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is something we don't reveal for competitive reasons and we &#x2013; but I can say we haven't done any dramatic changes. There's always changes in the mix and &#x2013; but nothing worth mentioning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, you're not seeing anything from the consumer in terms of trading down within the ranges or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's not about trading down. It's about &#x2013; we have a deep respect for the situation and the economies in our markets. So, for us, it's always about striving to have the best combination of fashion, quality, and price. That's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We feel quite comfortable in the sense that we have been strengthening our position during the third quarter as well. So, in that sense, facing really tough environment, I think, we have a really good customer offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, when you made the quote on the front page of your release about it is extra important to have a long-term perspective. And, then you talked about both combination of fashion and quality that sounds like this repositioning of your investment in product could be ongoing for some time. Is that what we should be reading from that comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What we want to say is that, again, repeat our business idea, to have a long-term view, strategy and always &#x2013; and looking at the wide perspective. And, it's tempting when &#x2013; in the short term to perhaps raise your prices or markdown, et cetera, which short term could be very efficient, but long term, we believe it's always about striving to have the best customer offering.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, when you talk about maintaining profitability longer term as well, can you give us any expectation of what your sense is of a long-term operating margin for the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't want to give any forecast when it comes to operating margin, but our goal is always to have the increase in number of new stores with high profitability also in the future.</p>

You've upped your store opening guidance for the full year, so should we think about a similar magnitude of increase in terms of <mark type="ph" /> compare (38:33) FX, CapEx, and at the same time, can you maybe comment on what your expectations are the next year? Should we &#x2013; are we right in thinking that just CapEx growth in line with the space growth at this stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when it comes to CapEx, we came out in general and estimated the CapEx for the full year that it will be increase in approx 20% in local currencies but as it looks right now, it will be less than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay. In local currency terms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in local currency terms, it will be less than 20% increase as we came out in the beginning of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, why is it lower than your expectations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's a lot of different reasons because going in, in the beginning of the year, it's difficult to give an exact estimation of the CapEx level for the full year because there are so many moving components, uncertain components, for instance, the timing, the currency effects, the negotiations. When we go out in general, we don't have contracts for all our stores that we plan to open during the year. There can come up new opportunities or we can revise decisions. So, there are a lot of different things that can affect the CapEx level during the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Do you have a view on what the biggest driver has been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a combination of all these.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And, in terms of your view on franchising, just following on from the question earlier, do you intend to use more franchising or department store-based concessions going forward? Is that something that you see as part of the strategy for growth?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The preferred growth path is always to work to grow organically. But, of course, we are also open for franchise in some cases and concessions, as you mentioned, we had some recently in London but still very marginal.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, we shouldn't expect these to grow as a percentage of your overall store max?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. And, then just finally, really interested to hear your views on what you think broadly the outlook is for the European consumer next year. Clearly, we're suffering from all sorts of turmoil in the markets. How do you think that's likely to translate to the consumer response next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's clearly as I said many times, a challenging environment. So, it's always up to us to continue to work with our offering, the customer offering. And, what we see is that &#x2013; clearly, markets like the UK and the U.S. and even some European markets this year were already challenging, H&amp;M has been doing very well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, okay. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Georgina Johanan. Please go ahead and announce your company name.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Georgina from JPMorgan. You comment...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Your comment in the statement that costs in comparable stores have come down year-on-year, just wondering if you can give us a bit of color on how you've managed to do that and whether that's something we should expect to see continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. That's correct that we &#x2013; what we've mentioned is that the cost on comparable stores come down in the third quarter, not on year-on-year. But, we have really good cost control, and we're confident that we will still work with the OpEx &#x2013; operating expenses in a good way. So, the increase in the third quarter by 9%, it's &#x2013; the main reason is, of course, our expansion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks. And, then just to go back to the point on input cost pressures. Is it possible if you could just clarify for us what quarter we should expect to see input cost pressures peak in terms of your P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When they will peak, the cost, is that what you say? Could you clarify?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, because obviously, we see a lag in terms of the easing in the cotton price and coming through your P&amp;L just because of obviously buying, supplying ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I see what you mean. It's very difficult to give an aggregated picture. I think you have to look into different parameters and you start with the cotton, it's true that it still hasn't peaked, the effects of the hike &#x2013; the peak that we saw in March. So it's very difficult to give an aggregated view. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, but the peaking in the cotton still hasn't come through in Q3 then is what we're saying?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would guess it hasn't come yet, right.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Hi, again, Rebecca, Santander. A couple of questions and just following on the OpEx, does that mean we should expect the OpEx to sales ratio to start coming down versus the slight pressure on that ratio for the last three quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Could you repeat the question again, Rebecca? Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The OpEx to sales ratio, should we expect that to start coming down as a percentage of sales over the coming quarters versus a little bit of pressure that we've seen over the last quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When it comes to OpEx development, as I said, there is just previously I &#x2013; we have a good cost control. And we are not steering our business as OpEx-sales relation because that's of course, depending from quarter to quarter how we perform on the top-line. We are confident that the work we are doing with the operating expenses and also those long-term investments when it comes to marketing IP and online that will benefit us in the long term.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, &#x2013; but if I remember correctly, the IP and the marketing expenses, they actually, sort of, accelerated in the latter part of last year. That will now have annualized, right, going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. And, then my second question is just -- there's a volatile recent trading trend with July like-for-like down 6% and then August flat. And, it looks like September is again down 6%. What do you think explains the actual volatility? I mean, I understand we've had some adverse weather, but you say that the adverse weather hit August or the second part of August as much as it hit September, so what do you think is explaining this volatility in the recent trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, if you look historically on the monthly figures, they are always volatile, especially when you go from summer to fall or when you go from winter to spring, depending on when the cold weather comes or the warm weather. So that's why we always say you shouldn't look &#x2013; read in too much in a monthly figure; there's also calendar effect, et cetera. So, you should look at it over a season and more &#x2013; or say, looking back historically, not just year-on-year but making &#x2013; taking the average two, three years back in time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to clarify the previous questions about the OpEx development in comparable stores. Just to be clear, the comparable stores decreased the OpEx in Q3 this year compared to last year's third quarter. Just to be clear.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. Hubert Mathet from Laub Investment. Just a question on the long-term view in sourcing because now things are a little bit more easy looking down the road. Are you thinking long-term sourcing mix in terms of geography or you think that your ramp-up in Asia will be such in five-year time so that you will mitigate the risk of inflation and forex?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is an ongoing process. As you rightly put it, this is &#x2013; we place orders every day, and when we look at the sourcing strategies, it's not just about costs, and just like you indicate, there are a lot of other parameters to face as well, just like risk and currency, lead times, et cetera. So, I'm sure that in five years' time the sourcing looks different from today, but exactly how, I can't tell you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Could I just follow up? Just for the record your Q1 comparable store cost, it actually says in the report that comparable store costs growth were down year-on-year. So, is that a misprint in the report or is that just getting it wrong during the conference call?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's with a comparable period last year. That means the last year third quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, but &#x2013; okay, you write in the report that the costs in comparable stores were down compared to the same period last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>With the same period, we mean the third quarter last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, obviously then if I'm not completely behind here, cost growth in comparable stores must be down year-on-year, no? Sorry for being pedantic, but...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, when we are looking at Q3 development in our comparable stores this year, it's down compared to last year's third quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you very much for clarifying that for me. I'm sorry for being a bit dense here in the afternoon...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My real question was actually regarding CapEx. Obviously, you have been enjoying a weaker euro in particular this time around. And, I was just wondering have you been using that situation to step up your CapEx efforts per store in the pertinent countries in the eurozone during this year? And, could you also &#x2013; just for the record, could you just give us a feeling for actual return and CapEx requirements in, say, Asia compared to Europe? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, first question. No, it has nothing to do with the euro development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. When we're looking at the CapEx, then we go in and look really much on the opportunities we see in different markets. And, we have a plan. But, as I said earlier, a lot of things can happen during a year when the situations changes and the opportunities changes. And so, we are looking at the CapEx in the beginning of the year, try to estimate what the best outcome will be. That is what this steering, to always find the best store location with the best terms for us. That's always steering our decisions when it comes to CapEx investments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the average lifespan per store or whatever method you want to use is still the same. It has not changed due to the weaker currency?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Of course, we are always looking at different KPIs when it comes to the investments. But, nothing changed due to the currency fluctuations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, how does expansion in Asia affect returns on capital. Is there any differences for why any expansion outside of Europe would be different in terms of returns, paybacks, and return on capital employed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course, there are different circumstances on different markets, but we don't want to go in for competitive reasons to say what markets we feel is quicker payback or &#x2013; but of course, there are differences between the different markets. That's for sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say if you take the Asian exposure combined, that by and large return potential or payback times are actually net-net different compared to Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me put it this way, they look interesting.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sure they do. I was just wondering versus Europe, where they would be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We prefer not...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But, there's &#x2013; as I said we prefer not to go into details how it looks in &#x2013; on different markets but what we can say of course, there are differences in the investment levels, the payback times, et cetera. So, there are differences but exactly how they look, that we don't want to go into in detail.</p>
