          <p>Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to our 2007 Results and Strategy Presentation. 2007 has been another good year for Eni. We took a number of steps to develop our portfolio, positioning the company to deliver growth and value in the next few years.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we increased our resource base by 10%, adding more than 5 billion boe through a combination of targeted acquisitions and successful exploration.</p>
          <p>We have continued our strategy of building a strong presence in key producing regions, buying assets in Russia, the Gulf of Mexico, Angola, the Congo and Alaska. These assets were secured at a price of around $4 a barrel on a 2P basis. We have also added 1.1 billion barrels of resources organically through our exploration program. All this means that we replaced about 90% of our Q1 reserves at a year-end price of $96 a barrel, assuming a 30% stake in Arctic Gas and Urengoil and excluding our 20% of GazPromNeft.</p>
          <p>We have also secured our long-term relationship with legacy countries by defining contractual frameworks in Libya, Algeria and Kazakhstan</p>
          <p>Moving to gas and power, a division whose free cash flow underpins around 40% of Eni's dividend, 2007 was an excellent year despite the mild weather in Europe. As a result of our good performance, we will propose to our Annual General Meeting a second half dividend of 0.70, bringing the total for 2007 to 1.30, confirming our industry leading dividend policy.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we made significant strides towards a more efficient Eni. We achieved cost reductions of &#x20AC;500 million, equivalent to half our 2006-2010 target. There is still a lot to go for in terms of efficiency, and for this reason we have increased our overall target by 50% to &#x20AC;1.5 billion.</p>
          <p>As a result of these achievements, we are well positioned to deliver superior growth and value over the next four years. We have raised our production growth target to 4.5% per year. This combined with the strong cash generation of our gas and power division will enable us to reward our shareholders with top tier returns.</p>
          <p>Marco will now take you through our 2007 numbers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paolo. Good afternoon ladies and gentleman. The fourth quarter of 2007 Brent prices increased by about 49% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, averaging $88.7 per barrel. European refining margins averaged $4.1 per barrel, increasing by 87% compared to the corresponding period of 2006. Despite this trend, the margins realized by our owned refineries declined as a result of the narrowing of light-heavy crude differentials. Finally, the euro appreciated by 12.3% versus the U.S. dollar.</p>
          <p>Reported net profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 was &#x20AC;3 billion, 98% higher than in fourth quarter of 2006. This result includes inventory gains for more than &#x20AC;200 million and the net positive special items for more than &#x20AC;100 million, on which I will comment in more detail when discussing the results for each division. Adjusted net profit amounted to &#x20AC;2.7 billion, 13.7% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2006. This performance is attributable to the 11% increase in operating results and to the lower adjusted tax rate, equal to 47.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Finally, adjusted net profit for the full year 2007 decreased by 9% compared to 2006. The 11% increase in adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter of 2007 is essentially attributable to the good performance of our upstream, engineering and construction and gas and power business segments. These positive effects were partially offset by weaker performance of the R&amp;M and petrochemical divisions. For the full year, the adjusted operating profit decreased by 7% compared to 2006, reflecting the weaker results achieved in the E&amp;P and R&amp;M.</p>
          <p>Let's now look in more detail at each division's business performance. Reported operating profit for the E&amp;P division amounted to about &#x20AC;3.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. On an adjusted basis, the operating profit for the fourth quarter of last year amounted to &#x20AC;4.1 billion, up 29% compared to the fourth quarter of 2006, mainly as a consequence of the higher realization prices denominated in U.S. dollars and higher production sold. These positive effects were partially offset by depreciation of the euro versus the dollar, higher operating costs and DD&amp;A also as a result of sector specific inflation and the increased exploration CapEx, which, as you know, we treat as cost incurred in the year.</p>
          <p>If we turn to the full year, the adjusted operating profit totaled &#x20AC;14.1 billion with a decrease of 11%.</p>
          <p>Turning to the gas and power division, reported operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2007 increased by 10% to &#x20AC;1.4 billion while adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;1.3 billion, up 3.2% on business on a like-for-like basis. This performance was driven by higher volumes sold as a result of the colder weather and the increased international sales and improved performance in the regulated business, determined by higher volume distributed and transported as well as efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>It is worth mentioning that the fourth quarter 2006 benefited from the partial recovery of around &#x20AC;130 million relevant to the provisions made in 2005 on the basis of the 248 resolution. Full year 2007 adjusted operating profit reached &#x20AC;4.1 billion, up more than 5% compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>Turning to R&amp;M, the division reported an operating profit of &#x20AC;27 million in the fourth quarter of 2007 compared to an operating loss of 386 million in the same period of 2006. The result includes an inventory gain of &#x20AC;252 million that has been partially offset by negative special items for &#x20AC;130 million mainly related to asset write downs, environmental provisions and redundancy incentives.</p>
          <p>On an adjusted basis, the fourth quarter saw an operating loss of &#x20AC;95 million compared to an operating profit of &#x20AC;148 million of the same period of 2006. This result reflects significant weaker refining margins, mainly as a result of the narrowing of the differential between light and heavy crude as well as the appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. 2007 fourth quarter margins relevant to the marketing were negatively affected by the continuous upward strength of oil product price, which was transferred to retail prices with a time lag.</p>
          <p>In 2007, adjusted operating profit decreased by 58% and amounted to &#x20AC;329 million. If we exclude the scenario effects, our 2007 operating profits would be up 9% thanks to the higher plant available and efficiency improvement.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, the petrochemical business, Polimeri Europa, posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;129 million compared to &#x20AC;154 million profit in 2006. This is principally due to higher feedstock costs. In the full year, Polimeri Europa's adjusted operating profit decreased by 59% compared to 2006.</p>
          <p>The oilfield services and engineering sector fourth quarter adjusted operating profit amounted to &#x20AC;250 million versus &#x20AC;152 million in 2006. The increase is mainly attributable to higher results in both onshore and offshore construction activities. On a full year basis, the sector recorded an increase in adjusted operating profit of around 65%.</p>
          <p>The other activities segment reported an operating loss of &#x20AC;48 million, affording a small improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2006. For the full year, the operating loss amounted to &#x20AC;207 million.</p>
          <p>Finally, corporate activities posted an adjusted operating loss of &#x20AC;64 million. For the full year, the operating loss amounts to &#x20AC;183 million.</p>
          <p>This slide compares our sources and uses of cash for 2006 and 2007. Operating cash flow decreased to around &#x20AC;15.5 billion, primarily as a consequence of the strong euro and also as a result of the weaker contribution from refining and marketing and petrochemical business segments. In total, sources of cash were 16.9 billion. We used this cash to fund around &#x20AC;11 billion of CapEx, acquired assets for &#x20AC;10 billion and distributed on a consolidated basis almost &#x20AC;6 billion to shareholders. Our net debt ratio at year end was 38% irrespective our 40% ceiling.</p>
          <p>Turning to shareholder returns. In 2007, we distributed &#x20AC;5.3 billion in cash to our shareholders, resulting in a total yield for 2007 of about 6%. The overall cash return is composed of three elements: &#x20AC;2.4 billion as 2006 final dividend, &#x20AC;2.2 billion as 2007 interim dividend, and &#x20AC;0.7 billion spent on the share buyback.</p>
          <p>Regarding this last item, let me remind you that from the beginning of our share buyback program, we have bought 363 million shares, representing 9.1% of the share capital. At the bottom of the slide, you can see that in 2007, we returned around 95% of our free cash flow before acquisition to our shareholders.</p>
          <p>Thank you for your attention. And now I hand you over again to Paolo.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Marco. <mark type="inaudible" /> slide. This is the growth strategy that I set out for Eni in 2005. I am pleased to say that, first, we are delivering on all of these points and second, the principles remain at the heart of our ambitions for the future.</p>
          <p>In 2007, acquisitions were an important part of our growth strategy, but we are not interested in growth for growth's sake.  As Stefano will explain in more detail, our overall approach to acquisitions is to target assets where we can add value, leveraging on our technology, scale and integration along the oil and gas value chain.</p>
          <p>I will now take you through our major deals, explaining how each fits in this strategy.  In the Congo, we acquired a large stake in the giant M'Boundi field through two separate transactions, with Maurel &amp; Prom first and with Burren Energy second.  Here, we will create value in two main ways.  Firstly, our technology and expertise have enabled us to target a significantly higher recovery factor in excess of 30%.  And secondly, we have struck an agreement with the government to build an integrated power plant to monetize associated gas.  Through Burren, we have also gained exposure to Turkmenistan, which gives us access to a promising producing country and further enhance our position in the key Caspian region.</p>
          <p>Our acquisition in the Gulf of Mexico is an important move which allows us to build a leading position in this hydrocarbon region.  The acquisition price includes around $700 million for leases with significant exploration potential, which we feel very confident about.</p>
          <p>Let's now move on to Alaska where we have acquired operatorship of the Nikaitchuq field, located on offshore in the North Slope.  Here, Eni will leverage on its distinctive skills of operating in harsh and highly sensitive environments. Indeed, since we bought the asset, we have already increased the reserves by around 30 million barrels.</p>
          <p>In Angola, we acquired 13.6% in an LNG project, which will allow us to monetize gas reserves using our regasification capacity in Pascagoula in Mississippi.  Angola LNG represents a further step towards our target of building a global LNG position, leveraging on our unique integrated E&amp;P and gas and power model.</p>
          <p>Lastly, in Russia, we built on our longstanding relationship with Gazprom to enter this strategic area, acquiring prime assets at attractive prices. But I will tell you more about that in a minute.</p>
          <p>Overall, the asset acquired in 2007 were secured at the competitive price of $4 a barrel on a 2P reserve basis.  Excluding Russia, the average acquisition price was around $10 a barrel. Most importantly, our post-acquisition assessment confirms our earlier confidence in the assets upside potential. Indeed, we have increased our year-end 2P reserves from acquisitions by around 20% versus our pre-acquisition assumptions.</p>
          <p>Our transaction in Russia deserves a closer look. Entering the Russia upstream is a strategic breakthrough for Eni. The assets we acquired are considerable. Assuming Gazprom exercise its call over Arctic Gas and Urengoil, which we assume, our residual 30% will represent around 2.5 billion barrels of additional resources, significantly higher than we originally envisaged. Production will start in 2010, contributing more than 150,000 barrels a day of equity at plateau production in 2016.</p>
          <p>We have also acquired 20% of GazPromNeft.  We would like to retain our stake given the potential we see, but we currently book GazPromNeft as a financial investment and it is therefore excluded both from our production and our reserve numbers. Recent progress on the key South Stream project is further evidence of the value of our strategic alliance with Gazprom.</p>
          <p>In 2007, we also focused on strengthening our presence in three key producing countries, adding considerable solidity to our long-term organic growth. In Libya, we extended all our contracts. I remind you that Libya is our number one producing country for Eni and, I said, we extended all of our contracts, some of which were shortly due to expire for the next 25 years. On top of that, we will be able to monetize our equity gas with two key projects, an increase in gas sales through the Greenstream pipeline and the construction of a full scale liquefier in Libya.</p>
          <p>Similarly, in Algeria, we extended a key contract that would have expired in 2007 for another decade. In both cases, we were able to leverage on our presence along the entire gas value chain, which gives us a unique competitive advantage in dealing with oil and gas producing countries.</p>
          <p>Finally, in Kazakhstan, we reached an agreement on Kashagan.  The negotiations over the past few months have been a key focus for us.  There has been no shortage of media coverage and comments on the subject.  Let me tell you my view about this.</p>
          <p>Kashagan will continue to play a major role in the future of Eni, and we are particularly pleased with the agreement we have reached for three main reasons. Firstly, the original PSA contract remains unchanged and additional compensation to the Republic of Kazakhstan will be linked to oil price.  This ensures a satisfactory net present value for the project.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Kashagan has been a transformational experience for Eni and we will continue to gain valuable experience by operating the experimental phase of the project.  This phase, the experimental phase, will take us to a production capacity of 370,000 barrels a day, and this is the phase which poses the greatest technological challenges and therefore has the steepest learning curve. Our experience in Kashagan will be especially useful given the increasing complexity of other projects around the world.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, we have now established a stable platform for the development of this project with KazMunaiGaz as a fully committed partner. Following the completion of the experimental phase, we will share personnel contribution with other industry leaders. This will allow us to deploy our skilled personnel, the really scarce resource in our sector, to the benefit of our projects.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the strategy and target for each division. Despite the challenges faced by the industry, Eni has consistently delivered on its production targets. The reserves we acquired in 2007 in the world's fastest growing areas and in giant project, coupled with the strength of our existing portfolio, mean we will achieve superior long-term growth.</p>
          <p>We have raised our production growth target to 4.5% per annum for the next four years with particularly strong growth in North Africa, West Africa, Russia, the Caspian region and the U.S. Deepwater.  Beyond 2011, our portfolio gives us confidence that we can achieve a growth of 3% per annum assuming our scenario.  These targets are entirely organic, factoring in no further acquisitions.  These targets are also robust. Even at $90 a barrel, we will still achieve annual growth of 3.6% to 2011.  We will grow strongly already in 2008 with a 4.5% production increase at our oil price scenario of $64 a barrel. Even at $90 a barrel, we will still see growth of around 2%.  Over the planned period, we also target reserve replacement ratio of over 100% at our oil price scenario.</p>
          <p>Moving now to gas and power, I am pleased to see that our effort to provide more detailed information about this division has resulted in increased interest from our investors.  This is a business which remains distinctive and attractive for Eni. It is distinctive because gas and power is a strong differentiator in dialogue with oil and gas producing countries.  Our integrated approach has been a key contributing factor for recent business development in Russia, Algeria, Libya, and Angola.  It is highly attractive because gas and power is a strong cash generative business with a very low risk profile. Indeed, gas and power will deliver 19 billion of EBITDA over the next four years, half of which will come from regulated or quasi-regulated assets.  During this period, the gas and power division will also strengthen its European leadership, moving to counter increased competition in Italy by delivering annual volume growth of 9% outside our domestic market.  This will allow us to achieve our free cash flow target of &#x20AC;2.1 billion in 2011 and to position this division on a solid future -- footing for future growth.</p>
          <p>In refining and marketing, we aim to enhance the overall profitability of the business through targeted investments in refining and increasing European sales. Our European position in refining and marketing has been further strengthened by the acquisitions in the growing markets of Czech Republic and Slovakia.  We also achieved encouraging results on operational efficiency and there is further scope for improvement on this front. This strategy will enable us to achieve a &#x20AC;400 million increase in EBIT over the planned period.</p>
          <p>As we have seen, Eni as a whole targets significant growth over the next four years. Our growth program is supported by an increased CapEx plan. We will invest &#x20AC;49.8 billion over the next four years, up 6.6 billion from the previous plan. Let's look at this increase.</p>
          <p>Two-thirds will fund additional activities to drive growth.  For example, in this 6.6 increase, there are &#x20AC;1.7 billion for new vessels for Saipem, which, as you know we consolidate, which is enjoying a particularly strong market. The remaining third of this increase reflects the cost inflation that is affecting our industry.</p>
          <p>Looking now at the risk profile of our CapEx plan, 33% of the total will go into PSA projects, which had a very quick payback under the current high oil price scenario.  Another 15% of our CapEx plan will be invested in regulated businesses, which have an attractive and guaranteed return. We will continue to invest to drive our long-term growth while maintaining strict financial discipline.  Meanwhile, we are committed to continue sector leading dividends. Our divided adjusted for inflation is fully covered and an oil price of less than $40 per barrel. Furthermore, Eni will continue to push its buyback plan.</p>
          <p>The outlook for Eni is very positive.  We are confident we will deliver long-term growth and superior returns to shareholders, driven by the profitable growth of our E&amp;P division and the strong cash generation of our gas and power division.</p>
          <p>I would like now to hand over to the heads of our three divisions to give you more detail on the key drivers on the 2008-2011 plan. Stefano?</p>

          <p>Thank you, Paolo, and good afternoon. For the E&amp;P, 2007 was an important year of achievements and results.  And today, we are setting a new pace for the future growth.</p>
          <p>The upstream division reached record cash flow of approximately $16 billion.  Through focused acquisitions, we added new regions to our portfolio, strengthened our presence in some of the world's fastest growing oil and gas regions and improved materiality in core areas, adding approximately 4 billion boe of new resources. On top of it, we successfully implemented a well targeted exploration program that contributed for a total of about 1.1 billion boe of exploration reserves.  Major contributions came from legacy countries such as Egypt, Angola, Libya and the Congo as well as from the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska and Pakistan.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we finalized important agreements securing stability and paving the way for future growth in core countries. In Libya and Algeria, contracts were standard. In Kazakhstan, a settlement of the North Caspian Sea PSA was reached and the gas sale agreement for Karachaganaksi.  In the Congo, a gas project was sanctioned.  And in Angola, an important MOU was finalized, enabling new gas exploitation.</p>
          <p>A year ago, we were together commenting that a key priority for the industry was access to new resources. I believe that this year Eni, thanks to successful exploration, the above mentioned agreements and the asset acquisitions has properly addressed this crucial strategic issue.  All these results are indeed a solid base for continuing growth.</p>
          <p>As for production, I wish to highlight that in the fourth quarter 2007, production increased even with such high oil price. Compared to the fourth quarter 2006, production increased by 1.1%, which net of the PSA effect, becomes 4.3%. Main contributors were Egypt and Libya. The good production performance of the fourth quarter is more evident if compare to the third quarter of 2007. Growth is about 9.4%, which means 11.1 before the PSA effect.</p>
          <p>On a yearly basis, our production totaled 1,736,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day, down 1.9% from 2006 with a price scenario of $72.5 per boe, which means 11% higher than 2006. Excluding the PSA effect, the decrease was approximately 1%. It is worth mentioning that at an oil price of $85 per boe as forecasted for 2007, production would have been as planned, equal to 2006.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side, you can see the production variance analysis versus 2006.  I would like to point out that depletion of about 7.5% was more than offset by growth in new start ups.  Disruptions in Nigeria, the termination of the Daci&#xF3;n contract in Venezuela were balanced by the contribution of the acquisitions that in the 2007-2010 plan were expected to contribute with 35,000 boe per day production.</p>
          <p>For a complete reconciliation, we also show the impact of some external factors such the incident of Kaz in the UK and the PSA-related contractual triggers accounted for approximately 15,000 boe per day.  Excluding Nigeria and Venezuela, the PSA impact, production shows a 1.2% increase versus 2006.</p>
          <p>Last year, Eni was an active consolidator in the industry through selected asset acquisitions.  Portfolio activity was driven by clear and solid strategic and industrial drivers. Firstly, increase in production and gaining access to new reserves through the acquisition of operated assets in core areas and new oil and gas rich regions. Secondly, securing a global position in LNG and leveraging on exploration upside.  And last, but not least, adding qualified and competent management teams.  In short, a strict financial discipline in selecting the stellar growth opportunity was applied throughout.</p>
          <p>Such an acquisition strategy allowed us to add production, reserves and resources all at an attractive price. The acquired production in 2007 was 46,000 boe per day and will rise to approximately 190,000 boe per day in 2011. More importantly, as far as reserves are concerned, at year end, we accounted for an higher amount of 2P reserves than originally estimated. Approximately 1.7 billion boe of 2P were estimated while at year-end, based on $96 per barrel oil price 2P proved to be 2.1 billion boe.  This is a remarkable increase of 23%. The Burren acquisition completed in January allowed us to have a further 200 million boe. Total reserve and overall 2P reserves amount of 2.3 billion boe, more than 80% of which under concession.</p>
          <p>Finally, the average acquisition cost for 2P reserves is about $4.4 per boe.  The Burren transaction effective January 1st of 2008 required an outlay of $3.5 billion. The deal brings further production and reserves growth to our portfolio.  Moreover, it consolidates our presence in the core countries such as the Congo and gives us a foothold in Turkmenistan, a brand new high potential area for Eni and for the whole industry.</p>
          <p>In Yemen -- Egypt, we acquired exploration assets which were considered zero valued. They are now under assessment. In India, we took over a 27% participating interest in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company which we valued at market cap. Thanks to this acquisition, we added 240 million boe of 2P reserves.  The life index of the 2P reserve is more than 22 years.  The reserves' acquisition cost net of the exploration potential is $13.5 per boe.  Production growth rate in 2008-2011 will be more than 15% from 29 in 2008 to 45,000 boe per day in 2011.</p>
          <p>The acquisition of the former Dominion asset in the Gulf of Mexico allowed us to build a very competitive position in this hydrocarbon rich low-risk and top technology region and to improve materiality in the core area.  About 60% of the acquired leases are operated and we successfully integrated the highly skilled staff in our organization. Integration and the operational synergies in production and exploration will contribute to have more value in the future.  Through the Gulf of Mexico acquisition Eni almost rivaled its 2P reserves in the region to 345 million boe at year end.  The acquisition cost of these 2P reserves was $18.4 per boe.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter of 2007, Eni added new production from three fields connected to Independence hub.  Current total Gulf of Mexico net production exceeds 110,000 boe per day, in line with plans. Finally, we rely on the success of our exploration program, which was an important industrial driver for the deal. At the beginning of 2008, we obtained encouraging, I would even say, very encouraging indication in Kodiak well.</p>
          <p>Entering the Russia upstream was strategically driven by the determination to get access to very large resources.  Now I am very pleased to announce that the 2P reserves are currently estimated at 1.5 billion boe based on Eni equity of 30%, i.e. after Gazprom exercised its call option.  This represents an increase of 20% if compared to our initial assumption. Gazprom has the commitment to purchase and transport gas, and we are in the process of discussing with them the relevant contracts in a constructing manner.</p>
          <p>In Russia, we can leverage on skills and know-how we acquired in similar environments. Our experience in Karachaganak field is a very good example of what that means. We are building our organization in the country. More than 100 people are located in Moscow and 200 in Novy Urengoy.  While we have to still evaluating the various development options, we estimate that development costs will not exceed by far the very competitive level of $3 per boe.</p>
          <p>A 3D seismic acquisition in North Sambugskoye is ongoing.  Production is planned to start in 2010, contributing approximately 130,000 boe per day in 2014 and the plateau on over 150,000 boe per day in the following years; thus, boosting our production growth beyond the planned period.</p>
          <p>We sealed other important deals. In Alaska, our presence was strengthened by acquiring a 70% operating interest in Nikaitchuq sanctioned in 2008.  The production start up is expected in late 2009.  With a 13.6% stake, we entered the Angola LNG project, which was sanctioned last December. The project would allow Angolan gas flaring to be considerably reduced, and monetized 100 million boe of 2P reserves to be written in our books. Production start up is scheduled for 2012.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in early 2007, we consolidated our presence in the Congo by acquiring the balance 43% operating interest in the M'Boundi field. The project will enable Eni to develop approximately 180 million boe of 2P reserves. Thanks to the power generation project we just launched in the Congo, it will become possible to monetize gas in addition to consider reducing gas flaring. Furthermore, through a new water injection system currently in progress, the recovery factor will substantially improve.</p>
          <p>We are substantially exceeding the initially estimated 2P reserves. At year end, 2P amounted to 385 million boe, up 38% compared to our initial estimates. Reality is exceeding the expected upside potential.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to hydrocarbon reserves and resources. In 2007, proved reserves amounted to 6.4 billion boe and the all sources replacement at $96 per barrel was 90% and 16% organic.  With a life index of 10.1 years, these values assumed a 30% participation in the Russian asset and exclude the 20% shareholding in GazPromNeft.</p>
          <p>At a 2006 year-end Brent price of $58.9 per barrel, the organic and all sources replacement are 71% and 145% respectively.  Assuming a 60% in the Russian asset, as we have recorded in the balance sheet and of course still excluding GazPromNeft, 2007 reserve replacement all sources is 193% at $58.9 per barrel and 138% at $96 per barrel.</p>
          <p>At the bottom, you can see the resource base, calculated on our assumption of a long-term price deck of $50 per barrel, a 30% participation in the Russian asset, no contribution from GazPromNeft, the new equity in Kashagan and 100% of Burren Resources.  Future growth is secure by an overall resource base of approximately 28 billion barrels, up 10% compared to 2006 resource base. These figures include proven, probable and possible reserves plus risk exploration.  These resources represent a life index of more than 43 years while approximately 14 billion boe of proven and probable reserves represent a 22 year and 7.1 billion boe of proved reserve more than 11 years.  Such large resource base underpins a sustainable and long-term growth.</p>
          <p>Since 2000, Eni has been delivering a consistent and solid production growth, one of the highest in the sector. Maximized returns through production growth in the medium and long term in a higher oil price scenario remains our key priority. Leveraging on the high quality of our portfolio, we now target a 4.5% production increase in 2008-2011 and forecast approximately 3% in 2011-2014. In 2008, production is expected to exceed 1.8 million boe per day. Production profile is based on the Brent scenario shown at the bottom of this slide. For the long term, we are now using a price deck assumption of $50 per barrel real terms.</p>
          <p>Since the impact of PSA contract in a growing price scenario is becoming a major concern of the industry two sensitivities as shown on the top left. Assuming a $75 flat oil price in 2008-2011, production will still grow 4.1% while in a 90% flat scenario, we will still be able to deliver more than 3.5 production growth rate. This growth is inclusive of any specific contractual triggers. Still one of the highest in the industry.</p>
          <p>In 2011, new production will account for 27% of the total.  Thanks to the contribution from the 2007 acquisition and new start ups in West Africa, the U.S., the North Sea, Australia and Russia, production level in 2014 will be achieved by relying on growth in new start ups in core areas, in particular North and West Africa and the Caspian region.</p>
          <p>Total CapEx in the plan amounts to &#x20AC;33.5 billion, excluding &#x20AC;3.3 billion of non-consolidated investment and cash-up for the Burren acquisition.  Versus the previous 2007-2010 plan, CapEx increases by &#x20AC;5.4 billion, of which 48% is due to new activities supporting growth throughout the four-year plan and beyond. And around 52% is due to cost inflation. In particular, exploration 9% growth, &#x20AC;400 million to sustain our intensive program. Development, the increase is due to new activities, development of the acquired assets including Burren and cost inflation. 27% of the development CapEx is allocated to counteract the decline in mature fields, 41% to secure growth in 2008-2011 and the remaining 32% to support long-term growth beyond 2011. Approximately 60% of investments are operated.</p>
          <p>Over the last couple of years, we have substantially increased our efforts in exploration by raising our capital budget.  The results we have achieved so far are very positive and indicate that we are moving in the right direction. 2007 additional resources from exploration amounted to approximately 1.1 billion boe whereas in 2004-2007, the added resources were about 810 million boe per year.  The total resources added in the same period were 3.2 billion boe against 2.5 billion boe produced.</p>
          <p>2008 is confirming the positive trend. The results of exploration at the beginning of this year are also particularly promising with new discovery made in Gulf of Mexico, Libya, Angola, Norway and Egypt.</p>
          <p>We are pursuing a very selective exploration strategy, focusing activities in key areas such as U.S., North Africa, West Africa, the North Sea and Italy as well as new higher risk ventures in countries such as India, Pakistan, East Timor and Mali.  In 2008-2011 70% of exploration investment will be concentrated in 10 countries.  Our exploration strategy is complemented by portfolio optimization, diluting position in risky ventures and pursuing asset swaps. We have contracted in advance critical equipment, services and deepwater rigs to cover most of the activities in and beyond the plan period.</p>
          <p>Now a quick overview of the new projects including 2008-2011 plan. In the coming years, new production will -- is well defined and visible. In Africa, Eni can leverage of its leading position and the long lasting relationship with producing countries. We target a compounded average growth rate of 5.7%, thanks to the development of integrated gas project, offshore, and deep offshore projects.  Of a total of 12 projects starting up in 2008-2011, 7 will be operated by Eni.</p>
          <p>Thanks to the recent acquisition, Eni announced its presence in OECD countries.  Production will go up to more than 580,000 barrel of oil equivalent per day in 2011.  In the U.S., production will be sustained by the recent acquisition and the good results obtained in the exploration activity. As for Europe, new production start ups in UK and Italy will contribute to limit national depletion while Norway is a growing area in our portfolio. More than 3% growth is expected also in Australia thanks to Blacktip gas field where we are sole operator.</p>
          <p>In the Caspian region, one of our strategic areas to sustain long-term growth, we expect to reach an equity production of 155,000 boe per day in 2011 with a growth rate of 8.5%. These figures include the recent acquisition of assets in Turkmenistan. As far as Russia is concerned, we are building an important presence in West Siberia hydrocarbon rich region. The assets acquired are expected to start up in 2010 and to contribute materially to our production beyond the plan period.</p>
          <p>As for the rest of the rest of the world, it is worth mentioning that we will maintain a presence in Venezuela, a high potential area for the sector with Corocoro which started producing in January 2008.</p>
          <p>Kashagan, the agreement reached after long and at times difficult negotiations is balanced, good for all parties and secures long-term stability to the consortium. In this respect, the increased KazMunaiGaz role is particularly important.  All the consortium partners agreed to proportionally dilute their participating share to allow the Kazakh state oil company, KazMunaiGaz, to acquire a larger participating interest in the project. As a result, KMG will have an equal share as Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total 16.81%.</p>
          <p>A new lean program management organization, PMO, participated by all shareholders will take over once established. The role of operator will coordinate largely autonomous development teams. Eni will retain full responsibility for its security in the first phase of Kashagan development, the experimental program while the subsequent phases of Kashagan and the development of the satellite fields will be assigned to Eni, ExxonMobil, Shell and Total.  The rationale of this new organization model is the scale and complexity of the project next phases, which require massive resources in terms of both personnel and technology in excess of what one single company can make available.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, an important element of the agreement is the consortium exclusive right to negotiate the extension, the production period beyond 2041 and the right to match any offer submitted by any third party in this respect.</p>
          <p>I wish to outline that the experimental program did not stop during the negotiation. Although some delays occurred primarily because of lack of contract approval from the authority and problems related to new custom regulations related to the dispute and now resolved. The end of negotiation has removed the uncertainties surrounding the future of the project and the new cost schedule for the experimental program will be presented by the end of March.</p>
          <p>Coming back to production start ups, this slide shows the base for continuing growth beyond 2011.  These start ups will generate approximately 320,000 boe per day of new production in 2014. New production is well spread from the geographical viewpoint from legacy areas to new regions and from mature areas to high potential hydrocarbon basins.</p>
          <p>Looking through the new start ups in 2008-2014 period, it is clear that gas project and LNG in particular are important elements of future growth. LNG plays a key role in our strategy. We operate our gas business as an integrated portfolio with our colleagues in gas and power, monetizing equity gas and taking advantage of all the opportunities along the gas value chain.</p>
          <p>As for equity gas supplied to LNG plants delivery, this is target to go up to 7.3 billion cubic meters in 2011 and will be in excess of 14.6 billion cubic meters in 2014.</p>
          <p>Net liquefaction capacity in 2007 is 9.6 billion, mainly concentrated in Nigeria and Egypt. They are expanding to 11.3 bcm in 2011 and in excess of 18.8 bcm in 2014.  To better secure an outlet to the final market, we are expanding the available regasification capacity both in the U.S. and in Europe.  We forecast a capacity of 15.5 bcm in 2011 and in excess of 20.2 bcm in 2014 from the current 7.3 bcm.</p>
          <p>Finally, LNG sales are expected to grow from 11.7 bcm in 2007 to 14.5 bcm in 2011 and in excess of 25.8 bcm in 2014.</p>
          <p>I would like to complete my presentation drawing your attention to an important aspect that has made and will make a difference in our industry even more in the future: Be involved and operate giant projects. I believe that Eni is well placed in world scale projects. Among the international oil players is one of the most exposed.  We are present in 30 giant projects, 16 of which operated and operate over 35 billion boe of reserves.  This represents a solid base for short and long-term growth.  In 2014, more than 1 million boe per day of our future production will come from this project, 50% of which are already producing.  More importantly, over 80% of this production will be operated by Eni.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, after 2014, our production growth will be sustained by other major projects such as Kashagan phase 2 and 3, Angola Gas and Libyan LNG.  By relying on our people, our long and extensive experience, competent and highly qualified management as well as increasing advance in cutting-edge technological developments, we are in a good position to manage the growing complexity of the oil and gas industry, grow successfully and efficiently and deliver on our future targets.</p>
          <p>Thank you. And now, I hand you over to Domenico.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Stefano and I hope that you'll recover from your sore throat in time before the roadshow.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I will first take you through the 2007 results. After that, we will look at the strategy and targets for the next four years. 2007 has been another good year both in terms of operating performances and financial results.</p>
          <p>Gas sales reached 99 bcm, an increase of 4% if we excluded the weather impact. This was driven by growth in Europe where we are market leaders with an 18% share and an increasing presence outside Europe.</p>
          <p>The good operating results drove our record financial results. Adjusted operating profit reached &#x20AC;4.1 billion, up 5.4% compared to 2006. Our free cash flow rose from &#x20AC;1.9 billion to &#x20AC;2.1 billion, an increase of 10% over 2006. Adjusted pro forma EBITDA hit &#x20AC;5.1 billion, exceeding our performance in 2006.</p>
          <p>We can broadly break down our EBITDA into two categories. The first relating to market in Italy and out of Italy.  The second relating to infrastructure-based activities which have a stable return. This spilt between these two is approximately 50:50.</p>
          <p>Let's now look at the strategy and targets for each of these areas.  We intend to further increase our international sales, building on our unique portfolio of gas supply sources, transport infrastructures and storage facilities across Europe.  We target an annual growth rate over 9% in gas sales outside Italy over the 2008-2011 period. We target to grow in all areas where we are present, in particular in UK, North and Western Europe and France. In France, we will more than triple our sales and reach the market share of about 20% in 2011, partially through the expansion of our subsidiary Altergaz.</p>
          <p>In the Iberian Peninsula, we are targeting a 17% share of the market by 2011. Here we can leverage on LNG supplies at Uni&#xF3;n Fenosa Gas from Egypt and Oman. In coming years, we will also increase our presence in the U.S. market where we can rely on equity gas from any Gulf of Mexico asset as well as on LNG supplies from Cameron and Pascagoula terminals.</p>
          <p>Finally, we plan to enter the Russian downstream market; therefore leveraging on our unique upstream integration. In the Far East, we intend to maintain our presence with opportunitic sales. In Italy, we expect competition to increase in the next 2, 3 years.  After some delays, new significant import infrastructure, both LNG and pipelines will come on stream starting from this year.</p>
          <p>In addition to greater gas availability, we also face increasing competition from new operators, namely foreign national companies keen to directly reach end users. We aim to tackle to challenges to maintain a strong position in our domestic market, stabilizing sales volumes in the region of 50 bcm by the year 2011.  We plan to do this in three main ways.  Firstly, we are increasingly targeting the most profitable customers. We will improve our offer by tailoring pricing of services to the customer's specific needs thanks to our advanced risk management techniques.  Secondly, we are leveraging on our large customer base to increase the number to dual offer customers.  We set a target of 1.2 million dual offer customers by 2011.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, we will maintain a strong focus on increasing operational efficiency.  In the Italian mass market, we are targeting a 38% reduction in the cost to serve by 2011. This target will be pursuant to the rationalization of contact channels, a review of building processes, lower cost collection channels and a more streamlined management of contracts.</p>
          <p>Finally, in power generation, we target a more favorable sales mix, increasing the percentage of peak hour volumes on the power exchange from 53% in 2007 to 96% in 2011.</p>
          <p>I will now highlight the key growth drivers of our infrastructure-based activities. In international transport, we are investing to maximize the potential of the strength -- stronger cash generative low risk business.  We will increase our capacity by 16 bcm or 13% over the plan period through the debottlenecking of TTPC and TAG pipelines and the expansion of the downstream maintained pipelines. This will enable us to generate over &#x20AC;1 million cash flow between 2008 and 2011.  Similarly, Snam Rete Gas has recently announced a 4% increase in its CapEx plan to &#x20AC;4.3 billion in the 2008-2011 period.  80% of investments is dedicated to new assets and will enjoy up to 9.7 real pre-tax returns.</p>
          <p>Italgas and Eni Power will concentrate on efficiency plans.  We expect power generation to produce positive cash flows from 2009 when the construction on new CCGT plans will be completed.</p>
          <p>Our strategy enables us to increase our gas sales target to 110 bcm by 2011 from the previous target of 105 bcm in 2010.  We are targeting &#x20AC;2.1 billion of free cash flow in 2011 despite increased competition and pressure on margins.  Our CapEx plan is stable over the period. It's mainly dedicated to the development of our infrastructural asset base.  Overall, our objective is to continue to build on our unique platform to further increase our European leadership.</p>
          <p>Thank you to you, and now I will hand over to Angelo.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Domenico. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. Our 2007 results were negatively, and severely, affected by the scenario, particularly due to the narrow and light heavy fees differential and weak marketing margins.</p>
          <p>Excluding scenario effects, our operating profits were up by 9%. Thanks to the higher plant availability and efficiency gains through process streamlining and lower energy and labor costs. This initial result is in line with the strategy we put in place a year ago to enhance profitability. In refining the throughput on fully owned or participate, the refineries increased by 2% due to higher plant availability. 2007, we also started a project for the construction of 2000 barrels EST plant in Sannazzaro, which will be operative in 2012.</p>
          <p>We made significant progress on efficiency, restructuring our logistic activities towards a hub model. Meanwhile, all trading and shipping activities will now be managed on a group wide basis, which will result in further efficiency gains.</p>
          <p>In marketing, despite higher prices, domestic retail consumption was broadly steady, minus 0.2%. In this environment ENI was able to keep its market share in line with 2006, also through the launch of a new loyalty program, which was subscribed by 2.5 million customers. Outside Italy, sales increased by 4% versus 2006 mainly as a result of our acquisition in Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>2007, the refining and marketing division carried out three significant transactions that will allow us to reach critical mass in key European markets, improving the economics of our foreign operations. We carried out two significant acquisitions in Eastern Europe. In April, we signed the purchase of the Exxon subsidiaries in Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia, acquiring 102 service stations with an average annual throughput of around 5 million liters per site plus aviation and lubricants businesses.</p>
          <p>The following month, we bought 16% of Ceska Rafinerska from Conoco, increasing our total stake to 32%, which corresponds to an overall refining capacity of around 2.6 million tons per year. We expect a significant contribution from such transactions because of synergies between the refining and marketing businesses, economic of scale, our market share in each of the three countries doubled to over 10%, and an improvement of net core quality.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, we are currently in the process of selling our operations in the Iberian Peninsula to Galp, a process which we view to be complete by mid 2008. After the sale is completed, ENI's R&amp;M division will operate in the Iberian Peninsula through Galp. The combined operations will bring significant synergies. The market share in Spain will go from 4- to 7%, both, in terms of cost and supply options. The stronger competitive position will also sustain Galp's further growth.</p>
          <p>Moving on now to the next four years. Refining margins are expected to be volatile, but complex refineries will be able to leverage on resilient cracking spreads. The context of this scenario were engaged in a significant turnaround program to lower our breakeven through cost savings and higher middle distillate yield. In particular, we will increase our conversion index to 60% and achieve a middle distillate yield of 43% by 2008. On both these measures, we see further improvements after the start of EST in Sannazzaro in 2012.</p>
          <p>We target an increase in the throughput on owned and participated refineries to 37 million tons by 2011, terminating low margin processing agreements on third-party sites. Furthermore, specific efficiency program targeting maintenance, energy consumption and general expenses will provide a cost savings of around &#x20AC;130 million by 2011.</p>
          <p>In marketing, the outlook is positive. Notwithstanding the high prices, retail consumption is fairly stable. And, from December, margins are back to historic levels. In Italy, we are consolidating our leadership, improving the quality and range of our offer with premium products, new loyalty programs and non-oil formats.</p>
          <p>Abroad, we will focus on those European markets where we can leverage on scale, supply and logistic advantages and brand awareness. Overall, we are targeting annual retail sales growth of 2% between 2008 and 2011 and an increase in the average throughput per site to 2.6 million liters per year in 2011. The implementation of this strategy and the significant turnaround potential in our business lines will enable us to increase the EBIT of the division by &#x20AC;400 million in 2011 at the 2007 price scenario.</p>
          <p>Thank you. I will now pass you, again, to Paolo for his final remarks.</p>

          <p>Irene Himona at Exane BNP Paribas. Congratulations on executing a variety of transforming deals. So, I had three questions please. Firstly, on Kashagan. You said that the MPV is satisfactory at your oil price scenario. Do we presume that is your new oil price scenario? And, could you talk a little bit about the new or final CapEx on Kashagan?</p>
          <p>My second question is on the efficiency gains, you have raised your target 50% to 1.5 billion. Can you help us understand how we should track that improvement? What does that number refer to exactly? And, my final question is on production growth. There is a lot of moving part. Last year, you were targeting 3% growth between '06 and 2010. Now, you've moved a year forward, 2007 to 2011. But, of course, the '07 production was lower than '06. So, can you just help us kind of normalize the new growth? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Stefano will try to answer your first and third questions, I try and think. Okay? He still has some voice -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I have sufficient voice to answer the question. Kashagan and the reference to the MPV. Now, what is important I think is marginal consideration, what we managed to do through the negotiation is to protect the value transfer in terms of minimizing the value transfer at scenario which were lower than scenario, which basically is our scenario, 45-, $50 a barrel. Then, the major value transfer is achieved other than the value transfer related to the additional share of the Kazakh gas in the venture is price-related mechanism which basically according with the growth of the scenario allows a priority share which basically is a monetary transfer which is proportional to the increased scenario. So, when we say that we protect, we refer to the fact that at lower scenario, the impact of negotiation is absolutely marginal.</p>
          <p>In terms of final CapEx, something which has been decided, and I think to the benefit of all parties, is that there will be a new mechanism which means we'll announce &#x2013; we'll define and announce the CapEx program by phases. So, experimental program. Then, there will be Phase II and then there will be Phase III. I think a lot of confusion was created by the famous US$136 billion which was a combination of the development CapEx &#x2013; the combination of all the OpEx throughout 2041 and the combination of all the overheads and general expenses. And that was a number completely misleading which has created a lot of tension within the country which has made the early part of negotiation very, very difficult. So, now, we have devised a new way. So, we'll go stage-by-stage and that has been agreed.</p>
          <p>In terms of production growth, you said correctly that 3% was the target which we had set last year. Of course, every new program is based on the actual value of the reference year production. So, the 4.5% is based on the actual value of 2007. I don't know whether I answered, but this is the way it is.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me deal with your questions around efficiency program. Now, it is not a surprise to me that once you started to dig into efficiency, every year you improve your target. It is always like that. Now, on the specific of today plan, the 0.5 billion increase is largely due to E&amp;P which was not included before and &#x2013; because in the &#x2013; previously I did not include E&amp;P. And, in terms of the areas where we expect to have most of the benefit of this efficiency program is procurement; ICT; energy; energy consumption, particularly, in the refining business; reduction of overheads all across the Company, starting, of course, from the corporate center.</p>

          <p>Hi, it's Iain Reid from UBS. Sorry, I've got two more questions for the man with the croaky voice. First one Stefano was on LNG. You've got, obviously, a fairly bullish target for liquefaction &#x2013; equity for liquefaction volume increases. I wonder whether you can take us through the development of the projects, particularly when you see FID for Brass, Nigeria LNG 27? I presume they are also expecting to see FID, on Damietta fairly soon, given the fact they want to start-up in 2011. Maybe, you could also update us on what you think the cost per ton of liquefaction of those facilities might be now given the latest estimates there?</p>
          <p>The second question is on Russia. I wonder whether you can tell us a little bit about the terms under which you are going to be taxed whether it's a PSC or whether it's the existing Russian tax legislation for subsoil development et cetera. And, also, how much of the gas sales will be exported or will you get any access to export prices or is it just the Russian domestic price which you will be accessing? Thanks very much.</p>

          <p>In term of LNG, I think you said it, you have mentioned most of the answer. Yes, we rely on Damietta Train 2 and we rely on Brass Train 1 and 2. Basically, for the Damietta, we expect to have a final investment decision by the end of this year while for Brass 1 and 2, we were aiming at an earlier date. But, for a number of reasons, we could not make a substantial progress in particular with some preparatory works on-site. So, that has been reprogrammed. And, so now we think that the date will be sometime in early part of 2009 for the Brass 1 and 2. But, I think it is useful to mention that the place where I got this horrible flu is Nigeria. Because we were there meeting the President and together with the President there was the Vice President, Jonathan Goodluck, and the answer which we got is of total commitment to go ahead with the scheme of Brass 1 and 2 which I think is something which is very important.</p>
          <p>In terms of Russia, the terms are the concession &#x2013; concession terms with the Russian fiscalities. As you heard, there is a commitment taken by Gazprom to transport and take delivery of the gas. But, we are in the process of negotiating final terms and condition. At this stage, there is no indication that some of the gas might be going to the export, but certainly that is something which is not excluded. But, simply, it's not been tackled yet.</p>

          <p>Hi, Neil McMahon with Sanford Bernstein. Only two questions. Hopefully, only one for the croaky voice. First one is really looking at exploration and your strategy in the Arctic. It seems that you are trying to surround the Arctic much like the Russians are trying to do with good positions in the Barrens Sea and also in Alaska. Maybe you could tell us a bit more about your thinking about what's next in terms of exploration in the offshore Arctic and much of the core area that will be for you going forward? The second question is really around the overall group strategy on refining. In the past, you've been positive in terms of your thoughts of increasing refining exposure and indeed you've been able to do some of that. But, I was just wondering in terms of North American refining in oil sands, if you've got any further thoughts on that particular business. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So, I think for the &#x2013; as far as the first question concern, of course, we enter the Barrens Sea with the Goliath, and that has been the first exposure for us. And we realize that not only that was an attractive area in terms of being largely unexplored, but then we realized that that are certain themes which we know well and which we could exploit making the best utilization of our know-how. So, we naturally moved to Alaska as well. And, the recent move was the acquisition of the 14 new areas in the Chukchi area. So, for us, what is next? I think we'll continue monitoring the developments and we shall certainly take a close look to any additional opportunity in the Arctic region.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me answer on this &#x2013; our refining strategy. Just to be clear, we never thought to increase our exposure to refining. What we always said was that we want to be very efficient where we are with our refining capacity, mainly in Italy. This is what we are working on today. Then, we said a second thing that we might use refining as a way to enter or to increase our E&amp;P exposure in some countries, particularly in the Mediterranean. So far this has not been the case, but we are open to it. As far as the Canadian sands are concerned, we are somewhat cooling off on this prospective investment. We are cooling off for several reasons, including the very high cost that they imply, the potential environmental risk that we see, the fact that we have to integrating to refining, as you said, in the US in order to be really effective. Let's say the more we look into it, the more we are getting cooler on investing in Canada.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you &#x2013; it's Huw Williams here from Bear Stearns. Just three questions, if I can, please? The first one is, I'm afraid also on the upstream side, it refers to Libya and Algeria. I mean, clearly have been and will continue to be very important areas for your production profile, but I wonder if you can just give us an update or a view on the terms of access to those reserves, can you sign new long-term agreements? But maybe you can give us some flavor or color on the changes to any of those terms that you've seen in the recent negotiations and how that might affect returns going forward?.</p>
          <p>Second point is just to circle back on the Gazprom negotiations and ongoing relationship. You made some clearly specific comments about your upstream involvement in Russia, but I wonder if you could just take us back through the situation with respect to the domestic gas position in Italy and the timeframe on when Gazprom may take a stake in maybe one of your operations here in Italy? And also, how you see the relationship developing as you go forward?</p>
          <p>And the final question is just on the cash returns policy. Clearly, I note your comment there about retaining the industry-yielding dividend yield, but clearly in the context of what we are seeing across the industry, whereby, many companies are thinking about pulling back from buybacks maybe more towards dividends, maybe you can make some, also, comments on how you see the cash return balance as you go forward, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The two situation are, I will say, rather different, Algeria we have negotiated the extension to some existing contract as well as we accepted to renegotiate the physical terms of the contracts. While on Libya was a much more thorough sort of agreement in the sense that we had a large gas resources in an area already retained by us which were awaiting just the setting up of the proper framework under which to work and develop these resources and transforming them into reserves. So, I will say that yes we negotiate a contract and we also extended contracts in Libya, but in parallel we have created the condition so that we can produce 3 bcm of gas more to export it via pipeline and we have created the basis for the exploitation of large volume, basically something like 5 bcf of gas which would allow to build an LNG plant, full scale LNG plant together with Libya. So I will say that the Libyan scenario is something you know looking ahead of us which is much more material.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, let me answer about Gazprom, particularly, in Italy. As you probably are aware, Gazprom has achieved a capacity of transport of 3 billion cubic meters to be sold in Italy. They are actively pursuing to sell this gas. I think so far they probably sold a large part of it, they will be selling all of it, no doubt about that. Then, we have launched, a few months ago, using the rules which were somewhat dictated by antitrust Italian and European antitrust, a bid for the first phase of the de-bottlenecking of the tag, 3.2, I think, billion cubic meters. Am I right Domenico? 3.2 billion cubic meters.</p>
          <p>Now, we launched the bid, this bid has been won by 149 different subjects. We have the impression that Gazprom might be buying some of this transport capacity from the winner of the bid and therefore might increase, in the future, their quantity of export into Italy. I have to tell you that all of this is of no concern for us, because we have a ceiling, we cannot sell more, therefore we are not really very much interested in knowing who will be selling additional quantity of gas in Italy.</p>
          <p>Now, as far as cash and buybacks are concerned, we continue in the policy we've been implemented for many years to be at the top in terms of dividend yield in our industry. Also because we perceive that most of the investors prefer dividends to share buybacks. As far as share buybacks, we have still some room to go in our buyback plan. We will continue to buy shares more or less at the same pace we have been using in the last year. When we will get to the ceiling of 10%, possibly we will have a much clearer position in our shareholders in the treasury department, and we will take decision according to what they will desire to do in the Shareholder Meeting, because as you certainly know all these decisions are of competence of the Shareholder Meeting.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen. Roberto Ranieri from Banca IMI. I have just a couple of questions relating to the Refining business mostly, and relating to the E&amp;P business, please. On Refining business I'm just wondering if you can elaborate about the &#x2013; what your out performance would be with reference to the benchmark you gave us which is the FOB Mediterranean area on brand refining margin average European.</p>
          <p>My second question is also on the refining business, and if I remember when the Sannazzaro plant, EST plant is started up in 2009 and so can you give us an idea on what the additional refining margin would be or the additional outperformance would be with reference to the average European &#x2013; your benchmark basically?</p>
          <p>My last question is about the E&amp;P cost and specifically the cost inflation which is &#x2013; I think in my opinion pretty important. If I remember when the cost inflation you gave us, and the indication on cost inflation you gave us is about &#x20AC;2.8 billion over the period, which is not very high if I remember when we compare with the last cost inflation. So, my question is if you can give us your flavor about the trend of the cost inflation and this cost inflation and if there are any risks outside on a &#x2013; upward trend or a downward trend about the cost inflation. And if in the industry, the oil industry there is a possibility to share this cost inflation between the oil majors and the contractors in terms of negotiation issues and something? Thank you very much.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But let me say that taking in account of the 2007 scenario I should say that the &#x2013; our division breakeven margin, to be clear, so the refining margin necessarily took over all operating costs including depreciation corresponds to a level of the reference benchmark TRC Brent of 2 to $3 per barrel. Now we are on track to complete our investment plan with two new hydrocrackers, one in Sannazzaro and in Taranto. The implementation of these investments, scheduled in our plan, will allow us to reduce the breakeven margin by around $1 per barrel still at the 2007 price scenario.</p>

          <p>Additional margins -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes but that &#x2013; on Sannazzaro we have two investments planned, an hydrocracker that is nearly completed. We are above 80% of progress, it will be commissioned at the end of the year and that will start up in the first quarter of next year and we are starting this year with the EST new plant that is an industrial plant where our technology is applied, new technology, deep conversion technology is applied. The margin that I gave you before is for all our system in Sannazzaro start to evaluate the improvement with the new two investments. But we are very confident in our EST technology because as you probably already know, it's a technology that allow us to avoid all the undesired byproduct such as solid coke and fuel oil. It will permit us to have the first refiner without a few alloy production with only 1- to 2% production outage. So, we are very confident in our definite improvement.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is the cost inflation. If you remember the message we were giving a year ago, we were saying that the cost inflation was about 15%. This year what we project is about 10%, which means that we start seeing a tendency to &#x2013; this cost inflation to get to a, sort of, saturation. It's not yet totally saturated, but is getting &#x2013; it is in a way slowing down. But still it's quite a substantial impact on the cost for doing exploration and the development. In terms of sharing with a contractor, I'm afraid that for the time being it's still a sellers market. There are very few contractor who have the capability of providing the services of the quality, which we are seeking for our major, for our substantial investment, also in terms of the frequencies and technology. So, I would say that for the time being it is not likely that we'll be in a position to share it with contractors.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, good afternoon. Three quick questions. Can I just clarify on your reserve replacement target of 100%? I mean how much of that comes from the effect of a lower oil price by 2011 and what the big reserve bookings you expect to make will be over the coming years? Secondly, can I just ask what the euro/dollar rate is that underpins your CapEx assumption? And finally, just a question for Mr. Scaroni, on the point of dividend, when you talk about a $40 breakeven, given that you are running a $55 long-term oil price, why don't you raise the dividend to that point?</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If you are using a long-term oil price at $55, why don't you just raise the dividend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So I might be giving the answer, the 100% replacement, of course, is on the basis of the scenario on which we have used for the &#x2013; for flattening, so which means that will be 64, 2009; 57, 2010; 56, 2011; and 55, 2012. So, basically the replacement is based on the $55 per barrel of the last year. That is the basis for the 100% -- more than 100% replacement.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correctly, you were asking for the euro dollar exchange rate assumption. In 2011, we are projecting a stronger $1.22 while as regard to the mention which Paolo made to the dividend and the oil price scenario and the sustainability, he said that the dividend policy is sustainable under our scenario and this scenario is 64 for the 2008, 57, 56, and 55; and in 2011, even with the price which I just mentioned, we would be cash neutral at lower than the oil price scenario method, at the $40 per barrel which Paolo mentioned.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess that was really my question. And if it's cash neutral at $40 and you are using 55, why not just make it cash neutral at 55?</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I understand your question now. But you see we have other constraints including the fact that we have a 38 debt-to-equity and we fixed a ceiling of 40, including the fact that we want to be sustainable in any potential scenario, and therefore, we want to be on the safe side even on that.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just start with &#x2013; can I just clarify the separate question on reserve replacement, how much of the replacement rate comes from writing back the oil price down to $55?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would say, Alastair, they're quite a substantial. If I may give you just three numbers to set the scene, this year in 2007, we had to reduce 634 million barrels.  We have promoted reserves -- V1 results for 453, out of which are -- go into $96 a barrel.  We had a price effect of 350. So that gives an idea of how substantial.  If we had only to make an assessment at the long term scenario of $50 a barrel, we would have basically -- have a replacement of just over 100% already.  So I would say in general terms, but you heard me already making this comment, the metrics which the industry has been utilizing over the years are all based on a substantial stability in the oil scenario.  If the world changes and it gets to 96, I think we have to find a different metric. That's why, we like always showing -- we and also the other peers of ours by showing the concept of the resources. So the overall volume which over time and through the investment and hard work will become proven results.</p>

          <p>Hi there. You've been talking about the experimental program of Kashagan reaching a production of 370,000 barrels a day. But as the contract renegotiation moves to start day, and so what's the start date now that you think production will start? And when will it reach plateau? And you say you're still the operator of the experimental program. But were Eni actually reappointed as it where by the new full company, joint operating company, which I think is what totals the results this week? And secondly, can you give us some color on any funding problems basically happening in Nigeria and whether this will affect your production? And you are in talks with the authorities in Nigeria on the funding situation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well let me answer to Kashagan, so say save Stefano's voice. No, on Kashagan, 370,000 barrels is the production capacity.  It's not the product, the actual product.  This production capacity has not been negotiated with anybody, the result of our estimate of what we can do.  In terms of the reappointment, the fact that Eni will continue to lead the experimental program has been already agreed with our partners.  So there will be no reappointment in the sense that this has been already agreed.  Now on Nigeria...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Nigeria, yes indeed, going forward, since we mentioned that we are just coming from Nigeria, one of the major issues will be related to funding.  So in order to be in a position to develop all the projects, a new approach will need to be found on our funding.  And this is something which I think you mentioned it yourself is already a discussion which is already ongoing, and which we hope will come soon to a successful conclusion so that we can all move on with our investments.</p>

And the commitment is to come out with a commitment by the end of March.  So that will be officially the date.  You heard it from the -- I officially in the commentary that 2011 is the target date.  And to get to the full capacity of the experimental program, I think we said all along that about a year is the time to get to the capacity, 370,000 barrel per day capacity.</p>

          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen.  Couple of questions actually, firstly, just on Russia, could you give us an idea of sort of what is that -- kind of we should be looking for in terms of stepping stone for &#x2013; in terms of development of those assets? When do you expect the FID?  My second question is just on &#x2013; you had pretty high depletion rates in the 2007. And I was wondering whether you could give any guidance going forward, what you are assuming there. And lastly, just on depreciation whether you could give us guidance for 2008 on a depreciation number.  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  So, on the first two question it will be Stefano -- for well understand -- First question is around the development of Russia, the second is around depletion in 2007.  And then, I think Marco would answer about depreciation in 2008, if we well understood the questions.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, FID Russia, I think with today's presentation, we wanted to give a flavor of the activities going on there. And basically we have shut off all the wells which due to the bankruptcy process, they were not properly shut down.  So we have been putting the oil field under safety.  Then we have started the &#x2013; and we are doing right now the 3D seismic. And as well as we are checking the status of the plant which was being built in, again, at the time of bankruptcy.  So activities are already going on.  Making a judgment on the exact date of the FID, it is something which I think it will be much better if we do it in an ordinary fashion, once we have a better control of the situation.  Depletion, the depletion is 8 to 9%, that is the actual. And we project that to continue to be in the years to come basically.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen.  I would like to ask -- just to give some color on the breakdown and timing of the CapEx over the next three or four years. And also if you be kind enough just to reconfirm the FX euro-dollar assumption rates that you use in terms of setting that budget?  Hello!</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am not sure I've understood your first question.  In terms of the exchange rate between euro and dollar, we have been using 1.42 for 2008, 1.33 for 2009, 1.27 for 2010 and 1.22 for 2011.  Your first question was around CapEx in general.  What was exactly your question because we gave the CapEx plan for the period which are &#x2013; let me go into it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Apologies, Mr. Scaroni.  The question on the CapEx is merely on the season i.e., should we anticipate that the CapEx should be more or less evenly distributed within the period?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I understood. I understood your question.  Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In fact, we'll have a slightly higher CapEx in the first two years and declining in the last two, but not just because we are not in a position to project them, but also because we expect to have concluded that the power initiatives. And also we are not seeing any additional investment coming from the engineering and construction, meaning the hard part of this item business.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi good afternoon.  I have just two questions.  You mentioned in your presentation that Brazil is an area of exploration interest for you -- initiative I think you used the word. And problem your holdings in Galp, I think you have acreage in the Santos deepwater area which has attracted lot of interest recently.  Can you tell us when you plan to drill up that particular block, it's maybe next year or so?  And then secondly on refining and marketing obviously negatively hit in Q4 by the light heavy spread closing. That gap has remained low throughout Q1. So, should we take it to that through Q1 your refining business will also be performing relatively poorly or was it more of a transitions, the way narrower spread that was --  that was mainly <mark type="inaudible" /> (121.40) in the absolute level of the spread itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, but the line is very bad.  Could you please repeat both questions?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry but the line is very, very bad.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  On exploration you, I believe have a deepwater block in the Santos basin near to other high profile discoveries.  So my first question is when do you plan to drill that block?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>You are not talking about 2P, you are talking about -- okay this is the first question.  The second one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Refining and marketing has a poor results in Q4, Q2 a low to light heavy spread?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This spread has remained low in Q1. So can't we expect a poor results in Q1 for refining as well or is there some other dynamics going on there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Good.  I think I understood both questions.  Now Stefano will tell you something about exploration in Brazil and then..</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, you are right. We have a block 100% in the Santos basin which we are awaiting to drill. And for the time being we have no indication when the first well will be spudded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Angelo.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="18" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.  In our point of view, let's say the Brent, Urals for price differential was about $4.5 per barrel, down by 21% in comparison to 2006.  The appreciation was even stronger for sale of crudes for Middle East.  For 2008 and following year, so we expect a light to heavy oil price differential to slightly increase in comparison to this year -- to last year average, with the Brent Urals price differential in the range of $5 per barrel.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I guess just a follow-up on Brazil.  You say you have no indication when you will spud, do you have a rig line-up? Are you hoping to drill this thing over the next 12 months or is it just not an urgent issue here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Unfortunately, the line is so bad, say again.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Brazil you say you have no indication of when you will be spudding the well. Does that mean you have a rig line-up or at the moment you don't even have a rig line-up for this prospect?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, number of rigs, I think as we said we cover all our requirements. But the point is that we have still some contractual arrangements which we need to finalize. So we need to have them sorted out and then we can probably insert it in our program. But we have rigs for West Africa. We have rigs for Latin America. We have rigs lined up also for Gulf of Mexico. So it will be a matter of properly organizing them.</p>
