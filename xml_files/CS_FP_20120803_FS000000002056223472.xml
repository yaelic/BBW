          <p>Good morning, everybody. I'm very happy to welcome you for AXA's Presentation of the Half Year 2012 Earnings. Today would be presenting Henri de Castries, the Chairman and CEO of AXA; Denis Duverne, Deputy CEO; and G&#xE9;rald Harlin, Group CFO. The presentation will then be followed by Q&amp;A. You'll have the possibility to ask question in the room, and then we'll take question over the phone and through Internet.</p>
          <p>Henri, I can now hand over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mattieu. So, we are here to share with you the half-year results which we see as being solid in a difficult environment. The &#x2013; if you look at these results, I just would like to have the right chart, and I don't have it. I'd like to have the previous one. No, the previous one. Okay.</p>
          <p>The underlying earnings, as you will see, are stable at &#x20AC;2.3 billion. Adjusted earnings are stable. The net income, if you take out the exceptionals of last year, are stable &#x2013; is stable, too. Solvency ratios are comfortable, and I will come back to that. And you will see that from an operating standpoint, things are moving in the right direction in all the three business lines: Property &amp; Casualty, Health &amp; Protection; and Savings and Asset Management.</p>
          <p>What's the environment? I'm not going to elaborate for long on the Eurozone crisis, but it's clearly creating clouds over the industry. The financial markets have been difficult. And if you compare them to the first half of last year, it's clear that equity markets have decreased, interest rates are much lower in the strongest economies, spreads are much wider in the weaker economies. The economic outlook is not very favorable for the GDP evolution in the Eurozone, and we remain with a significant amount of regulatory uncertainties surrounding the financial services. One of them being, of course, for insurers, the evolution of Solvency II even if some steps in the good direction have been made there.</p>
          <p>So, where do we stand as AXA for this half year? As I said, underlying earnings are, on a comparable basis, stable. On a published basis, they are up a little less than &#x20AC;100 million. Adjusted earnings are stable, too. And the net income, if you take out the proceeds of the disposal of Taikang and of our Australian activities last year, are stable, too; stability in a difficult environment. The majority of the earning is coming from the segments which are less sensitive to financial markets where we are seeing a significant and positive evolution.</p>
          <p>Property &amp; Casualty is up and represents 44% of the underlying earnings. You will see the progress made on the combined ratio. Protection &amp; Health is up 9%, which we see as being a good performance and represents a little less than a third of the business. So, if you take these two segments, you have three quarters of the business. On three quarters of the business, underlying earnings are up, and revenues also progressed in a very decent way. The portion of the business which is affected by the financial markets is savings and asset management, where underlying earnings are down 14%. This is a reflection of what the environment has been.</p>
          <p>If you look at our solvency margins, our solvency levels, and I think this is something important in these volatile times. Solvency I, which I'm not going to insist very much on, is reaching historical high at above 200% &#x2013; 207%. It's more important to focus for a few seconds on Solvency II. And we are presenting here for the first time the solvency ratio with the benefit of the equivalence.</p>
          <p>Why do we do that? Well, because it's one of the points where the Solvency II negotiation has progressed well because Mr. Bernier has expressed himself loud and clear more than once, saying that yes, equivalence was something which would happen and that the equivalence with the U.S. is something which the industry could take into account. It's important because this is one of the key requests of the industry, and it's the one where we have clarity. We do not have at this stage clarity on countercyclical premiums, matching premiums. But on equivalence, we have clarity. So, we think we can take it into account in the computation of our Solvency II ratio.</p>
          <p>And what this shows is that the ratio has declined since the end of last year due to the decline &#x2013; principally the decline in the market, the payment of the dividend partly offset by the returns during the first half. But this leaves us in a situation which we see as comfortable because we are at 174%, including the benefit of the equivalence. Denis will come back to that. It's 136% without this benefit. But we think that the right regulatory way to look at the capital situation is to take into account the equivalence. And you see that we are there at very comfortable levels.</p>
          <p>The gearing ratio is very slightly up. This is not due to the fact that our debt would have increased. It has, in fact, slightly decreased. It's just because, as you know, we have made some accounting changes on the DAC policies at the end of last year. The accounting retreatment is leading to a mechanical increase by 1 point, not very far away from the long-term goal of 20%, 25%.</p>
          <p>What do I want to say on the alignment of these earnings &#x2013; of this set of results with the long-term goals of Ambition AXA? I think despite an environment which is not favorable, because the performance is impacted by market conditions, we are well-aligned with our long-term goals. And we are continuing to implement the operational initiatives and to deliver on them, selectivity in the major markets, acceleration in the emerging ones, and in the business lines where we see we can capture growth and margins, and efficiency where the savings efforts, which should represent at the end of 2015, &#x20AC;1.5 billion, are very well on track.</p>
          <p>Underlying earnings are at &#x20AC;0.92 for the semester. They were at &#x20AC;0.90 last year for the first half. The progression of the two years is 4%. It's below the long-term target of Ambition AXA, but as you will remember, when we set out the goals for Ambition AXA, we were assuming &#x2013; assumptions &#x2013; market assumptions which were a positive evolution of the equity market and gradually increasing interest rates. It's not what we have seen. If you take into account the sensitivities, we are in line with what the sensitivities were.</p>
          <p>Return on equity, the return on equity is slightly progressing when compared with last year at 13.8%, progressing on the way to the 15% we think we can reach at the end of 2015. The operating cash flows are in line with the plan. And the gearing, I've already mentioned it, is &#x2013; also, if you take the two-year perspective, is evolving towards what the long-term goals are.</p>
          <p>If you start to look into slightly more detail at the operations, I think on the Life &amp; Savings side, the important point for you is to understand if our efforts of selectivity are bearing fruit. We have said at the very beginning that we wanted to increase the exposure to have some protection because these are businesses where the demand is there where margins are satisfactory and that we wanted to put less emphasis on the General Accounts and Savings business. If you look at the transformation over the last two years, you will see that this semester reflects the fact that this is well on track. The proportion of the protection business has moved from 31% to 41%. The compounded APE growth since the beginning of the plan in Health and Protection is 16% whereas on the general account where we want to put less emphasis is the reverse. The share of general account in the mix has declined from 26% to 17% declining by approximately 17% on a compounded base.</p>
          <p>Unit-Linked remains more or less stable at around 30% which we think is a decent performance given what the state of the market is. We think these are good products for the clients delivering reasonable margins for us. We want to keep them at a high level in the mix. And I think we are achieving it. So, as you see the transformation efforts on the Life business are bearing fruits. The new business revenue margins, they've been progressing. For the first half, they are pretty stable, slightly increasing if you compare it to last year. And we think we can continue to improve them further between now and 2015.</p>
          <p>If you look at the second significant business, Property &amp; Casualty, Property &amp; Casualty is well-aligned, well on track, satisfactory in nearly all fronts because we combine what we see as being a good revenue growth approximately 4% with very good improvement in the profitability. The combined ratio for the current year is improving versus last year. The combined ratio whole year is improving versus last year and stands now at 96.4%, not very far away from the 2015 goal. So, we are pleased with what we see on the P&amp;C side.</p>
          <p>Last but not least, Asset Management which has been an area of concern during the financial turmoil for different reasons at AXA Rosenberg. Seeing that gradually improving, investment performance first which is important for the clients, important for the insurance portfolio is good. The flows are still negative but are starting to improve.</p>
          <p>The net flows were negative &#x20AC;23 billion for the first half of last year. It's only &#x20AC;8 billion for the first half of this year. And so, we think that we are gradually seeing a return to a more normalized situation, AB in particular is positive again on the retail side. And you can see that at AXA IM, in some of their core specialties, they are positive. So, we are seeing there a gradual improvement in a picture where underlying earnings are pretty stable and resilient.</p>
          <p>Cost savings plan, I've mentioned it. We have achieved in the first half exactly what we intended to achieve. So, we have now saved &#x20AC;500 million out of the &#x20AC;0.5 billion we intended to save between 2010 and 2015, which means we still have &#x20AC;1 billion to save. So, we will achieve that. We have the goal of maintaining in Property &amp; Casualty and the Life &amp; Savings, the administrative &#x2013; the admin costs well under control. We have detailed plans and we want to reduce the acquisition expenses in the Property &amp; Casualty business by 1.5 points. We are comfortable that we can reach that because the plans are now well identified.</p>
          <p>So, this was just a brief introduction. If there is one thing to have in mind, we think this is a solid set of results with a solid balance sheet in an environment which remain volatile and troubled, but it's not going to distract us from the long-term orientation.</p>
          <p>I'm now going to leave the floor to Denis, who's going to go into more detail on the various business segments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Henri. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. A big thank you to those of you who are across the channel in the middle of the Olympics to attend this presentation in Paris today. I will go straight into the group earnings and I will skip slide 17 to go directly to slide 18 where you have a waterfall showing the evolution of the earnings between the first half of 2011 and the first half of 2012.</p>
          <p>You see that we had slightly better Life &amp; Savings earnings. The decrease in the U.S. being more than compensated by an improvement in Japan, we didn't have a repeat of the &#x2013; thank God, the repeat of the tsunami and earthquake in Japan. P&amp;C was up also, thanks to an improved combined ratio. We had a negative on International Insurance just because we had less positive developments on our runoff portfolios. Asset Management was pretty flat. Holdings were negative because we've converted some of our debts from Swiss franc and Yen into Euros, which increased the interest charge, and we had a positive impact of &#x20AC;73 million of the foreign exchange because of an appreciation of most currencies against the euro.</p>
          <p>Moving to adjusted earnings and net income. Adjusted earnings were pretty flat in the first half. They were mainly impacted by lower realized capital gains on equities and real estate and partly offset by lower impairments mainly due to the non-repeats of the first tranche of our Greek impairment on government bonds in the first half of last year.</p>
          <p>Net income, as Henri mentioned earlier, was stable if you exclude the exceptional gains that we made last year on the disposal of our 15% stake in Taikang Life in China, and the disposal of our Australian and New Zealand operations as part of our buyout of our Asian minorities.</p>
          <p>Moving to efficiency. I don't have new figures to add there, but just to comment, you will recall that our efficiency program is relying on maintaining our P&amp;C and Life &amp; Savings admin cost offsetting the impact of inflation and reducing our P&amp;C acquisition expense ratio by 1.5 points. Of the &#x20AC;160 million that we save in the first half, roughly &#x20AC;100 million came from administrative expenses savings and &#x20AC;60 million came from reduction of P&amp;C acquisition cost.</p>
          <p>Moving to the Life &amp; Savings. Our new business sales and margins by market. You see that in mature markets, we had a growth of APE of 1% with a stable margin of 21%, and we saw a slight decline of our new business sales in high-growth markets, which is not what we would like in the long term. There is, I believe, a one-off effect which relates to Central and Eastern Europe, where we had a decline of 36%. This decline was a function of the fact that most of our presence in Central and Eastern Europe was focused on the pension market.</p>
          <p>There was a change of regulation in Poland, which followed the year before the nationalization of pensions in Hungary. In Poland, the compulsory contributions have been sharply reduced and are now very, very small. We have to convert our sales force to selling more Life business, and it's not a transformation that happens in one go. We are, however, optimistic about the development in that region, but we should see that in the following quarters.</p>
          <p>In Asia, we saw our sales growing by 9%. This is a combination of flat sales in Hong Kong and the growth of 18% in the rest of the region, Southeast Asia, India and China. The margins were pretty good at 42% in high-growth markets. Overall, flat APE on a constant forex basis and slightly higher new business margins, I will comment on that later, 24.2% &#x2013; 24.4% in a declining interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>When you look at the mix of business, we are, as Henri mentioned, fully in line with our commitment to be more selective. We are growing Protection &amp; Health this year at the pace of 5%, with strong sales in Asia, Germany and Japan. In Germany because of the expected change in regulation on the health side and also in Japan because of new products that we've developed both on Protection &amp; Health, and as well in France with their strong development of long-term care program. The government is not yet making any change to regulation there, so all the communication around long-term care is leading people to take care of their long-term care protection by themselves.</p>
          <p>General account savings. Sales were down 6%. New business margin remains negative, low profitability in France and Italy and lower volumes in France and Italy, slightly bigger volumes in Belgium. But all-in-all, this is clearly not the area that we're emphasizing. We are trying to mix those savings with Unit-Linked on the new business side.</p>
          <p>Unit-Linked, our performance was good on margins at 22%, strong sales performance in the U.S. and Italy, more than offset by CEE which I've already mentioned, and the UK, where the evolution of regulation on bancassurance is leading to a strong decline of the sales in that channel.</p>
          <p>Finally, mutual funds, good performance, with a strong performance in the UK, thanks to our Elevate platform partly offset by lower sales in the U.S.</p>
          <p>When you look at the evolution of our new business margin, you see that we have managed to more than fully offset the impacts of declining interest rates, which affects our GMxB margin by an improved business mix with a higher Protection &amp; Health, higher contribution from high growth markets and lower expenses. So, we are well on our way and in line with our commitment to invest more money into Protection &amp; Health and Unit-Linked and less capital on general accounts and savings.</p>
          <p>Moving to the evolution of earnings on the Life &amp; Savings side, you see that we had a negative evolution of our earnings on the U.S. GMxB business Variable Annuities, has slightly negative investment margin &#x2013; evolution of the investment margin from 76 to 72 basis points. And this was more than offset by better fees and revenues, in fact, slightly lower Unit-Linked fees, more than offset by higher margin on revenues, but a stable technical margin, better expenses, positive impacts of forex and a positive impact of taxes.</p>
          <p>I mentioned already the fact that we had a negative evolution in the U.S. GMxB earnings. I will focus on the last column where you see that we had hedge margin negative &#x20AC;90 million. We expect a slightly negative hedge margin. You see that basis risk increased a little bit compared to last year, which was pretty contained. Volatility was a bit higher but we had hedge volatility in the first half, slightly negative impact of interest rates. You see that on the lapse experience side, where we had a significant reserve in the second half of 2011, our experience is stable which is good. So, we told you we would bring our reserves in line with our current experience. This current experience remains the same, so no need to strengthen the reserves on lapse experience, but we have to strengthen our reserves on partial withdrawals. It's a negative of &#x20AC;137 million.</p>
          <p>What we are doing here is we are taking into account the fact that because of lower interest rates, our customers have reduced their partial withdrawals to take the hit which reflects a view that this experience will continue the same in the future. And therefore, we're taking the full hit of that change in experience on partial withdrawals. This is partly offset by positive reserve adjustments which relate mainly to the impact of premium suspension and some other refinements.</p>
          <p>What is premium suspension? We have announced at the end of last year and implemented in March, the elimination of the possibility for our customers to put in more money into old contracts with high levels of guarantees. So, this is leading to a better level of &#x2013; I mean, an improvement in the economic situation which leads to lower results.</p>
          <p>Moving to the detailed performance on the different sub-segments within Life. We saw Protection &amp; Health pre-tax earnings grow by 9%. This is largely a reflection of the improvement of the situation in Japan, where we had a non-repeat of the earthquake of last year.</p>
          <p>General Account Savings performance was plus 3%. We have lower expenses. It's partly offset by lower investment margin but the net is positive. Unit-Linked excluding variable annuities plus 28%. It's a combination of higher upfront charges in AXA MPS where we saw big sales of Unit-Linked in the first half, and a boni on protection riders in France and also lower expenses. Finally, U.S. variable annuities where we moved from profits to a small loss of &#x20AC;10 million.</p>
          <p>I will now cover Property &amp; Casualty where we are quite pleased to see growth in revenues of 3.7% which affects both personal lines, plus 3% with an average price increase of 3% and an increase in volumes more than 600,000 new exposures offsets by lower average premiums. Commercial lines is a nice development as well, with a revenue growth of 5% which is a combination, an average price increase of 2.7% and a more favorable business mix. We have positive impact of higher exposures there on the &#x2013; I mean, on a per-contract basis which is a positive development.</p>
          <p>When you look at the pricing picture around our footprint, you'll see that we continue to have a positive price evolution in all territories with the exception of Switzerland where, I remind you, that our combined ratio is at 89%. This evolution &#x2013; positive evolution of prices can be seen both on personal lines and commercial lines. Of note, the strong increase of prices in Belgium on Personal lines and in the UK on Personal lines, as well as in Commercial lines in the UK and France.</p>
          <p>Moving to the evolution of the revenues and margins by market. Mature markets saw a growth of the revenues of 2.4% and a positive evolution of the current-year combined ratio, 0.8 points. High-growth markets quite strong growth, accelerating at 17.4%. This is true both in Asia, in the Middle East and in Mexico with a slight decrease of the current-year combined ratio.</p>
          <p>Direct &#x2013; it's a two different &#x2013; combination of two stories. Sharp decline of the UK Direct, down 29% on the revenue side. The growth &#x2013; the very fast growth that we had experienced in the previous years being tamed by strong price increases that we implemented at the beginning of this year, and a strong growth of 10% in the rest of our Direct footprints, both in Europe and in Asia, and a slow &#x2013; I mean, a small decrease of the current-year combined ratio at 100.3%.</p>
          <p>All in all, 3.7% and good decline of the current-year combined ratio. Looking at it in more details, you see that this is a 4% earnings increase. You see also that we had slightly less favorable weather experience which mainly stressed itself in the cost of natural catastrophes of 0.5 points against 0.1. This does not include also a deterioration of the freeze impact which was worse by 0.9 points compared to last year, which in total means that we have a deterioration of 1.3 points coming from weather and a total cost of weather of 1.7 points, which is quite substantial.</p>
          <p>Prior-year reserve developments were slightly more favorable this year than last year, 2.1% against 2%, leading in total to an all-year combined ratio of 96.4%, where it goes to our medium-term target of 96%. Investment income was stable with an asset yield that was stable at 4% in P&amp;C.</p>
          <p>In Asset Management, average AUM were slight &#x2013; were stable at AXA Investment Managers with a negative impact of Investment Solutions, essentially employee shareholding plans which were not profitable and where we had an outflow of &#x20AC;4 billion. This was partly offset by fixed income, plus &#x20AC;1 billion and equity, plus &#x20AC;1 billion. And on the equity side, it's a combination of quite positive flows at AXA Framlington and AXA Private Equity, offset by still a negative flow at AXA Rosenberg.</p>
          <p>AllianceBernstein, average AUM decline by 9%. Again, a mix of a continuation of significant outflows of &#x20AC;17 billion in equities, almost offset by a positive &#x20AC;8 billion in fixed income and &#x20AC;3 billion in alternatives. The net outflows at AllianceBernstein at minus &#x20AC;5 billion, much, much better than what they were last year, and we seem to see a brighter horizon on the AllianceBernstein front.</p>
          <p>All in all for Asset Management, earnings were slightly up but minus 4% after taking into account the forex impact. Revenues were down 10%, but expenses managed to match the revenue decline at minus 11%, allowing a good reasonable expense on the earnings side.</p>
          <p>I will now hand over the floor to G&#xE9;rald Harlin, who will talk to you about the balance sheet. Thank you very much for your attention.</p>

      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Let's start this with the shareholders' equity and we have &#x2013; as mentioned before by Henri, we have a restatement of minus of &#x20AC;2.1 billion corresponding &#x2013; that is in line &#x2013; it's absolutely in line with what we told you in February and this corresponds to a change in deferred acquisition cost, accounting methodology which is in line with U.S. GAAP and which is being imposed on January 1, 2012. So, we have restated retrospectively and that correspond to a minus &#x20AC;2.1 billion negative adjustment.</p>
          <p>Starting from 2011 shareholders' equity, after restatements, we are &#x20AC;46.5 billion, and we have an increase of &#x20AC;2.2 billion. You can see on the right hand side the main elements, the main driver of this evolution starting first with the net income for the period, plus &#x20AC;2.6 billion; the increase in net unrealized capital gains coming mostly from the decrease of spreads and decrease of interest rates, plus &#x20AC;1.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Then we have the FX movements net of hedging instruments because we have a lower euro and we are benefiting from this situation from our international presence, plus &#x20AC;0.6 billion. Then we have dividends, minus &#x20AC;1.6 billion. And the change in pension benefit, which is negative. Why? Because all our liabilities are discounted with AA bond yield.</p>
          <p>So, let's move to Solvency I. On Solvency I, we have an increase. We are 207% which is a record level, mostly due to the very low interest rate environment. And you can see that the sensitivities are mostly geared to the interest rates. So, the interest rate explain most of the move going forward.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the economic solvency. As explained by Henri, it's an economic solvency which is presented here with equivalence for the U.S. business. That means that for the U.S., the requirement is based on a 300% risk-based capital. And we have a decline from 183% to 174%.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the economic solvency without equivalence, which is on the top right, where we have a decline from 148% to 136%, which is mostly explained by the low interest rate environment. And then it's interesting to go through the sensitivities. And here, I would like to mention that, first, these sensitivities are made without equivalence. And I have two remarks.</p>
          <p>First of all, let's have a look at the interest rate, minus 100 basis points. We would end up with an economic solvency without equivalence at 119%. 119% would correspond to a situation that would be close to the Swiss interest rate environment. That means that interest rates would be close to 50, 60 basis points. So, we can consider this is the floor. And with equivalence, we would be at the level that we consider would be very comfortable and equivalence will bring us comfortable margin.</p>
          <p>The second remark relates to the corporate spreads. You can see that the last sensitivity, corporate spread, plus 75 basis points. This is made with a liquidity premium. That explains why you don't have any sensitivity. That means that the negative impact on the asset side on the corporate spread widening by 75 basis points would be offset by the liquidity premium.</p>
          <p>Let's move now to the debt gearing. Debt gearing is at 27%. Again, it would have been 26%. We start the DAC methodology restatement because, again, there is a decrease in the denominator since we decreased the denominator by &#x20AC;2.1 billion. In terms of interest spread coverage, we are better off. We increased our interest coverage from 9.1 to 9.7.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the invested assets. As you can see, the asset allocation is partly unchanged. That means that, nevertheless, you can see that we increased the corporate bonds and that's the main element. We increased from &#x20AC;148 billion to &#x20AC;155 billion. And as you will see later on most of our investments have been during the first half in corporate bonds.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the unrealized gains. And you can see that the balance sheet net unrealized capital gains went up from &#x20AC;5.2 billion to &#x20AC;7 billion. The most important drivers are, first, the unrealized gains in light blue in government bonds, where we went up from &#x20AC;3.1 billion to &#x20AC;4.2 billion, and you have, like we did at the end of December, you have the breakdown by sovereign bond. And you can see first that excluding Eurozone peripheral countries, we have &#x2013; all countries are positive, and they are at higher levels than at the end of last year.</p>
          <p>As far as Eurozone peripheral countries are concerned, we're at minus &#x20AC;0.6 billion. We were at minus &#x20AC;0.7 billion, and we will see later on that we have a slightly decreased exposure which explains that we are better off today.</p>
          <p>On the other categories of assets, you have corporate bonds and equities, and two of them are &#x2013; both have improved, specifically the corporate bonds due to the declining interest rates and in spreads as well.</p>
          <p>So, let's make an update on the peripheral countries. As you can see and you can notice that the gross book value between the end of 2011 and June 30, 2012, we have a drop of partly &#x20AC;4 billion. That means that we decrease our gross exposure partly from 13% mostly through disposals. You can see also that at &#x20AC;21.3 billion, the gross market value of our peripheral countries exposure correspond to 4.5% of our assets under management.</p>
          <p>Let's move to ALM, to Asset &amp; Liability Management, and first &#x2013; start first with Life. As expected, the asset yield is slightly down from 3.9% to 3.8%. But as you can see on the right-hand side of the graph on the top, we are benefiting from a very long duration of our assets, 7.4 years. And we have been managing as in the past this &#x2013; the duration gap extremely cautiously because the gap is less than one year today. So, 7.4 years, 5 years in P&amp;C but as far as Life is concerned, this explains why we have a small decrease from 3.9% to 3.8%. As far as the net investment margin is concerned, we moved from 76 to 72 basis points. The guidance that we gave at the earnings release at the end of 2011 was between 70 and 80. We are in line with this guidance. As far as P&amp;C is concerned, the P&amp;C asset yield is flat at 4%. We do see opportunity of this very low interest rates in order to reinforce the protection in case of the rising interest rates in countries where we have a market-sensitive liabilities like in France, for example, in case that there would be a rise of interest rates.</p>
          <p>So, let's focus now on the fixed income investment policy. First, the amount of reinvestment in the first half has been &#x20AC;25 billion and the reinvestment has been down at 2.9% on average. You can see at the bottom of the right part of the slide that the 2.9% are broken down between the different currencies and that as far as euro is concerned, we reinvested at 3.2%. We didn't invest in the Eurozone peripheral countries. As you can see on the top of the right part, we invested mostly, as I said before, in corporate bonds, 48% of our investment whilst government bonds is only 22%. It was low in the past. So, we have been extremely selective on this investment. Most of the corporate bonds have been invested in non-financial bonds.</p>
          <p>Let's move another point to two other points is the yield dilution. We can expect for those life and non-life to have a dilution of 2012 compared to 2011 partly of 20 basis points. And we confirm that we are still expecting a margin between 70 and 80 basis points for life, net investment margin for the full year of 2012.</p>
          <p>Let's move to the investment spread and this confirms on the left-hand side, you have the inforce business, new business on the right-hand side. First, starting with the inforce, 3.8% compared with 2.2%. That means 160 basis points buffer which is quite &#x2013; which gives us flexibility, flexibility now crediting rates and a way to face, in case we would stay in the same environment &#x2013; interest rate environment to face any further decrease of crediting rates.</p>
          <p>We have a significant buffer, as I said. And on the right-hand side, on new business, we have a much lower guaranteed interest rate at 0.7%, corresponding to what we mainly repeated which is that we stopped in many countries pricing new business with guaranteed rates, so we are giving guarantees for limited period of time.</p>
          <p>And in Continental Europe, as you know, we are selling these spread products in combination with Unit-Linked. That's the case in France, for example, in order to increase Unit-Linked share.</p>
          <p>Now, the details between the main countries. So, first we could say that for both inforce and new business, we have comfortable buffers. You can see that &#x2013; I would make &#x2013; like to make two remarks. First, starting with Switzerland, you might be surprised by the 30 basis points spread on inforce, which seems to be low, but I remind you that most of our profit in Group Life in Switzerland is derived from the technical margin.</p>
          <p>Second, as far as Belgium is concerned, we have a spread of 70 basis points only between the asset and the guarantee liabilities, but this doesn't take into account the fact that we anticipated these new investments at the end of last year and that we invested in all those that at that time at very attractive spreads. So, that means that, in fact, the earn rate on the asset is more towards 4% and 3.5%.</p>
          <p>And now, I hand over to Henri.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Thank you, G&#xE9;rald. I think after this detailed presentation, there is not much to add as a conclusion. I think what you should take out is what I said at the beginning. This is a solid set of earnings, showing that we are progressing towards the goals of Ambition AXA. These goals being well suited to the current environment. We will continue &#x2013; we are even a bit confident that we will deliver on the long-term objectives, but we also know that the short-term environment may remain pretty volatile and uncertain, but I really think that the resilience of the earnings over the last three to four years is showing the solidity and the growing solidity of the model we have adopted.</p>
          <p>Having said that, I suggest we move to the questions. We are going to take questions in the room first. Mics are available.

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the taxation side, first, the tax on the financial transaction should be extremely limited, something like &#x20AC;10 million. For the rest, we don't know yet so we will wait for the announcement in September. Your question about the assumption on the economic capital, let's be clear on that side. We took really a risky rate yield curve that means that we are using a total discount of the liabilities, 1.7 for the swap rates. That means, on the top of these, we have like in Q4 or in &#x2013; we have the liquidity premium, and this liquidity premium decreased so we are slightly above 80 basis points &#x2013; 88 on top of my head.</p>
          <p>So, that means that contrary to what of some others did, we are really calculating this in a risky rate environment. In other words, we don't take the average assets and we don't discount at the average or blended rate corresponding to our assets. So, that's important because that can explain a lot of the differences that might exist because of solvency that are posted by some of our peers and this solvency.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>UK Life. On the UK Life business, we knew when we sold the bulk of this UK Life business to Resolution in 2010 that the remaining business which is essentially a Wealth Management business was not at scale, and we are building both the Elevate platform and the Architas Multi-Manager platform to scale. And we expect to be profitable in 2014 and making a good return in 2015. So, we are fully in line with that plan. The growth of the assets on the Elevate platform and on Architas is progressing quite nicely. The only change in the environment that we are not fully protected is what's happening on the bancassurance market where essentially the evolution that we see that the FSA is making it extremely difficult to provide advice because the way they look at it is when the customer has invested in an asset which has made a loss, it means that it was bad advice &#x2013; which means that the only advice that can be recommended at this stage is cash.</p>
          <p>So, bancassurance is at risk at the moment in the UK and that explains the much lower volumes that we've seen in the first half. But the progression on our two strategy platforms, Elevate and Architas, is growing nicely.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. William Elderkin from Soc Gen. Two questions. First one on asset yield, can you say how the P&amp;C asset yield was stabilized in the first half at 4% I think with new money rates of 2.9%, if I understood your slide correctly? And then, second, related to that. If interest rates stay where they are over 2013, what roughly would be the impact on the asset yield over that time horizon?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on the variable annuity slide, I just wonder if you can talk on how I can reconcile the information given on slide A26, and then secondly on B19 where you broke down the technical margin. I can't see how they fit together.</p>
          <p>And then, related to that, can you just give a sense of how conservative your assumptions now are related to the new policyholder utilization effect you mentioned?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the &#x2013; first on the asset yield, first of all, the asset yield is a blended rate, combining different currencies and so on and so forth. But as far as the 4% are concerned, this is coming from the fact that, as I explained before, in a country like Belgium, we increased our rates. Why did we increase our rates? Because we have invested in OLOs. And that explains why we succeeded in stabilizing the 4% for P&amp;C, but we have a decrease on the other side, on Life.</p>
          <p>To answer the second part of your...</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What would happen? It's quite easy; I think that we are investing today, on average, at 2.9. Take the euro, we are investing at 3.2 points, so that means that starting from a situation where roughly, we're at 4, that means that we have to spread a decline of 80 basis points, 80 to 100 basis points over the duration of the asset. That means that taking into account the duration of 7, 7.4 year in Life and 5 years in non-Life, you can expect to have something like 15 basis points per year roughly. And that's why we said this year we are on the safe side saying that we will decrease by 20 basis points. The year after, everything equal, maybe it would be 15 &#x2013; between 15 and 20.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Okay. So, the way we could explain it; first of all, we have &#x2013; and that's what you've mentioned on page A26, we have negative contributions from the U.S. of minus &#x20AC;7 million. This is compared first with the earnings for the &#x2013; the U.S. earnings for the first half at &#x20AC;237 million. You can see that we have a negative adjustment of &#x20AC;137 million and &#x20AC;120 million, as we see on the net basis, that means its net of DAC, net of PB, net of DAC.</p>
          <p>And on page &#x2013; which is your question on page 19, you have the figure which are gross. So, roughly speaking, you have an adjustment of &#x20AC;542 million plus the volatility, &#x20AC;143 million plus &#x20AC;54 million so you have &#x20AC;740 million negative growth adjustment, which is mentioned on page 19, B19, and you have to offset the DAC effect which is roughly &#x20AC;530 million. It doesn't make the whole but it gives you a good idea of the offsetting element coming from the DAC.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Fran&#xE7;ois Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. A follow-up question on the VA book, it seems a bit the net impact is much lower than the gross because you actually assume that the DAC impairment will take further to come through. And the question is, what is the amount of DAC right now? And what could trigger an accelerated impairment of the stock of DAC, interest of market conditions, interest of calendar? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So, the amount of DAC in the U.S. went up on this year from &#x20AC;7.2 billion to &#x20AC;7.9 billion. Your &#x2013; the second part of the question is about what is &#x2013; what's the level. You know that we have a kind of moving average with the corridor. The name is the corridor. And that means that we are very far from the level where we would have an acceleration of DAC if we would go through this corridor. It's maybe 30% below in terms of equity markets. But at the same time, we are &#x2013; on a regular basis, we are making lots of liability adequacy tests in order to test that we can recover this DAC. So, that means that it's not an amount which could grow at a very high-level without any expectation for recovery. We are tracking this recovery. And we are comfortable that we will recover it.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to &#x2013; I would like to add two points. First, on DAC, the fact that we have lower surrenders and lower partial withdrawals means that the policies stay with us for longer, which justifies that we keep a higher level of DAC because we have a longer period for &#x2013; during which we will keep the policies in force.</p>
          <p>Secondly, to add to the response to the previous question on assumptions. We told you last year that we were bringing our assumptions on surrenders in line with our current experience. And we confirmed in the first half that we had no further reserves to make on surrenders because we remain in line with those assumptions on surrenders.</p>
          <p>On partial withdrawals, it's the first time that we take a hit because it's the first time that we see a deterioration of the experience. We have taken the full effect of this deterioration of the experience from partial withdrawals. That doesn't mean that the experience could not change in the future. But what we have taken the full effect of the current experience on partial withdrawals.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Sorry about that. So, I've got a few questions. Firstly, going back to, I think, William Elderkin's question about the further risks in the VA book, how far away are you from assuming either zero partial withdrawals or zero lapses in the business? So, what would &#x2013; another way of asking this is, what would be the level of reserve that you would need if you made that kind of assumption? That's question one.</p>
          <p>Question two is you did have a study, I think, internally of going to policy holders and offering them to cancel their liabilities in return for a cash payment. I was wondering how that study is going and what you think the likelihood is of it being a solution?</p>
          <p>And my third and last question is on economic capital, at what point the economic capital becomes a constraint on dividend? So, if you did fall to 120%, 110% excluding the assumption of U.S. equivalence, would that cause you to reduce your dividend below the 40% payout level? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good. G&#xE9;rald, do you want to take the first part of the question on withdrawals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As far as partial withdrawal are concerned, we decreased our assumption by 50% for the next years. So, that means that we consider that this is quite cautious and that &#x2013; we won't be in a situation where partial withdrawal will be a zero. It would be a nonsense. So, we are taking something which is much more conservative than before and it should be in line with our &#x2013; with the reality in the future. So, under the present circumstances, we can consider that we are at the right level. Who knows exactly what will be the case if rates would &#x2013; also go down? But for the time being, it's not the case, and we have <mark type="indiscernible" />.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>So, on the second part of your question, I'd like to give a context for the &#x2013; for my answer. We have indicated that as part of Ambition AXA, we would devote more resources to the management of our inforce portfolios. And as part of this initiative, a team has been built in the U.S. That's the study that you're referring to. It's not a study. It's a full team that is dedicated to managing the inforce. And they are coming up with ideas which &#x2013; and initiatives which make a lot of sense.</p>
          <p>The first one was the one which led to a positive change in reserves in the first half, which was to offer &#x2013; I mean, to 10 policyholders. They would not be able to make further contribution and tax policies. The second initiative which has been announced and will start, I believe in October, will be an offer to GMDB policyholders, the people that have only GMDB to buy back this feature against cash. So, guaranteed minimum death benefit. And there will probably be other initiatives of the same nature, both in the U.S. and in other territories as part of this inforce management for value. But I don't have anything else to add to that question.</p>
          <p>This is ongoing. It's an offer that will start in October but has already been announced in the U.S. market.</p>

          <p>Your third question is on the dividend &#x2013; the possible constraint on dividend. I think we are telling you now as Henri has indicated at the presentation, that we are looking at our economic solvency including equivalence. And this is the uptick for the management of capital. That means that we are quite comfortable at the current level of 174%, and we see the minimum as being 100%. So, we don't see any short-term constraints on the dividends.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>The next question is from Mr. Blair Stewart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks. Thanks very much. Blair Stewart here. I've got a couple of questions. The first one is just &#x2013; I know you've not provided any explicit information on free cash flow, but perhaps, could you give us an indication as to how you're progressing with regards to your free cash flow targets?</p>
          <p>Secondly, with regards to Ambition AXA, clearly, capital markets are less favorable than you would or may have expected at the time it was put together. Is there more that you can do or would you consider doing more on the expenses side to compensate for those adverse capital market movements going forward into the future?</p>
          <p>And thirdly and finally, for &#x2013; I guess, as a question for you, Henri, as the CEO of the company, we've seen various issues coming up in the U.S. We had bases losses. We had volatility. We had a series of lapse adjustments as well, and we've now got partial withdrawals. What level of confidence do you have in that business now to expect some sort of breakeven or close to breakeven on the GMxB line going forward? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll start by the last part of your question. I think we have two elements in the U.S. We have the legacy book and we have the efforts we are making to reorient the business and develop the new generations of products and the Life part of the business.</p>
          <p>If I look at what is done by Marc and by his team, I'm comfortable. Of course, the legacy book has remained an issue. But if you look at the U.S. activities as a whole, the U.S. is profitable certainly not at the levels where we were in the future but &#x2013; sorry, in the past, but the profitability is there. The development &#x2013; the reorientation of the activities is progressing and according to the plans we have.</p>
          <p>So, the question is how does then the legacy book behave. And the feeling we have is that we are &#x2013; probably, in the &#x2013; I would say, at the end of the &#x2013; or close to the end of the bad story, because who would have believed that interest rates would be that low in the U.S. for that long. I think we have seen most of the changes.</p>
          <p>And once more, given the fact that the reorientation seems to be working, I think it's something we need to hold on not being passive. I mean, there is a very significant degree of activity in the U.S. to try to reduce the negative impact of the legacy book, to try to manage more actively the inforce to improve the situation, and you'll see in the numbers of the first half that the fact that we've stopped the drop-ins is an example and is bearing fruit. So, we have more things like that to be done. So overall, I'm not going to tell you it's a pleasant situation, of course not. We are paying the price for the mistakes made in the pricing of the first generation of policies. And the price has been heavy because of the evolution of interest rates. But in the long run, I think it would be a mistake not to be confident in the recovery of the U.S. market.</p>
          <p>The other element I would add is that IFRS accounting is giving a pretty, I would say, accurate non-complacent view on what the risks on these portfolios are. The U.S. GAAP methodology is much more complacent but I would say only for some time. And what is interesting for us is to start to see that some of the competitors are starting to adjust, reprice and understand what the long-term economic issues are with the first generation of VA.</p>
          <p>So, we think there is going to be more discipline in the market going forward. We think that if the U.S. economy recovers and it could take longer than expected, but long-term rates will increase again, and this means that we have to, I would say, keep our exposure but continue the very active efforts we are making.</p>
          <p>On the free cash flow indicators, on the expenses, Denis, do you want to say a word?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Free cash flow, I just would like to bring you back to slide 10. We have on slide 10 an indication that free cash flow for the first half were in line with Ambition AXA, and I don't think we need to tell you more because, as you know, we only publish the embedded value once a year.</p>
          <p>On the Ambition AXA plan and what the &#x2013; the impact of the markets, you pointed to efficiency initiatives. I would say as &#x2013; we showed that we are well in line on our efficiency initiatives and we have a plan over five years of &#x20AC;1.5 billion. We also have to invest as part of that plan, so we will not change our target there.</p>
          <p>The two areas where we are probably more focused at this stage are in the selectivity initiatives. On the P&amp;C side, we will have to offset the fact that we will have, eventually, lower investment income going forward, and we will have to adjust our targets on the combined ratio side.</p>
          <p>And on the Life &amp; Savings side, we need to accelerate our shift to Protection &amp; Health which is what we have done because basically we've moved and Henri showed from 31% of new business to 41% of new business, we need to continue, I would say, and be more aggressive and imaginative on that front. Those are the two, I would say, key elements of our strategy to offset the impact of low interest rates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there. Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, going back yet again on economic solvency. You've already said that it's not comparable with other companies, what you're publishing. And really, my question is, so why do you publish it? I mean doesn't it just create more trouble than it's worth? And what sort of suggestion would you give to investors who are puzzled by all these different economic solvency ratios that are coming out from companies. I mean not all of them, of course, are disclosing them but what kind of guidance would you give? And then second question just coming back on the U.S., you said that it's becoming more rational competition but I think there are still some companies that are still very aggressive out there, and are you really sure that rationality is returning to the market? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Nick, for these good questions. On the solvency ratios, there are differences. Some European having activities in the U.S. do not publish. That's true. Some Europeans as we've said before not using real risk-free interest rates that are, I would say, making some adjustments. What we want to do &#x2013; I mean first we publish I could say because you're up for it, point one. More seriously because also we think that for the sake of transparency, we want to show where we are, and we want you to be convinced that we are fully prepared for Solvency II.</p>
          <p>What we do is to &#x2013; because it's also the way we manage the business I mean our internal risk model is very much a Solvency II one. What we have done this &#x2013; for this half year is to slightly change the way we present it. But we think it's fair because it's reflecting the evolution of the discussion with the regulators and the supervisors. Mr. Bernier has been crystal clear more than once, which &#x2013; and most of these things are not always usual in, I would say, the discussions with regulators, they are sometimes crystal clear; sometimes, once. But being crystal clear more than once is something pretty unusual, on the fact that equivalence would be granted to the European players because it's a core element of the level playing field, global players need.</p>
          <p>As long as we had not been crystal clear, we didn't take into account the benefit of equivalence. We think now that we have good reasons to take it. We have not taken the benefit of the countercyclical premium and of the matching premium. The industry is requiring to support a full move to Solvency II. And we would do it only if we were to reach an agreement on the finalization of Solvency II.</p>
          <p>But what we want you to know and to understand is that under the current stage of the negotiation, the ratio for us stands at 170% plus which we see as being an extremely comfortable level. Doesn't mean that the discussion on Solvency II is over, there are still some very substantial points to be negotiated. The industry has been very clear on what is needed to adjust to the extravagance or inconsistencies of the model which is put today on the table by the commission. We hope that we will progress. We will see.</p>
          <p>But at the &#x2013; I would say, at the current stage of the negotiations, equivalence will exist. We think it's fair to take it in the number we publish, which is, on all the other elements, a pretty conservative number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for that. Could I just ask a follow-up question which is, what would ratio &#x2013; can you give us any sort of indication of what the ratio would be if the matching premium and the countercyclical premium were also agreed?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

          <p>On the U.S., I would agree with you that the &#x2013; all the players are not yet totally rational. But I would say that the market is evolving in the right direction. And the fact that we have regained market share in the VA space in the first half is a reflection of that. It's the first time that we are regaining market share not because we have been more aggressive at all, but just because the market has become somewhat more rational. There is still some room for progress there, but it's a very significant progress on the VA side.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, altogether. I have three questions. The first one is about your reinvestment. The majority of your reinvestment is actually in fixed income. And if I look to your asset base, I have some 82% invested in fixed income. So, then looking at your new investment, is the share bigger or lower? I mean, are you investing also in other asset classes or all the &#x20AC;25 billion already 100% of your total reinvestment? And, yeah, that's the first one.</p>
          <p>The second one is in terms of Direct business, the minus 1% are clearly driven by UK. Looking forward, what is the growth rate which we could expect for this business? Are we speaking double digit or still half?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And half or double digit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then for economic solvency, the question is even accepting the new equivalence, could you give a sensitivity for a AA ratio calibration?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. G&#xE9;rald, you want to take it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Concerning your question relative to the investment, we are not exclusively of course investing in bonds. But keep in mind that in Solvency II world, Henri just said that we are already managing our business in a Solvency II world. And it's not new; we started long time ago. And that explains why ALM is a key element of our strategy. So, don't expect to move a lot from this 82% in fixed income. For sure, what we try to do is to diversify ourselves, as I explained, within this fixed income category. For example, investing more in loans, investing more in secured loans, and so on and so forth.</p>
          <p>On the other categories of assets, yes, we still have &#x2013; for the time being, we have investment in equity which is not so high. You have all the figures. That's due to the environment but we are still investing in real estate and we have some opportunities as well. We are still investing as well in private equity.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry for following up on this one. To be more precise, the &#x20AC;25 billion is the reinvestment amount in fixed income. How much is the total sum which you are reinvesting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That means that the total sum which is reinvested in the first half, roughly speaking, we invested mostly in fixed income. But we should have something like &#x20AC;2 billion more, &#x20AC;2 billion to &#x20AC;3 billion more in other categories of assets, but there we have been mostly in fixed income.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning to everybody. I have just one question left. I wonder if you can provide a sensitivity on your U.S. variable annuity business. In the case the interest rates would fall further in the second half of the year, since the end of H1, there was a decline of roughly 20 basis points and I wonder if this could hit more your U.S. variable annuity in the second half of the year. If you can provide some sensitivity on this. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. G&#xE9;rald?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, as far as variable annuities are concerned, you &#x2013; keep in mind that, in fact, if you take all the adjustments and all the P&amp;L from GMxB to be that were over the last years. We have, in fact, two different categories of earnings contribution. The first one coming from basis risk and volatility. And if rates are going down in a quite benign volatility environment, then it's not a real problem. So, that means that we would have some volatility losses but nothing really different from what we posted in the first half.</p>
          <p>And the second one is the adjustment. So, as I said, and our statements, current knowledge of the business, we consider that our reserves are at the right level. So, nothing says that if rates would go 100 basis points down further, then maybe there could be adjustment. But for the time being, we don't have any indications that we should do it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We have a question from Mr. Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Sir, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, all. Three questions, I suppose. Going back to the U.S. VA book, could you tell us what portion of the U.S. VA book, are the policyholders in the money on the rolled-up guarantees? And also, say, in basis points, your hedge charges, how much is that? What's the average charge?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, on VA book, could you talk a little bit about the proportion of the loss, which is going to run through the P&amp;L versus get put up on the balance sheet through sort of DAC reactivity because I think it's about three-quarters of losses that are currently going on to the balance sheet?</p>
          <p>And then finally, on the definition of economic capital required, in your embedded value calculation which is the higher of regulatory capital and your economic, whereas, I think when you calculate the economic capital coverage ratio, it will just kill your internal model. Could you therefore state what are the additional regulatory buffers to take it up to its preliminary value basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, G&#xE9;rald, could take the question of VAs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the VAs, you asked for the hedged charges. Going back to the slide which is on page A26, the VA base fee roughly is 150 basis points. So, that means that if we have a slight drop between the VA base fee at the end of 2011 &#x2013; yes, for the first of half of 2011 and the first half of 2012 is due to the average amount of VAs that's why we have a drop. So, 150 basis points.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

          <p>So, that's the basis point charge, isn't it? It's not the additional charge for hedging?</p>

          <p>No, that's whole &#x2013; that's the whole, the hedges. The part for hedging is much smaller than this, we guide with you.</p>

          <p>...but the 150, the whole. And on the policy order in the money, that means that as you can imagine with the present interest rate environment, we have a significant part which are in the money. But at the same time, it should be analyzed in the light of the unrealized gains that we have on our hedge &#x2013; on our hedge position. And today, we should be the most hedged company as a whole.</p>

          <p>I'll liaise with you on this point. On the DAC reactivity, 58%. That was the DAC reactivity on the first half of 2012. We told you 50% last time so we are not very far from this level.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On the last part of your question on &#x2013; if I understood you correctly, Andrew, I believe that your question is appropriate at the local level. I don't believe it's appropriate at the group level because at the end, the capital that will be required under Solvency II is going to be the economic capital. So, there is no addition to be made at the consolidated level for additional local buffers. We have within our balance sheet to manage the fungibility issue but we &#x2013; I don't believe it would make sense to add on the consolidated basis some additional regulatory buffers that are local, because at the end, on the consolidated basis, we are regulated on the &#x2013; we will be regulated on this economic basis.</p>

      <speaker id="0" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a question on the Internet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Last question from Ralph Hebgen from KBW, "When do you think will equivalence be formally granted? Are there still any risks that it will not be granted, and you need to return to Solvency II in all territories? And please, can you confirm &#x2013; you manage your U.S. business in accordance with RBC-based economic capital."</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. On Solvency II, it's an ongoing process. The &#x2013; we are at the stage of the negotiations where some progress has been made, equivalence, admission of the principal that a countercyclical premium and a matching premium are a necessity that no agreement at all on the way it should work. So, I think going forward, it's a pretty binary route. Either we can come to an agreement on the two last substantial points and Solvency II will be enforced even if it's later than expected or we can't and the probability is that there is not going to be, I would say, the necessary level of political support to implement it and the European Commission will have to go back to the drawing board and come with another system.</p>
          <p>That's where we are, but we do not see a situation where something would come out without equivalence. What we see as an industry is we've been very clear in what we are requesting. Every &#x2013; I mean, all the cards are on the table. There is an ongoing negotiation process. There is a French word, I don't know in English, [contre] &#x2013; locked.</p>
          <p>I think the important point is equivalence has been locked in the process because Bernier has been very clear on that. So, we do not see why they would step back and take a different stand. So, it's a positive that this has been locked. We need to lock two additional things. One is the reasonable outcome of the countercyclical premium. The second one is the reasonable outcome on the matching premium. We hope we will have that.</p>
          <p>If not &#x2013; going to the another question.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Your second question was related to the way the U.S. business is managed. The U.S.-managed business is managed on two registry systems because locally, we obviously have to comply with the RBC regulations. And in some extreme circumstances, like at the end of 2008, we took some hedging positions just to protect our risk-based capital. So, yes, we do have to take into account the U.S. RBC in the way we manage the business because on a regulatory level, at the local level, we have to comply with RBC rules.</p>
          <p>Having said that, in the way we price our products, in the way we manage our risk, we manage the business on an economic-capital basis. This is the way the group looks at the risks. And we do it also for our U.S. business.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. We are going to end the discussion here which is not going to prevent us from answering your questions in separate meetings offline. Thank you very much to all of you. We were probably wrong not to go to London because everybody tells us that London is empty and that traffic has never been very easy. But we thought it was a cautious decision to have this half year presentation in Paris. We wish you well for your holidays, for those of you who are going to be courageous enough to take holidays in this interesting environment. Thank you very much.</p>
