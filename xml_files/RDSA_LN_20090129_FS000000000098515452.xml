          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell Q4 Results Announcement Call. There will be a presentation followed by a Q&amp;A session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />.</p>
          <p>I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mr. Jeroen van der Veer. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello. Welcome to the Royal Dutch Shell fourth quarter and full year 2008 results presentation. I sit here with Peter Voser. I take you through the results and our portfolio activities.</p>
          <p>Firstly, please take a moment to read the cautionary statement. Thank you.</p>
          <p>Now, I turn to the highlights. We delivered another set of competitive results in 2008. Earnings were underpinned by satisfactory operating performance. We keep the capital discipline in the company. For 2008, net capital spending was 32 billion, and returns to shareholders were 13 billion.</p>
          <p>We made good progress on portfolio by adding new upstream resources and rebalancing downstream with new investments and some asset sales.</p>
          <p>We are taking a prudent approach to the economic downturn. This means, maintaining the core strategy to add 1 million barrels a day upstream and 300,000 barrels per day downstream, and getting the right balance between affordability and investment.</p>
          <p>Net spending for 2009 will be 31 to 32 billion, and we have made some tough choices in discretionary areas. I am pre-announcing the first quarter '09 dividend today, which is $0.42 per share. That is an increase of 5%. Dividend is a signal of confidence in our future.</p>
          <p>As I told you at the third quarter stage, we are steering the Shell ship through rough waters, and so far okay.</p>
          <p>Let me make some comments on the industry landscape. We see a recession in '09. The amount for energy deteriorated as we went through the fourth quarter. The oil industry is now facing some significant challenges. Downstream conditions, that's refining, marketing of petrochemicals, are as stiff now as during the early 2000s. And oil prices are back at the level that we had in 2004.</p>
          <p>Okay, so that's the picture. At Shell, we don't complaint about it. We are working hard to cope with this new environment.</p>
          <p>I think you are all familiar with the rollercoaster ride of oil prices. Basically, there was quite a rally over the last few years, and now we are back at around 40.</p>
          <p>But, if you look at the cost side, then industry costs are about double their 2004 levels. So oil price is flat, costs are double. That's a hard landing, and it puts a lot of pressure on the industry.</p>
          <p>We do expect costs to come down. And this is already happening in some of the commodity segments, like onshore rigs and steel. But this does take time; typically, 12 to 18 months in our industry, and after some help and not just the lower utilization rates. Take a bit of both, I'm saying.</p>
          <p>So, how do we manage these cycles? We screen our projects in a grid of long-run price scenarios. But we don't get carried away at the peaks and the troughs.</p>
          <p>Most of our FIDs, final investment decisions, were taken in a lower price environment. And we typically try to lock in about 70% of capital costs when we take FID. This is something we learned from the cost overruns that we have had in the past. We have avoided the worst of the CapEx inflation recently, and at the same time this structure just gives us some upside in the market if prices come down.</p>
          <p>In addition, we have deliberately postponed new FIDs in the last year or so into the peak of the cost cycle. We can come back to these projects later, when prices and technology have moved on.</p>
          <p>This is all normal behavior in a cyclical business like Shell. Then how are we looking at the dramatic change in conditions as we come into '09? This is all about how we manage affordability.</p>
          <p>On costs, we have an ongoing cost program in Shell, and cost focus is not new for us. Of course, in this environment, there are new opportunities to take out costs, and we are sharpening the focus. For example, in the service company area, the supply chain, and in our own organization as we focus on getting through tough quartile.</p>
          <p>On the capital spending side, a substantial part of our '09-2010 CapEx is already committed to post-FID projects and maintenance, and we don't slow down there. As we look further into the future of the '09-2010, then the committed CapEx levels do fall, depending on the pace at which you take new FIDs.</p>
          <p>So for 2009 budgeting, we will of course continue with committed projects, but we have slowed down some discretionary investments and pushed back potential 2009 FIDs. This gives us the opportunity to look for lower costs in the market and to manage affordability in '09 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Having a conservative balance sheet is key, and I feel good about that. In the end, this is all about using the flexibility that we have created in the portfolio and the balance sheet, and choices between spending restraints and growth. Sometimes, these are tough choices.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to our portfolio. We had a series of start-ups across the year, which contributed some 80,000 barrels per day to quarter four '08 production, and we have made good progress on creating new long-term positions in '08. One example is in Canada tight gas with the Duvernay deal. Another example, some 40,000 square kilometers of the new exploration area worldwide, 40,000 square kilometers is the size of the Netherlands.</p>
          <p>We have made good progress with our large new projects in '08, and we are on track. We have 1 million barrel per day upstream capacity and 300,000 barrels per day downstream. Let me update you on one of these new projects, Sakhalin, the oil and liquefied gas project in the East Coast of Russia. I'm very pleased with the performance of Sakhalin Energy and the relationships we have with Gazprom.</p>
          <p>Shell, as you know has 27.5% of the Sakhalin project. It will produce 400,000 barrels per oil equivalent per day with LNG capacity of 9.6 million tonnes per year.</p>
          <p>Offshore, the project has three production platforms. Onshore, there are two pipelines; one for oil, one for gas, that run for 800 kilometers each. That's the equivalent of the distance from The Hague to Milan.</p>
          <p>We have built Russia's first LNG plant and export facilities. All of these has been built through high engineering, safety and environmental standards in some of the most difficult operating conditions in the world. In fact, we've got just recently a couple of distinguishments about that.</p>
          <p>Year-round oil production has begun at Sakhalin. Gas from the pipeline arrived at the LNG plant in December and commissioning is going well. The joint venture company has spent some 30 billion on this project, and they will start to export LNG around the end of the first quarter 3/09.</p>
          <p>Turning to payout. Firstly, on share buybacks. This is really an up-cycle activity, and we stopped buybacks last November as we entered the down cycle. But it is the dividend where I put my focus. Growth in dividend signals our confidence in profitability in future, and I am extremely committed in this area. Shell has a long history of progressive dividends, and I am pleased that we continue with that. There is an 11% increase for '08 and a 5% announced to date for the first quarter '09.</p>
          <p>Now, let me hand you over to Peter Voser, and Peter will take you through the fourth quarter results in more detail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Jeroen. Let's start by making some comments on the market environment. Market conditions deteriorated sharply in the fourth quarter 2008, and continue to be under pressure so far in 2009. Average oil prices in the fourth quarter were some $32 lower than a year ago levels.</p>
          <p>Market LNG prices were higher than oil prices in Q4, due to pricing lag effects. However, we do expect LNG prices to step down in Q1 '09.</p>
          <p>The industry is seeing the impact of weaker demand across the board, and especially downstream, where volumes are weak.</p>
          <p>On the refining side, U.S. margins declined, although Asian and our European margins did increase, reflecting strong distillate cracks and further supported by some capacity outages.</p>
          <p>For Chemicals, U.S. and Europe benefited from falling feedstock costs in Europe and in the U.S., but were weaker in Asia. The macro environment today is clearly a challenge for the industry.</p>
          <p>Now, let me turn to Q4 '08 financial performance in more detail. So excluding identified items, CCS earnings were 3.9 billion and the earnings per share decreased by some 30%, compared to Q4 '07.</p>
          <p>The quarter was characterized by our earnings in both upstream and downstream. Operating cash flow doubled with a large flow back from working capital. As Jeroen said, '08 dividends increased by 11% in U.S. dollars, which is the currency we set it.</p>
          <p>Now let me talk about the business performance in more detail. Firstly, on upstream. Upstream earnings decreased by almost 30% to 3.4 billion in Q4 '08. There are continuing pressures industry-wide from operating costs and tax, and margins are under pressure.</p>
          <p>Oil and gas production was essentially flat versus the year-ago levels. Fourth quarter oil and gas production was boosted by some 80,000 barrels per day from a series of field start-ups, both large and small over the last year. These new growths balance out to offset the impact of planned fields decline, and the impact from the Q3 hurricanes.</p>
          <p>LNG sales volumes increased by 1%, and include new capacity from Australia, which offsets the impact of gas supply shortages in Nigeria.</p>
          <p>In Nigeria, we have taken the SPDC Soku gas processing plant offline in December, to repair damage caused by the security situation. Shell's share of production from Soku is about 70,000 barrels per day, and there is an impact from this on Nigeria LNG where volumes have been reduced.</p>
          <p>So, we estimate that Shell's share of LNG volumes at Nigeria LNG, are reduced by about 150,000 tonnes per month until Soku comes back online.</p>
          <p>Let's continue with downstream earnings. They declined by 25% to $0.8 billion. Headline margins were resilient in some regions. However, earnings were impacted by lower demand which resulted in reduced sales volumes. Demand picture deteriorated across Q4, and remains under pressure in Q1.</p>
          <p>Refining earnings were around $70 million in the fourth quarter of '08 compared to a loss of 30 million in Q4 '07. Refinery availability was lower than in Q4 '07, mainly due to a heavy turnaround schedule and an unplanned downturn. Refining availability in Q1 '09 is expected to be around 90%, and about 94% for Chemicals.</p>
          <p>So those are the results, now turning to disposal strategy.</p>
          <p>We received some 7 billion from disposals in '08, exceeding our target of 5 billion. Most of these deals were finalized mid-year before the markets deteriorated, and we achieved higher prices for many of these -- of the assets than we had expected when we opened the data routes.</p>
          <p>Upstream, we sold fields that will reduce '09 production by some 50,000 barrels per day, or about 1.5% of '08 production. And downstream we sold some 340,000 barrels per day of refining capacity, or about 8% of our total.</p>
          <p>So, we are pleased to have sold these non-core positions across the peak of the cycle. Total disposals now -- proceeds since '04, has now reached some $33 billion, which is about 25% of average capital employed.</p>
          <p>Now, let's look at cash. Upstream and downstream segments have both generated cash flow in excess of capital spending requirements. At the Group level, the cash inflow for '08 was well-balanced against outflow. Gearing is now sitting at 7.5% or 23%, including certain off-balance sheet items.</p>
          <p>Now let's turn to '09 on the spending plans. Net spending for '08 was 32 billion, which is below the 35, 36 billion that we had budgeted for last year. The difference for '08 comes mainly on the disposals side, where we have achieved higher prices and completion rates than we had expected.</p>
          <p>For '09 disposals, the market is very weak. So we are not assuming any further asset sales at this stage.</p>
          <p>Overall, for '09 we are expecting around 31 to 32 billion of spending. This is a more modest increase than in prior years, balancing on the one side Shell's commitments to projects under construction and growth, and on the other side the more challenging economic landscape in '09.</p>
          <p>You can see that after several years of 5 billion per year increases in organic spending, the spending levels are stabilizing. Future spending levels will depend on the timing of new FIDs, and our growth aspirations.</p>
          <p>With that, I pass back to Jeroen to summarize.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Peter. I recap. We have delivered satisfactory performance, despite pressure on demand due to a weaker global economy. Our strategy remains to pay competitive and progressive dividends, and to make significant investments in the company for the future profitability.</p>
          <p>Industry conditions remain challenging, and we continue with the focus on capital discipline in Shell. By taking a prudent approach to the economic downturn, we are steering the Shell ship through rough waters, and so far okay.</p>
          <p>Before we go into Q&amp;A, can I remind you that we are having a strategy presentation on the 17th of March. That is where we are planning to give you updates on reserves, exploration, and our portfolio in more detail. So, please could you leave your questions in those areas until the 17th of March.</p>
          <p>Also before we go into Q&amp;A, we have some good feedback from some of you that the question-and-answer session is too long. Therefore, please limit yourselves to one or maximum two questions each, so everyone has the opportunity to ask a question. Peter and I, we will try to give short answers and we will go around again if there is time to spare. Operator, please poll for the questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question and answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And the first question today comes from Michel de la Vinya from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Michel de la Vinya. I will ask only one question. On the operating working capital movement which was very large in Q4, what should we expect in Q1, if the oil price stays at the current level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take that. Thanks for the question. I think from an oil price perspective, if the prices are staying the same compared to where they have been towards the end of the year, I think the effect is actually not going to be too big again. I think there will be a little bit, but not that much. As you remember in Q3, I said actually that we will have some effects in Q4, but that has quite clearly been accelerated by the fall in price. So, I think there is a little bit still to come, but it is not going to be too much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Neil McMahon from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just two quick ones, hopefully. First of all, in terms of previous acquisitions, you've looked at North American unconventional gas, or tight gas acquisitions. Anything planned for this year, in terms of -- are you still screening companies, let's say, under the $5 billion mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is one question. You said you have two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, right, well, I will keep going then. And the second one is, I think given the entire markets focus on the reserve write-off issue, it doesn't look like you took any substantial write-offs in terms of any balance sheet capital or any significant amount of reserves. Maybe you could just run through what you were doing there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Neil. I will do the first question, Peter does the second. Tight gas, if I look at our total North American position, normal gas, tight gas and what you have is that, I feel for the past say five or six years, we came from a relatively near gap in our portfolio to quite an acceptable position. We did that in bits and pieces, and we concentrated basically on fields where we hope to have basically a kind of relative low life and where we can work either with our technology or a good profitability -- productivity, think about Pinedale.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we have largely restored what was in my view from the portfolio a relative weak position, so taking it forward is basically -- we are normal businessman, yeah if we get additional very good opportunities, we will certainly consider that. But then it has to rank vis-&#xE0;-vis other opportunities -- I'm sorry, vis-&#xE0;-vis other possibilities what we can do with our money.</p>
          <p>Peter, for the second part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Neil. This is all about impairment. This is about fair value testing for us. The way we do this, we test these things normally, obviously for the long-term because that's the nature of assets we have. We check these things at various price sets and see how they perform. And if it's downstream assets, we also take the cyclicality of the refining margin, but also the sharper than expected demands slowdown into account.</p>
          <p>So we looked at all of our assets, we also test the goodwill, and we had a few but minor impairments which we have recorded in the fourth quarter. The biggest one being in North America, and you have seen that in the results. So all in all, tested all the assets and went through the books. And we are pleased with the values we have of those assets, reflecting our cautious and conservative policy on the investment side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question, operator.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Mark Iannotti from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions. Firstly, on the U.S. upstream, the number looks pretty weak and realizations look quite poor. Can you just make some comments on, first of all, realization and secondly, whether you are happy with the performance of this business?</p>
          <p>And secondly, just looking at your gearing calculation in the back of the statement, you are showing an 11.8 billion under funded pension now versus zero last year. Can you make any comments on your desire or requirement under Dutch law to start making payments back into the fund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Again, first question I do, second question Peter. You asked -- if you look at the upstream position, fourth quarter, we had quite an impact and an ongoing impact as well of the hurricanes. You have to take that into account. So we had not only that for -- during the hurricane, but it takes simply time to get the production back up to where it was. I think that's the major impact.</p>
          <p>If I look at the total, you asked production figures. Yeah, and if I assume that it comes back, I think we are at where we should be. Peter, the pension funds.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question. First, let me split the 11.8 because it's important to understand that, because it's actually a remuneration of balance sheet items, which had 3.5 billion for post retirement health in it as well, mainly in North America and the U.S. So what we call the pension unfunded position is 8.3 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This does not show it obviously, as you know, per the end of the year. To put that a little bit into perspective, over the last 10 years, we had roughly 10 billion over funding or surface funding between '98 and 2001. We were then 3 billion negative 2002 to 2005; '06 and '07 we were 10 billion plus. And each time you can see when the equity market is actually accelerating or when it is crashing in '08, obviously you get these swings. But this is for the long-term.</p>
          <p>Now, this is the sum of 50, more than 50 pension funds across the world with all their legislations et cetera. So you have a quite a variety of funding needs which are coming out of this. Obviously at Shell, we will comply with our legal obligations.</p>
          <p>You asked about the Dutch funds. The Dutch regulations are pretty clear. You have got three years to get to 105 coverage ratio and you have got longer term then actually for further kind to increase your coverage ratio.</p>
          <p>In all of these countries including in Holland, there are huge discussions at this stage in with the regulators, or among the regulators on what rules they really want to have in the near term and in the, let's say the medium term. So it's a picture which is not very clear at this stage, and we will have to see how this unfolds over the next few years.</p>
          <p>If you actually go back over the last seven, eight years, in the early part of the decade, we had some 300 million in funding every year more or less. And then later on, we had 1.5 billion every year.</p>
          <p>So, we are used to these kind of swings, and we build that normally into our cash flow and into the short-term forecasts for the next few years. So, this is nothing new for us, and we manage that. We will not change our long-term investment strategy, which has equity, bonds and cash, and real estate in it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I had two questions please. First, you mentioned some tough choices on the discretionary part of spending. And I wonder if you could give us some examples of the type of projects in this environment that would go? And also, after 2020, sorry 2010, can you say roughly what discretionary CapEx would be?</p>
          <p>And my second question, in 2009 in terms of production trends, could you give us some guidance between oil versus gas, please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I see, thanks, Irene, that Peter has the whole list of projects already in front of him. So I suggest he takes all of your questions. Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Hi, Irene. Projects, what we have done; we have a few things which we postponed. I guess, the Gulf of Mexico Marsh B. We announced already the second expansion to the Oil Sands. So where we go more debottlenecking, that was one. We re-phased Carmon Creek, which is on the more heavy oil side. And we also re-phased Pierce in the UK for example. This is on top of seven or eight projects which we have done in '08, and in '07. So this is actually not new for us. We are quite in that kind of, let's say, prioritization mode, every year. As I've said many times, we have actually more projects than what we want to spend at this stage.</p>
          <p>2010 CapEx and the split, I think Jeroen has said we will go ahead with our projects where we have CapEx committed. You know how our projects are coming on stream. This year, we have Sakhalin towards the end of the year. We have got BC-10 coming, Perdido coming. So you have all these projects next year, then the next. So from that point of view, the committed part obviously comes down. We will now see how many new FIDs we take, and how we are refilling the CapEx side.</p>
          <p>So, there is quite a bit of discretionary going to come. But quite clearly, we want to grow the company as well, so we will have a look at that. But at this stage, in this environment I think I will not give you a split.</p>
          <p>Your third one on the production, I'm -- we don't do actually the split between oil and gas. What I can give you is actually that the production outlook for '09 is similar to '08. It's pretty -- we assume flat or about flat, with a chance of a slight decline, depending on the -- and you know all these ifs, that's weather-related, that's OPEC-related, that is Nigeria-related. But that is our view at this stage.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Kim Fustier from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Just two questions on marketing.  Obviously, a large proportion of your R&amp;M profit came from marketing this quarter. Now, how much of this was due to the temporary time lag effects, and how do you see marketing margins stabilizing so far in 1Q?</p>
          <p>And also, in terms of sales volumes, it seems like like-for-like sales were down 3% year-on-year. That's slightly better than the average drop in the OECD, which was close to 5% I think. So, can you comment on your market share, whether it's increased at all? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- I'll start with the second part of your question. Kim, is that the 3%, this is not an easy figure to calculate, because we sold certain positions and it's too early to say whether you are gaining or losing market share.</p>
          <p>Having said that, if we compare apples with apples, we think it was a guidance of 3% in OECD. But this is not a very precise figure. Needless to say that the economy as it is now, and as it developed at the end of last year, and then we see that in these lower demand, a much more drastic figures you see at the capital side, because de-stocking plays an even more important role.</p>
          <p>I think that if you always look back then you may have in theory that refinery margins or marketing margins can move independent from each other, that is not what we see. You have to realize that a lot of the devalue of the stocks is of course, already out of the figures. So, we don't know how the prices will develop. But we expect basically a quite gloomy environment for the downstream, until either the economy starts to recover, or you may have even the case that let's say the most expensive capacity will be closed down.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Jon Rigby from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks. Two questions. The first is on the U.S. downstream. The direction of travel of profitability seems pretty worrying, even if you clean up for specials and probably worse than the bad old days before you restructured that business. Is there something going on there or is it just a reflection of your business mix vis-&#xE0;-vis the operating conditions in the U.S. at the moment or is there something else going on, I wonder if you could comment?</p>
          <p>And the second is just to go back to Athabasca and Carmon Creek, when you defer/shelve a project, what is the process for revisiting that project, and how fast can you get it back on stream in terms of going through the process of assessments and project sanction? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter starts, we will see how we do with first question of Carmon Creek.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks John. On the U.S. downstream, you say if you strip out the special item, we have one as you know there. I think you need to take the two things at par between Chemicals and Oil Products.</p>
          <p>In general, I think the Oil Products business is performing well, and is performing as expected. It was quite clear that we had got compared to the year before, refinery margins were down, retail margins were actually coming under pressure and the volume came down quite significantly in December. So you had there quite clearly the recession effect actually slightly earlier than you have in like for example, say in Europe or maybe even in Asia. Asia was even a little bit earlier than Europe. So, I think from that point of view, Oil Products performing in as expected, so nothing special there.</p>
          <p>Volume-wise for example, lubricants was also down quite clearly. But that's linked obviously to the car manufacturing companies. It is also linked obviously to let's say the transport sector in general.</p>
          <p>On the chemical side, I think the key issue there was that the feedstock price is actually -- or the prices came down, not let's say as -- the feedstock prices came faster down as the sales -- the sales prices, so we had that mix. But you know how we are positioned in the U.S. on the chemical side, in terms of liquid stocks, or liquid capacity, and in terms of gas capacity, now in practice that didn't play well for us in the fourth quarter either. So, I think chemical story is as seen before. And the oil products, it's just the deterioration of the market.</p>
          <p>On the project -- on the second question on the process. I think what we normally do in both in Carmon Creek and in Oil Sands, you actually keep the possibility of a fast coming back of these projects to life. So you normally spend a certain amount in terms of OpEx to keep the thing going. So you do some commercial testing, or you actually in the case of Oil Sands, when you go into a debottlenecking mode, you keep some key resources in place, so that you actually could switch, shoot the market actually, take some heat out of the cost side, et cetera.</p>
          <p>So we keep this quite clearly on our radar screen. It is ranked on an annual basis. We look at these projects. We look at our strategy. So we are not stopping everything, and then you need to restart and then it takes you two, three years before you have actually the whole thing up again. So we try to be as flexible as possible there, in order to have all the flexibility going forward.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You keep the work and the sort of status of where you've got to, and just try to hold it there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, more or less yes. Maybe you'll go a little bit down in terms of resources you put in. But you keep it quite steady, so that you actually can't take off. In the case of Carmon -- Carmon Creek, you do some testing on technology et cetera. But you may do it at a lower fire than you do it when you actually are full speed going ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, gentlemen. I've got two questions on both on LNG actually. I wonder if you could update us on the progress of Qatargas 4 for in terms of the percentage completion on the project. And also, could you say where you are in terms of sales contracts from the plant, in terms of long-term contracts?</p>
          <p>And secondly, I wonder going into the first quarter, you can make a comment on how you see the Asian LNG markets in the downturn, and what sort of force in deliveries you are seeing there, particularly on the spot-traded LNG side? Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me be open, Iain. I know the answers, but I don't know if I'm allowed to disclose, so I'll leave it to Peter. Yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We normally don't give completion rates et cetera. I think in Qatargas 4, we are within in the kind of framework we have set ourselves, both in terms of budget and timing. So, I think that's all going well and it's all on track. And we look at the 2011 ramp up, which kindly --obviously points you towards the kind of a 2010 start-up.</p>
          <p>On the contractual side, as far as I know, there are two things in place. One is into Dubai, and one is into China. So we have got very long-term contracts there. So we are pleased with pricing there, and how we have closed them a few months ago.</p>
          <p>On the type of the Asian one, LNG market, you need to remember that obviously on our side, we are out alone in terms of long-term contract, which clearly gives you an advantage in India in the kind of decreasing market at this stage. So there is obviously, we deliver these things, and we are therefore have quite a reliable cash flow on these contracts. We had a good fourth quarter in terms of diversions into the Asia-Pacific market. So we couldn't actually see too much of a slowdown. I think we would expect this to -- the longer the year go, that you get less spot possibilities. It looks positive into the Q1 still, but I think the longer the year go, I think the spot market will be tighter there. But all in all, our strategy of long-term contracts pays off.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Two quick questions. One, just on CapEx for this year. I was wondering what sort of cost inflation assumptions have you incorporated into that 31 to $32 billion?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, I think you've talked about sort of ongoing cost -- an ongoing cost-saving program. How aggressive could that be, and does that mean reduction in headcounts? If you could give a bit of flavor where you see scope to reduce costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Peter starts with cost inflation and I'll take your second question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have -- at this stage, we are looking at 31-32 into 2009. As we have outlined in the opening speech, and what we have said before, it takes a while before the oil cost inflation comes down. If you believe in the statistics which we are seeing, the costs have peaked according to some to zero, for example in Q3. So we have built in our assumptions. But at this stage the world is quite volatile in terms of costs. So we are looking into that on a kind of category-by-category basis.</p>
          <p>So, at this stage, we will not update on an inflation assumption, which we have built in into 2009. We took our views. But I think we are more or less looking at older contracts which we have, and where we have got opening clauses in it, we go after these things. So I think this is a very kind of moving beast at this stage. But I think we are -- as we have given the guidance now, we are okay with 31, 32. And we are working on the issue.</p>
          <p>And cost, over to you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Ongoing cost and jobs, I think the difficulty is probably for many outsiders, also had it going on and what was additional. Things that were going on in Shell, we think that despite of normal business as bringing IT to India, bringing finance, back offices from OECD to the Philippines and to Malaysia, and to India now as well.</p>
          <p>We brought HR back offices from say, from the UK, the Netherlands had even go to Poland. That all that that means is not necessarily a direct job saving total Group wide, but it reduces jobs here in Europe and the States, and it increases job in Asia. That is one.</p>
          <p>Secondly, we had already quite a cost drive over the past years, because we never knew when the cycle will turn. We have frankly had a turn, very drastically as well. But long-term, costs are always important. So we build them in as normal management, and then we use as the criteria for all our location managers, for commercial managers, what we call top quartile. You benchmark your operations with the competition, and try to figure out how to get it into top quartile. We were very busy with that program.</p>
          <p>Of course we have used impressive market circumstances, and that we can sharpen it and then we can accelerate the delivery. Now by doing it that way, you build it in into your normal business. And we don't think there is any point to try to add it over, but to get to this kind of headline figure. We don't see the merits of that. So there's a bit -- just do it, is open to the managers we control that they are making that progress and then you see, not before too long, you see the quality of our operational results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. A quick question on petrochemicals demand. Your volumes being down 20% year-on-year in the fourth quarter, citing weakness in demand and I believe on the call you also referenced de-stocking. I'm curious if you were to try and strip out the de-stocking component, what your view of underlying end-user petrochemical demand is right now?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I handled the chemicals for years. And we have gone through many cycles, I have given up to split it in de-stocking and renewals demand. There must be huge de-stocking because in the end there is short-term relative if you take stock effects out with, there is a relative good correlation between GDP development and chemical demand. You have always some product substitution, plastics for steel, steel for plastics; but it doesn't go that quickly. So I'm sorry, can't help you.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have two questions please. First of all, I wonder if you could give us some sense of the absolute level of committed CapEx in 2010, if possible.</p>
          <p>And secondly, I think in the past you've indicated the impact on production of PSC contracts. I just wondered if you could tell us the extent of the presumably positive effect in Q4? Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks Mark. On the committed one, I not going to do a forecast for 2010. I did try it the best way I could with all our projects, which are now calling on stream and falling out of it in '09. You know in '08-'09 we bring on 250,000 barrels of production, '10-'11 will be some further production coming on stream. So that will work itself out and we will replace some of it quite clearly with new projects. But at this stage, given the uncertainty in terms of the costing environment as well, I am not going to go into that.</p>
          <p>On the PSC effect, Q4 on Q4 it has been 30,000 barrels &#x2013; 3,000 barrels, sorry. Yeah. Q4 on Q4 PSC is 3,000 barrels.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I was wondering about two items, if I may. Number one as Shell's exposure to the tanker market, such that it is right now, benefiting from the reduction in the pricing there or does Shell have contractual exposures where it's actually at a disadvantage relative to its competitors as it perceives it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Joseph, may I stop you? You said, the first one, tanker rates? Freight rate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, okay yeah thanks. Second question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Then second question or should I wait until that one is answered before I ask the second?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, you can ask your second question, Joe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay are you seeing opportunities for buying more cheaply than building in terms of assets that you would be interested in acquiring long run as some of the less than actually prudent people find themselves forced to sell to you perhaps at pricing that is relatively more attractive, or has that not yet happened in the marketplace?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Freight rates, whether it's crude tankers or product tankers, we have waited already for it I think for decades, I was involved when I was very young child. As you have a whole mix of what we own, what we charter for long-term, what we charter for short term, and who is carrying which cost, et cetera. So, this is a whole potpourri of things, I am not aware of any additional let's say or unlucky exposures. On the contrary, I think we have very professional shipping management.</p>
          <p>On your second question, buying distressed assets or something like that, yeah, we are normal businessmen. We do realize that we start at least at this economic cycle, at the downturn of this economic cycle with a strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, we are not worried, and we will be prudent and the things to always consider, every opportunity that we get and then we rank that with the other opportunities that we have, rather that is on the acquisition side or organic. That is simply the discipline which I meant when I said, yeah, we are prudent. And the discipline in our CapEx, then on the other hand you have to be good businessmen as well. Needless to say that if we buy something, it should always taken into our base strategy. And we have made choices of what kind of businesses we like to be engaged, and it should fulfill that picture.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, good afternoon. I am just trying to get some understanding of the -- behind the different performances in the E&amp;P between the U.S. and WOUSA. When you look at profit per barrel, profit per barrel in WOUSA was about half what it was in Q3 last quarter. In the U.S., it was down nearly 90% from about 45 to about $5.6 per barrel. There's clearly some specific costs in this Q4 in the U.S., probably recovery from hurricanes et cetera. Are you able to quantify what those are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I answered already the question of Mark. Apparently you were not happy with that, so I will ask Peter what more he can say about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say much more. Its earnings in the U.S. decreased mainly as a consequence of the new prices quite clearly. The U.S. generates high margins for Shell as a consequence of their royalty regime normally. Realized crude prices in the U.S. reduced by some 40%. In addition, production volumes are still being impacted by the third quarter hurricanes, with full recovery expected to -- in the first quarter. So, I think that's all what I can say at this stage, so there is nothing special in there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am guessing that there would have been a phasing effect because as you're building up production back from the hurricanes later in the quarter, that's when prices were -- have become lower. So that explains why there was a bigger differential to the average over the quarter and that's not something we should expect to see in the first quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is absolutely correct. You will have it on a much smaller scale obviously from what is still outstanding depends on how obviously the prices move. But it is quite clearly we needed a few weeks and even months before some of the production came back, so that is quite clearly a part of the explanation here.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Gentlemen, good afternoon. Two questions as well, if I may. The first is on the sands and clearly given the expansion of plant, you are pouring capital in. But you've realized a loss at a time when your average realized price has been $47, which I think one would simply say, given the historic cost base of the business, isn't quite good enough. So, first question really is, is observations there; is there something you can do to improve the base level of profitability in that business?</p>
          <p>And the second and more difficult question, and it's one that I'm asked frequently and I just wondered how you'd respond. And very simply it's, when do I start to worry about your commitment to the dividend? 40-50 years of history says I shouldn't, but how long the thing -- it's almost -- how difficult do things have to stay, how starved of growth capital does Shell have to become before its absolute commitment to shareholders and to driving income growth goes by the wayside?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will answer the question about the oil sands because probably your difficult question, it is much more relevant that you asked that to the incoming CEO. I am absolutely committed. Oil sands, realize that the existing operation, we said at a past conference as well, you need $38 per barrel including energy costs. That's a kind of figure that we have in mind. Of course in a specific quarter, you may have additional costs or certain problems, I think I have some tailings problems last year, that is one.</p>
          <p>The second thing I would like to say, oil sands, your duty investment, I know you will thump it up for decades. And so it is very much based on the long-term view. Regarding how to -- and that is basically the view, how do oil sands fit into the total energy mix. And as far as we can look down the road, that the longer term prices in the energy alternatives that you have, we think oil sands is a very good mix to have it in. Having said that, we delayed the additional expansion of oil sands because we expect by delaying it that we have later lower construction prices incur on that because we expect a substantial less overheated market in Calgary -- in Alberta.</p>
          <p>Over to Peter for the dividend.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeroen, just before you change over, you're saying it breaks even at 38. The average price is 47, so you're effectively telling me there's $9 of associated cost with the expansion at the present time or other one-offs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think one-offs. I look at Peter as well, I don't know the answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I -- sorry, let me just give you some numbers here, which maybe then it's easier. The 38 actually per barrel is an '08 figure, which reflects, let's say, 80,000 barrels of production. If you take the same in 2007, you get $29 on the production of 87,000, let's put it this way. So you quite clearly have a cost increase also related obviously to what Jeroen said, tailing management et cetera. But you also have obviously a heating up environment in Alberta as well. And the current operations are actually not free of those, so you need to take that into account. Roughly 20, 25% is energy cost, so energy cost actually is up between the two years by $1.80 roughly. So you need to take all of that into account, when you look at these figures. So you can't just take the year end or the last quarter, what I am giving you is actually average numbers.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On your second question, I think I'll answer it still as a CFO because it hands a lot together with how you actually plan your balance sheet. We have always said that we look at our three, four legs and you know the legs, which is the dividend, which is organic growth, balance sheet which is throughout the cycle well, reasonably leveraged in that sense, and then we do with cash surplus a little bit more.</p>
          <p>So when you look at the plan -- of R&amp;D planning going forward, you do stress test your balance sheet and you forward in a way that you can actually go on with your comment to CapEx for -- to bring these projects to an end for a while, and you make sure that when you then actually -- you are in a low cycle, you are careful on how you actually fill that CapEx hole, which you are generating by working yourself out with the current project. So what you do over time when you are in a prolonged down cycle, you start to look at your cash in and your cash out, and you use some of the flexibility which you're generating and you do some of the test for the early part.</p>
          <p>We have a lot of barrels coming on stream. That will increase our operational cash flow, starting with May to this year, with '10 and '11. So, these all contributes to a long-term financial plan, which acts as one of the cornerstones to dividend policy you actually you know. So from that point of view, committed, we have structured it in such a way that we can actually go through quite a long period with what I just explained to you.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Guys, good afternoon. I had two questions, one relating to the dividend, the other relating to the upstream. On the dividend, following up on the last question, I'm curious what kind of long-term commodity price planning scenario underpins the announced increase, Jeroen, which frankly surprised me a great deal?</p>
          <p>On the upstream side, within the newly announced 2009 capital budget, what is the expected outlay for exploration in that figure compared to what it had been in 2008. Also Peter's comment about flat 2009 production, what oil price is assumed in terms of that comparison to 2008? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mark. The dividend is that, I think it is -- we look always at the kind of various scenarios, long-term, short-term. We don't get very nervous by the oil price of one day. And then rather than to repeating what Peter said is realized, if you look at the kind of cycle we are in as a company, I don't mean the economic cycle is that, yeah, we spent heavily over the past years for our growth and it takes a bit of time.</p>
          <p>And sometimes, you feel it takes long time. Those big projects, they will come in, they start to produce cash and we do know that. So that's in our whole total planning, and so you look at your balance sheet, you look like kind of if your longer term CapEx even if the oil prices are still going up and down, we felt that the 5% dividend increase was appropriate to do.</p>
          <p>Regarding your second part of the question, I refer to Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks, Mark. First, start with exploration. The 2009 includes some $3 billion of spending on exploration, which is a slight increase from 2008 levels. If I treat for example, the adjust you see et cetera, the acquisition and all those part of that spend. This is actually a reduction from what we were planning in the midst 2008, so we are actually adjusting given the circumstances.</p>
          <p>We have deferred some deepwater exploration wells from 2009. North American tight gas drilling spending will increase, but at a lower pace than previously actually planned and concentrated in Canada. So, this is an area where we have particularly good flexibility on spending. But we know this is also an area where we will deliver future barrels. So we will always try to find the right balance.</p>
          <p>Production target, the outlook for '09 was based on 50. And maybe I can add to this one that we have got as you may have heard or already seeing new guidance on PSC, so far we always said that the dollar change so related to the 50 now is 2 to 4,000 barrels difference. Now, we say it is 1 to 2,000 barrels difference or BOD.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon. Just two questions. Looking at slide 15 of the presentation, I'm just wondering, with the capital under construction at $30 billion in 2008. Your best estimate of when that would peak; 2009 or 2010 and perhaps what level it might peak at?</p>
          <p>And secondly on disposals, is it your intention not to sell any assets in 2009 given the low asset values or is it simply a prudent assumption, and you are in fact still actively looking to sell? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will start with the second, so Peter can look and check here the graph of the first. We -- there your second question, not to sell it. Now we think that good portfolio management is that you always just keep on reading. We sold 33 billion over -- since 2004, which is quite -- basically a quarter of our capital employed. Having said that we think that '09 -- as we sold a lot of stuff basically on the peak of the cycle -- we think '09, which will be a much more difficult environment. So that's why it is a prudent assumption to keep that figure very low.</p>
          <p>Peter, on the CapEx and the peaking.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks for the question, Neill. Historically, on the capital under construction, we always have used 20 to 30% more, around 20% base of our capital employed is normally under construction, so that's historically. We normally don't give a full cost for the future. But to say -- I would say this will not change dramatically if the spending keeps going at the same level. If obviously the spending changes because the spending depends obviously on FID; that could have an impact then on let's say on the capital under construction. But we will see that in going forward. But I think historical rates are good rates to peak.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. I hope the last will not be the least. Two questions. One is, I saw that your total margin oil and gas and compared with the last 12 quarters is about two-thirds to 70%. Now if you -- what you've said about for obvious reasons of course, lower oil price, higher cost, probably higher taxes as well. In view of what you've said about costs peaking in Q3, what sort of an acceptable margin levels going forward in the next two to five years would be, would you expect it to be up to 11 or $12 again, or has the ball game changed?</p>
          <p>And the next question is versus the inventory losses, you have a large trading division, of course oil price guessing is everybody's guess. But last summer it was pretty clear that prices had come somewhat over the year, over the barrel, so to speak. To what extent have you indeed been able to hedge your losses with smart trading?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Peter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. On the first one, which is what you are really asking for is a kind of a profit guidance for the future, which we don't do, so I'm not going to give you a kind of market expectations. I reiterate that quite clearly the cost picture is changing, but we also said it will take 12 to 18 months. It depends a little bit in which category you are, you have some commodities are already coming off.</p>
          <p>Some onshore rigs you are coming off, some other categories like deep water rigs, we don't see much movement at this stage. So this is a whole basket of things which we will work out through and then see where margin comes out. So no point to give any guidance on that side.</p>
          <p>Trading, yes, indeed we have a trading business which is embedded in the various businesses. In downstream, we have clearly a successful trading business. We work quite slowly to get to that and we take obviously our -- rather we have a big physical position which we obviously trade, given our equity production, given our refining capacity which we have. But we have never splitted it out in terms of how much we hedge away from the FIFO losses.</p>
          <p>I find it actually quite dangerous to try to actually go and look at FIFO losses because FIFO losses are actually not the way management looks actually at our FIFO numbers at the business. We are really on a current cost of supply basis on a day-to-day basis and that's how we are driving it. And quite clearly, the trading environment does its share to that, and that's how we manage the business. So, I can't give you any numbers there, because we would actually not look in the way you described it as this. Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Afternoon, gentlemen. I've got a question or couple of questions on gearing, so I guess these are for Peter. Just coming back to the pension shift, I wonder if you could provide a bit more color on how things were moving between the assets and the liabilities. Because, even if you strip out the healthcare impact, it looks like a $22 billion swing between the end '07 position and the end '08 position.</p>
          <p>And related to that, I wonder if you could comment on what point you think bond markets would start to worry about gearing on your definitions, so including the operating leases and the unfunded pension liabilities? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Both sides of the equation obviously have moved in 2008 to asset and liabilities. So you know that we're using obviously mortality tables, we're losing for a discount rate AA-rated bonds, et cetera. So what we normally do, we publish all of this in our 20-F which is in March, everything is being brought together at this stage. So I would feel it is not rightly placed if we start to talk about all these details. But the one thing I can tell you on the liability side, we have followed it even more strengths and now in kind of conservative view on our assumptions in order to have the liability questions actually covered in the right sense.</p>
          <p>So if you look at previous years and also this year, our expectations from an asset return point of view, from a dollar inflation point of view, but also mortality rate, discount rate, we are normally actually more conservative than the markets are in this sense.</p>
          <p>The second question on the bond market. We have had now financial policy for a few years where we said throughout the cycle, we will manage the balance sheet around 20-25% gearing ratio. We will be quite significantly below that, at the high end of the cycle, which has been the case. When you go into the other side of the cycle, you go through this, you may temporarily be above. I think this is a policy which we have shared with the rating agencies. We have launched a bond in December. We have been active in the CP market as well, and the way our balance sheet and our future cash flow generation is viewed is strong. So from that point of view, we are going though 2009 in a positive way.</p>
          <p>Just to remind you also, we have maturing debt of $1.3 billion, which is hardly anything. That is also a big difference to many other, either competitors or companies. We have started to lengthen our maturity profile over the last two, three years, because that's part of how you run a financial framework. We have not optimized only the interest, which we are paying interest rates, we have gone for rather long-term and I think that is now working to our benefit. So we'll just go through that during 2009.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Are you still committed to your 2 to 3% upstream growth target for the early years of the next decade? Could you give some more definition of the period that actually counts for, and does that at all allow you to throttle down on CapEx in the coming year? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have said, as Peter mentioned, is that if you look at the production outlook, you have many uncertainties -- pipes from Nigeria, weather, production agreements, what have you. We have said, we expect relative flat development or even a slight decline until our major projects kick in. And our major projects don't kick in before too long. Then how does that compare with the 2 to 3% figure, is that yeah, if a major project kicks in, it kicks in with a lot especially if you have a fast start-up.</p>
          <p>So, the 2 to 3% is a kind of average figure around those projects are coming on stream. Then longer term, so if you take more years out, then of course it is in the out balance between if we invest more, you get more production and if you put all the FID definitions on hold, one day your decline rates will win it from your newer investments. That is simply too early to say.</p>
          <p>So, what we have decided, the bottom line is, yeah, flat development or even a slight decline than 2 to 3% growth over the year. So, now our major projects kick in, long-term is all subject to FIDs that we have still to take.</p>

It looks like based on Peter's comments that when you're fixing the Soku terminal, you'll be doing about a third of your capacity if you include Train 6 at Nigeria in LNG although I am not even sure if that's fully operational. And also we've heard that Oman is running a bit below capacity too.</p>

          <p>We look at each other, who is taking the questions, we can do both, yeah?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You take so.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We did -- our traders did some storage of crude and crude tankers, which is -- that's correct. I think it was too magnified at the press, probably people have physical pictures. But if you look at the total scale of operations, yeah, and how -- so this was not that large. The contango has become a bit smaller in the markets and I think this was announced two days ago that what the first position was then wider. I think this is not -- this is a kind of short-term optimization, and we try to take advantage of the markets in a transparent way. How that will develop over this quarter, don't know.</p>
          <p>And in de-utilization, in -- first of all, in Oman, we acquired some capacity and the plants are running very well. And that enables us sometimes to sell more gas, but you have on whole the supply problems, the structure of the upstream operations, you have to make sure that you got enough supplies to the plants and that's a story in itself. That's from time-to-time indeed, our joint venture companies have a certain over capacity, and it has to do with the supply upstream.</p>
          <p>In Nigeria, so far and I give credit to our Nigerian operations in LNG joint venture, that in spite of all the security problems, they have a very good record sticking to the contracts. We have built there many trains. I think the sixth train is ready, but here we have that due to the security problems and due to what happened in Soku, which is a kind of terminal -- how they call that in English, for gas supplies, that is -- we had serious problems, and we have to get Soku back to come back to the full capacity. And of course, people are working hard on that. But I don't know whether we have given more guidance about that. People say no here. Okay, so you have to do with this, Neil.</p>

          <p>We do actually have a question sir. It's from Jason Kenney from ING.</p>

      <speaker id="20" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the earlier exploration question. You mentioned that deepwater was one area where you could be cutting back in the exploration budget. And I think in September you mentioned that you plan to drill 10 wells over two years in Brazil. Is this a region where waiting is perhaps prudent?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I leave that to Peter. Peter is not only CFO, he is Regional Director of South America and he has been recently in Brazil. Yeah.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right, and actually the statement came from me when I talked in at the Rio Gas and Oil Conference. And that is still in our plans to go ahead as outlined back then. So, that's another area where we are going down.</p>

          <p>Well, let me thank you, thank you for your questions. I repeat, the update which will take place in London on the 17th of March, and I look at Peter, whether he would like anything more to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>No, but you know March is also the month where we file our 20-F and there you will get all the questions about -- or all the data about reserves and further updates on exploration then in the strategy update. That's all. So thank you very much for calling in.</p>
