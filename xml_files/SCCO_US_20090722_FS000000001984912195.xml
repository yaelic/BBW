        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Marline, and thank you everyone again for joining us for the second quarter 2009 Southern Copper earnings conference call. Participating in today's conference are Mr. Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha, the company CEO and Mr. Genaro Guerrero, Southern Copper's CFO. Mr. Guerrero will now lead the conference.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone and welcome to our conference. Today, I will discuss Southern Copper's production, sales, operating cost, financial results, and capital expenditure program. After that we will open the session for questions.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter 2009 we have seen a partial recovery in the prices of copper, molybdenum, zinc and silver, which are the most important commodities produced by Southern Copper. The LME 2009 second quarter average copper price was $2.12 per pound, 45% lower than $3.83 per pound average for the same quarter of 2008, but 36% higher than the prior quarter. A major driver for the better copper prices in the second quarter '09 has been the significant demand recovery of China. We think that this process will be reinforced with more positive news regarding economic growth from China, as well as other emerging economies. As you know, economic growth in these economies results in higher metal demand. We believe that there are initial signals of end of the recession for the U.S. and European economies. An encouraging sign regarding to the copper market is the availability of metal inventories when compared to copper consumption. Currently there are about eight days of consumption copper by copper inventories at the major LME and COMEX warehouses of London, Shanghai and the USA. This period it was 32 days, four times higher in the 2001, 2002, lower price cycle. We believe that when demand recovers, supply will underperform, and it did in recent years, given support to prices over $2 in fourth quarter of '09 and 2010.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper's second quarter '09 mine copper production was 119,000 tons, 2% higher than the second quarter of 2008. It is important to note that Southern Copper operating units have increased their production in the second quarter 2009. La Caridad and IMMSA copper production increased by 9% and 5% respectively. The Peruvian operations of Cuajone and Toquepala increased Copper production by 3%, as smelting production was 2% higher this quarter than in the second quarter 2008. It is worth mentioning that during the second quarter 2009, the Ilo smelter copper concentrate throughput was 298,000 tons, the highest smelted production obtained in a quarter. This was achieved because in June 2009, the concentrate throughput reached a monthly record of 114,375 tons.</p>
          <p>At this point we are changing our guidance for 2009 to 490,000 tons of copper sold in 2009. Molybdenum prices averaged $9.10 per pound for the second quarter 2009, 72% lower than the second quarter 2008 and 4% higher than the first quarter 2009. Molybdenum production was 4,400 tons in the second quarter '09 compared with 3,900 tons in the comparable 2008 period. The increase of 13% was due to higher ore grade and recovery at Caridad mine, whose production increased by 44% and higher recovery at Cuajone mine where production increased by 8%. The company maintains its productions and sales guidance of 18,000 tons for 2009.</p>
          <p>Regarding zinc second quarter '09, the LME price averaged $0.67 per pound, 30% lower than the second quarter 2008, but 26% higher than the first quarter 2009. Zinc mine production remained stable in the second quarter '09, refined zinc production increased by 6% to 25,900 tons compared with 24,500 tons in the second quarter 2008. The refined production increase was the result of the improved performance of the San Luis Potosi zinc refinery. The company is increasing its 2009 estimated sales for Zinc to 105,000 tons.</p>
          <p>Silver COMEX prices in the second quarter 2009 averaged $13.75 per ounce, 20% lower than the second quarter '08 but 9% higher than the first quarter '09. Silver mine production in the second quarter '09 increased 9% to 3.4 million ounces compared with the second quarter of 2008. Refined silver production for the second quarter '09 was 3.5 million ounces, 33% higher than in the second quarter 2008 due to the better performance of the La Caridad and IMMSA refineries.</p>
          <p>The company is maintaining its guidance for silver sales of 17 million ounces for this year. Net sales for the second quarter were $825 million compared to the $1,462 million for the second quarter 2008 and $622 million for the first quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Copper sales volume increased by 7% when compared second quarter '09 with its 2008 equivalent. Molybdenum sales volume increased by 13% compared to its second quarter '08 level and by 10% when compared to the first quarter 2009. Silver and Zinc volume sold increased by 26% and 2% respectively when compared to second quarter 2008 volumes.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter of 2009, we have had no material related to provisional price to sales --no material adjustments related to provisional price to sales. Total operating cost and expenses for the second quarter 2009 was $521 million, this figure compares favorably with the $669 million in the second quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>The cost reduction of $148 million between this quarter and the second quarter 2008 includes fuel cost reduction of $11 million, $44 million reduction in electric power cost carried, lower labor cost of $7 million, worker participation decreased by $58 million, mining royalties decreased by $7 million, selling and administrative and exploration cost decreases by $13 million and depreciation as well as other costs and expenses reduction explain the remaining difference. As a result of the mentioned sales and operating cost balances, the second quarter 2009 EBITDA was $380 million or 46% of sales. This figure compares with a 225 million in the first quarter of '09, the company second quarter '09 cash cost per pound of copper produced before by-product credits was $1.50 per pound, $0.35 lower than the $1.85 per pound for the same period of 2008. Southern Copper operating cash cost including the benefit of by-product credits was $0.51 per pound in the second quarter of 2009, $0.13 lower than the $0.64 registered at the first quarter 2009, a 20% reduction.</p>
          <p>The very competitive cash cost achieved during the second quarter 2009 is the result of higher by-product credits, higher volumes of by-products sold due to the operational efficiencies explain $0.04 of those $0.13 cost reduction. And better metal prices account for the remaining $0.09. The net earnings in the second quarter 2009 were $175 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.21 compared with a $548 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.62 in the second quarter 2008. Southern Copper's capital expending programs have continued in the second quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>The company is currently using internal funds for capital expenditure, and carefully monitoring the use of resources to preserve cash. The Tia Maria project, which includes the Tia Maria and the La Tapada deposits in the Peruvian region of Arequipa is expected to produce 120,000 tons of SX-EW copper cathodes per year. The approved budget for the project is 934 million, through June 30th 2009, 187.2 million have been spent on this project. The basic engineering work has been completed, current work on the project include the development of the detailed engineering, the commencement of fabrication of the main equipment and the environmental impact assessment, which was completed in June 2009 and presented to the Peruvian authorities for approval. As of June 30, 2009, the company has expended $72.8 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion.</p>
          <p>Detailed engineering works are scheduled to start in the third quarter of this year and the environmental impact study is currently being conducted and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>
          <p>Other capital project is the by-product treatment plant at La Caridad metallurgical complex. This project is at 85% completion and it has been spent 13.4 million. The first stage of the project is in operation and the total completion of this facility is planned for September 2009.</p>
          <p>The lime plant at Agua Prieta, which is 100 kilometers north of La Caridad, has been fully modernized to comply with environmental regulations and to meet the lime requirements of the Mexican operations. The new furnace will reduce the consumption of natural gas to a third of its current level and cost will be reduced by 45%. The operation is scheduled to a start-off in August 2009, with a total investment of $20.8 million.</p>
          <p>The El Arco project, a world-class copper deposit in the north part of the Baja California peninsula with estimated resources of over 1.3 billion tons of mineral. This project is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. Based on the approval of the Board of Directors, the company has contracted the basic engineering and is proceeding with the environmental study and land acquisition for this project.</p>
          <p>In respect of Cananea strike, on April 14, 2009, the Mexican Federal Labor Court issued a resolution, based on a force majeure, approving the termination of Cananea's labor relationships with individuals and unionized employees, as well as the termination of its collective bargaining agreement with its employees and with the National Mining and Metal Workers Union. This ruling has been challenged before federal tribunals and it is expected that it will be resolved during the month of August. The company, the state of Sonora and the Mexican federal government are working together to restore the necessary legal and safety conditions to resume operations at Cananea.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividend, I would like to state again that it is the company's policy to review at each Board meeting; the capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order determine the appropriate quarterly dividend.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, on July 15, 2009, our Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $0.10 per share, approximately 50% of earnings per share. The dividend will be paid on September 2, 2009 to shareholders of record as of August 6, 2009.</p>
          <p>And thank you very much ladies and gentlemen. And now we would like to open the forum for questions. Thank you.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain from Deutsche. Your line is open.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen. It's Jorge Beristain from Deutsche Bank. I just had a question related to your molybdenum output; we've seen quite a nice rally in moly prices lately. And I just wanted to understand in speaking with other producers, they've said, that they have the ability to flex up their operations and get a little bit more moly out in the second half. And I was wondering if you would also see a supply response from your company to the improvement in moly prices.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Jorge, good morning. This is Ra&#xFA;l Jacob. We are not increasing our molybdenum production. We are holding to the guidance that we have made. In general terms, we never reduce our plans when low prices came in. We're seeing a better market for molybdenum for the coming months. But basically, we are sticking to our initial plan. And as you know, our goal is to produce 18,000 tons of molybdenum for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then, you do comment on this in your press release, but we're still in a waiting pattern then to see the response of the appeal to the Mexican labor panel regarding the Cananea strike. Is there any further color you could give us on when do you expected a date of a ruling is there in August?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jorge, good morning. I will pass this to our counselor Armando Ortega. Probably he &#x2013; well I'm sure that he can elaborate a little bit more in respect to Cananea and in respect to these legal procedures.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. As this has been stated, this decision by this Mexican Federal Labor Court has been challenged both by individual workers and by the union as an entity before different federal tribunals. When we put in our press release the August month, it is just an expectation. I mean, as you know this is up to the tribunals themselves, and it is our best estimation it would happen and it could be later. This is what I would say an informed estimation and we consider that the main ruling will come from a so-called collegiate tribunal which is handling the challenge by the union itself.</p>
          <p>And legally speaking, once this is solved it will give direction to the rest of the challenges because as I would say the substantive of the main litigation. So this is right now what we can share with you and we are expecting the tribunals to perform their duties. We consider that the basis upon which these Mexican Federal Labor Court rendered its ruling is pretty sound, and we are confident that we will prevail.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Welcome.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Gloria (sic) [Victoria] Santaella from Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Victoria Santaella from Santander. Good morning, gentlemen. I have two questions, the first one is if you can give us some indication of how is demand from the North American market, which I understand is your largest one including Mexico and the U.S.?</p>
          <p>And the second one is, if you can talk a little bit about inventories, unlike other mining companies where we've seen inventories coming down significantly, I see yours being maintained basically at the same level from last year. So if you can give us some idea on that? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Victoria, regarding the North American market, we're seeing very slow recovery. Please keep in mind that the American market has been very slow in corporate consumption since 2006 when the housing bubble start to burst. So we're basically seeing a very slow market there but recovering somehow.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So you don't see it declining even further. You don't see a strong recovery, but you don't see it collapsing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Perfect.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, maybe some other producers are having a higher &#x2013; more trouble than us to sell their copper, but that is not the case for us. And you asked a question regarding inventories as...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, basically we try to sell as much as we can each quarter and each month, of course. Usually we ship the very last day of production at the end of the quarter. So that's why we have a very stable inventories in copper. And we have reduced our copper in process by about 10% in the last few months, and that's something that is helping us as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone. I have a simple question. With the current prices of copper, and also given that Cananea is still closed, do you plan on pushing your CapEx program anticipating some or &#x2013; can you just give an overall <mark type="inaudible" /> what you expect, how do you see changes on your CapEx plan in the medium &#x2013; short, medium term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Rodolfo, good morning. Well, actually we are not changing our plans for capital expenditure program. As we mentioned, our ongoing project is at Tia Maria and Toquepala, and we are analyzing and we are taking some steps in relation with other projects that I already mentioned during my presentation.</p>
          <p>And for Tia Maria, we have $363 million committed with the suppliers for this project, and we have spent $187 million since the beginning of the project. And again, we are trying to handle this capital expenditure program very carefully in order to try to preserve cash and continue with the project with enough resources to complete the project in the dates that we are planning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, Rodrigo. For the year 2009 we are increasing our guidance from 470,000 tons to 490,000 tons. For zinc, we are also increasing our guidance from 101,000 tons to 105,000 tons.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to ask a question about the Asarco settlement. Asarco said it's unlikely to keep between stated Southern Copper shares and has contacted a number of bidders, and I am wondering if you have any role in this process? Also they talked about bringing in either a hedge fund or a private equity firm to buy up those shares? I'm wondering what kind of impact that could have on your operations?</p>

          <p>I will talk of course on behalf of Southern Copper. For Southern Copper, any settlement related to Asarco, it has no bearing, it has no impact, at least no direct impact. So I don't think we have any opinion nor any comment going forward.</p>

          <p>On Cananea, if you guys achieve a successful decision with the labor unions, how long do you think it would take you to bring up production in that mine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we expect it to be between three and six months, and Cananea full production will be at about 180,000 tons per year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This would happen gradually because some sections of the production are ready to start. I'm talking specifically about a <mark type="inaudible" /> plant. That would take us a very short-term in order to start off the production. The other areas would take a little bit more longer, but answering your questions as Ra&#xFA;l was mentioning, to reach full capacity, that would be the estimates of that we have as of today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. And you guys' bond ratings are currently on a low triple B. Do you see any impact if you were to fall to low investment grade, and do you remain committed to investment grade ratings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. No, we are not seeing any downgrading from the agencies. We are operating in a regular basis. We have not changed our capital structure, then we are not expecting any change.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there are negative watch at both Moody's and S&amp;Ps. Are you guys in communication with them, and based upon --?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the negative watch is more in relationship with Asarcomar, but well as Armando mentioned, we are not seeing or we are not expecting any impact in Southern Copper Corporation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess just to try to clarify from Southern Copper's point of view, I mean what we're seeing is that &#x2013; I mean, the rating agencies are seeing is that there might be needed more debt in order to service what happens at the Asarco bankruptcy proceeding or the grounds of litigation. I mean from Southern Copper Corporation, I mean we feel the gap restructuring is very adequate. And that until something materializes, this litigation there will be absolutely no input, and we are not in a position to take in more debt.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Thank you for taking my call. Just a quick follow-up question on Cananea. Do you have an estimate on the amount of any physical damage at the mine? And also any estimate of the total one-time costs to repair the mine and get it back up to full capacity? Thank you. Hello?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Alex, it's about $50 million. It's about $50 million, but we are going to be sure of that number until we get the facilities, and we evaluate how or what is the damage that at the mine or the facilities or the equipment has offered. That is our estimate of $50 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Just following on the Cananea questions. If the solution was either positive or negative, one of those hopefully can that be appealed? That was my first question.</p>
          <p>And my second question regarding the projects, if you can tell us what the thinking is on the company regarding Los Chancas and the Cuajone expansion, and whether or not El Arco is taking priority over those projects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. With regard to the Cananea question, I mean, you never know with the federal tribunals, but in principle if our legalities didn't works, that ruling, in particular the ruling derived from the challenge put forward by the union should be a definitive ruling. It could happen that rather than entering to resolve the substantive challenge, the court could, for example find procedural or formal violations during the process. It'd be little awkward, but it could happen, then rather than having or accounting with a definitive ruling, then these courts would give back the file to the Mexican Federal Labor Court, and order it to purge to correct some of these formal violations. But this is in a scenario that this in my basic opinions, in the company's opinion is in a likely scenario.</p>
          <p>We are confident that this federal tribunal would render a definitive ruling. And once it renders this definitive ruling, the rest of the challenges will be <mark type="inaudible" /> should be solved in accordance with this decision.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now about the projects of Los Chancas and Cuajone. In the Chancas, we are starting in the fourth quarter, the <mark type="inaudible" /> in order to proceed with that project. And if everything works fine, we'll be ready by the end of 2013, like we mentioned some times before. And about Cuajone, we are increasing the cutting grades from 0.4 to 0.5 in order to maintain the production <mark type="inaudible" /> we will do the expansion to 105,000 like we mentioned before. That is the status of the two projects like you asked.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. And just one final question on the cash cost. The cash cost this quarter before byproduct were actually higher than the previous quarter, <mark type="inaudible" />. Can you comment on that, and what's your expectation for the next couple of quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the first quarter of '09 cash cost was $1.40, and the second quarter '09 was $1.50. That is, as a result of the &#x2013; well first, we have a negative effect for conversion between peso and dollars. The peso revaluates and we have a conversion effect.</p>
          <p>The other is the cost of metals that we are purchasing. The price is increased, but it's another item. And I will say that more volume is producing a little bit of more cost. That was the main reasons. And &#x2013; but as always we are working in order to try to reduce cost, and we are expecting that the next quarter we will be regularized.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you mean regularized, is that $1.50 or $1.40?</p>

          <p>Good morning. Several of my questions have already been answered. One final one, could you just refresh us on your expected timing of the Tia Maria project, and when would be the earliest and perhaps the range of when this would be completed?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Tia Maria, we are expecting by the middle of 2011, mainly because we are still waiting for the delivery of the power by the government with the 500 megawatts line that they had constructed from the center part of the country to the south, where we are established. And that is the main reason, and the revision that within our budget in order to see that the cost will be maintained or reduced with the engineering firms. That is the reason, and we expected to have production at the middle of 2011, if everything works fine.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it is under construction, and these are on a scale to &#x2013; we finish in the first quarter of 2011.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if that would be delayed, your project would be delayed then by the same amount of time?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we plan it to be ready by the same first quarter of 2011. As soon we have the power we will test all the equipments and then we will start the production by the middle of the year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, well, the cash position have been lower as you were saying. And this is basically as a result of our capital investments. And we have been paying a substantial amount of dividends. And probably you remember that we exercise, repurchase &#x2013; share repurchase program during the last part of 2008, first part of this year. And that is basically the reason that the cash position has been reduced.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a quick question on the working capital cash needs for the first six months of this year. The increase in cash outflow, working capital cash outflow is due to the increase of copper prices assuming that your inventories are more or less unchanged or something else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, basically as you pointed out, having higher copper prices made us to have a higher accounts receivable, and that as you know increased the working capital. That's one of the reasons. Armando will get you some more detail for this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. We're trying to find some numbers. So, Nick.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that's basically the main reason for incremental in working capital. The other one is that you saw that we end the year with some payments like taxes and workers participation that are due on the first part of the year. And that also reduce our liabilities somehow. And that also is the source of capital, working capital.</p>
