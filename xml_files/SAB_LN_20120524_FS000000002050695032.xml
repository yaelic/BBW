      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, everyone. Welcome to SABMiller's results presentation for our financial year ended 31st of March, 2012. With me today is Jamie Wilson, our CFO; and Alan Clark; our Chief Operating Officer.</p>
          <p>First, the formalities; as usual, our presentation will contain forward-looking statements which reflect the current best judgment of management that include risks and uncertainties. The company disclaims any obligation to update these statements outside of our normal reporting and seminar routines.</p>
          <p>Okay. So getting started, the group's delivered a strong financial performance, thus the EPS up 12% and underlying EBITA up 8%, which was supported by good volume growth amidst market conditions which were mixed, focused price increases, further premiumization, and production efficiencies. We capitalized on economic growth in developing markets through initiatives to move our portfolio more towards the premium end and also to enhance the affordability of the selected brands. Improvements in distribution and in commercial execution also helped to bolster volumes and mix. Latin America and Africa were undoubtedly the stars of the year, but Asia and particularly South Africa also delivered very creditable performances.</p>
          <p>Conditions in Europe and North America have been more difficult, with weak consumer sentiment. And Europe has been particularly tough; lower volumes, increasing raw material costs and consumers trading down into the economy segment. In the U.S., despite pressure on volume MillerCoors has been able to increase prices and continued to improve its mix through the growth of Tenth and Blake, while further reducing costs.</p>
          <p>We've undertaken several transactions during the year, which have enhanced our global spread of businesses. We completed the acquisition of Foster's, which provides us the exposure to Australia's growth prospects and its profitable beer industry. In March, we completed our strategic alliance with Anadolu Efes, contributing our Russian and Ukrainian beer businesses in exchange for a 24% equity stake in the enlarged group. Also strengthened our strategic alliance with Castel and the operational management of the businesses in Angola and Nigeria.</p>
          <p>We've seen further progress in our business capability program, particularly in the area of procurement. Net operating benefits again exceeded our expectations, reaching $159 million during the year. Significant contributions came from our global procurement organization from European manufacturing and commercial systems in Latin America. We are raising our estimate of the likely total benefits of the program. There'll be more from Jamie on this in a moment.</p>
          <p>And I'll now hand you over to Jamie to take you through the financial review of our results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and good day to everyone. The significant transactions made during the year impact many of our reported numbers. My presentation will therefore focus on results on an organic constant currency basis, as this reflects our underlying performance and profitability before foreign exchange translation impacts and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.</p>
          <p>First off, the headline reported figures, starting with an adjusted earnings per share. The group has delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth in all of our major currencies in the year. Adjusted earnings per share in our reporting currency of U.S. dollars was up 12%. The final dividend, therefore, is $0.695 per share, which brings the annual dividend to $0.91 per share, an increase of 12% over the prior year.</p>
          <p>We have delivered a strong financial performance this year, despite varied trading conditions across our markets. Lager volumes increased 3% on an organic basis versus the prior year, driven by strong growth in Latin America and Africa and good, profitable growth in our Asia Pacific and South African markets.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Poland and Romania were impacted by volume declines and adverse sales mix as a result of consumer down trading, while the industry in North America continued to see pressure on consumer spending. A 7% increase in soft drink volumes, particularly driven by Africa and Latin America, contributed to the strong overall total volume growth of 4% on an organic basis. Organic constant currency group revenue grew by 7.5%, driven by higher volumes, selective price increases, and favorable mix in all regions, other than Europe. Full year organic constant currency EBITDA growth of 8% reflect good top line revenue growth, with all beverage divisions except Europe contributing to EBITA growth. Full year EBITA margin was in line with prior year on an organic constant currency basis.</p>
          <p>This year was a year of significant progress in building on our global business portfolio. On the 16 of December 2011, we completed the acquisition of Foster's Group Limited in Australia. The remaining 50% of Pacific Beverages was acquired on the 13 of January 2012 from Coca-Cola Amatil, and Pacific Beverages was integrated into Foster's operations on that date. 100% of Foster's results have been included as a subsidiary from the date of completion, with Foster's included within the renamed Asia Pacific division. We expect to sell some of the acquired non-core businesses from the original Foster's Group.</p>
          <p>On the 6 of March 2012, we completed our strategic alliance with Anadolu Efes. Our Russian and Ukrainian beer businesses were exchanged for a 24% equity stake in the enlarged Anadolu Efes Group. 24% of Anadolu Efes' results have been included from the 6 of March, and treated as an associate. Anadolu Efes is included within the Europe region.</p>
          <p>With effect from the 1 of January 2012, aspects of our African operations have been reorganized. Operational management of the group and the Castel's businesses in Nigeria and Angola was combined, with the Nigerian business being run by SABMilller and the Angolan business by Castel.</p>
          <p>For accounting purposes, we have recorded the disposal of the Angolan operations in exchange for a 27.5% interest in the holding company for our combined Angolan businesses, and the acquisition of Castel's Nigeria business in exchange for Castel's participation in our Nigerian holdings.</p>
          <p>All the transactions during the year include the purchase of additional shares in our subsidiary in Tanzania and our associates in Zimbabwe, along with the sale of our investment in Kenya Breweries, the disposal of our Italian distribution business and various brewery acquisitions in China through our associate, CR Snow.</p>
          <p>Organic revenue growth of 7.5% was driven almost equally by volume, price and mix benefits, reflecting firm pricing in South Africa, North America, Africa and Asia Pacific, together with strong developing markets volume growth. Our local premium brands continue to perform well and have improved our sales mix in the year.</p>
          <p>The favorable currency benefits in the first half of the year reversed over the second half, following a weakening of the South African rand against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the full year reported group revenue was not significantly impacted by currency moves.</p>
          <p>Group revenue per hectoliter grew 4% on an organic constant currency basis and all regions achieved revenue per hectoliter of growth over the full year. Whilst we continue our strategy of <mark type="ph" /> price strength in (9:34) a number of our markets, Latin America benefited from selected price increases and continued growth of the premium segment, while in Europe, the improvement in the revenue per hectoliter it was achieved through selected price increases, despite adverse sales mix and pressure on pricing in Poland and Romania in particular.</p>
          <p>In North America, MillerCoors benefited from a firm second half pricing and favorable brand mix, including double-digit growth of the Tenth and Blake division. Africa grew group revenue per hectoliter 5% overall, with pricing and mix benefits. Asia Pacific saw a significant organic increase in group revenue per hectoliter versus the prior year across the region, due to price increases implemented late in the previous financial year and positive brand mix. And then, South Africa benefited from the strength of local premium brands, in particular, Castle Lite, together with price increases.</p>
          <p>We delivered EBITA growth of 8% on organic constant currency basis, largely aided by the volume and revenue benefits previously mentioned. Cost of goods sold rose in low single-digits due to higher brewing and fuel costs. Marketing investments continued to increase to support the development of our brand portfolio, but with the rate of marketing investments as a percentage of revenue overall in line with the prior year.</p>
          <p>In real term, fixed costs on the constant currency per hectoliter basis were in line with the prior year despite increased local brewing and distribution footprint in Africa and further investments in sales, marketing, systems capabilities across our operations and in the corporate center.</p>
          <p>On a reported basis, EBITA grew by 12% Foster's contributed to the reported results in the last quarter and the currency translation benefits during the first six months largely reversed in the second half, as the weakening of the South African and African currencies predominantly offset strengthening in other regions.</p>
          <p>In Latin America, volume growth and favorable mix together with improved manufacturing efficiencies, distribution advancements and ongoing fixed cost productivity led EBITA margin improvement, despite rising commodity costs. U.S.A. margin, North America benefited from pricing and favorable brand mix, together with successful completion of the synergy and cost-saving programs. Africa's strong volume growth translated into healthy EBITA growth, the margin was flat due to ramping up of our capacity in several markets. The expansion of sales and marketing capability supported medium term growth, inflation, and weaker local currencies.</p>
          <p>Our input costs, wages, and indirect taxes continued to rise significantly. Asia Pacific's EBITA margin improved thanks to robust pricing and positive mix in China and India. South African beverages benefited from pricing and positive mix, with the impact of rising raw material costs offset by supply chain productivity. Fixed costs efficiencies were reinvested in sales and marketing.</p>
          <p>Reduced margins in Europe were due to lower volumes, increased raw material costs and adverse sales mix, particularly in Poland and Romania. Cost efficiency was helped by regional manufacturing and global procurement, and most other countries in Europe held or improved margins. On an organic basis, margins overall were flat, with Europe's decline offset by broad-based improvement elsewhere.</p>
          <p>As anticipated, full year costs in terms of input costs and costs of sales per hectoliter increased on last year in low single digits. Cost rose across most of the regions, driven by higher brewing material costs, including malt, barley, and sugar and increased energy prices, which impacted packaging material and distribution. These increases have been partially offset by savings achieved through our global procurement program.</p>
          <p>As noted previously, our global procurement initiative currency has made significant progress in the area of brewing raw materials and parts of packaging. Overall, 60% of raw materials and packaging of our subsidiaries was being managed by Trinity by the end of the year, and this share is continuing to rise.</p>
          <p>We see further opportunities from leveraging expertise, and spreading existing best practice in these categories, not just by reducing costs, but also by securing stable, long-term supply, and advancing our sustainability objectives through strategic approaches, for example, developing local programs in Africa and India.</p>
          <p>We've already extended into other categories, including some IT and freight procurement, started to cover marketing materials, and realized savings and procurement of fridges. We see significant further opportunities in these adjacent categories. In the year to March 2012, Trinity delivered net operating benefits of $100 million before costs.</p>
          <p>Our global ERP implementation continues. After the first deployment in South Africa and the corporate center of the back office component, we have now added middle and front office capabilities, and deployed this in Ecuador. This is complementary to the front office system development carried out in Peru and Colombia earlier in the program to support stronger extended distribution models. We have developed &#x2013; or <mark type="ph" /> we'll template (15:13) further to accommodate relevant go-to market scenarios and we'll deploy this first in Poland next year, a large business and quite sophisticated trade environment.</p>
          <p>We continue to make good progress with shared services. We have centralized our treasury operations for European countries and are extending the model to Africa. This has resulted in both financial and operational benefits. We're also optimizing the shared service to operations of finance.</p>
          <p>Without mentioning all the programs which are helping to leverage scale and transform SABMiller towards a truly global organization, I would like to mention that the centralization of the European manufacturing organization, which continues to result in significant efficiencies and financial benefits. We're considering how to apply the learning from this success in other regions.</p>
          <p>The business capability program exceptional cost of $235 million reflects some acceleration of the spend into the year, as we have pushed development of the global template to complete models for different go-to-market scenarios. The spend will be about roughly $140 million in the year to March 2013 and the program will be complete in the year to March 2014, as previously advised, with spend further reducing in that year.</p>
          <p>As we have seen, net operating benefits reached $159 million this year, well above the previous guidance of $100 million. Based on the success we have seen to date and the plans that are in place for global procurement in particular, we believe it's appropriate to raise guidance for the remainder of the program. We expect to deliver approximately $90 million of incremental operating benefits in the year to March 2013 and a further $150 million in the year to March 2014.</p>
          <p>This will take us up to a cumulative net operating benefit of $400 million in that year, compared to $300 million previously advised, and a run rate of approximately $450 million by the end of that year, March 2014, as we exit the program. These figures excludes $75 million of procurement benefits built into Foster's synergy target, which will be delivered largely through Trinity. Beyond the formal end of the program, we expect the financial and operational and strategic capabilities it will have delivered to continue to build over time and to become business as usual.</p>
          <p>Net exceptional credits of $1.037 billion before financing costs and tax were reported during the year. You'll find full disclosure in our preliminary statement. But the presentation for formal accounting purposes is somewhat complex, so I've summarized the main items in the chart. This reflects a large number of transactions, some of which created large non-cash gains under IFRS.</p>
          <p>In Europe, a profit of $1.195 billion arose in the disposal of our businesses in Russia and Ukraine in exchange for 24% of the interest in the enlarged Anadolu Efes Group. Costs of $109 million were incurred in relation to Foster's transaction, together with the integration cost of $26 million following the Foster's and Pacific Beverage acquisitions.</p>
          <p>A gain of $66 million was generated through the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in Pacific Beverages from Coca-Cola Amatil as a result of the re-measurement of our existing interest to fair value. In relation to the reorganization in Africa, a profit of $67 million arose on the combination of the operational management of our Angolan operations with the Angolan businesses of our associate, Castel. And our share of Castel's profit on disposal of its subsidiary in Nigeria amounted to around $23 million.</p>
          <p>Other transactions include the disposal of our investment in our associate in Kenya, resulting in a profit of $103 million, a $23 million profit on transactions of our associate, <mark type="ph" /> SilverSun (19:18), and the loss of $14 million in relation to the disposal of the distribution business in Italy.</p>
          <p>Our business capability program, exceptional costs in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific, South Africa <mark type="ph" /> by region (19:31) and corporate amounted to $235 million. $34 million of integration and restructuring costs related to various integration and restructuring projects in Latin America and the $35 million of exceptional charge related to our share of impairment of the Sparks brand in the MillerCoors are also recorded in the table.</p>
          <p>Adjusted EBITDA through pricing EBITDA before cash flows from exceptional items together with dividend received from MillerCoors increased 10% on the prior year as a result of increased operational profit and higher dividend from MillerCoors.</p>
          <p>We have generated further working capital inflows over the year, building on the significant improvements in working capital achieved over the last two years, largely through better management of payables and renegotiation of terms with suppliers.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure was $324 million higher than last year, following continued investment to support growth in Africa, where we have experienced capacity constraints, and in Latin America. Free cash flow continued to improve, up $560 million versus the prior year, primarily due to higher EBITDA, partially offset by capital expenditure increases.</p>
          <p>Adjusted net finance costs increased 5% to $542 million following the increase in borrowings related to the Foster's transaction. The group's effective tax rate of 27.5% was 70 basis points lower than the prior year reflecting a number of small opportunities realized through the year, together with some beneficial effect of the Foster's transaction.</p>
          <p>Our net debt position has increased due to the acquisition of Foster's, in part, mitigated by the continuing strong free cash flows generated by the group. As a result, gearing has increased to 68.7% and net debt to adjusted EBITDA to 2.9 times. We intend that the net debt to adjusted EBITDA will return to its target range of 2 to 2.5 times within the next two years, in line with our stated financial policy.</p>
          <p>Following the acquisition of Foster's, both Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's reaffirmed our credit rating and the outlook at BBB+/Baa1 respectively with a stable outlook. The weighted average interest rate and gross debt as at the 31st of March was 4.9%, down from 5.9% as at March 2011. This was primarily driven by the cost of an effective financing package put in place to fund the Foster's acquisition, including our $7 billion bond issue in January, which was issued at an average coupon of just under 3.4%. The majority of our debt continues to be held in floating rates, benefiting from low market rates.</p>
          <p>We continue to target a balanced net debt currency profile appropriate to the spread of our businesses. The proportion of total borrowings denominated in Australian dollars reflects this approach. We expect the proportion of U.S. dollar-denominated debt in our portfolio to reduce over the next two years as we repay borrowings and further re-denominate debt into a number of our operating currencies.</p>
          <p>Our maturity profile has been extended as a result of the very successful US$7 billion bond issue in the U.S. market in January 2012. As a result, after offsetting cash against our short-term maturities, almost 90% of our debt matures after two years. We have substantial headroom available to refinance more than the amount of maturing debt falling due over the next two years from cash resources and undrawn committed facilities. Our access to committed liquidity remains extremely strong, with committed headroom available to the group as at 31st of March 2012 increased to $3.8 billion.</p>
          <p>Moving to our financial outlook, we expect continued growth in most of our developing markets, with modest improvements in some of our more mature economies, further uncertainty in Europe, given the developments in the Eurozone, which we'll continue to monitor closely.</p>
          <p>Opportunities for selective price increases and favorable mix benefits are anticipated across most regions, as we continue to develop and differentiate our brand portfolios. Raw material costs are expected to increase mid-single digits on a per hectoliter basis, mainly driven by increases across a number of brewing raw materials.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure for the full year is anticipated to amount to approximately $1.6 billion, with new breweries currently being constructed in Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia. And finally, we see a potential to keep our effective tax rate near the level achieved in the year to March 2012, in part, reflecting the impact of the Foster's transaction. However, we recognize the potential for a little more volatility looking forward. The ETR is expected to fall within the range of 27% to 29% for the next year and in the medium term.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jamie. Now, turning to review of our divisional businesses. Firstly, Latin America, where we delivered an excellent performance, with robust volume growth in both lager and soft drinks. We've extended the brand and pack ranges in our portfolios, supporting premiumization, expanding beer's presence into more occasions and improving the affordability of certain key brands.</p>
          <p>Our successful premium line extensions, Club Colombia Negra and Roja, are shown here. These have reinvigorated the Club Colombia brand franchise and the broader premium segment. Our larger mainstream bottle is also shown on the slide, which promotes a sharing culture and addresses on-premise affordability, as well as home consumption opportunities.</p>
          <p>Our non-alcoholic malt brands have grown by 16%, following the introduction of a smaller pack for Pony Malta. We've also rolled out additional malt brands, Maltizz in Colombia and ActiMalta in Honduras and El Salvador, all shown on the slide. Revenue increased 10%, driven by these volumes as well as selective price increases and favorable mix development within the portfolio. Our premium and upper mainstream volumes grew by a point to 27% of total lager.</p>
          <p>Higher commodity costs were mitigated by efficiencies, while increased brand investment was funded by ongoing fixed cost productivity. As a result, EBITDA growth was very strong at 14%. And margins continued to rise, up 70 basis points on an organic basis. And Miller Coors continued to achieve strong revenue and cost management, offsetting volume reduction, to grow profits and margins. Premium lights continue to be pressured by economic weakness amongst key beer drinkers and by narrower price gaps versus key import brands, which have become more mainstream in their price and their positioning.</p>
          <p>Premium lights recovery remains important to sustainable cash flow growth for the industry and remained a sharp focus for MillerCoors. There was improvement in the last quarter, with Coors Light back in growth.</p>
          <p>We're optimistic about improvement in Miller Light following the launch last month of the new Miller Time advertising and brand positioning, and new can packages. MillerCoors investment in retail execution capability continues to increase, and it increased its share of category captainships from 24% to 35% of key account volumes over the last three years.</p>
          <p>The craft and import portfolio at Tenth and Blake continued its double-digit growth, driven by Leinenkugel's, particularly the very successful Summer Shandy seasonal, and by Blue Moon. Peroni Nastro Azzurro grew in the high single digits, primarily in on-premise. MillerCoors has brought a strong innovation pipeline for fiscal 2013, with new packaging for key brands, the acquisition of Crispin Cider, <mark type="ph" /> San Stefanis (28:54) from Europe, more craft seasonals, Batch 19, Redd's, Cocoa Brovaz, and more.</p>
          <p>In Europe, whilst there were tentative signs of a slow economic recovery earlier in the year, we are now faced with increased economic uncertainty once more. Pressure on beer industry segment mix and profitably continued. Competitive orientation towards the off-trade and the economy segment, coupled with subdued consumer sentiment, has resulted in lower average pricing.</p>
          <p>In this environment, we've chosen to adjust our price points selectively, but we are primarily focused on brand building, on premiumization, and innovation to broaden and increase the perceived value of the category to consumers.</p>
          <p>Current innovations in the Czech Republic, for example, include the premium Phoenix wheat beer, Gambrinus, a Radler variance and new Frisco variance, all shown on the slide. We've built high value positions in some of our small markets, where we've achieved significant profit growth notwithstanding the economic downturn and uncertainty. And our supply-side initiatives, as you heard from Jamie, such as regional manufacturing and in-country productivity improvement, are continuing to deliver cost savings.</p>
          <p>In South Africa, our sustained brand investment improving retail execution and leading customer service have driven a return to growth of the beer category. Our lager volumes were up 2% and our market share in total now close to 90%.</p>
          <p>We've made significant share gains in the premium segment. Notable performances were from Castle Lite, which is the fastest growing and most popular premium brand in South Africa, and Castle Milk Stout, which has repositioned during the year and which gained share at a higher premium price. Revenue and cost management delivered strong EBITDA and margin growth and enabled further increased investment in consumer facing activities. Soft drink volumes were also up by 2% in the year. Productivity gains, supply chain and packaging improvements more than offset the effect of increasing commodity costs.</p>
          <p>Africa has now delivered eight consecutive quarters of double digit volume growth. This is being driven by many countries across the portfolio, including Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and by our associate, Castel. Portfolio enhancements, extended price ladders, wider distribution and increased in-trade investment are all allowing us to reach many more consumers.</p>
          <p>The Castle portfolio is leading the regional premium growth, as it successfully appeals to the growing middle class in Africa. Castle Lite is now in nine of our markets. In the more affordable segment, we very successfully launched Impala lager in Mozambique, which is the world's first clear beer made from local cassava. Margin growth has been softened by our stepped-up investment in future growth, as we work to alleviate capacity constraints in a number of markets.</p>
          <p>Then in Asia Pacific, our brewery operations in China continued to do well and have once again increased market share, although organic growth was impacted by heavy and prolonged rains that affected some of CR Snow's key provinces. CR Snow's 82 breweries surpassed an impressive milestone during the year and sold in excess of 100 million hectoliters in a year for the first time, while they maintained their market share lead versus the competition.</p>
          <p>Notably, group revenue per hectoliter in China increased by 13%, reflecting upper single-digit price increases in the prior year, positive brand mix and currency effects. This helped to mitigate the rising costs raw materials, of higher labor cost and the consumption taxes.</p>
          <p>India had a year of good profit growth. We've adopted a disciplined approach to targeting profitable growth opportunity at our brand and pack innovation and commercial capability development. In Australia, CUB's pro-forma lager volumes were 4% below the prior year, affecting continued subdued consumer sentiment and some incremental share loss. However, revenue per hectoliter benefited from focused revenue management and a renewed focus on value growth, following a recent period of lower price realization.</p>
          <p>Now, before I conclude, a reminder that our strategic priorities remain consistent and we continue to make good progress against each. The Foster's and Efes transactions have further built our balance and attractive global spread of businesses, now are more evenly distributed around the world. Our partnership with Efes will provide us with enhanced positions in Russia, Turkey, the CIS, and Central Asia; more on both these transactions in a minute. We continue to develop the strong relevant brand portfolios that win in the local market, for example, achieving market share gains in the South African premium segment, in Tanzania, and in Peru.</p>
          <p>We strive to constantly raise the profitability of local businesses sustainably. And this year, we improved our sales mix and margins, with a significant increase in the proportion of our volumes in the premium segment. Double-digit premium segment revenue growth, constant currency, and we'll continue to progress well against our 10 sustainable development priorities.</p>
          <p>We're leveraging our skills and the global scale. As Jamie and I have highlighted, we've seen further progress in our business capability program this year, particularly in the areas of procurement, European manufacturing, and the front-end systems in Latin America. Plus, as you heard from Jamie, our forecast benefits have been now lifted by some $150 million.</p>
          <p>With regard to our major recent transactions, the integration of Carlton United Breweries is progressing well. Some of the negative trends relating to the beer category in general and specific brands in particular have been clearly evident for many years, and they won't be reversed overnight. In our first 100 days of managing the business, we've clarified the detail of the cost synergies, and identified the commercial turnaround thrusts. Brand portfolio strategy evaluation is currently underway.</p>
          <p>As we presented to you in March, our medium-term outlook is for volume growth of between 1% and 3% per annum, with unit revenue growth ahead of inflation, supported by price promotional management and mix improvement. We expect healthy margin expansion before cost synergies of A$180 million, that's Australian dollars, by year four.</p>
          <p>Then, as previously mentioned, our strategic alliance with Efes was completed in March of this year. This offers an enhanced position in Russia, creates a strong number two player in value terms, with the leading position in Moscow and an increased national footprint for the combined portfolio.</p>
          <p>The combined businesses are expected to yield significant cost synergies of at least $120 million a year and provide additional revenue synergy opportunities as well. The transaction also extends our footprint to include a leading position in beer and soft drinks in Turkey, as well as exposure to beer industry growth across the CIS and Central Asia.</p>
          <p>And so, to conclude, the mixed trading conditions experienced in the first half continued through the remainder of the year. Developing market consumption continued to be buoyant. While there were signs of a muted economic recovery in the U.S., volatility has continued in Europe.</p>
          <p>Overall, we believe that our operating results are strong and resilient against this backdrop. Our organic growth strategies remain consistent, developing the beer category and our leading positions on the basis of local insights and local portfolios. CUB represents another exciting growth opportunity to deploy these capabilities. And Efes provides an excellent extension to our global footprint, our underlying financial position, as well as our medium-term outlook for growth in volume, revenue and profitability remained strong.</p>
          <p>And with that, operator, we'll be glad to take some questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Simon Hales from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of questions, if I can, please. Firstly, just a question around the margin outlook for 2013. You've highlighted in the presentation you had pretty favorable organic margin development, I think, through the year, especially perhaps in the second half in most of your divisions outside of Europe.</p>
          <p>It seems to me that with a relatively solid volume backdrop, again, across most of your geographic platform, especially in some of the higher value areas like South Africa and Latin America that we saw through the year, coupled with the higher BCP cost-saving targets you're now setting yourself, we should be expecting further positive margin development for the current year.</p>
          <p>But I note on some comments on the wires earlier that, I think, Jamie, you've been going towards a flattish margin. I'm just trying to sort of reconcile those two things. Is it the fact that we should expect further substantial margin drop in Europe, in your opinion, this year, coupled with higher input costs, which is holding back the margin leverage in fiscal 2013? And then just secondly, very briefly, I couldn't find it in the statement. It may be there. But have you disclosed anywhere what the actual revenue and EBIT contribution was for Foster's for the three months it was in the numbers? And if you haven't discussed it, could you give it to us, please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Simon, the guidance that you've mentioned, I'll ask Jamie to comment now. But, Simon, the guidance you've mentioned is indeed for flat to slightly up, slightly increased margins in the coming year. I wouldn't highlight, in particular, Europe in that outlook. I would highlight more the increased raw material costs and the rate of increase is rising.</p>
          <p>As you know, we guided &#x2013; we delivered or showed low single digit increases during the year that's just gone by and we're guiding to mid-single digits for the coming year. And in fact, there's quite a lot of variation from region to region within that. So it's recovery of those costs that really influenced the margin development more than anything else.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, any sort of differing split between half one and half two and the way we should think about those input costs actually feeding through, higher in the first half, lower in the second half or mid single digit generally for the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that's more or less it. And remember though that we have covered positions extending out for most of this year. And the &#x2013; we start to move -- moving into territory which is relatively more uncovered in the second half. And we have reason to hope for a better agricultural season certainly than we've had for the last little while. And if we do, in fact, see that in the northern hemisphere, then we would hope that pressure on agricultural commodities will come off a bit.</p>
          <p>But that is somewhat speculative, as you'll understand, because those crops are still in the ground right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the only other point to add on margin is just the fact that you saw that in Africa, our margins were slightly more in the first than the second half of the year, due to, I suppose, the nice problem of actually increased volumes which caused us with some capacity constraints, which will continue in the first half of the incoming year before the new capacity that we've invested in in Spain. And those capacity constraints involve you sometimes in moving beer further than you would ideally like to do it and indeed, sometimes moving across borders, which adds a little bit to the input costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's also the fact, I mean as Jamie said, we're adding capacity in Africa and you might expect a bit more operational leverage in Africa. But, of course, some of that capacity expansion is represented by entirely new greenfield breweries. And so there's both CapEx, in addition to the CapEx cost, there's also OpEx increments, because we're setting up new undertakings completely. So, while we have this relatively fragmented production footprint in Africa, which we think is commercially the right thing to do, the impact on margins is not as positive as you might think.</p>
          <p>On the Foster's, do you want to comment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, on Foster's, we haven't commented specifically, but I mean, Foster's will have added approximately $230 million into the results for the last quarter of the year or for the period from 16 December onwards.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Shackleton from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, morning, gentlemen. Two questions. You've given us more granularity on the cost-cutting side from BCP. Are you getting to a position where you can give us a little bit more guidance around the revenue benefits that could accrue from that? And when we're thinking about the Efes situation, the $120 million of synergies or at least $120 million, I think you said, Graham, what is the phasing of that coming through, through the P&amp;L?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We're not &#x2013; we haven't given guidance on the revenue benefit from the BCP. Well, first of all, they're very difficult to estimate, and secondly, the roll-out of the complete ERP system is a great deal nearer the beginning than the end. So, I'd rather get a few more of those implementations under our belt before we are confident about top line synergies from them. As I think you know, the initial release went into Ecuador. There's an updated Ecuador release going in later this year, and then the first very complex full release into Poland during the first half of next year. So I'd rather be a bit further down the track before we give any estimates on that.</p>
          <p>The phasing of Efes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Efes phasing, Ian, I mean we're looking at a limited amount coming through in coming year and then ramping up over the following two years, so the $120 million this year is the year three target for the synergies. So you're looking at sort of roughly $20-odd million in the incoming year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So $20 million, $50 million, $50 million that type of phasing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it will probably &#x2013; yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just to be clear, that is purely cost, though again, there was no revenue synergy included within that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that is the cost synergies. I mean, obviously, we would hope that the business, particularly in Russia, as a combined entity would have some additional revenue upside, but this is the cost number.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The next question was submitted via the website. And the question to Graham and Jamie is regarding South Africa. Following a significant EBITA margin increase in F2012 and the recent weakening of the South African rand versus the U.S. dollar. Does that mean a higher outlook for input cost inflation in South Africa in the year ahead? And would it be possible to further increase margin in that region, as <mark type="ph" /> Norman (47:23) has guided over the next couple of years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, the answer to the first part of the question is yes. South Africa had a favorable upturn on raw material costs last year because of a couple of factors, including currency. As you're aware, currency has moved against us there now, so we would expect the pressure on raw material input costs to rise in line with the pressure that we're seeing in the rest of the group, perhaps a bit higher. So I think that &#x2013; well, that will definitely place pressure on margins.</p>
          <p>As far as guidance for the next year is concerned, I would say that flat would be a good outcome, actually, in the light of what I've just said.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Just looking at Europe, it seems that the conditions there don't seem to be improving materially and maybe are deteriorating a bit. And is there any risk that we'll see a change in the margin structurally if your competitors continue to push the pricing strategy that they appear to be using in your key markets there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="ph" /> This (48:56), thanks. So, I think the &#x2013; yeah, there will certainly be pressure on overall margins for the industry as a whole. But I do think that it will come probably in two forms, in the sense of lesser margin pressure perhaps in western and northern Europe, where we are less represented.  But in fact, where there is a bit more price taking and consumers have more disposable income so that brewers are able to take some price. In central and eastern Europe, I think where there's far more competition at the economy end and the value end of the industry, and therefore, margins will be under pressure in those markets.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you see this as a multi-year problem? Is this something that could go on for two or three years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I do think so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it has already &#x2013; I should just point out that there has already been a fairly substantial rebasing down of some of those value approvals in central and eastern Europe over the last couple of years. So we're not starting a journey here.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Morning, a couple of things. Firstly, on Africa, looks like your price and mix &#x2013; at least what came through in the difference in organic volume and organic revenue &#x2013; slowed  down a fair bit in the second half, like about 8% for the first half and then more like 4% in the second. I'm wondering if there's any particular factors which have driven that geographic mix or activity in a particular market?</p>
          <p>And then just on the group tax rates, I think you mentioned, Jamie, that the rate could be a bit more volatile going forward. I'm wondering what's causing that? And I think before today, I might have got the wrong end of the stick, but I was also expecting Foster's to bring the group tax rate down a little bit more. Maybe it sounds like that's not going to happen now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Africa, the &#x2013; I suppose the things I'd point to are, first of all, the volatility of demand and growth between the different countries, which, of course, affects the overall mix that you see. But the major underlying cause of what you talk about is capacity constraints, because we are now effectively out of capacity in a number of those countries and we're adding new capacity.</p>
          <p>As Jamie was explaining a little bit earlier, that has had a depressing effect on margins, as we've had to move product around the country to meet demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And raise costs. So, most of what you're talking about in Africa has been caused by capacity constraints and then new capacity provision coming in.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, and let me ask Jamie to talk about the group tax rate.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, when I said that it's slightly more volatile, the reason I said that is in the past we've given very narrow tax guidance of effectively 1% and we feel that it's more appropriate to widen that to 2% band within which we will fluctuate. So, I don't think it's really going to &#x2013; the tax rate is going to become very volatile. It just means that we believe that giving you 2% range is a more appropriate than a 1% range.</p>
          <p>In terms of your specific point on Foster's, you've got to remember that Foster's was only in the numbers for effectively just 3.5 months, so the beneficial effects of any &#x2013; of the way that that was acquired is not really impacted for the whole year. But having said that, we did get some additional benefits which won't be repeated in the current year, particularly as we've been quite successful in a number of our tax cases in Russia and we've got some pull-through of those benefits into our tax rate before that company left the group. So, I think what you've seen is 70 basis point drop from last year, partly positive, partly some one-offs that came in this year. We would expect that rate to be sustainable into the next year, both by the fact that Foster's will deliver more and perhaps the other one will be less.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So Foster's is delivering benefits, but that's offset by some other things which helped you this year. I see.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning. I have a question again on the margin guidance. When you mentioned that margin should be slightly, slightly up next year, does that &#x2013; I suppose that's a comment on organic margin development as opposed to on a reported basis, which should be benefiting from Foster's, obviously, as a positive margin mix. Any comment on that will be helpful?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to return into Europe, if I can. I know that you've covered some of this in previous answers. But if I look at your commentary, you say that you saw generally stronger financial performance in the region if you strip out Poland and Romania. And yet, if you look at the sort of margin progression H1, it was down 60 basis points; for the full year, it was down 110 basis points.</p>
          <p>Wonder if you can help with some of the moving parts there, what's happening really in underlying terms there? And looking forwards, is there some possibility that you will need to change your medium-term guidance in Europe, which from memory, is volume up 2% to 4% per year with margins up 30 basis points to 50 basis points? Listening to your answers so far, that would look very optimistic for over the next two to three-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think first of all, just to make a point that the medium-term guidance that we give, it's now almost two years ago that we have given that, and obviously, a lot has changed since then. I think broadly, just to say that if you looked at the pattern of Europe, that we were operating pre-Efes in 12 markets in Europe. In seven of those, which are more skewed towards Western Europe, we had a very good profit growth actually. Czech is flat, Canaries and Hungary sort of more reasonable or more solid, and then our two real problems were in Poland and Romania.</p>
          <p>On the margin issue, that really was the Poland and Romania problem which affected it most directly. And in the second half, there was also the impact of our destocking, which further depressed the performance of those markets so we effectively destocked about 500,000 hectoliters between those two markets in the second half of the year, and that would have had an impact.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, can we just come back to the input cost, then. You've talked a bit about the fact that South Africa is one area where raw material costs you think will be sort of higher than the average that you're talking about in the mid-single digit. Could you just go through each of the regions and say where you're expecting input cost inflation to be above whatever you think the average will be that gives you mid-single digit and where it'll be below?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah. Actually, I won't go through all of them right here. In general, the balance is that we're expecting relatively low, almost flat, in fact, input cost rates in the U.S. and that's partly because of their packaging mix compared to brewing raw materials and partly because of the dollar versus other currencies, and the fact you don't have currency exchange movements there.</p>
          <p>South Africa would be at the top end of the range and partly, that is because they, in fact, had a very strong positive performance in the last year, so there's a bit of unwinding of that position, I'm afraid. Africa itself will be high, higher than the others, largely because of currencies. And the rest would be roughly on the average.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And when you're thinking about a sort of top end of the range, are we talking about 7%, 8% or 9%, 10% inflation?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>At the top end of the range, it would be in double-digits, but that's about as far as I can go.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. My question is on the U.S. You mentioned continued pressure with respect to consumer spending. But also, we've heard a lot about trends firming up a bit, maybe a return to more on-premise consumption again. Could you tell us if you're seeing that all? And then also with respect to U.S. pricing, there has been the adjustments of the pricing ladder. I know you've taken some movements, as has your competitor. How much room is there for pricing and what are your plans, if you could talk about that for this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so, on-premise has firmed a bit. Some of the &#x2013; particularly, casual dining is doing a bit better than it was. It's still not great, but it's certainly starting to get better and in the on-premise, are starting to firm somewhat. The major thing that's going on in the U.S., obviously, is orienting towards the new future with tremendous growth in Craft brands and the big brewers trying to make sense of those and have viable long-term growth options in the midst of all that development.</p>
          <p>Pricing overall is, in effect, not really the problem in the U.S. Pricing has really been firm and broadly, it recovers raw material input costs and we will expect that more or less to continue. There have been some outbreaks of discounting around the U.S., but you get that and you get chatter about that at the beginning of every selling season, the start of every summer. And I don't think that what we've seen is unusual compared to the normal background &#x2013; backdrop of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess, as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, import haven't taken pricing. I think they're pointing to domestics to take pricing before they move. I mean, is that something in the industry right now that's just not going to happen, that we're going to stay at somewhat of a standstill at the high-end?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I really can't talk for the major import operators. But the premium or the price index between standard and mainstream or premium in America, the Miller Light, Bud Lite is different, that's price level. And the major imports, that has come down from about a 70%, 75% premium, let's say, five or six years ago or perhaps a bit more, down to 35%, 40% premium. Now, so what we're pointing to there is not anything particularly dramatic. It's a continued long term erosion of that price cap.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Trevor Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One question for me. Graham, if I listened to your commentary about the markets and the trends that are going on, it broadly sounds that it hasn't really changed that much in the six months and that sort of emerging markets in general being very strong, central and eastern Europe very weak and the U.S. just about okay. As you look back, would you pick out any countries or regions where you think things have got significantly better or significantly worse in the last six months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Trevor, it's hard to pick out countries that have gotten much better. I think that if you take the overall trading environment globally, which is hard to generalize about. But I mean, just if you try to do that, I think that the trend is probably a bit softer now than it was, say, six months ago on average. Okay. And that's because the growth markets, the emerging economies are still in growth, but the rate of growth has declined somewhat.</p>
          <p>So &#x2013; and that will be true for Latin America, it would be true of Asia; Africa, perhaps not quite as much. In fact, it's hard for us to see what the underlying trend is in Africa, because very regrettably, we're out of capacity in a number of our major African countries. So that's the major determinant of sales growth right now is simply capacity constraint rather than underlying demand.</p>
          <p>But I suppose if I have to pick a region which is less affected by the sentiment and the mild softening, it would be Africa. There are some parts of the world where demand seems to be continuing, up to now anyway, pretty much unabated and unaffected by softening. I suppose Peru would be one of those, yeah, outside Africa. The South African economy, the South African consumer has gone up and down a bit over the last year, actually, in terms of local confidence. And I don't really see any particular difference now from what there was.</p>
          <p>Generally, the air in the U.S. is more confident than it was six or nine months ago. And where it will stay like, I don't know. But just anecdotally walking around the place, I would say that things are looking a little bit more upbeat there. And sentiment in Europe, of course, as we know, is dire. But that's, I think, because of uncertainty as much as anything else.</p>

          <p>Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Gerard Rijk from ING. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning. Three questions, if I may. First about the headquarter costs. They have &#x2013; for logical reasons, increased in financial year 2012. What are the expectations for 2013 or is that whole organization now, has that moved up to a healthy critical size? And second question is on the hectoliter expansions that you are planning in Africa. Can you give some guidance what kind of hectoliter size number that is in total or for the different countries, maybe even better?</p>
          <p>And finally, in Poland and Romania, concerning the changing environment there already for two years, what is exactly your &#x2013; what could be your reaction on these changes in downtrading and in &#x2013; or is it just in the reversal of an earlier position which was, let's say, relatively healthy versus competitors which were not so active?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I will ask Alan to talk on the Europe thing and Jamie on the headquarter cost. Do you want to comment on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry. Problem here with the microphone. If I talk about head office costs, the changes in head office costs, as you know, are due to part of the business capability programs where we picked some of these programs to come within head office costs, because we're centralizing some of the centers of skill, such as Trinity. So I would say that there will be a little bit more of that to carry out in incoming years, so the head office costs will still have some outward pressure on that, but obviously, reflecting lower cost in the regions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Africa expansions, I actually don't have those in front of me. But I mean, from memory, let me just go through them. We've upgraded southern Sudan and that is now up to about 0.5 million hectoliters, maybe 0.6 million from memory. Upgrades in Tanzania, we're putting a new brew house into the Mwanza brewery and we're upgrading <mark type="ph" /> Erusha (1:07:05). That is, again, about another 0.5 million. New <mark type="ph" /> Enicha (1:07:10) brewery in Nigeria is about the same size as the -- as will be the new Mbarara brewery in Uganda.  Each of those would be in the 0.5 million to 1 million hectoliter range. And the new or replacement brewery in Ndola is roughly the same size as well.</p>
          <p>We tend to use the same module sizes in Africa. So typically, we will put in a 0.5 million to 0.75 million module, with the capability of doubling that relatively easily.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>On Europe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On Europe, yes, Alan speaking. Just &#x2013; yeah. In Poland and Romania, I mean, we have <mark type="ph" /> foothold (1:07:58) in trying to hold the value up. But the reality is that the consumers broadly have followed a path to economy brands and more economy shopping and we recognize that and that technology. So in the past six to nine months, we've done quite a major revision of our strategy in both markets and there are really three things we're doing to respond to this.</p>
          <p>The first is that we are actually and have actually re-based pricing in Poland and Romania in different ways. In Poland, we've actually reduced pricing on our core mainstream and economy brands. And in Romania, we've rebased pricing by introducing new SKUs effectively using PET and large-sized PET to re-base our <mark type="ph" /> ramps (1:08:43) in the trade, 2.5-liter PET again on our mainstream and economy brands. So more competitive pricing across sort of 70% of our portfolio volume in those markets.</p>
          <p>The second thing is more aggressive in the discounted channel. So whereas we have stayed out of the discounted channels in both markets until now, to date, we have now begun to move aggressively into those channels, so we have sought and obtained listings. Obviously in key accounts generally, we've been present, but now in the discounted channels which are growing the fastest in those markets.</p>
          <p>And the third one then, obviously, with re-basing price and moving into discount is, it's about protecting our core volume and our core share. But we have to offset that impact with a search for revenue somewhere and that is through innovation. So we've put a number of innovations into those markets in the past six months, and rolling forward, we'll be more aggressive with that.</p>
          <p>So again, innovations around the large as well as premium brands to try and offset that. And so quite a substantial change in our approach and obviously, hoping for the positive impact of that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that is &#x2013; this change in approach is since when in those countries?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
