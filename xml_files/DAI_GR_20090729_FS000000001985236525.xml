        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.  Thanks for joining us and welcome to our 2009 second quarter and first half results conference call.</p>
          <p>This is the third time we are presenting quarterly results against the backdrop of the global economic crisis.  More than 8.5 million passenger vehicles were sold in the triad markets in the first and second quarter of last year.  In the fourth quarter, however, this number dropped to only six million and sales have remained low ever since.</p>
          <p>Various cost cutting programs were started to artificially support passenger vehicle demand in the first half of 2009, but despite these incentives we expect sales in triad markets to decrease by around 15% this year or in the triad market even 15 to 20%. Since the end of last year the truck market has witnessed a dramatic slump. For the entire year 2009 we anticipate a decrease of 40 to 50%.</p>
          <p>The triad van market saw a collapse in late 2008 similar to passenger cars.  Demand is projected to decline by 35 to 40% this year.</p>
          <p>So how did Daimler perform in this extraordinary weak market environment in the second quarter?  First and foremost, the key message is with the exception of truck sales, the downward trend has been stopped. Sales are stabilizing also on the low level and there are signs of a beginning turnaround.</p>
          <p>At Mercedes-Benz Cars a clear recovery is evident in the last months.  In the second quarter we sold 287,000 units.  That's still 90% less compared to last year, but it's 24% more than in the first quarter of 2009.  In some Western European countries, in the United States and in China, for example, Mercedes-Benz Cars has grown its market share in recent months.</p>
          <p>You've seen a gradual improvement in our Van and Bus business as well.  Both divisions gained market share in their respective segments in major markets and while trucks sales decreased further due to the global recession, our Truck division still increased its share in nearly all major markets, all these results reflected in our bottom line.</p>
          <p>As projected in our last quarterly conference call in April, the severe impact of the economic crisis led to significantly lower revenues and earnings in the second quarter of 2009.  EBIT declined to minus &#x20AC;1.0 billion.  It's important to note that this figure includes special reporting items of &#x20AC;600 million in connection with repositioning initiatives at Daimler Trucks and with our divestment in Chrysler.</p>
          <p>In the second quarter we reached an agreement with Cerberus and redeemed our remaining share in Chrysler.  The final legal separation from Chrysler, which also involves the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, resulted in a charge of &#x20AC;0.4 billion in our second quarter results.</p>
          <p>Net profit of the Daimler Group in the second quarter of 2009 decreased to minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion due to the development in EBIT and the lower interest result.  Earnings per share came in at minus &#x20AC;0.99.</p>
          <p>Without a doubt, these results are unsatisfactory, but they are not unexpected and excluding the special reporting items, the key financials prove that our crisis management is gaining traction.  Both free cash flow and net liquidity of our industrial business developed positively in the second quarter, largely driven by our successful working capital management.</p>
          <p>Net liquidity of our industrial business increased to &#x20AC;4.6 billion at the end of June 2009.  The &#x20AC;1.4 billion free cash flow in our industrial business also represents a significant step forward compared to the minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2009.  One of the reasons for the positive development of our industrial free cash flow is the substantial progress in the adjustment of our inventories, but the market driven sales decline in all divisions still left its mark.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we reduced our passenger car inventory by approximately 44,000 units.  We are now back at our target level.  All of our other automotive divisions have also successfully reduced their inventories and working capital.</p>
          <p>Now let's take a closer look at the developments in our individual divisions.  Mercedes-Benz Cars sold 287,000 vehicles, 67,000 less than in last year's second quarter.  Revenue dropped from 12.9 to &#x20AC;10.6 billion, but one has to bear in mind that last year's second quarter was an extraordinarily good one.</p>
          <p>The decrease was especially pronounced in Western Europe and the U.S. due to the difficult markets there.  In contrast, unit sales in China increased by 27% in the last quarter and we have gained market share.  The increase in retail sales for China in the same time period was 57%.</p>
          <p>Our second quarter EBIT figures for Mercedes-Benz Cars underline.  Despite the successful launch of the E-Class in this quarter and the measures taken to reduce costs we were not able to compensate for the market driven sales decrease.</p>
          <p>As a consequence, EBIT dropped to minus &#x20AC;340 million.  Additional negative effects on earnings resulted from the market pressure on sales prices and a less favorable model mix.  Nonetheless, in comparison to the first quarter of this year with EBIT of minus &#x20AC;1.1 billion, the second quarter result is a significant step in the right direction.</p>
          <p>In the developed market, the new E-Class has still provided us with renewed sales impetus.  In Europe, shipment of the sedan version started at the end of March.  The coupe followed at the beginning of May.</p>
          <p>By the end of June we had already delivered 40,000 new E-Class sedans and coupes.  We expect further momentum from the upcoming launch in important markets like the United States or China and the launch of the station wagon.  The E-Class sedan has already regained market leadership in its segment in May.</p>
          <p>After four years in production and sales of 270,000 units, we have also presented the new generation S-Class with an even more dynamic design, more comfort and trailblazing innovations, it sets again the standard for automotive progress.</p>
          <p>Technological highlights include the world's first series production hybrid drive systems with a lithium-ion battery in the S 400 Hybrid, the most economical luxury sedan with a gasoline engine in the market.  Its fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions make the new S-1 Hybrid the tier 2 champion in the luxury class.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Truck division, the figures show that it took longer for this economic crisis to affect the commercial vehicle business, but now the market collapse is all the more dramatic.  As a result, Daimler Trucks' unit sales decreased by 56% to 54,000 vehicles in the second quarter.  All of our regional units are affected, Trucks Europe/Latin America, Trucks NAFTA and Trucks Asia.</p>
          <p>In line with unit sales, revenue fell from 7.4 billion to &#x20AC;4.2 billion.  However, our market share rose in almost all major markets, which is a very positive statement on the strength of our product.</p>
          <p>Not surprisingly, EBIT of our Truck division at minus &#x20AC;508 million was below last year's record level.  Besides the lower sales in all major markets, an important driving force behind the decline of earnings was the realignment of Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation.</p>
          <p>An additional factor was the repositioning of our truck business in North America, which we initiated last year.  These programs are comprehensive answers to the structural changes in the commercial vehicle market and we are well on track with the implementation of our measures.  With the adjustment of production, we reduced our truck inventories by more than &#x20AC;800 million compared to year end 2008.</p>
          <p>One highlight on the product side was the European launch of the Mercedes-Benz Actros Construction, a new model from the truck of the year 2009 family.  And to underline our ongoing commitment to environmentally friendly transport solutions, Trucks NAFTA has developed the first hybrid truck for use in the hazardous material transport.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile a few weeks ago Truck Asia launched the new Fuso Canter with Euro 5-compliant engines in Europe.  The new generation of the Canter is one of the most technologically advanced environmentally friendly light-duty trucks worldwide.</p>
          <p>Looking at our Mercedes-Benz Van business, we posted sales of 42,000 units in the second quarter of this year.  Compared to the record figure for the prior year quarter, this represents a drop of 47%.</p>
          <p>The division's revenue of &#x20AC;1.5 billion was also significantly lower than in the second quarter of last year.  Across the board, Mercedes-Benz Van models were affected by the global economic decline and the resulting decrease <mark type="inaudible" />.  In all Western European key markets unit sales <mark type="inaudible" />.  The EU member states in Central and Eastern Europe suffered even more from this <mark type="inaudible" /> prices.</p>
          <p>But despite the sharp market contraction of recent months, Mercedes-Benz Vans was able to strengthen its position in the segment of mid-size and large vans in Europe.  EBIT of Mercedes-Benz Vans amounted to negative &#x20AC;10 million after 262 million a year ago.  Cost savings from initiated counter measures could not compensate for the drastic decline in unit sales.</p>
          <p>In May, we introduced our own form of stimulus package to the overall weak van market with our new diesel engines and eco-transmissions for the Sprinter that Mercedes-Benz Vans.  With a new fuel-efficient four-cylinder diesel engine OM 651, the Sprinter fulfills the Euro-5 emission limits without any modifications.  In combination with the newly developed Eco-6-Speed transmission, the Sprinter delivers substantial fuel savings.</p>
          <p>Considering the magnitude of the global recession, our Bus business still reported relatively stable results.  Daimler Buses sold 8,300 buses and chassis in the second quarter, a decrease of 25% compared to the prior year period.  We recorded a decline in sales in all major regions.</p>
          <p>In Western Europe, the Mercedes-Benz and Citaro brands were not able to match the high prior year figure.  Unit sales of city buses remain robust, but sales of coaches have declined.</p>
          <p>Despite ongoing strong demand for Orion-branded city buses in North America, unit sales in the NAFTA region dropped by 44%.  The main reason was the severe market decline in Mexico.</p>
          <p>The economic crisis became also very apparent in Latin America, driving down the demand for bus chassis as well.  The Bus division's revenue at &#x20AC;1.1 billion fell at a lower rate than unit sales due to positive structural effects.</p>
          <p>Daimler Buses posted EBIT of &#x20AC;49 million in the second quarter.  Of course, that's significantly below the outstanding earnings level of the prior year, but still clearly in the black.</p>
          <p>Even the relatively good development in sales of city buses worldwide and the measures that we have initiated to manage efficiency and reduce costs could not prevent the earnings decline.  However, even in this depressed market environment Daimler Buses obtained several major orders in the second quarter: 144 Mercedes-Benz Citaro LE city buses for Berlin; a follow-up order for 200 more Mercedes-Benz Conecto buses for Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and 30 Setra S 417 travel buses for San Francisco.</p>
          <p>In June we presented a technological world premiere, the new Mercedes-Benz Citaro FuelCELL-Hybrid, the first vehicle of our new generation of buses with fuel-cells.  The Citaro FuelCELL-Hybrid city bus does not emit any pollutants, operates near noiselessly and runs on less hydrogen than previous fuel-cell buses.</p>
          <p>That brings us to Daimler Financial Services.  It's no surprise that the drop in car and truck sales is also reflected in our results here.  New business fell by 16% down to &#x20AC;6.5 billion compared to the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>Contract volume amounted to &#x20AC;60.3 billion at the end of June 2009.  That's close to the level of last year.  However, as a consequence of the market situation and the sale of a part of our non-automotive portfolio in the U.S., contract volume decreased 5% compared to year end 2008 when contract volume totaled &#x20AC;63.4 billion.</p>
          <p>The main reason for the decrease of EBIT to &#x20AC;79 million was the higher cost of risk, effectively the consequences of the economic crisis felt by our financial service customers.  Still, it's not exceptionally high, given the severity of the recession.</p>
          <p>Moreover, burdens on earnings arose from cost of liquidity measures and lower margins.  Like our other divisions, Daimler Financial Services has initiated further measures to increase overall efficiency, as well as reducing financing expenses for the leasing and financing business.</p>
          <p>Coming back to the Group level, we have initiated counter measures across all of our divisions and corporate functions to adjust our expenditures to lower revenue.  We are cutting cost wherever it does not affect our competitive position.</p>
          <p>In addition to short-time work in our production, we have implemented rigorous reductions in personnel costs on all hiring levels and in the area of materials.  Plus, we've prioritized our investment plans to keep cash outflows to the minimum we require to stay on plan.</p>
          <p>During the first half year our counter measures realized &#x20AC;1.9 billion in savings.  We are confident we'll achieve or possibly exceed our &#x20AC;4 billion target by year end.</p>
          <p>We are largely focusing on turning one-time savings into sustainable efficiency gains, but we continue to invest in our key strategic areas, new markets and new products.  Our total R&amp;D budget in the last quarter was even slightly higher than the second quarter of 2008.  We will not mortgage our future.</p>
          <p>The comparison to our first quarter results shows how our cost savings have gained traction.  Our counter measures work.  Although the results we are reporting today are still heavily impacted by the economic crisis, we saw signs of a moderate recovery during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>EBIT of the Group, excluding the special reporting items, improved from minus 1.4 billion to minus &#x20AC;0.4 billion.  The major part of this improvement is attributed to Mercedes-Benz Cars where EBIT has risen from minus 1.1 billion to minus &#x20AC;0.3 billion, plus the earnings situation during the last three months has also improved at Mercedes-Benz Vans and Daimler Financial Services.</p>
          <p>Although we expect some stabilization in the second half of this year, global demand for passenger vehicles is expected to decline by approximately 15% compared to 2008.  The Prospect for the medium and heavy-duty truck markets are also unfavorable.</p>
          <p>Significant decreases of 40 to 50% are likely for Western Europe and Japan and a drop of 30 to 40% in the NAFTA region.  Pre-buy effects in the U.S. market towards the end of 2009 are very unlikely, so we do not expect a market recovery before the beginning of 2010.  We also anticipate a distinct decline in Russia and Eastern Europe.</p>
          <p>In van markets we do not foresee a significant improvement compared to the first half of this year either.  In regard to bus markets, we estimate stable demand for the city bus segment in 2009.  However, we believe that conditions for the coach market will remain difficult.</p>
          <p>What consequences will these assumptions have on our sales in 2009?  Mercedes-Benz Cars will meet the challenges of this difficult year with an up-to-date and competitive product range.  Therefore, we assume sales in the second half of the year to exceed those of the first half.</p>
          <p>As we do not see truck markets recovering during the remainder of this year, sales volume of Daimler Trucks in the second half of 2009 is expected to stay on the level of the first six months.  Mercedes-Benz Vans also expects only a slight improvement in unit sales in the second half of the year.  Daimler Buses anticipate a repeat of the sales level of the first six months in the final six months of this year.</p>
          <p>Now let me give you our outlook on the earnings situation.  At Mercedes-Benz Cars we will benefit from the fully availability of the new E-Class and a savings effects from the wide-ranging measures we have initiated.  Therefore, we expect a gradual improvement in profitability over the remaining quarters and positive earnings in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>Our Daimler Trucks division anticipates continued burdens from depressed markets in the second half of the year.  The initiated counter measures will not fully offset the sales decline.</p>
          <p>EBIT of Mercedes-Benz Vans will also continue to be affected by overall weak demand.  However, the lows should have already been reached in Q1.  We expect a slight earnings improvement in the second half of the year.</p>
          <p>Despite the decrease in unit sales and the difficult development in the coach market, Daimler Buses expects to achieve positive earnings in the second half of the year.  The division will also face higher R&amp;D expenditures related to new products.</p>
          <p>Daimler Financial Services anticipates rising credit defaults and continued higher refinancing expenses.  The EBIT in the second half is expected to be slightly positive.  At the Group level, thanks to our measures to cut costs and expenditures by a total amount of at least &#x20AC;4 billion, we anticipate a gradual EBIT improvement from ongoing business in the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>So as you connect the dots in our first half story, we believe they shape a clear picture.  The automotive industry is still in the midst of an extraordinary crisis and, yes, this crisis is taking its toll on Daimler as well.</p>
          <p>But what's important, we've put a comprehensive and a rigorous crisis management in place and these measures are working.  We have strong products and technologies.  We continue to invest in our future and our organization is adapting to the new reality.  After hitting rock bottom in the first quarter we are now fighting our way back.</p>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention.  Now Bodo Uebber, Andreas Renschler and I will be happy to take your questions.</p>

          <p>Okay, we take the first question from Horst Schneider.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Horst Schneider here from HSBC.  Good afternoon.  I've got couple of questions.  First of all, it's relating to your inventory development, I would be interested in any indication about inventory development in the second half of this year, whether we might see a restocking effect in H2 and if we have seen really the lowest point here at the end of the H1?</p>
          <p>Then the second one is regarding your cost cutting measures.  As you told us in the last conference call, you are implementing this year cost cuts in amount of &#x20AC;4 billion and I would be interested to which extent all these measures has been implemented already in the second quarter?</p>
          <p>And the third question is relating to residual values, I would be interested how residual values developed here in Germany and Europe against U.S., how is the trade off, is there eventually even a positive net impact and maybe if we see some write-backs on residual values at the end of 2009?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for your questions.  As far as inventories are concerned, we have reached the targeted levels actually in some divisions, namely Mercedes, done more than we planned to do in the sense of reduction of stock.  Looking forward, and that was your question, roughly spoken, this is about the level we will maintain towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>There might be a little bit up and down on the Mercedes side, few units higher is not impossible, but it's about the range we are now.  On the Truck side, further decrease is planned for and the same applies for Vans.  Cost cutting, just in general, as I reported, 1.9 billion out of the four have been booked in the first half.  We are on track for the second half and as I indicated, perhaps even more.  Bodo can come back to that and then answer your residual value question as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Horst, I don't want to &#x2013; cost cutting measures, Dieter has already said.  There might be also some opportunities for the second half and as you know, of course, it is a work in process report what we do right now here, 1.9 billion is booked into the P&amp;L.  Of course we have, we are working on all the measures in different implementation stages, but as we said, we confirm that we will shoot for the four billion, even some possibilities to do more.</p>
          <p>Residual values is overall in the U.S. a good situation, means from a trend perspective we came down with the losses there.  So same applies to the U.K.  In Germany it is not as positive when I look at the difference in that, but also a stable situation.  That holds true for passenger cars.  On the Truck side, we do have a pressure on the used car prices overall.  That holds true for all the regions we are in, but you know that the levels we are in, in the Truck business compared to the passenger Car business, it's far lower.  Therefore we are well provisioned, but I also have to say there is risk in that business, so for next quarters we have to see what the developments are.  Currently we see this positive, but as I said, there's also risk in that business also in the next quarters to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We take the next question from Wes Kirkham.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon.  I just have three questions, two relating to Mercedes Cars and one relating to Group cost cutting.  If we can start with the cost cutting, of the 1.9 billion you've announced I think you've said in the presentation that 45% related to head count, i.e. some of it <mark type="inaudible" />, some of it I assume permanent.  Can you just answer the people who say you've just benefited from a government handout here and therefore as you grow volumes you won't get operating leverage to give us some confidence that those cost savings are permanent?</p>
          <p>Then on the underlying margin in Mercedes-Benz Cars, clearly under-producing by 44,000 in the quarter we've just been through on an average ASP basis means you missed out on about 1.6 billion of revenue.  Now you did a 53% margin-on-margin sequentially Q2 on Q1.  Why is my logic incorrect that if I multiply that 0.53 by 1.6 billion actually in the quarter just gone you did nearly a 5% EBIT margin and EBIT would have been nearer 500 million when we adjust for the one offs that are above the line in Mercedes-Benz Cars, a tremendous performance given the volume trends you see?</p>
          <p>And finally, you talk about selling more cars in the second half than in the first, but equally say the visibility is still not great, i.e. Q4 we don't have a strong core.  Does that mean you actually do have great visibility going into Q3 and therefore as you match your production with your sales, this is the second question, you may actually see some sales growth in Q3 on top and we can look forward to a substantially positive EBIT margin in Mercedes Cars in Q3?</p>
        </plist>

          <p>First of all, to your cost question, I think we never held back with a clear statement that the four billion in 2009 consists of quite a significant amount of improvements, which are constant and go to the bottom line on a consistent way, but as well, reductions which are kind of one-time in their character and that's pretty normal.  If you have direct short-term, you will have these components in a cost program normally.</p>
          <p>Of course, we are very much aware that our task going forward is to replace these one-time effects by ongoing savings looking forward to 2010 and following years and to the extent necessary and possible add further actions to that.  So that applies to all categories, including you said, head count.  I would prefer to say personnel cost where obviously as we have announced there are, for instance, continued part of this savings related to labor time reduction with proportional salary reductions.  And these are not agreed for the long-term, but at the time being for June till June next year.  So once again, generally we have to make sure that we turn the short-term action into sustainable actions within the personnel cost reduction.  It's reflected as well a reduction of head count of 15,000 year-to-date, which is combined by about 10,000 outside of Germany and 5,000 within Germany.  So these are obviously permanent savings going forward including in this number.</p>
          <p>The second question, to the extent I understood when you said under-produced if I got it right, what you were referring to, we have two forms of inventory reductions.  The one is our inventory, wholesale and AG inventory, which has been reduced.  In this case we basically realized our revenues relative to retail sales.  The second reduction with occurred was on retail level.  There, of course, we do not realize revenues and thereby sales contribution with our retail sales, but they are basically sitting within the dealer body.  At that part you could say that in the market we performed better than we do with our sales, but with our own reduction we do not have this kind of negative impact on our earnings.</p>
          <p>Still, I would not object to your conclusion that we did a decent job in Mercedes last quarter.  Visibility, we know pretty well how we're doing on the cost side and what we can accomplish there.  We have some visibility as far as the market is concerned and at the same time, of course, still risk as far as the market is concerned because we continue to live in pretty volatile times.  And on that basis we made our statements in the sense of guidance where we expect Mercedes to go for.  I don't think we are living in times where we should become more specific and precise than what we have said.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Stefan Burgstaller from Goldman Sachs.  Just a couple of questions.  In the release you mentioned a building of pension provisions and also the discounting of long-term provisions.  I was just wondering should we treat or think about this as one-offs or more of an ongoing nature?</p>
          <p>And second, also trying to dig in a bit in your operating or underlying operating performance on Page 26 of the EBIT work, which you provide so helpfully, you show that in Mercedes Car Group, it's a negative impact from volume structure and pricing was 1.9 billion.  So on a back of the envelope we would allocate a billion of this impact on the volume side and from negative operating leverage.  Could you explain what is or that the constituent of that delta, the other billion and how should we think about this other billion going forward?</p>
          <p>And then finally, in terms of the percentage of your workers on short-time week in Germany, are you also planning like your peers Audi and BMW to move offshore to time week in Germany after August and would this negatively impact your four billion target for the full year in terms of cost savings?  Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.  Stefan, first of all, the subject regarding the pension, the German Pension Protection Association where we have booked in the first half year 78 million, the normal level was last year kind of 20 million, for example.  So that has increased in the half year.  We expect the same amount for the time being for the second half, but it could also increase further when we get new expected exits from this association.  What that is in 2010 and '11, I can't tell you right now, depends on the development of insolvencies and other stuff in Germany.</p>
          <p>The long-term, the interest rates, of course, we had to take into account for the long-term provisions.  Of course it's something which we do have to do, we value at each quarter.  So that means if interest rates are increasing in the next few quarters, for example, you would see a positive development in this regard.  If you would see a further decrease of interest rate levels you would see a further burden in this regard.  Of course we would inform you in our disclosure what the impact would be.  Of course, I regard this right now as the interest rate development was so fast in that respect that we have a kind of one-off, so to say, in that quarter.</p>
          <p>You asked for the Page 26 and the volume effect there.  Of course, in that volume effect here, of course, first of all it's very &#x2013; you take the difference between two quarters.  It's first of all not pretty easy, Q2 and Q2 in this regard, to compare.  It's better to take the data always and to accumulate for first half and for three quarters to get a better precise number because we have some kind of effects which are in here, which are related not to the difference of sales or the difference of revenues.  For example, when we talk about incentives, for example, they are related to the total sales you have in that quarters, for example.  I would regard from that, from the 1.9 billion, roughly 35% to 40% as elements which are related to incentive levels or the used car business where we got rid of a lot of inventory.  And on top, also the cost effect on residual costs, so to say, where our short timing does only compensate for the fixed cost element in that.  So that's roughly as a guidance here what is in there. And now I do think we have the last question.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, at least I didn't get it, one element which is included and I think you asked specifically for Mercedes is the mix effect, the structural effect?</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The final question was just whether you intend or similar to Audi and BMW to move offshore term week in Germany?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry.  Of course we had in the first half of the year the necessity to reduce production below sales in order to get rid of the inventory and while we are now in sync, already by that we have a better sense on production situation, plus the fact of the E-Class and GLK, all engines available and so on.  We clearly expect higher production volumes than in the first half and that will have its effect on the need for short labor as well.</p>
          <p>At that time it's not decided if we, to which extent we will get out of this program on the car side, but certainly it will be significantly less than in the first half.  By no means this would negatively impact our EBIT development.  If it's in line with our plan, then obviously the labor cost savings related to that are in line with our cost cutting plan as well.  If we produce more than that, then on the one hand we would have less savings on the labor side, but certainly over proportional benefits from the revenue side.  So in this regard I definitely see not a risk in that development.</p>

          <p>We take the next question from Christoff Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone.  Christoff Howard, Dow Jones in Frankfurt .  Three quick questions, if I may, first one would be following up on BMW's announcement earlier today, does Mercedes-Benz have any plans to leave Formula One or at least to scale back investment as part of the current cost cutting efforts?</p>
          <p>Second question would be, did the recent sales stabilization continue in July and could you give us an indication on what you expect in terms of sales this month at Mercedes-Benz Cars compared to July last year?</p>
          <p>Third and final question would be, there has been some noise on a new wide ranging cost reduction program similar to the core program possibly looming later this year.  And you, Mr. Zetsche, have stated actually at the AGM that job cuts can't be ruled out if the market conditions don't ease.  Do you expect the current cost cutting efforts to be sufficient looking forward or are there more cuts to be expected?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well to your first question, we have impact much earlier on significantly cost reduction programs in our F1 engagement with the result that, for instance, this year we have about 30% expected spending below last year's level.  And we are pretty sure that last year's level was below some of our main competitors' spending in 2008.  We are making our own decisions on F1 and we have no plan to exit at that time, but we said very clearly all the time that this is not a natural law, but we will ask ourselves about the costs and the benefits, if the ratio is positive frequently and continuously.  And on that basis our account status is a going concern on Formula One at much lower cost than we used to have and we expect next year spending to be much below this year's spending again.</p>
          <p>As far as sales are concerned, we are not in a position to give July numbers.  Our understanding is that the industry-wide improvement of order intake in the March, April, May period has kind of flattened out in June, July, not specifically for Mercedes, but generally.  And therefore this will reflect in the sales going forward to some extent, but so far not in the sense of a deviation of our planning and expectations.  Cost program, I would consider the current Daimler-wide cost program of four billion as a wide reaching program already.</p>
          <p>I don't think that the question how we call our programs is the main issue.  We obviously have made significant progress on the Mercedes side while we were running under the core umbrella within our goal for '10 initiative.  We have one package, a significant one, addressing efficiency and cost cutting and with this one we are making very good progress again and as well, personnel cost being one element.  I was just referring to significant head count reduction we have accomplished already and at that point of time there's no plan for a major program in the sense of head count reductions as you were asking.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>We take the next question from Jochen Gehrke [Deutsche Bank], please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions, if I may.  Two related to trucks, first of all your competitors that already reported, Scania in particular, was mentioning that in the third quarter they see significant ramp up in daily production rates given that inventories on their side seems to have come down to an end, inventory corrections.  Is that something we should anticipate for your European activities as well?  And generally market-wise when do you think inventory correction is done in the truck industry in Western Europe?</p>
          <p>And on that same subject, in the past when these activities were all very profitable you always pointed out that your European/Latin American activities are very comparable profitability-wise for Scania.  Is this still the case in the downturn and if so shouldn't we read that NAFTA is heavily loss making and that potentially your restructuring actions are insufficient to turn around that business and that you might have to cut even deeper into the organization?</p>
          <p>And thirdly, on your cash development, I recognize that you are not very clear and specific about your profit guidance, but could you talk about your cash flow outlook for the second half of the year, is there any reason that we should assume that you're burning cash in the second half, given you are assuming sequential rise in profitability?  So do you expect to exit the year on a similar level of net cash as we have currently?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Mr. Gehrke, let's look at your assumption that with our business in Latin America and Europe, like we pointed out, when there were good times in the market we see the same also in these conditions.  So I'm not happy with the results, but compared to our competitors I can confirm what you have said before also in this bad time.  So indeed, we have two regions where are hit much more dramatically in the market conditions, think about in the United States, for example.  This is the third year in a row and compared to the very weak 2008 we are hit with another 30 to 40% market reduction.  So that was just recently initiated there, the programs, the repositioning program, as well as in the U.S. as in Japan.</p>
          <p>There we are on track, in some of the programs we are ahead of schedule, but again, market condition was worse and so we could not over compensate with the programs this more dramatic market development.  But we are on track and, of course, we need some time for our restructuring efforts or in other words to reduce the breakeven point further.  For some examples, in our restructuring programs we have the large plant closure in the U.S. in 2010 in Portland.  So I'm very confident that we are able to achieve our plant breakeven reduction for the year 2010.  So this year it needs some acceleration, but don't forget and it's is no excuse, it is not good we have do like this, is exercise a lot of homework overall.  But this is the ongoing thing, but the market conditions are really sometimes breaking us to more activities at once.  But again, I'm very confident for 2010.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. From a cash point of view, so first of all I do think in the first half especially in the second quarter, a well done job by all divisions to reduce inventory levels, especially Mercedes-Benz Cars, but all divisions contributed to that success.  There's some further potential in the second half also in the Truck area regarding inventories.  Not everything is done yet there.  On the Van business too and overall, of course, we look at our net assets in total, there's more than only finished goods, so to say, or inventories to keep an eye on.  But as we also said, we don't give a cash flow guidance, so a precise guidance.  There will be heavy volatility also in the market, as Dieter Zetsche said.</p>
          <p>So therefore we don't make a precise guidance, but we do everything to be cash positive and I would not exclude for the total year that we are cash positive.  There are effects from the cost measure side, of course, which we will address.  We will look again at our investments as we have already said, what is relevant for strategically or for the long run and we keep it on the very low level if possible.  And, of course, also from the market side we do see on the passenger car side, as we have said, some upward trends, but also on trucks, it's a kind of flat scenario.  All-in-all, we will look at our cash and see that we are positive with our measures on the cash side.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, can I just follow on Mr. Renschler, just back to NAFTA.  I understand that this takes time for all these measurements to come into play, but the market where it currently is in terms of volume is certainly unprecedented.  Can you give us some sort of indication what type of market you need to breakeven with this business, is it with the unused structure would you be breakeven with a market of last year or with a market level that we have in the current year?  What type of volume do you really need in this market?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think when you look to the actual situation and I think, I mean you're right, this is the worst situation we had after the second World War in the United States and we don't expect a big recovery.  We see some slightly improvement in the market next year, but this is besides everything.  We are preparing as we try to prepare ourselves for a very worst market scenario in the United States, so whatever happens next year from a scenario point of view we try to prepare us there.</p>
          <p>You asked another question before about the stock inventory level of the European competitors, if I got it right.  I think there is not a big relief seen.  I know that several companies announced things, but when we talked through in our last AGM meeting, for example, everybody still has the potential to see another stock reduction in the second quarter.  So it could be certain specific situations other companies, but basically not as high as the first half, but in the second half we have another potential at industry point, from an industry point of view for it to reduce the stocks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps just to make it a little bit more precise when Andreas just said prepare for, we are in total agreement that the market is what it is and, of course, in such a dramatic change of the market conditions which are unprecedented, as you already granted, it will take some time to adjust to that.  But we totally agree that we have to earn money with great honor and this can't last, that can't last forever, the market be it as it is.</p>

          <p>Next question we take from Max Warburton [Sanford Bernstein].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi, good afternoon, everybody.  Two questions please, on operating leverage really and cost reduction, Dr. Zetsche and, Mr. Uebber, you know us analysts look at operating leverage and a sort of discussion on the Q1 call was the apparent 66% negative operating leverage in Mercedes.  Another time you said there was some special items in there, some financial services or residual value write-downs in Mercedes.  We seem to have a similar level, an identical level, of operating leverage in Q2.  Are there any special effects in that number and/or could you just explain to us again why the operating leverage in Mercedes seems to be so much more severe than in most other car companies?  That would be really helpful.</p>
          <p>And then the second question related to this, I'm actually going to refer to two slides in your presentation pack.  You talk about 1.9 billion of cost savings in the first half being achieved, but on Page 26 in your profit walk through you actually give some numbers for cost savings in the quarter of 629.  I've looked it up what you did in Q1, you give the same helpful profit bridge and you give a number of 281 for the first quarter.  So it looks like you're saying that cost savings or cost changes save 910 in the first half in the EBIT bridge, but in this counter measure slide you talk about 1.9 billion of savings.  Could you just explain to us the difference?  I guess the 1.9 is versus a budget, but is it kind of fair for us to assume that for the full year the real saving is about half of the four billion number because I'm still struggling a little bit to understand the difference between the two numbers on Page 20 and Page 26?  Thanks a lot.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Max, your question to the, first to the 1.9 billion.  Of course we have said clearly that we have a counter measure program that means okay a mix between efficiency measures and on top measures we introduce during the crisis.  In this aspect you see on Page 26 the effect in the second quarter, but we have also disclosed to you that we have the effect from the German Pension Protection Association, for example, in that we have the impact on the interest rates on long-term provisioning, which is roughly together 315 million.  So if you add this to that number of 629 and if you would add, we have of course not disclosed here, but we do have a Bus business, we have a Van business and we have headquarters.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately so, to say in costs, this is also a cost burden, but of course we could reduce the costs also here.  If I add all of these numbers together, we come to a level of roughly add to the 1.1 billion.  So if I then would include all the effects from short timing on top of that I get into directionally the number of 1.4 billion roughly which we had in the second quarter and that gives you the explanation.  If you now add the first quarter where we have disclosed that we have roughly four to 500 million in counter measure effects, which you couldn't see of course, not in the walk because we had also some effects, for example, we mentioned there, I do think it was the E-Class launch, for example and some investment in technology and so on and so forth.  So that makes a completion to the 1.9 billion.  And the first question, Dieter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Perhaps I can say one word to the operating leverage.  I'm certainly not in a position to question the ways how you assess the business and operating leverage is obviously one element.  But if you, for instance, consider we would have the same turnover or &#x20AC;1.00 less, but in the one case we would sell mostly Smart and the other one mostly S-Classes, then obviously this &#x20AC;1.00 less revenues would carry an operating leverage of multiple thousands of percents, which does make too much sense.  So to relate the change in EBIT just to the change in turnover I think reflects only one dimension and specifically in our case, quite obviously, the sales mix change, as we mentioned before, is a significant element not directly related or not in the first place related to change in revenues.</p>
          <p>The same applies, of course, to any changes in incentive levels which do not apply to the units you lose, but to the overall units you are selling.  And in this sense I accept, of course, your KPI.  It's not one we would steer our business to and when you make the comparison to other car manufacturers, the point probably is that points in the S-Class segment is at the point of time about the most severe hit segment.  And that's one where we were by far the strongest of our competitors and therefore this impact is more severe on us than on others.  Those seem to me to be the differences at that point of time, but the other way around, I'm pretty confident that those segments have more, at least faster potential of recovery and in this sense I think we have a good opportunity as we have seen if you want from Q1 to Q2 to improve with similar leverages in the other direction as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's very helpful.  Can I just have one follow-up question on it, Dr. Zetsche?  You mentioned incentive levels, explaining parts of the disparity in this very simple operating leverage measure.  Can you just remind us what incentives are booked below the revenue line and what are booked above because the operating leverage number should capture incentives that are booked off revenues, it sounds like quite a lot is appearing in marketing expense in Mercedes, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think that's completely in, you might come into some grey area when you talk about content, for instance, changing content in the sense of similar to incentives.  But other than that, that is all in and reported.  And I did not want to give the wrong indication in this respect, for instance, to our best understanding the increase in incentives for Mercedes, for instance, is not higher than the one for BMW, for instance, rather the opposite.</p>

          <p>Thank you.  Just going back to the Truck business, one of the developments looks quite odd actually, is that order intake and when we compare what's happened sequentially between Europe and North America where sequentially between the second quarter and the first quarter order intake in Europe has gone up, but the opposite has happened in North America.  Now given where we are in terms of the truck cycles, where your North American truck cycle turned down earlier and the economy in the U.S theoretically should be perhaps increasing before Europe.  I mean I just wonder if you could explain that sort of apparent anomaly and whether this order intake in the second quarter is a temporary phenomenon and that when other truck makers talk about a young fleet, under-utilization of existing fleets and still low levels of freight haulage, whether we could see the order intake sort of fall off again in the second half of 2010 in Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first of all when you look to the United States, the order intake there is the same leverage when you look to the industry order intake.  The reason there is the only customers who are still ordering, but not regular every month, are big fleets, so there you see sometimes a further drop.  I mean a big fleet is not ordering two months then you see a further decrease and it will come back then though.  Like I see the Class 8 market in the United State this year it will be more or less that we have achieved bottom line, it looks like that.  So maybe there are some slight increased possibilities in the Class 8 in the second half year.</p>
          <p>But this is really very, very slightly, more or less our expectation is flat.  It will be much different in 6 and 7 in the United States.  There the market decline is much more dramatic compared to last year and there I see some further market decrease in the second half.  In Europe, you're right, compared to the very, very, very weak first quarter we see some increase, but compare this increase of the order intake for Europe in the second quarter and compare it to last year, it's minus 50% still.  So there you could not develop out a recovery for the second half of this year.  The expectation we have in the market and you could see it in the first half year is between 40 and 50% and it will still stay like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's one effect which might explain the discrepancy, which is in the first half compared to even more so than we, but we as well had cancellations out of their order book.  And these net order intake further decreased the numbers and increased the percentage of decline and those cancellations are, there's not much left to be canceled for all competitors.  So these are off and therefore when you take the gross order intake before cancellation, I think you have less of an improvement second quarter versus first quarter than including those cancellations.</p>

          <p>Do you have any sense of how the market will develop in 2010?  I mean you've had almost three years of decline in NAFTA region, will it be the same for Europe do you think?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our expectation is today more as a scenario because, tell me how the markets will look exactly in 2010.  The scenario is more or less that there will be no improvement in Western Europe, only slightly improvement in Western Europe because if you look to the &#x2013; no, no, he asked about Western Europe, specifically NAFTA, I said it already.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'm asking about Europe? You're right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.  So if you look to the Eastern Europe parts where a lot of growth came the last three months, actually years, sorry, we have now a decrease of more than 80%.  So I don't see a lot of potential there.  But on the other side, as I said, the indication I'm very clear that we have achieved the bottom line and I don't expect the same situation in NAFTA where we have three years in a row of decreasing market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I just ask another question about another subject on CapEx and depreciation.  I mean in the Annual Report you had this big number for CapEx, which then obviously you had some ambitious plans about models and technology, et cetera and now you've got to revisit that.  But when you look forward beyond this crisis period, are you now got a new plan which says that your, the CapEx will be more closely matched to depreciation or is it still a situation where CapEx will be higher than depreciation 2011, '12, for example?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So basically when you look to our potential investment in emerging markets or weak states, so to say, because in Brazil we are in, I think there will be still a focus on that because they have growth in the next couple of years also before the crisis was and is expected.  What is really driving our investment in R&amp;D this year, for example, is the emission regulations and we don't have a chance.  In the United States, this year, for example, we have to fulfill from 1 of January next year EPA 010, so of course I can save a lot of R&amp;D money this year, but then I cannot sell trucks any longer in January 2010.  That comes on top.  So all the investments we are doing now for products to fulfill further emission regulations and Euro-6 is upcoming, the next thing here in Europe, the very big emission, next step for emissions and the same is in Japan.  We have to prepare at the moment for a new emission regulation that's called Japanese '09.  Now that we will bring on a midterm of caused in line with our depreciation, but in certain years where all this emission regulations change around the world we have to invest, then we are able to sell still truck in the Western new emission now.</p>

          <p>And is there a comment on the same question on a Group level, the Mercedes Car level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well directionally it's the same story driven by the two elements, one being that we want to have a fresh and young product line-up and not eat our seed potatoes.  And on the other one, CO2 reduction for the passenger car fleet will continue to stretch our R&amp;D budget.  Of course, we're doing everything on the one hand to be as efficient as ever possible to get the output with as little resource as possible and secondly, towards everything else in investment which does not directly relate to new product and technology for CO2 reduction.  So we are aware of higher the depreciation investments this year and we will not come to a completely different situation next year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon.  It's Thierry Huon from Exane BNP Paribas.  Just a quick one on Mercedes Car Group, when do you think you will reach the sweet spot for the year in new E-Class?  Would it be in H2 this year or more likely H1 next year?  And did you book any launch costs during Q2 for the new versions of the E-Class to come?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When we are talking about their sweet spot, I guess you mean that we are running at peak capacity on the sales side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With the best margin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Including, of course, best margins in the beginning, hopefully.  So we have been ramping up pretty fast and are almost running at capacity by now.  Of course, the introduction in further markets, especially of the Coupe, which is not finalized and addition of further engines, plus then the station wagon and ultimately the convertible will further strengthen our offering in our line up in that segment.  So we are certainly coming closer to that point.  In Q2 it clearly was not the case.  In Q3 we are coming closer and I don't know if you can by quarter exactly define that, but let's say next year we should be very much be running at full speed and at good margins.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Excuse me, about the launch cost, did you book any launch cost during Q2 for the new versions of the E-Class?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well we do not have any one-time of this regard.  Of course we have expenses which are related to the marketing side, for instance and then, of course, in the beginning you have higher hours per vehicle than you do after half a year of launch time.  Those are incremental expenses during launch as well and then you have some CapEx, which you take over in your books during that timeframe, but that is normal in every launch, it's not a specific number.</p>

          <p>Hi, thanks.  Dr. Zetsche, just a clarification on your comment about German used car prices.  I think you said that they had stabilized, but I'm not sure because we had heard from some of your competitors that used car prices in Germany were still under great pressure, even continuing to decline?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think it was Bodo who made that comment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, apologies.  You don't sound that much alike, I promise...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, what at least we said is that definitely in the U.S. and in U.K. we have a very encouraging development of used car prices, certainly less so in Germany.  We did have very good used car business during the first half of the year as far as volume is concerned, especially of young used cars.  The pricing was kind of flat and improving by now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks for clarifying that.  And just do you guys, I don't know, do you guys disclose or can you disclose roughly the amount of risk provisioning or residual provisioning that you're taking on the Truck side like your competitors do?  I mean presumably you're taking these provisions, either splitting them between the Truck divisions or finance, but can you first confirm that you are taking still higher provisions, what's the risk loss percentage on the book and anything else that you could put some quantification on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, Adam, of course if there would be huge issues we would certainly disclose it, if there would be huge impacts.  On the Financial Services side I have provided you in the backup with the loss development.  The only thing I would like to say there is in the U.S., for example, we see a positive trend of the loss ratios in the passenger car side. And on the truck side, the loss ratio is a little bit deteriorating, of course, due to the effect in the market as long as these markets are at 50% levels and so depressed.  Of course there is some pressure on the customer side on the Truck side.  That's it, Adam.</p>

          <p>Okay.  Next is Daniel Schwarz.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Daniel Schwarz from Commerzbank.  Two questions, are you currently talking with Renault on a cooperation on the Smart Forfour and would you say it's necessary to have a joint venture partner in the Smart program if you want to enlarge the Smart program?</p>
          <p>And second question, just for clarification, the Chrysler cost in the second quarter were some 100 million below what you guided for.  Will we see this 100 million in Q3 or are the overall costs just 100 million lower than you expected?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First question, it's not necessary, but certainly it wouldn't hurt if we could partner in some form or the other on the Smart side, to which extent ever going forward.  I would not make any comments on potential steps in this direction.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Daniel, you are right and thank for the question.  That relates to the guarantee we have given regarding the pension, in the pension area.  You know we have the three installments, the three payments of U.S.$200 million where we have already paid U.S. $200 million in the second quarter.  And therefore we have made the provision, but the guarantee of 200 million we have given is not provision for, so to say, because of course there's no reason to do so because Chrysler is, so to say, in a new co ongoing business and as long as they are ongoing business we cannot provide accounting-wise for a provision there.</p>
          <p>So that is the difference to that what we have said of up to, I do think in the press release and in the Q2, we have booked for the three times $200 million, but not for the guarantee.  And, of course, that will not happen, of course, in Q3 or Q4 as long as Chrysler is doing well as a corporation.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon, Aleksej Wunrau of BHF-Bank.  Just three short ones, the first on your free cash flow indication for the second half, that was quite reassuring, so is it fair to assume that you from the current standpoint would like to keep your dividend payout for 2009 stable?  Secondly, can you provide some idea of the amount of the de-stocking loss in the second quarter?  And thirdly, you are mentioning rise in delinquency rates in the car financing business.  Is this another risk of posting a, as you say, balanced result in the Financial Services segment for the full year?  Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Of course every question to dividends I refer to our February meeting to talk about it there.  The free cash flow, of course, what you mentioned, yes, we have to take into account of course that we in the first half had a huge and positive and good impact on the working capital.  Of course that will slow down in the second half.  And what I mentioned were opportunities, of course, for the second half, but I also said we don't give guidance for the second half in terms of cash flow.</p>
          <p>The delinquency rates, I didn't really get the correct question, so of course there is risk in the Financial Services side, also on the second half I cannot exclude risk deteriorating.  But what we see right now, what we have provisioned for in the first quarter, of course and what we have done now in the second quarter means that we think that we come out with a second half profit slightly positive also with respect to the risk situation we have currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Second question, I don't know, was there a second question left?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you were talking about destocking loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There's probably a difference between selling a car on order or out-of-stock potentially, especially in segments which were more hit by the decline in the market than other segments.  To the extent this was the case that was of course consummated in our overall incentive level and reporting.  But I do not see a special amount of destocking loss.  So to turn it the other way around, we could say while we admit it and I'm not changing that, that we could have reacted faster last year and reduced the increase of stock levels.  We have proven, meanwhile, that that obviously was something which we could fix and fix relatively fast and now we are back where we ought to be.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello, Christian Hetnaugh here from Reuters .  I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of quick questions?  First of all, the perennial one about BMW, can you give us any update as far as your attempt to form an alliance with BMW is concerned?  You had also made a comment to the press about savings in 2010 that seemed to indicate you were looking at four billion as well.  I was wondering if you could give some sort of indication about that?</p>
          <p>Also, just can you give any indication about what quarter you expect to actually make a profit on your operating level?  And there was a comment made by Mr. Uebber earlier about cash, I believe it was we cannot exclude that we will be cash positive at the end of the year.  At the end of June it was 4.6 billion in net industrial cash, so unless there's some sort of massive cash drain in the second half, could you give any, could you basically sort of say this is going to be the bottom and it's just going to get better from here as industrial net cash improves and no dividend has to be paid?  Thank you.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And sorry to be also be very frank and short, we don't give an indication here about 2010 right and I ask for your understanding.  In this regard when you ask about savings and other stuff and for the free cash flow I had made the comment, but I don't comment here on the net liquidity forecast, so wait until we have booked the Q3 and Q4 numbers and we will see where we are.  Sorry.</p>

          <p>So our last question comes from Chuck Isensat .  Chuck?  For another one, very last question, Alexis Albeoff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon, thank you for taking my question.  Just a quick question regarding the Smart Forfour, you just said that it is not necessary, but it would not hurt if you can partner with somebody for Smart?  And regarding the Smart Forfour specifically, I'd like to understand, do you think that the premium carmaker can make good money on the B-segment and do you think that, I mean I fully understand that the Smart ForTwo is a specific concept with two seats for big cities like around Paris or London or Berlin, but I don't understand what can you make differently from a broad line carmaker on the B-segment under traditional B-segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, it's probably a fair assumption that no car manufacturer makes record profits in the B-segment.  The fact that we are positive with the Smart is related, as you already assumed, to the fact that we are not a ME2 product there, but that we are very special and not just a cheap entry.  But if you want a premium offering in that segment and we said it all the time, we would not consider to increase the Smart family with potentially a four-seater if it were just another four-seater.  And if our people don't have better fantasy than you, what could we do different than others, that we will not make it a four-seater.  If we do have ideas to do things different than it might make sense to go forward, but only under that condition, that is very clear.</p>
