          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am very, very happy to say good morning and welcome to Nordea's Press Conference on the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Report for 2012. The same procedure as previous years. It will be webcasted, so if you have answers after the presentation, please state your name and the newspaper that you work for. We have this year split the press conference from an analyst conference in order to give not least analysts a chance to also ask questions to Christian Clausen after their conference.</p>
          <p>But I actually do not have much more to say, but to give the floor to President and CEO of Nordea, Christian Clausen.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. It's a pleasure to welcome you, and it's nearly sold out. I can see there's one seat left, so show some interest, and I can say that I'm really pleased to see you all here today. The key message today is that we have laid the foundation to shape the future relationship bank. And in 2012, we had more customers, more capital and higher profit than ever before, and we are well-ahead of the plan which we announced in 2011, actually from this &#x2013; in this very room one and a half year ago.</p>
          <p>On that foundation, we will shape the future relationship bank, with closer customer relationship, cost and capital efficiency at a higher level, and increased return on equity. And the future relationship bank will build on closer relationships, and the ambition is to understand, advise, service and commit to each customer. I will come back to that. And we will ensure profitability above the cost of capital level and a stable capital buffer and, of course, in this way, we will be able to service and support our customers and provide financing. So this is the key message.</p>
          <p>Let's go into the numbers, and you have seen them. 2012 is a record year, more than &#x20AC;10 billion in income, up 8%. Costs slightly down, and we have a risk adjusted profit, which is actually up 20%. But maybe more importantly, we are building capital really fast. Our efficiency measures are turning out really well. So we have more than 13.1% Core Tier 1 capital now.</p>
          <p>So the headlines are actually very simple. We have grown our customer base. The number of relationship customers are up 2% in the year. We have grown our operating income, more customers and more business with the customers, by 8%. Operating expenses are slightly down. Efficiency measures all point in the right direction. This one is the productivity in terms of retail customers per FTE, which is up 9%, but there are number of other metrics I have shown previously, which shows the same direction. And return on equity is up 9%, and as l already said, the capital base is built and Core Tier 1 ratio is up 17%.</p>
          <p>Total income is stable during &#x2013; towards the end of the year, net interest income more or less flat, deposit margin somewhat under pressure. But fee and commission income is really up quite a lot, reflecting that we do more business with our customers, very much the savings area. Assets under management is up, asset management fees are up, but also fees from the debt capital markets where we serve our corporate customers is up. And net fair value, as you can see, is also up in the quarter. Net interest margin is flat in the quarter, is slightly down during the year, reflecting the lower interest rate, and the deposit margins are coming down.</p>
          <p>All this is based on the fact that we do still more advisory meetings with our customers. We have had more than 2 million customer advisory sessions last year. That's more than 8,000 per day of &#x2013; and thereby we also service much more relationship customers. As you can see, we keep steadily growing the number of relationship customers, which is a very important part of the strategy.</p>
          <p>Expenses are flat adjusted for FX and variable pay. As you can see, we now nine quarters in a row with flat cost. And as you will see in the plan, we expect that to continue. Net loan losses are slightly down; credit quality is clearly stabilizing and solid. We have positive rating migration with institution customers and household customers. We have stabilization in the amount of impaired loans as you can see. So credit quality across the board, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Baltics and Poland is all very good.</p>
          <p>We still have some loan losses in Denmark in shipping at some levels, but they seem to be well under control and stabilizing. And especially Denmark seems to be stabilizing, especially the housing market has during 2012 stabilized housing prices, especially in single family houses and flats are stabilizing, maybe slightly up. And this, of course, also mean that our loan loss provisions in Denmark has come down in the individual assist category.</p>
          <p>But also shipping seems to be bottoming out. We see on the first graph here shipping values, which are coming down from the peaks. So the red one is the tanker, and then we have the bulk and the container market. And you can see that ship values have come down to the level before the start of the bubble. And this is, of course, based on the fact that the order book for new ships globally has come down. It peaked after this bubble, where a lot of ships were ordered, but now we see the number in the order books coming down to a sustainable level.</p>
          <p>This all points to the fact that some time during the end of the year, maybe into 2014, we will see a stabilization of the shipping market. But, of course, we will in the coming quarters still see some customers struggling here.</p>
          <p>A few comments on each business area. And retail banking are showing really strong progress in the year, good progress on the income, expenses under control. So operating profit is up significantly, as you can see. And the strategic direction here is that we keep growing the franchise with the relationship banking model. And as we can see from the slide here, we have indeed, in the red line, grown the number of customers significantly in recent years. By the way, also the blue line, which is our income line.</p>
          <p>And all the strategies, all directed towards getting a closer relationship with our customers, getting closer to advising them, ensuring we become more efficient in the way we do that, giving more value to the customer, using all the new distribution channels, having more advisory meetings, making sure that our electronic channels are also giving value added to them. And all in all, the whole idea is to move closer to the customer.</p>
          <p>On wholesale banking, we also see good results; operating income is up. Expenses is also up, reflecting somewhat higher variable pay. But in general, the underlying cost is well under control. Here, a lot of work has happened and will happen going forward in aligning the value chain better. The corporate customers require a huge amount of services, and aligning our value chains to be able to deliver that to the customer will experience both high quality of the service and efficiency is really key.</p>
          <p>Also here, we have strict resource management. And going forward, we will even more take advantage of our strong position within the debt capital markets and the markets area in general, where you can see on the slide that the income is growing and very stable. Particularly now and going forward, it will be so that a lot of the corporate financing will be done under the capital markets, and we have a very strong position, as pointed out here.</p>
          <p>In 2012, we had a market share of 27% of the Nordic corporate markets. And I can tell you, by the way, we had a market share of 6% of the European, total European corporate markets. So we're helping a lot of customers to finance themselves through the capital market, and that is a clear direction and part of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Wealth management is also showing very nice figures; strong progress in income, expenses well under control, and operating profit up very significantly. And assets under management reaching new-times high &#x2013; all-times high, &#x20AC;218 billion.</p>
          <p>Here we're going to extension even more our advisory concepts, our products and services. We are going to increase the penetration, our retail getting even closer to the customers here, ensuring that they have the right savings advice. We grow our private banking, and we keep in life and pension to migrate products towards the capital light areas, which is better for the customers and require less capital.</p>
          <p>And on wealth management, we really have some nice metrics to show. I think the inflow slide is quite interesting. We had more than &#x20AC;9 billion extra under management flowing in from retail, from our global fund distribution, distributing our funds in 16 countries from institutional customers both in the Nordic area, but most of them actually globally, and also from our life and pension area.</p>
          <p>So an inflow metric of nearly 5% of assets under management compares extremely well on a European level. And part of it is, of course, based on a very strong performance, which you can see here. All our main composites show value-added, which is quite significant here showed in each category in basis points above the benchmarks.</p>
          <p>And this means that we are proposing an increased dividend, &#x20AC;0.35 per share. It's the same payout ratio as previously, just above 40%. We're also announcing in our release a new capital policy, updating it with all the new regulation, so we will be above 13% Core Tier 1 capital going forward, and excess capital will be returned to shareholders. And in order to have full flexibility in the way we manage our capital base, we will also ask for a share buyback mandate at the general meeting in March.</p>
          <p>Let me get to the future relationship bank, which is, of course, a next logical step. So what we have done in the recent years is we have built a relationship bank based on our values and relationship strategy. I've been telling about these more or less every quarter, so you know about it. And last year, one and a half year ago, we launched the New Normal plan to adjust to the new regulation.</p>
          <p>We are over-delivering on that plan, so now we have the foundation to take the next steps towards building the future relationship bank, which we define as a sustainable business model which delivers ROE well above cost of capital on this fully-loaded balance sheet. And fully-loaded balance sheet means a balance sheet with all the capital the regulation requires, all the liquidity buffers, and all the loan funding required.</p>
          <p>So this fully-loaded balance sheet needs to return an ROE above the cost of capital. And that is the story we &#x2013; and our commitment to the equity market. And at the same time, this business model, of course, also needs a strong commitment to our customers, and we are working further on that to strengthen our values to the customer, so they can really clearly get the benefits of having a very strong bank that can add value and can be of relevance to the customer.</p>
          <p>The relationship strategy, as I said, we have been conducting since 2006, and it has been instrumental in delivering results we have done. And with the 2015 plan, we take it one step further, and the heart of the strategy is to get closer to the customers, to understand, advise and service and commit to the customers. I'll come back to that.</p>
          <p>It's very important in the New Normal, because being so close to the customers, we can design efficient solution to customer needs, which require less capital funding and liquidity and is better for the customer. But this requires a dialog and the closeness, and that's the reason why we also say that we believe that going forward, the relationship strategy being close to the customer is even more important than it has been, because with the new regulation it requires that we can design the right solutions.</p>
          <p>And it is really a win-win. I've actually shown this slide one time before, but we still think it's a very important message that the customers will have a lot of benefits in this relationship strategy and they are actually feeding that back to us, that they actually see the benefits, because they can have confidence in the bank. We know the customer, the customer knows that we know him or her, and therefore, can rely that we do advise in the best interest of the customer knowing well how the customer balance sheet looks like. And we can service the customer with all needs, advise, but also ordinary banking transactions, and we commit to be there both on a sunny and a rainy day helping the customer as he or she progresses in her life and his life.</p>
          <p>And for the bank, of course, it has a lot of benefits, because that's the way we can manage our balance sheet in the New Normal with all this regulation. We can focus on the right customers which we can serve and the right products, projects. We can identify the efficient solutions, which makes it possible to be competitive and efficient on capital, and we can service with all the needs of the customer, and this, of course, gives us loyal and profitable customers. So a win-win in the relationship situation. And we have indeed delivered on this in the past six years.</p>
          <p>If we look upon the metrics here, which goes back to 2006, the number of relationship customers is up by nearly a third. Our operating income is up very significantly, by more than a third, nearly 50%, and we have a very strong increase in risk-adjusted profit, showing that we have contained cost well in the period at the same time and we have built a capital base very significantly. We have nearly doubled the capital base in the past six years, of course, also reflecting the need from the new regulation.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we will continue on this track, so we will generate capital and build capital, and will return excess capital to shareholders. We are reconfirming our ROE target of 15%. We are revising it, so it now is based on the Core Tier 1 rate of above 13% our new capital policy, and we will continue to deliver low volatility in our results. Our business model is designed and well-diversified so we can deliver a very stable result also to the shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now this capital build, I already mentioned, is very significant, as I said, and more than 9% increase per year. And, of course, it is based on the capital generation which is very substantial. We've actively built &#x20AC;20 billion of capital these six years; &#x20AC;12 billion has gone into equity and built equity, as we show over here, but the rest have been paid out, so a very significant capital generation.</p>
          <p>And that is, of course, mainly happening &#x2013; or giving the result that the Core Tier 1 is increasing, and we have during this year, as I said, built the Core Tier 1 to 13.1%, and as we go forward expect that level to be maintained. We will have the Basel III effect coming in later this year, as the CRD IV is being decided, and that will take down the Core Tier 1. Growth will, of course, take it down as well, but we have a number of efficiency measures which we will carry out. And we have, of course, retained earnings, so everything points to the fact that we expect that we will above 13% throughout the quarters in the coming period.</p>
          <p>The RWA development is, of course, the one the risk-weighted assets that supports this, and we have lowered the risk-weighted assets in 2012 to &#x20AC;168 billion, and we will do &#x2013; as we go forward, keep that level by having new regulation, being more efficient, keeping the level more or less during 2013 plus or minus, and going forward, we even have more efficiency plans. And these efficiency plans in capital is extremely important. We roll out new models which better control risks, we introduced new products, capital-light products that takes less capital to service the customers, and we ensure that we get more collateral and treat it in an efficient way so we have the risk contained in a better way.</p>
          <p>And going forward, we have more to do; we have more to do on our collection process, we have more to do to refine our exposure segmentation, and again, more capital-light products. So the plan points to the fact that we can keep the ROE more or less unchanged. Of course, this is subject to changes in regulation, but the regulation as we know it point in this direction.</p>
          <p>And this means that we also will deliver a return on equity which is according to our target. The main drivers will be income generation, cost efficiency and lower loan losses, which will drive up the ROE. And even though that we have the higher capital level from Basel III, and then on top of that we will have a normalized interest rate scenario one day, it is not sustainable to our interest rates way below inflation as we have and when that happens, we will be at the 15% return on equity, which of course will drive the capital build up.</p>
          <p>We'll keep &#x2013; keeping our cost unchanged. We have done that for nine quarters now, will add another eight quarters under plan approximately , which keeps costs more or less unchanged when we adjust for FX and variable salary. Of course, there is some volatility, but the underlying cost development is well-controlled and reflecting a very significant efficiency gain.</p>
          <p>And this thing about our robust and resilient business model is important to stress. We actually have the lowest income volatility of any bank during the past five years, and that is, of course, based on the fact that our exposure to our largest market is much smaller than most of our peers, which are more concentrated. And we also see that from our loan pie here that we have a significant exposure in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, which means that the volatility picture, of course, is very positive.</p>
          <p>And this is, of course, confirmed by the debt capital markets, which rate us as a AA-rated bank, one of very few in Europe, one of absolute most stable banks. And this, of course, is reflected in our CDS spread, which is among the very lowest compared to the European universe. And it's also meaning that we can attract long-term funding at very attractive levels, which is, of course, part of the business model.</p>
          <p>So the very short way to reflect it is that we will build a safe and reliable customer-oriented bank. The customers can rely us on. We will have the capital available to service them. We will grow our customer base and we will do more business with our customers. We will increase income. We will be more capital and cost efficiency &#x2013; efficient, and thereby delivering an ROE above cost of capital, generating capital to grow.</p>
          <p>And this means that we will have a strong bank with low funding and capital cost, and thereby being able to service our customers. That is the future relationship bank which is important, and it's based on the graph already shown, which I think is showing in a very simple way our business model; more  customers, the red line, more business with the customers make our income line grow, and adding in the efficiency picture means that we have a strong capital generation.</p>
          <p>We're also today announcing that we will do a Capital Markets Day in March, March 6, in London, and here we will go through the plan shaping the future, the financial initiatives and the credit risks. And we will very much dive into each business area telling much more about the way we're actually going to produce this business model in the coming years and what the key drivers are. So you are welcome to this meeting, March 6.</p>
          <p>This concludes my presentation. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, Christian. Now there will be chances to ask one-on-one questions for journalists after this conference. But if you have any questions you want to raise at the conference, you are naturally more than welcome.</p>
          <p>I think since I started in 2009, it has happened once that a journalist will ask a question on these press conferences. So I do not see any signs of changing that pattern, and thereby I think we can conclude this press conference as such.</p>
