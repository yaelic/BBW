          <p>Good day and welcome to the Novo-Nordisk Quarter One Event Conference Call. For your information, today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Welcome to this Novo-Nordisk conference call regarding our performance in the first three months of 2010 and outlook for the year. I'm Lars Rebien S&#xF8;rensen, CEO of Novo-Nordisk; and with me, I have our Chief Financial Officer, Jesper Brandgaard; Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, our Chief Science Officer; and present are also our Investor Relations officers.</p>
          <p>Today's earnings release is available on our homepage, novonordisk.com, along with the slides that we'll be using for this conference call. The conference call is scheduled to last approximately one hour, as usual. I'd also like to start the presentation by outline on slide number two. The Q&amp;A will begin in about 20 minutes.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number three. As always, I need to advise you this call will contain forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual result to differ materially from expectations. For further information on the risk factors, please see the earnings release and the slides prepared for this presentation.</p>
          <p>Also note that this conference call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available on Novo-Nordisk's website after the call.</p>
          <p>Please turn to slide number four. We are very satisfied with the performance in the first three months of 2010. In February, Victoza, our once-daily human GLP-1 analogue was launched in the United States. And so far, performance has been encouraging. Victoza also performs well in Europe, where it continues to gain market share and expand the GLP-1 class in key markets.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in the first three months 2010 was 9% reported and 11% in local currencies. The performance is driven by continued penetration of our modern insulins in all key markets and further supported by the launch of Victoza. From a regional perspective, the key growth drivers have been North America, international operations, which combined contributed with more than 80% of the sales growth.</p>
          <p> Within our new Norditropin FlexPro, a new prefilled injection pen for growth hormone has been approved and launched in United States. FlexPro has a unique new dosing mechanism, a user-friendly design and an audible click confirming dose delivery, all of which we believe will significantly increase convenience for our patients.</p>
          <p>Degludec and DegludecPlus, our two new-generation insulins, the ongoing phase 3 program continues to progress according to plan with the initiation of seven new studies during the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>The last phase 3a study to be conducted in the United States, Europe and Japan is expected to initiate during the second quarter of this year. During the first quarter, a phase 1 study of a new oral GLP-1 was also initiated.</p>
          <p>Now, turn to the financials. Our gross margin improved by 40 basis points to 80.3% during the first quarter of this year, which reflects an underlying improvement of 100 basis points in local currencies. Operating profit grew 15% reported and around 20% in local currencies.</p>
          <p>The passage of the U.S. Healthcare Reform and the increased clarity this provides on the future performance has enabled us to raise our guidance for 2010 sales from 6 to 10 to now 7 to 10 growth in local currencies.</p>
          <p>On operating profit, due to the passage of the healthcare reform and higher than expected non-recurring other operating income items, we raised our guidance for 2010 from around 10% to now more than 10%, also in local currencies.</p>
          <p>Turn to slide number five, our portfolio of modern insulins continued to show strong performance overall. In the first quarter of 2010, the portfolio of modern insulins was the main growth driver accounting for almost 70% of total sales growth in local currencies. Sales performance reflects the steady durable penetration of modern insulins into the expanding market.</p>
          <p>Victoza sales reached DKK370 million during the first quarter this year. It is, however, impacted by pipeline filling in the United States of approximately 250 million in connection with the launch in mid-February in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Biopharmaceuticals grew 6% reported and 8% in local currencies and here sales of NovoSeven was primarily realized in North America and reflect increased sales from treatment spontaneous bleeding episodes of congenital inhibitor patients. Room temperature-stable version of recombinant factor VIIa, NovoSeven RT was launched in Japan in April 2010.</p>
          <p>The full-year sales growth for NovoSeven is expected to be negatively impacted by the loss of the majority of the federal tender for NovoSeven in Russia. Sales of our growth hormone therapy product Norditropin increased 7% in local currencies in the first quarter with North America being the main contributor.</p>
          <p>Novo-Nordisk remains the single largest company in the global growth hormone market with 25% market share measured by volume.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide for an update on the regional sales split. In the first three months of this year all regions contributed to growth measured in local currencies, North America was the main contributor with 68% share of the growth measured in local currencies followed by international operations and Europe contributing 19% and 12% respectively.</p>
          <p>Sales in North America increased 21% in the first quarter, and is driven by strong performance in the modern insulins as well as the mentioned pipeline fitting for Victoza. The European sales is still impacted by the currently low volume growth of the insulin market assumed to be of temporary nature and linked to the launch of the incretin mimetics in Europe.</p>
          <p>Sales growth in Japan continues to be impacted by a change in the underlying insulin market dynamics where growth of the basal segment, in particular the modern insulins, has accelerated at the expense of premixed segment where Novo-Nordisk historically has had its strongest position.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the overview of key elements to the U.S. healthcare reform which affects us. The U.S. healthcare reform is expected to have a negative effect on Novo-Nordisk financially in the coming years. However, longer term elements such as expansion of number of people covered by medical insurance and new diabetes specific initiatives might be positive to us.</p>
          <p>We think that the reform will have a financial negative impact of around 1% of global sales in 2010. The main element leading to this is the expansion of the Medicaid service pricing to manage Medicaid which previously has been paying commercial rates. In 2011, two additional elements will increase the impact to around 2% of sales. These are new manufactures fees and the industry's commitment to partly cover the out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare patients in the coverage gap known as a donut hole.</p>
          <p>Please also turn to the next slide for an update on the U.S. launch of Victoza. The rollout of Victoza is progressing well. Globally Victoza has been commercialized &#x2013; commercially launched in 15 markets including U.S., Germany, U.K. and France. We expect to continue the global rollout throughout this year. In the United States, Victoza is off to an encouraging start. We're now 10 weeks into the launch of Victoza-has gained more than 10% of the GLP-1 market.</p>
          <p>Data and anecdotal feedback from the U.S. confirms the significant awareness of Victoza and a high level of interest in its key characteristics such as effective glycaemic control, once-daily administration and weight loss benefit amongst physicians and patients.</p>
          <p>To sustain this promising launch, good market access through formulary coverage is of course important. Current coverage provides for almost all licensed tier 3 level, a coverage which we over time gradually expect to improve to tier 2 level.</p>
          <p>Turn to the next slide on the performance of Victoza in Europe. In Europe, where Victoza was originally first launch, market penetration continues to improve and market leadership had been obtained in a number of European markets. In Germany, Victoza has so far been successful in expanding the whole GLP-1 class, the latest March year data from February 2010 shows a 2.1% market share of the total diabetes market. The penetration; it shows a current trend and feedback from physicians and patients are very positive.</p>
          <p>In the U.K., Victoza is also gaining market share and now holds more than 1% of the total diabetes care market. This should be seen in the context where we continued to expand the primary care trust formulary access for Victoza.</p>
          <p>With this, I would like to hand over to Mads, who will give an update on the development within our clinical pipeline.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Lars. Please turn to the next slide for an overview of the R&amp;D pipeline within diabetes and obesity. With more than 8,000 patients now entered into the BEGIN and BOOST programs for Degludec and DegludecPlus respectively. The pivotal trials for these new insulin products continue to progress at a high pace.</p>
          <p>During the first quarter of 2010, Novo Nordisk has initiated seven out of eight trials in the fourth wave of the phase 3a program to support regulatory filing. These trials use insulin glargine as comparative product and evaluate the use of insulin degludec once-daily or three times weekly. The last of the phase 3a try at market trials is expected to be initiated during this quarter,</p>
          <p>Scientific results as well as several phase 2 study results on Degludec and DegludecPlus have been accepted for three oral and two poster presentations at the 70th annual meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando, Florida, which will take place from the 25th to the 29th of June this year. At this conference, more than 20 abstracts on Victoza have also been accepted for oral or poster presentation.</p>
          <p>Novo Nordisk has completed a phase 1 study with a fixed ratio combination product consisting of Degludec and Victoza. The results of the study were encouraging and support full product development. Novo Nordisk is engaging at the current time in dialogue with the regulatory authorities regarding the design of the remaining trial program for the Degludec, Victoza combination product.</p>
          <p>In March 2010, Novo Nordisk initiated a phase 1 trial for an orally administered GLP-1 analogue formulated using Merrion Pharmaceutical's GIPET Technology.</p>
          <p>In brief, the Novo Nordisk's R&amp;D strategy seeks to maximize the likelihood of success for its oral diabetes protein portfolio by adopting an approach of clinically investigating several different tailor-made degradation persistent analogues of insulin and GLP-1 formulated through the use of various state-of-the-art oral protein delivery technologies.</p>
          <p>In China, Novo Nordisk filed PrandiMet for approval in March 2010. The fixed dose combination product, consisting of repaglinide and metformin, for regulatory approval with the SFDA.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an overview of the Haemophilia pipeline. This slide provides an overview of our portfolio within Haemostasis. It is a maturing clinical portfolio with a handful of recombinant engineered short and long-acting factor VII, VIII, IX and XIII compounds with which we strive to expand our current product portfolio into both on-demand and prophylactic therapy both within the general haemophilia and inhibitor segments, respectively.</p>
          <p>As all projects are progressing according to plans, I will jump to the final slide on the pipeline of other biopharmaceuticals. I have two comments to our pipeline of growth hormone projects. Firstly, in relation to the ongoing pediatric phase 2a study with NN8630, the growth hormone derivative intended for once-weekly injection. Recruitment is slightly delayed and we now expect to complete this trial in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Finally, as Lars mentioned we received U.S. FDA approval last month for Norditropin FlexPro, a novel prefilled pen for growth hormone administration to children and adults. The Norditropin FlexPro has a unique new automatic dosing mechanism, a user-friendly design and an audible click confirming completion of dose delivery.</p>
          <p>We have already launched Norditropin FlexPro this month at the Pediatric Endocrinology Nursing Society also called PENS conference in the United States and feedback is very positive indeed.</p>
          <p>With that, over to you Jesper for an update on the financials.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Mads. Please turn to the next slide. We are satisfied with the financial results for the first three months of 2010. Total sales growth was 9% as reported and 11% in local currencies. Growth was realized within both diabetes care and biopharmaceuticals, and the primary growth contribution originated from the modern insulins. The gross margin for the first three months of 2010 increased to 80.3 compared to 79.9 in the same period of 2009. This reflects improved production efficiency, higher average selling prices in primarily the U.S. and the favorable product mix development. The gross margin was negatively impacted by around 0.6 percentage points due to the currency development, primarily for the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen.</p>
          <p>Total non-production-related costs increased by 9% to 6,827 million. This development primarily reflects the costs associated with the global launch of Victoza, impacting sales and distribution costs, and the ongoing phase 3 program for the next generation of insulins, impacting R&amp;D costs.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that a higher than expected non-recurring other operating income of 100 million related to the settlement of an IP dispute was recorded in the first quarter of 2010. Operating profit for the first three months of 2010 increased by 15% to more than 4.3 billion compared to the same period last year. Net financials showed a net expense of 65 million in the first three months of 2010 compared to a net expense of 305 million in the same period of 2009.</p>
          <p>Included in net financial is the results from associated company with an income of 65 million, primarily related to an accounting gain in relation to the successful public offering of shares by ZymoGenetics in January 2010. In the same period of 2009, the results from associated company was an expense of 35 million.</p>
          <p>The number of full-time employees has increased 6%, reflecting expansion in the markets in International Operations.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for an update on the currency development. This slide shows the development of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen versus the Danish kroner. Further, it illustrates the expected annual impact on the operating profit of a 5% movement in our key invoicing currencies and the extent of hedging for the same currencies. Recently, the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen have appreciated versus the Danish kroner and they are now above the average level of 2009.</p>
          <p>For the first three months of 2010, the foreign exchange result was an expense of 137 million compared to an expense of 327 million in the first three months of 2009. This development reflect losses on foreign exchange hedging of especially U.S. dollar due to the recent appreciation versus the Danish kroner. Foreign exchange hedging losses of around 700 million have been deferred for future income recognition in 2010 and 2011 respectively.</p>
          <p>Please turn to the next slide for the financial outlook for 2010. Novo Nordisk now expects sales growth in 2010 of 7 to 10% measured in local currencies. This is based on expectations of continued market penetration for Novo Nordisk's key strategic products within diabetes care, including the continued global roll-out of Victoza and biopharmaceuticals as well as expectations of continued intense competition, potential generic competition to NovoNorm/Prandin and the impact from the implementation of the healthcare reform in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Given the current level of exchange rate versus Danish kroner, the reported sales growth is now expected to be 3 percentage points higher than what it is measured in local currencies.</p>
          <p>For 2010, growth in operating profit is now expected to be more than 10%, measured in local currencies, primarily driven by the slight change in the sales growth expectations. Given the current level of exchange rate versus the Danish kroner, the reported operating profit growth is now expected to be 6 percentage points higher than what measured in local currency.</p>
          <p>For 2010, Novo Nordisk expects a net financial expense of around 700 million. The current expectation primarily reflects losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts. The effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be maintained at around 23%.</p>
          <p>Capital expenditure is expected to be around 3.5 billion in 2010, primarily related to investments in the new insulin formulation and filling plant in China and new device capacity in Denmark. Expectations for depreciation, amortization and impairment losses are around 2.7 billion whereas free cash flow is now expected to be more than 12 billion.</p>
          <p>All of the above expectations are based on the assumption that the global economic environment will not significantly alter the business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2010 and that currency exchange rates, especially for the U.S. dollar, remain at the current level versus the Danish kroner during the remaining part of 2010.</p>
          <p>This concludes our presentation of the financial results. Lars will now moderate the Q&amp;A session. Please note that there will be a maximum limit of two questions per individual with the objective of allowing as many conference participants as possible to have the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Jesper and Mads. Please note that this conference is being taped and a replay will be made available on our website. And, operator, we are now ready to take the first question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
    </section>
    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Michael Novod of Handelsbanken. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, it's Michael Novod from Handelsbanken. Two questions, first of all, are you worried about the performance of International Operations? And could you also elaborate on the reasons to the pressure we're seeing? In that question, how much is the tender offer or the tender in Russia that you lost in terms of NovoSeven and also still what is China growing &#x2013; at what rate is China growing in Q1? And then the second question is to your insulin GLP-1 combo. Is it fair to assume that what you are pursuing now is to piggyback on the Degludec phase 3 data and the Victoza registration and then start direct into phase 3 by early 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. This is Lars Rebien. I will try to address the first questions relating to IO. And then hopefully Mads Krogsgaard will address the combo product and what the intentions are going forward in terms of the development program for that.</p>
          <p>Are we worried about the performance of IO? No, not really. We are impacted by some unfortunate developments for our business in particular in Russia, which has delayed importation of some insulins in Russia. But in particular, the very rapid approval of a NovoSeven-like product from a local manufacturer in Russia which has come somewhat of a surprise to us in that it has been very expedient and with less than transparent regulatory requirement being fulfilled. All in all, I wish an intention, a political intention for import substitution in Russia. So we can expect to see more activities on that front going forward.</p>
          <p>Then, in addition to that, when you compare the first quarter of 2010 that you had -we are comparing it to a very strong quarter of 2009 and that makes the comparison slightly more difficult, we have seen continuous strong growth of our business in China. The amount &#x2013; you asked, for the question, about the size of the tender of NovoSeven in Russia. We are estimating the requirements to be around DKK200 million on an annual basis. And we had anticipated to win that tender in the beginning of this year and we're not going to do that.</p>
          <p>So all in all, we're used to seeing swings like this. There are some other tenders in different parts of the world that has been postponed that were expected in the first quarter. And they are hence likely to appear in the second quarter. And so we are still expecting to see growth rate in International Operation in the area of 15 to 20% on an annual basis but with occasional quarterly swings. I think that covers that. And then, Mads, on to the combo product.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, first of all, Michael, just on a technical note, like to highlight the notion that this and other products where insulin is an integral partner in the combination product will be considered not as fixed dose combinations for which we have regulatory guidelines approved both by the FDA and EMA, but rather as fixed ratio products that are reminiscent but not identical to, for instance, the premixed insulins. Henceforth, we have no distinct guidelines to follow.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it is true that piggybacking on the Victoza approval as we have it today, supplemented with the extremely large degludec safety database that will be existing at the point in time when we submit, is expected to allow us to move directly into the phase 3 pivotal trial program. At least this is what we are discussing with the regulators at present. Ideally, of course, such a product compared to a GLP-1 is seeking to have the benefit of even higher treatment success rates and, compared to a pure-play insulin, less hypo and less weight gain.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads, and thanks for the question. Next question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Our next question comes from Sachin Jain of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, just a couple of questions. Firstly just to follow-on on the GLP-1, that combo, just a comment on the timing. Is it fair to assume you'd probably need to submit the degludec package before you could start that phase 3? Secondly on semaglutide, just to check whether you were thinking about phase 2 data at ADA? You didn't mention that. And just thought process on that compound and progress in the phase 3 versus the combo? And then finally just one of the aspects, could you just talk about second half growth rate pressures which has resulted in guidance being nudged up a little bit versus the 20% local currency growth rate in the first quarter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Mads Krogsgaard, again, a comment on the GLP-1 combo and whether or not that requires a filing of degludec to enable a continuation into phase 3. Semaglutide, what's the current thinking, are we moving ahead with that into phase 3? And then Jesper, growth prices for the second half of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well first of all it is true that to be able to submit the kind of regulatory dose shift for this combo product, you would expect to have two individual regulatory doses, either approved i.e. for Victoza or at least submitted and potentially approved in the case of degludec in order to support a smaller and more slim and faster program as the one we're suggesting. That does not mean, however, that to enter into pivotal trials i.e. phase 3 program, that you would need to have that, at that point in time, rather that you need to have completion of the preclinical trials plus a safety database that justifies entrance to phase 3 and this will be the case, for sure, as we move into that phase.</p>
          <p>As regards semaglutide, I have not distinctly mentioned the ADA and that is true. I'm not sure that the phase 2 data, which are encouraging, are being presented there but a host of other data are being presented and they will of course be published. We stick to the &#x2013; maintain the notion that we will move towards a phase 3 stop/go decision in the second half of this year on this once weekly human GLP-1 analog.</p>
          <p>And as to your question as regards, how does semaglutide stack up against the combo? I think, semaglutide, you should see as a product that probably has the same stable profile as Victoza liraglutide being a human GLP-1 analog with a smooth pharmacokinetics, but has a lesser injection frequency. Whereas the combination product, on the other hand, as I just mentioned is supposed to provide, you can argue, the best of the insulin world with even high efficacy than for GLP-1 and the best of the GLP-1 world with the benefits on glucose dependent, lack of hypoglycemia and anti &#x2013; body weight reductions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Mads. And Jesper, what are your predictions for the second half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we will have to anticipate that the impact from the patent expiry on <mark type="inaudible" /> in Europe will ratchet up during the year. So far we have only seen a generic competition occurring in Germany which accounts for less than 10% of the European sales, and we have markets, like France and Italy, which both covers around 20% of sales each, which are likely to be exposed for generic competition this year.</p>
          <p>The U.S. situation is also potentially hitting us in the second half of 2010 with the generic competition occurring for Prandin.</p>
          <p>In terms of the investments we have in R&amp;D and selling and distribution you'd also see them ratcheting up in the second half of the year as you get speed and momentum behind the Victoza launches and the full year effect of the degludec programs; and in combination probably will start in the CV programs for Victoza also in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>We could also anticipate that we are getting into more challenging quarters for our NovoSeven sales and we would anticipate a mid single-digit growth level for NovoSeven for the full year 2010. And then finally, you should be aware that we have recorded a 100 million non-recurring gain in the first quarter regarding a settlement of IP property, and we don't anticipate that we will have other non-recurring IP income in the latter part of the year. So those four factors should be the prime drivers.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Jack Scannell, Sanford Bernstein. Two degludec questions, the first is, this is the first new insulin analogue since the FDA changed its guidelines on cardiovascular risk. I just wonder what that means for the design and timing of the phase 3 program, so when might this drug be filed?</p>
          <p>Secondly, this is also the first insulin analogue since &#x2013; at least some people became concerned that LANTUS may have a higher cancer risk than other analogues. Is the program in any way designed or structured to try and look at that issue more definitively?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, as regards cardiovascular guidelines vis-&#xE0;-vis the FDA, they have in those guidelines stipulated that for an injection-based insulin product, there is not a need per se for doing a pre-approval cardiovascular risk assessment in the formulistic form. However, Novo-Nordisk has decided, in conjunction and in collaboration with the U.S. regulatory agency, to do a major adverse cardiovascular event adjudication by independent external committee to live up to the spirit of the overall guidelines as pertains to cardiovascular risk.</p>
          <p>Vis-&#xE0;-vis, the cancer issue, we have very extensively looked into degludec. It's not possible to study human cancer, you can say, rate of diagnosis in trials even in spite of the size of 10,000 patients as we have it for BEGIN and BOOST because the numbers are simply too low. But that being said, we have done extremely extensive pre-clinical in-vitro and also in-vivo investigations into the potential for cancer development, or I should rather say, lack of potential for cancer development associated with this insulin analogue.</p>
          <p>We have completed the pre-clinical trials with no findings of cancer and as pertains to the relative finding, insulin and IGF-I receptor, we have a ratio that is more beneficial than is the case for human insulin.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good morning. It's Peter Verdult here from Morgan Stanley. Just, Jesper, on the gross margin, on the underlying 100 basis points improvement, can you just give your usual split between price productivity and mix? And just on price, can we assume that the net price increase in the U.S. around two to 3%? And also just staying on the gross margin, did the accounting for Victoza stock have any meaningful impact that we should be aware of? And then Mads, for the second question, just on degludec again, with respect to Phase II data ADA, are we going to get any sort of data on the hypoglycemia angle here or is that going to come with the Phase III package and is there any chance of getting Phase III data for Q3?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Jesper, In terms of the productivity improvements, can you sort of give a rough breakdown of the 100 basis points and of course also just comment on whether the pipeline's filling any initial sales of Victoza, are there any major impact on this, and then Mads over to you on data taken and whether or not hypo data will be into the ADA?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we actually had positive impact on our gross margin and if we do it in local currencies, we are looking at approximately 100 basis point improvement. And Roth, almost half of that was related to a &#x2013; actually a mix improvement as we have an improved production economy for our portfolio of modern insulins which provides an upgrade over the human insulins and then linked to that also of course Victoza now enters the mix compared to last year and Victoza is, to a large degree, produced in the same purification and fermentation facilities that we use for the insulins and is currently being sold in a device very similar to the FlexPen device. So there is clear economies of scale for Victoza and that of course helps this mix effect.</p>
          <p>Then in terms of price, we have a slight positive price impact and that price impact is net of the effect of the U.S. healthcare reform. And then the final element as usually is continued improvement in the overall production economy, especially for the portfolio of insulins.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much Jesper. Data <mark type="inaudible" /> ADA <mark type="inaudible" /> hypo, Mads? ?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, Peter, in terms of the ADA, indeed there will be focus on hypo, it is so that as I mentioned we have three oral presentations and two posters approved for presentation. And indeed we'll look into the mechanism of protraction which is dual in HFO, for soluble state self-association in the interstitial fluids giving most of the protraction plus spiced up with albumin binding as in the case of Levemir. There will also be focus on duration of activity and among others, there will be presentation of the three times weekly regimen up against once-daily glargine, and in all of the clinical studies there will also be a focus on the rate of hypoglycemia which is reduced in the case of Degludec.</p>
          <p>Phase III data will indeed start accumulating in the second half of this year. I have to caution you that the more exciting ones where, for instance LANTUS, is used as the head-on comparative drug are not the first studies to report but they will start emerging as the year comes towards an end.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. Just two questions as I am allowed to do that. The selling expenses, the cost margin just slightly above 29%, is that a level that we are going to see sort of going forward or are there any sort of specific effects bringing it down there? And then secondly just comparing the performance of Victoza in the U.K. towards &#x2013; against Germany, is there any sort of local variation as it seems that the uptake in the U.K. seems somewhat slower than what we are seeing in Germany? So my two questions. thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Jesper, if you get a comment on our expectation for the selling expenses which are currently running at 29-30 and how that's likely to evolve over the next quarters, then I'll take care of Victoza in U.K. and Germany.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The launch of Victoza, of course only happened in mid of this quarter and hence we expect the full quarter impact to hit from Q2 onwards. And of course, we had a short notice to prepare the actual launch. So you can expect them to run at full steam from Q2 onwards, and hence I would anticipate that our selling and distribution ratio moved up to around 30% in the subsequent quarter and also in that ballpark for the full year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then onto Victoza, there are sort of distinct national differences between our anticipation and indeed the performance in Germany and the U.K. We've traditionally seen that there's usually a faster uptake in Germany, whereas in the U.K. due to the formal area adoptions by the PTCs, that usually takes longer. What we do anticipate though is that the &#x2013; that the overall GLP-1 market in the U.K. could be larger than that of Germany, so we are off to a very fast start in Germany. There are some leveling off of the growth rates in Germany at the moment whereas there is a slow but very steady sustainable growth of our penetration in the U.K. And so both markets are meeting our expectations. And in fact, the most interesting observation is that we are growing the market in both markets where in a way you could simply add the former Byetta market to that of Victoza and then it's of course the most important long-term perspective not just outgrowing or taking up patients from Byetta, but expand in the GLP-1 market. And we just recently launched in France and that should prove also to be a quite substantial market and the initial uptakes are quite positive. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, Martin Parkh&#xF8;i, Danske Bank. Also two questions. Firstly with respect to U.S. If you look at the margin development in U.S. it is looks like that you are at least losing slight momentum in your analogue franchise in U.S., since the launch of Victoza. Is there anything that you also have seen and could you comment on that? And then secondly, with respect to the inventory build up of Victoza which was around quarter of a billion in the first quarter. What you would expect for the rest of the year? Will we end up the year with this 250 million, should we go lower or should we go higher?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you very much. Jesper, would you comment on the last question perhaps in terms of what our expectations are? We should definitely expect to sell more than the 250 million that's currently in the pipeline. So with that lead in, over to you Jesper.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah Martin, if you just go back and remember the launch we had on Levemir, there we also had a significant initial pipeline fill. And then following that more than 100, I think in the ballpark of 150 million in pipeline fill. I think subsequently, we saw four to six months after the reorders began for Victoza, that would have the indication that you should not expect to see any <mark type="inaudible" /> the pipeline movements in the U.S. should stabilize and there will be a close correlation between the end market demand and the actual <mark type="inaudible" /> sales that we will record from thereon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Jesper. In terms of market in the U.S. overall, quite frankly we're seeing a stable market share development of all our franchises in the U.S. We've had a relatively nice and strong performance in the first quarter of Levemir and that is of course interesting to know in as much as it's not a secret that most of our retailing activity is actually on Victoza at the moment, but that seems to be a good attention span in terms of the physicians which allows us to also detail our excellent portfolio while we had their attention in bringing Victoza to their attention. So things are going well also in the U.S. especially, thank you. Next question, please.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much for taking my question. I'm afraid it's another one for Mads on Degludec. Yes, if I look at ClinicalTrials.gov at least from what I can see you've got about 11 phase 3 projects in BEGIN. But only two of those were on the three times a week dosing regime for Degludec and now notice one is dosing in the AM, one appears to be dosing in the PM. So I could sort of interpret from that you've got a lot more confidence in Degludec as a once daily drug as opposed to a three times per week. So I'm just trying to assess that that's a fair interpretation of what we see? Thanks.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, quite frankly, you do know that completely new paradigms in terms of how people treat diabetes in particularly with an injectable such as insulin, they typically do not appear overnight and that means that Novo-Nordisk clearly is going to seek a label for the three times weekly concept, because having two trials powered the way they are and as you correctly allude to also giving both AM and PM dosing should allow us for a full label as regards the three times weekly. At the same time we have to say the gold standard treatment of insulin therapy is to start when all is fail either prime, second or third line with a once daily basal insulin and that is what you have to go up against and prove that you're better than and what we're doing is powering the 11 BEGIN trials at this dose of them that are up against other basal insulins in type two diabetes to actually prove that we can take glucose levels to the below 7% HbA1c level in the presence of benefits such as reduced, significantly reduced clinically meaningful hyperglycemia rates as compared to, for instance, insulin glargine.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Just two questions. One on Victoza, I think you've said previously you do not expect it to contribute anything material for the profit line this year. Do you still standby that? And then the second question on the Degludec &#x2013; Victoza combination. It's interesting to note that you've gone for fixed ratio, I'm just wondering why you've not &#x2013; decided to not to go for a fully titratable insulin element to that pen. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Lars Rebien here. In terms of Victoza, yes, we're doing slightly better perhaps than what we had originally anticipated, but it's still largely neutral in terms of the P&amp;L impact this year. Next, fixed as opposed to titratable insulin regimen as part of that combo, that's sounds like a complicated equation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well actually first of all the nature of insulin is such that the therapeutic window you are playing within for any insulin even Degludec is of course rather narrow, i.e. you have to be able driven by the mornings or the evenings fasting glucose levels be able to on a daily basis adjust your insulin dose. Now the only way through which you could alter the ratio between insulin element and the GLP-1 element would be if you had a sophisticated device where you had a dual chamber system with a titratable instant dose with a fixed contribution from GLP-1 on a day-to-day basis. This would on the one hand be very sophisticated and inconvenient to harness and I have to say our modeling tells us that the GLP-1 ranges will be working within for most markets, I see such that we'll reap the benefits of being in a pharmacological range of treatment for both the insulin analogue Degludec, and the GLP-1 analogue Liraglutide. But obviously the more creative engineers in the company have been looking into ideas surrounding what you're talking about. It doesn't seem to be that feasible and may be not even attractive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we are I suppose talking about Type 2 diabetics where they still have some insulin capacity left and that renders itself more amenable to a convenient fixed dose combination as opposed to very narrowly titrating which is what you would like to do ideally on a type 1 patient if that were the case. Thank you very much. Next question, please.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hello gentlemen. Yet another question on the combo. Just wanted to make sure how you want to position the drug, are you targeting that the individual components of the combo, would be the same as the one you separately so that you can shoot for higher efficacy or would you rather be targeting similar efficacy to the individual components and have lower dose of both insulin's and GLP-1 to target lower side effects?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Mads.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well. First of all, we will be targeting a broad label i.e., we will seek realizing I mean, you have to consider two facts one is that in the case of Victoza, we are really advocating that this should be positioned logically as a second-line therapy as add-on to metformin and this is happening very successfully. But in spite of that we are also seeing rather extensive use of Victoza in other labeled indications such as combination with two orals and even as monotherapy and sometimes in combination with insulin even though that is not formally approved at this point as you know we have a major trial ongoing.</p>
          <p>So learning from the past you can say GLP-1 being the kind of agent it is, it's actually rendering itself to treatment both as monotherapy combination with orals and even combination with insulin and what we hence are seeking here is to have a broad label which will allow us on the one hand to use to it to intensify therapy where people need something more than Victoza, they may have been using Victoza for a few years and need some element of intensification but also those patients who have been on a basal insulin and who seek to reap some of the benefits of adding a GLP-1 could render themselves with this kind of therapy and even multiple OED fails or anti-diabetic failures of course are logical choices.</p>
          <p>So I cannot give you a very crisp and clear response other than say we will be seeking a broad label and then we will be optimizing our marketing strategy before we hit the market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much. It's Brian Bourdot from Barclays Capital calling from London. Two questions please, the first on Liraglutide and the second on your guidance. Firstly on Liraglutide, I was just wondering what, whether you could give us an update in terms of your conversations with regulators, whether you will be pursuing that indication, or whether you think the risk-benefit equation doesn't work very &#x2013; anymore or whether approaches by other companies might be more competitive?</p>
          <p>Second question is your guidance: I see you're still including an allowance for generic Prandin in the U.S. despite a favorable appeals court ruling recently turning the issue into one of validity for your combination patent. Don't you think this is on the conservative side? Thanks very much.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">

          <p>Thank you very much. Two questions. One for Liar in connection with <mark type="inaudible" /> that's Mads and the other one guidance on the court case, Jesper would you care to disclose what we have in our guidance at the moment and what our assumptions are. Mads first.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, indeed as you know we do have one smallish phase 3 trial in only about 500 patients ongoing which is the body weight maintenance study where people have first lost at least 5% of body weight and then we see whether we can maintain on further increase that loss with Victoza or Liraglutide. In the case of the full blown program that has not been initiated. We have actually asked a number of questions to the U.S. regulators, the FDA. And we expect to provide you with an update on how they stand on this one at around the half year release in August, so more on that at that point in time.</p>
          <p>But in terms of the competitor landscape, we stand firmly by the belief that liraglutide, from a benefit risk perspective i.e. in terms of what does liraglutide do to body mass index as compared to its overall side effect profile. We believe this fully stacks up in a favorable way, as compared to some of the late-stage products that have, for instance, been submitted to the agency, but that are mostly either combinations or standalone products within the CNS kind of field of obesity research. So pending the regulatory dialog, we intend to proceed of course if the outcome from the FDA feedback is allowing us to do so.</p>

          <p>Well, I don't know, I guess, if you give a range for something where you don't have a certain view on what will be the outcome if providing such a range would qualify you for being conservative, yes, so then I guess we are conservative, because we don't exactly know what is going to materialize and that's part of the reason why we provide the range we do. I think it's probable that we will have impact in Europe from the Novo situation and I think it's possible that we will have an impact from the U.S. situation, I know that the trial is starting on 1st June, on the validity of the patent and we should expect the ruling in Q3. And as we all aware, the impact from potential generic competition in the U.S. is more or less imminent following a possibility of entering the market. So we'll have to wait and see how that goes out and then we'll probably narrow in our range as we get closer and get more knowledge.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my question. It's Richard Vosser from JP Morgan. A question on your U.S. healthcare reform guidance, I just wanted to just clarify the 2% guidance of a hit in 2011, whether that was a full 2% incremental on 2010 and whether it was an extra 1%?</p>
          <p>And secondly, on the growth in Europe, the growth stayed relatively low, 4%, I'm just wondering is there any impact from the U.S. &#x2013; sorry, European healthcare reform measures. You've quantified the impact on the U.S., but just wondering what the impact might be from the German white paper on healthcare reforms, and more widely from the pricing measures implemented in Europe as a result of the deficit?</p>
          <p>And one question on Degludec, if I could. Just for a moment assuming that there would be a generic Lantus, how much better do you think Degludec has to be, to be able to sustain premium pricing, whether that's in terms of the convenience of the three times a week dosing or hypoglycemia? Any views you could give on that would be great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Yes, that's a couple of questions on healthcare reform and then there is Degludec, again Mads over to you on <mark type="inaudible" />. In terms of U.S. healthcare reform, it's an additional 1% over and above the impact that we see this year. So it's not another 2%, let's be clear on that. We're talking about an impact &#x2013; overall impact to Novo Nordisk of around DKK1 billion, so that is very clear.</p>
          <p>Yes, the European market is, to some extent, impacted by healthcare reform. In Germany, we've had a ruling on basal modern insulins where the German GPA has requested that the basal modern insulins can only be reimbursed to the level of that of human insulins for type 2 diabetes, but they are on the market, they're fully reimbursed for type 1 diabetes and other individuals that are particular cases. And how that is going to pan out depends a little bit on the individual contracts that the individual manufacturers will strike with the congregates in Germany. And for obvious reasons I cannot disclose our negotiation strategy, but it's our anticipation that there will be a negative impact on our business in Germany as a result of this, we will of course try to find the best possible solution for Novo Nordisk to mitigate that situation.</p>
          <p>And then in terms of other destinations, yes, we are seeing, in particular, impact on day sales outstanding. Eastern European nations and Southern European nations are finding it increasingly difficult as a result of the pressure on public finances to repay their bills, and we have to extend credit terms and in some cases we get into dispute with the governments as to whether or not we are willing to offer our most modern products at requested price reductions. We have seen recent cases in former Eastern Europe where there has been some quite severe requests for price reductions. And our stance on this is that we are not going to reduce the prices of our modern insulins below what we believe is a feasible sustainable European price level because of the parallel export, which takes place in Europe that would then impact and give a cascade of price reductions throughout Europe.</p>
          <p>So it is not like we are withdrawing from these markets, we will of course continue to have our very high quality, human insulins available in these markets, should the governments decide that they wish to go to a more inexpensive alternative. Usually the case I have to say is that at the end of the day the governments weigh up the inconvenience of transferring a large number of patients from modern insulins back to human insulins, that risk being at a disadvantage to accepting a reasonable pricing for these modern products.</p>
          <p>So, yes, we're seeing pressure almost in all countries in Europe as a consequence of the economic crisis that we're in right now.</p>
          <p>Mads, Degludec and what differential do you require to maintain outlook for Degludec introduction in the face of a generic Lantus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, that's a good question, you can address it from two perspectives, either the payer's perspective or the patient's perspective. And if you look the payer's perspective, we've investigated quite a bit of the health technology assessment models that have been used &#x2013; the tools that have been used, for instance, for cost effectiveness assessments by the NICE institute in U.K. et cetera.</p>
          <p>And they are pretty harsh on one thing, hard outcomes in terms of hypoglycemia and the likes of it. And in that regard, our assessment is that the benefit that the analogues of the first generation such as glargine and Levemir or detemir provided over and above human impaired insulin i.e. in the 30 to 35% range. A reduction in hypoglycemia, for instance nocturnal hypos is something that there is a willingness to pay for.</p>
          <p>And on the one hand, our Phase II studies fully substantiate that we will be able to meet such an improvement and so do the clamp studies that have investigated glucose variability and intra-patient coefficients of variability as you will see at the EASD conference late this year.</p>
          <p>Then from the payer, sorry, from the patient perspective, it all boils down to other elements on top of hypos, such as dosing convenience which is clearly even more elaborate for Degludec that can be used any time of the day from day-to-day without any strings attached. But also dosing frequency with the three times weekly being perceived to be beneficial compared to once daily. And there will be other convenience elements also in Degludec that I will refrain from elaborating on at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this is Lars Rebien here, it is of course a very, very good question indeed because we can anticipate that there will be European markets where reimbursement levels will be adjusted and hence it is of course of utmost importance that we can show clinical superiority with Degludec and DegludecPlus, over and above the current products which are being used otherwise we might end up in similar situations, like the one we were just discussing in Germany of being sort of lumped in with old fashioned human insulins because there is a sort of a clothy scientific essence that the benefits are not substantial enough.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I am sorry I am calling from an airport line, so there is a little bit of noise. Actually many of my questions have been dealt with. The one thing I wanted to just touch on quickly, in your assessment looking at the European pricing et cetera, do you have any assumptions that take account of the possibility of Humalog, clearly an insulin analogue going off patent and the generic, whether they are true generics or not, but hitting on a pricing perspective, so kind of making the equation a bit more difficult when it comes to just straight comparison with human insulin? Just talking about what you were referring to in Germany. Actually that's the main thing and then the NovoSeven patents, where you feel &#x2013; do you feel there is any opportunity there again for a similar kind of question, not a truly generic but a pricing competition issue? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thank you very much. In general, this is Lars Rebien here, in general we do not see therapeutic switches between proteins and so our general assumption is that with regards to the competition between NovoRapid and a potential future Humalog generic that we will still be able to upgrade our offering in terms of devices and what not. Mads was talking about a whole new generation of devices, which we are currently launching from our growth hormone product.</p>
          <p>You can anticipate that these will be extended also to our insulin franchises. And that should be enough for us to anticipate the differentiation as such that we do not end up in the situation. But I cannot exclude the fact that certain governments will use that as an opportunity to determine where the reference price level should be. And so that is correct, and that may have some economic impact for us. In terms of a NovoSeven patent, I think the situation is even more favorable to long-term sustainable franchise, but, Mads, you should probably comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well, two things there. On one hand as Lars alluded to earlier, as much as our basic DNA patent for the full human sequence of factor VII is expiring then we have two major lines of defense, one, being of course that the room temperature stable highly specific formulation of NovoSeven is patented for about a decade into the future.</p>
          <p>But as important as that is the notion that even after the Obama reform, we have a situation where proteins in particular complicated one such as factor VII will not lend themselves &#x2013; apart from in a special situation such as the Russian one, will not lend themselves to a quick route into the market as biosimilars, i.e. since we have not seen on clinicaltrials.gov any phase 1 activities from any company we do expect that there needs to be a originator comparison, i.e. a comparison with NovoSeven in patients with inhibitors against a classic therapy and a full multi program before a biosimilar can emerge in the marketplace and in our minds that means beyond 2015.</p>
