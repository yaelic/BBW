          <p>Good morning. My name is Curie and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the BlackRock Inc. Fourth Quarter 2009 Earnings Teleconference. Our host for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer, Ann Marie Petach; and General Counsel, Robert P. Connolly. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question and answer period. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  Thank you.</p>
          <p>Mr. Connolly, you may begin your conference.</p>

          <p>Good morning. This is Bob Connolly here with Larry and Ann Marie and Sue Wagner, who is our Chief Operating Officer. Before Larry and Ann Marie make their remarks I want to point out that during the course of this conference call, we'll make a number of forward-looking statements. We call to your attention the fact that BlackRock's actual results may differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed with the SEC reports, which lists some of the factors which may cause our results to differ materially from these statements. Finally, BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the meeting over to Ann Marie.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks Bob. Good morning, everyone. We're reporting earnings for the first time since the December 1st acquisition of BGI. As you will see from the results, earnings have been positively affected by a combination of the BGI acquisition, continued strength in new assets, positive markets, continued cost discipline, and strong business momentum. I'll be discussing primarily as-adjusted results.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter net income was 379 million or $2.39 per share, including $2.34 per share of operating earnings and a nickel per share of non operating earnings. Net income improved 29% compared to third quarter and over four times compared to a year ago. The December 1, BGI transaction contributed 94 million to fourth quarter net income. As a reminder, as-adjusted results exclude BGI transaction and integration cost which were 152 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter and 183 million for the full year. These costs are comprised primarily of banking, legal and professional fees, restructuring and integration related compensation costs and other consulting and G&amp;A expenses. Over 50 million of these expenses would have been capitalized under the prior acquisition accounting standards. These costs will continue into 2010 and are inline with the 300 to 350 million estimate we provided previously. We will continue to exclude these costs from as-adjusted results in 2010.</p>
          <p>For the full year, net income was 1,021 million and earnings per share was $7.13. Net income was up 19% from a year ago despite strong headwinds coming into the start of the year which affected revenues and operating income particularly in the first half of the year. Non-operating income started the year negative as the value of co-investments on the company's balance sheet clocked in the first quarter. Since that time, we have been writing those assets back up as markets have steadily improved throughout the year.</p>
          <p>On a full year basis our balance sheet investments ended the year up 2 million more than offset by net interest expense of 48 million. Note that the fourth quarter results do include the interest expense associated with the 2.5 billion of term debt which we issued in December. Also note that the full year tax rate came in at 33% due in part to the favorable settlements of certain tax matters in the first half of the year and to the geographic mix of earnings. We would expect our 2010 tax rate to be higher in the 35% range in 2010.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter revenues of 1,544 million improved by 404 million or 35% compared to the third quarter and 480 million or 45% compared to a year ago. The improvement in revenues from the third quarter reflect 278 million in base and security lending revenue associated with the 1.8 trillion in AUM related to the BGI transaction. The improvement also reflects revenues associated with the 42 billion of positive long-dated asset flows and over 22 billion of net positive market and FX effects on AUM.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter revenue included performance fees of 125 million, an improvement of 76 million from the third quarter and 102 million from a year ago. The improvement reflects a period of more loss than the third quarter, a trend of improving fund performance and the addition of BGI related performance fees.</p>
          <p>As far as the revenue trend, it's worth pointing out that long dated assets of 2.8 trillion at December 31, include not only the 1.8 trillion of acquired assets under management, but also 221 billion of long dated asset growth throughout the year.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions and advisory fourth quarter revenues remained strong at 108 million reflecting a continued appetite for analytic and Aladdin services and continued advisory assignments, although the pace of advisory assignments has slowed relative to prior periods as greater stability has returned to financial institutions. BRS continues to have a strong pipeline of financial market advisory; Aladdin and risk reporting opportunities, as the focus of clients has shifted from short term assistance to long-term solutions.</p>
          <p>As adjusted operating income of 561 million improved 161 million or 40% compared to the third quarter and 191 million or 52% compared to fourth quarter, 2008. Fourth quarter included 141 million of operating income related to BGI. The BGI acquisition and organic revenue changes explained earlier were key drivers for the operating income improvements. The operating margin as adjusted of 39.7% reflects a combination of improved revenues and continued cost discipline.</p>
          <p>As adjusted compensation costs increased compared to prior period due to the addition of the BGI employees and increased incentive comps related to improved earnings. Our compensation to revenue ratio has been stable at about 35% over the past three years. Though the performance in the financial markets has varied greatly over the past three years, we have consistently sought to balance the interests of shareholders and employees resulting in stability in the comp to revenue ratio.</p>
          <p>Our G&amp;A expenses, excluding transaction and integration expenses, increased relative to prior periods primarily due to the BGI transaction. In addition, fourth quarter G&amp;A included an increase in occupancy cost and a reserve associated with an outstanding collateralized loan to Ampersites.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter included only a 2 million benefit from balance sheet related foreign currency effects whereas the fourth quarter of 2008 included a 31 million benefit. With the fourth quarter income statement we have introduced a new expense line item called direct fund expense. This item includes expenses which are directly related to the funds' operations but paid by the company.</p>
          <p>All of these expenses are essentially recouped by the company through a unitary fee structure and administrative fee. These expenses include index licensing fees associated with iShares products, custody fees, transfer agent fees, and fund accounting fees. We have isolated these fees as they are expenses which are likely to vary directly with revenue or number of accounts or other key metrics that are associated with the volume of the business.</p>
          <p>The increase in this expense compared to prior periods relates to the BGI transaction. The BGI transaction did not affect our balance sheet exposure to feed-in co-investments. We did not acquire any such investments with the company. The overall balance sheet exposure remains at levels greatly reduced from a year ago. The total value of the investment portfolio stands at about 840 million or about 735 million, excluding investments, which represent hedges or which are hedged. As I mentioned earlier, the last three quarters have actually been a trend of gradual write-ups of these assets, offsetting a portion of the write-down which began in the first quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>As I have said before, we do not run any proprietary investments, but rather invest alongside our clients or seed new products as required for the base business. As you will see in our 10-K, the BGI transaction has had some material effects on the balance sheet. Most notably, the acquisition of the U.K. group pensions business will add about 140 billion of offsetting assets and liabilities.</p>
          <p>Based on 141(R) acquisition accounting, the BGI transaction will be valued at about $15 billion and will come on to the balance sheet primarily in the form of intangible assets and goodwill. The majority of the intangible assets have been determined to be indefinite lived. The amortization of intangible assets related to the BGI transaction in the month of December was less than $2 million.</p>
          <p>In December, we completed all of the long-term financing associated with the BGI transaction including the issuance of 37.6 million shares to Barclays Bank, the issuance of 17.8 million shares to other investors, and the issuance of 2.5 billion of term debt. Fully diluted shares at the end of the year were about 196 million.</p>
          <p>In summary, 2009 was an extraordinary year in terms of improving business trends, markets, and transformational change. The combination of organic growth and the BGI transaction have positioned us uniquely to work with our clients and deliver solutions to their investment and liability management objectives. We offer a broad diversity of investment products and risk management tools which allow us to support clients' needs with their knowledge that we are working solely as a fiduciary on their behalf. With the addition of iShares, we have a new suite of products well suited for retail and institutional investors in a rapidly expanding market. As we enter 2010, we will be exploring both efficiency opportunities in our base business as well as investment opportunities to continue to support strong organic growth in the future.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Ann Marie. Welcome, everyone. I would like to wish everyone a happy New Year and importantly welcome all our new clients, our new investors, as this is the first formal phone call public conversation related to our year end and more importantly our closure of the BGI transaction on December 1. And so, the firm is actually in a very good position in terms of where we are going forward and let me describe some of the key attributes as I look out in 2010.</p>
          <p>So as I reflect on 2009, BlackRock results strongly indicate that our business model of providing asset management and risk management services to retail and institutional clients worldwide is working. And that we are very well positioned for 2010. An independent investment management company with a strong fiduciary culture, an organization that has no proprietary trading, we don't compete with our clients whereby virtually 100% of our revenues is client-driven business. An organization that invests and manages more money for teachers, firemen, school teachers, individuals than any firm in the world, I believe our business model has proven especially in these times to be a business model that works in a more scrutinized, in a more transparent world of investing. And importantly, I believe the platform of BlackRock of multi-asset products having a strong position in beta products and alpha products, strengthened fixed income equities and alternatives with a strong risk management culture has positioned BlackRock to help and assist our clients with their investment and risk management needs. And I believe this will set us apart in 2010 as it set us apart in 2009.</p>
          <p>As our fourth quarter release stated, our merger with BGI has progressed very well. We are very excited about where we are at this time. A little reference, when we closed our MLIM transaction in 2006 that transaction took eight months from contract to closing. The BGI transaction which is far more complex, required a much larger proxy solicitation, much more complexities in the businesses, we closed that transaction in six months. Sometimes it felt very hurried; sometimes we made mistakes; sometimes we mis-communicated. Overall though, the merger closing went extremely well and I'm very pleased to say that we are in a very good position going forward.</p>
          <p>We are very excited about the intellectual teams that came with BGI interfacing with the BlackRock teams. As I sit here today in late January, I can't tell you the excitement we're seeing worldwide with our employees on the opportunities we have in terms of blending the different business products together and going to our client representing one solid product across regions, across distribution channels and obviously across products.</p>
          <p>The intersection of beta and alpha is becoming more pronounced. We believe clients worldwide are asking just as many questions about beta strategies as alpha strategies. And these strategies are not separated any more, whereby maybe 5 or 10 years ago when people thought about beta it was much more simplistic and now through technology and innovation much of it from the historic legacy BGI and other firms the intersection of beta with alpha is becoming a very important component of our conversations and positioning with our clients. And it is that intellectual capital that we have from legacy BlackRock and legacy BGI that we're bringing across to our clients.</p>
          <p>As we stated in the press release integration is very hard and we are going to have more bumps and we are not going to have this completed for about two years as we stated when we closed the transaction. We are on target though, on schedule. We have already put all the global cash products on Aladdin. By the end of the first quarter we will have all legacy BGI products on our Green Risk Management &#x2013; Risk Reporting platform and so we are moving ahead quite nicely and we are working very closely in trying to bring all these product to our clients. But I need to just be very clear to everyone, merger integrations are hard, bringing everybody on to one platform, on to the one BlackRock platform just takes time, it takes commitment and it takes repeating ourselves many times. We have been successful as I said to-date. We have a lot, many more milestones to ensure that we are representing our clients on to one common platform and we are coming with one common voice across the world.</p>
          <p>Obviously as the world is changing as the financial markets change, as governments reflect on how best position the financial markets, we are working along side with those changes, with the regulatory regimes and at the same time we are doing integration. As globalization continues to expand this also means we have to change our business model as we try to grow internationally, which I'll discuss a little bit later.</p>
          <p>Let me just go in to some of the assets under management and trends. Hopefully for those who read our release we are trying to be as transparent as possible. We are providing you with information on a reported basis, on a pro forma basis and we know these trends are &#x2013; and all the numbers can be difficult to understand, so obviously we're prepared to answer a lot of questions.</p>
          <p>Assets at the end of the year were $3.346 trillion. We had continued strong growth in the fourth quarter of approximately $85 billion of long-dated commitments and then we had about $42 billion of total organic growth after some advisory and cash management reductions. What's very impressive for the year for long-dated assets, we had approximately $200 billion of organic growth as a firm. This is a pro forma basis. I need to repeat that, that is using all the year's performance of BGI and BlackRock.</p>
          <p>I would also like to say very loud and clear, please don't annualize this. We had an extraordinary year, we hope to have an extraordinary year in 2010, but I just want to- until we have our arms around integration and our platform, I'm not here to tell you this is going to be a re-occurring growth rate. It is our hope that we can achieve that, but I need to put caution with everyone.</p>
          <p>Fixed income, as we continue to rebound from the problems we had in '08, we had strong performance which led us to have some very strong momentum. For the quarter, we had $43 billion a new organic growth, 14 of it was active and $29 billion was through index and ETFs.</p>
          <p>For the quarter, equities grew by about $36 billion, all of it and then some was in indexing, about $46 billion was from indexing. The active side of the equities was down about 10, all of it was from a legacy BGI product, a quant equity product which is under some stress now like quant equity throughout the industry is under a lot of stress right now. This is a business that we're very committed on. This is a business that we believe is going to be robust in the future, but like what we had to do in some of our fixed income products over the last few years, we're rebuilding that product and we are experiencing and we expect to experience some more outflows in that one product area.</p>
          <p>Institutional flows for the quarter was close to $50 billion for the quarter. Our mutual fund platforms, the legacy BlackRock mutual fund platforms grew about 11.6 and iShares platform for the fourth quarter grew by about little over $21 billion. What's also very remarkable in terms of the iShares' positioning, this is as been reported earlier, the market share for our iShares platforms in the ETF space actually grew last year and we are just under $500 billion in total assets, with an industry above, just crossing over a $1 trillion of total assets.</p>
          <p>BlackRock Solutions continued to see very strong opportunities in growth. For the year, we had more assignments than we have ever had before. In the fourth quarter new assignments were 14. And in the fourth &#x2013; and we just announced a few weeks ago the acquisition which is very small of a product called Helix that I think it's going to have huge opportunities for BlackRock in the future. This is a little product that is going to be allowing us to analyze commercial mortgage-backed securities taking the structure and digging down below the structure and analyzing every loan. I think one of the outcomes of the credit crisis has been too many investors rely too heavily on their rating agencies and did not have enough analysis of understanding what's in these structured products.</p>
          <p>One of the strong positionings of BlackRock Solutions and Aladdin will be allowing our investors to use the Helix products to analyze their holdings and commercial mortgage securities and understanding all the base assets, all the loans, how they're performing on a period by period basis and we believe this is going to be the new fiduciary standard and this is one of the reasons why we bought this because we believe having that information is going to be necessary if you're going to invest in these products not just for BlackRock but all the BlackRock clients who use the Aladdin system. So, albeit it's a very small, a little acquisition, but we believe it's going to drive a lot more opportunity and we believe it is going to once again raise the level of fiduciary standards what is necessary when investors buy structured products.</p>
          <p>What's also very important to note, we crossed the $9 trillion mark in terms of assets that we are analyzing whether it's risk-based analysis or our Aladdin system or BlackRock Solutions. So if you think about the $9 trillion in the solutions space plus the three plus trillion dollars at BlackRock, we have responsibility of risk management and risk &#x2013; and investment management of about $12 trillion, pretty impressive number.</p>
          <p>Pipeline remains robust and we continue to see some strong strength this year. Our pipeline is about $38 billion of wins unfunded and we continued to see strong flows in our mutual fund and iShares platforms.</p>
          <p>Let me go over some other statistics that I think are important to note. And that's the balance of BlackRock today which is an important component as we think about our business. About &#x2013; a little over $1.1 trillion or 35% of our business is active today, about $1.6 trillion or 50% of our business is passive, $350 billion or 10% is cash and about a $161 billion is advisory or 5%. And so this firm is very unique in terms of the business mix between active and passive cash and advisory. What I think is also very remarkable when you think about BlackRock where we were four years ago, five years ago. We have $1 trillion of fixed income assets, but we have $1.5 trillion of equity assets. On top of that 350 billion in cash, a $102 billion of alternatives, $141 billion in multi assets and about a 161 billion in advisory.</p>
          <p>Another important characteristic of where we are and where we think our business is going, about 40% of our business is now international, which I spoke about over the past few years as an important characteristic and that is $1.3 trillion. And about 60% of our business is U.S., a little over $2 trillion. And so our business mix is very different and more importantly the amount of business that we are doing in the non-U.S. space is growing dramatically. This is where we are going to investment in the future, we continue to believe this is an important characteristic for us and we will continue to spend money in investing overseas especially in Latin America and in Asia.</p>
          <p>The other area that is interesting to look at as we think about our businesses our mutual fund ETF investment trust or commingled assets are now more than our separate accounts. So we have $1.8 trillion in these bundled types of products, and in separate accounts we have $1.5 trillion. So what I'm trying to frame out to everyone our business is very different today than it was even a year ago. And this is one of the real characteristics and differentiating features of BlackRock going forward.</p>
          <p>As we have these products, as we grow the one area of growth that we think is going to continue to really differentiate ourselves that is in the multi-asset products base where clients are looking for more fiduciary outsourcing, are looking for much more of a comprehensive business. In that area we saw some very large business flows and that will continue to grow above trend in 2010.</p>
          <p>The other opportunities we have as a firm going forward with our business mix is going to be in this defined contribution space. This is a space that we have never been as large as some of the large players, but we believe as a sub-advisor to some of these large platforms we have some very unique opportunities to provide in the DC space.</p>
          <p>The other areas that I would like to just emphasize where I believe we are going to continue to have some dominance. Clearly iShares the business there is going from strength to strength. The teams internationally and domestically have been very protective of the entire ETF space. We have been vigilant in terms of making sure we're providing products that meet the test of time.</p>
          <p>We do not have any leveraged or inverse ETFs. We don't believe ETFs should be used as a speculative tool. And yet, we sometimes worry about in terms of making sure that we are creating the right products that will test &#x2013; that will stand the test of time. The synergies that we see right now between the iShares team and our BlackRock mutual fund platform team is incredibly strong. If I had to say the one real surprise is how strong the connection and opportunities we have together in building opportunities in the retail space with beta and alpha products together.</p>
          <p>Institutionally as our fourth quarter suggested, we continued to have very unique opportunities institutionally globally. As you could see in our press release, we continue to have some very strong momentum with official institutions and that business now has crossed over $236 billion in terms of assets. So great growth, great opportunities, and we continue to see great successes in the taxable institution space or the insurance space, where clients are looking more for fiduciary outsourcing in different products.</p>
          <p>I don't want to spend too much more time, because I think it's important to open it up for questions. We are very well positioned for 2010. We have a lot of risks though. We have the risk of making sure our business model is correct as governments and central banks are looking at restructuring the financial institutions. We need to make sure that we are differentiated and that clients understand who and what we are. We have to make sure that our integration goes, continues to go smoothly, that our customer scope comes first that we're representing our clients continually. And we need to make sure that we're vigorous in terms of making sure we have growth in all our product areas and if there is cases in which we have needs for rebuilding or enhancing we will be doing that. One area that we are continuing to be bullish on and yet we've had a very difficult time especially in the news is our real estate business. We've unfortunately been in the news a little too much because of a bad investment in New York City, which we &#x2013; I think we identified many quarters ago that we actually wrote it off many quarters ago, actually in 2008 and 2009 and yet it is still an unfortunate point.</p>
          <p>We are not perfect, we always have to rebuild despite our scale, despite our size we need to be vigorous in terms of rebuilding, rebalancing and fixing where there is need to be fixed. As I said, real estate is an area that we believe in in the long run and we are committed to this area and we believe it's going to be an opportunity for us in the future. We are not alone in the problems in real estate, we are just being highlighted in the last few weeks, but most of the real estate platforms have had a very difficult time. We look at this as an opportunity for BlackRock and we are working with many clients on these opportunities.</p>
          <p>Quant equity is another area that is under a lot of stress industry-wide like real estate. Many firms are moving out of this space. We believe it is a great space despite under performance and despite large out flows we believe the product will stand the test of time. We believe the product will be a strong product in the future and we are very committed in making sure that we represent ourselves in that product area too.</p>
          <p>So I am not here to suggest all products are doing well; I'm not suggesting that BlackRock does everything perfectly. I would say overall though in 2009 we had a great year. We are very well positioned. I am very bullish on our business model. I think our business model has been incredibly validated throughout 2009. I believe we are well positioned for 2010. I believe we have opportunities not just in the United States, but globally. And I believe we're as well positioned in the asset management space as any investment manager in the world.</p>
          <p>With that, thank you to all the employees in working incredibly hard in terms of the hard work of this integration. It has been a remarkably intense period of time. I may have said this too many quarters, and so I may sound like a broken record, but I am very proud of the employees in pulling our merger off in such a record point of time, continuing to build momentum and continuing to build our client relationships. I'm standing or sitting here today as a very proud CEO in terms of the successes of the BlackRock team.</p>
          <p>With that let's open it up for questions.</p>

          <p>No, no change in that. But, what I did say in my comments is we really are going to be balancing, getting the cost and the efficiencies in the business, and at the same time appropriately investing in the business to continue top-line growth.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I would argue that if we found more cost savings it would be all really invested in different parts of the business whether it is iShares, defined contribution, Asia or Latin America. So I think this is a time Rob for us to be investing in lot of ways not just getting the synergy out. We are relentless in the synergies, so  I do not want to leave you in the idea that we are not committed in terms of making sure the synergies are there. But, if there are more synergies I don't know if that's going to show up because of our belief that we need to continue to build out.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And Larry I know you just mentioned about your feeling that I guess the BGI sales force and the BlackRock, I guess wholesaling sales force are integrating well. But, I'm just curious how do you deal with the fact that you have so many products, so many categories, I mean how do you actually kind of get an integrated sales force to focus on that breadth of products?  I mean do you...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking more institutionally?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, actually I guess it's both, really both retail and institutionally.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start off and say, at this moment, starting yesterday, we have our institutional global teams here talking about that, how to making sure that we represent our clients, making sure that all our two legacy teams learn each others products. And so, this is a big hurdle. This is part of the integration process. I think we have done a very good job in a very short time doing that, but the key is going to be in terms of employee education on the products and making sure that we are, that each of our client service teams have the ability to market and understand those products. And importantly that they are good listeners to our clients in their needs, and then coming back to them with the products that we have. And so this is an issue, I think you said it very clearly.</p>
          <p>On the retail side, we do have two separate teams on the ETF team. The iShares team is separated in terms of products versus our historic and legacy mutual fund teams. And so on the retail side, we have less of an issue. On the other hand, we need to make sure and we're doing that too, making sure our ETF team, our iShares team has the ability to cross-fertilize our mutual fund platform products and vice versa. So this is going to be an ongoing educational process. It is, as I said, we have a meeting today. I will be speaking to that team at lunch today, but it is an issue. And I think you should ask that question each quarter and I can give you a better statement as to how we're doing, but in the short run, I think we have shown in terms of to our clients that we have a pretty good beginning in terms of offering products.</p>
          <p>I was in Europe, I guess last week, no, maybe two weeks ago now. I don't remember where I am;  last week I was in San Francisco, so two weeks ago. And we had a client meeting with about 13 clients over dinner in Amsterdam and to a client, they were talking to me about how they really don't know today who is a legacy BGI or who is a legacy BlackRock person that we have represented it ourselves quite well and we've done a quite a good job in terms of bringing all the products to them. That was a nice thing to say to the CEO and it was right before bonuses, so maybe somebody got us to do it, but I think we've done a good job to-date but we have a lot of education in front of us.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>All right, great. And maybe just a follow-up question for Ann Marie, I think I may have missed it, but did you say that the intangible amortization related to the transaction was only 2 million in Q4 I may have misunderstood that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And with indefinite-lived intangibles, could you give us a sense if any proportion of that is tax deductible and maybe what kind of tax benefits you maybe able to derive from it?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that looking at individual pieces that the whole tax equation, I tried to give you an idea of where the range in which the total tax rate might come in sort of in the 35% range and $0.20.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, perfectly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, perfect thank you. Just first question Larry, now that your product menu has really expanded into really every significant strategy out there. I was hoping you could provide a little perspective on flows and this liquidity crisis has really thawed out and you've seen flows go to money markets and then to credit and convertibles and equities we've started to see some drip and such in the past aside.  Where do you think we are between really the institutional and the retail channel towards in terms of moving back to equities, and how do you think actively managed domestic equity stands and can we get better flows there in 2010?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We still continue to see- despite we had a very strong fourth quarter in terms of cash relative to the industry. We still believe we're going to see net outflows in cash because we believe we're going to see a persistently steep yield curve in 2010, and which will move money out from cash to other risk-based assets whether it's a two-year treasury or emerging market debt, and so we continue to see that.</p>
          <p>In terms of institutional cash &#x2013; institutions they are sitting with records amounts of cash. Institutions have actually 2.5 years of excess cash flow, a record amount. Corporations in the United States do not need to really come to the debt markets, they have that much &#x2013; they have that much cash sitting with them. So they don't even have to raise new debt if they have debt maturities over the next year or so.</p>
          <p>And so we see large cash balances as institutions have not restocked their inventories as they historically have or one would suggest with all this cash, we're going to probably see more M&amp;A activities from corporations over the course of the next year. So that's more on the corporation side. In terms of investor cash we are certainly seeing more and more investors migrate from cash to other risk-based assets, and I think that will continue to be the case.</p>
          <p>On retail side, we still see retail moving from money market funds into demand deposits because &#x2013; so we still see that trend I think that trend will persist and but &#x2013; let me talk about in terms of retail flows. Our retail flows so far are very strong this month into equities especially internationally. I think our flows month to date is way over a billion dollars in terms of retail flows. I would say most of it is in equities and some of it is in fixed income.</p>
          <p>In terms of the US, I don't have a clear picture on the mix. So, I can't talk about that. But, I think you hit on something, Craig, I believe we're seeing a continued flow out of more active strategies into indexed strategies. I think that will continue. I think investors are looking for some form of beta. We still see very strong trend out of US equities into emerging market and global equities. I think that trend will continue this year. We're seeing that both domestically and internationally. Our fastest growing funds are Global Opportunities Funds that crossed the $61 billion mark. So it's not just global funds, but funds that can go from the US into different product areas. So we continue to see the same type of trends that we saw after the second quarter into more international products. I don't see any trend changes on that, Craig. So I think that will, the trends that we saw in the third and fourth quarter will persist at least for the foreseeable future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And any hope for domestic active equities?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, no, I actually think if you have performance, if you have the right products, no question you're going to see it. But I still believe- <mark type="inaudible" /> which I just talked about, the $61 billion fund, has a great opportunity. He could put all this money in US equities, if he chose. So, I think you are going to see more flows into more, if you're going to go into active strategies, if you are going to go into more of these actively allocation strategies, I think you are going to see less money going to the bucketed strategies of S&amp;P or things like that, so one should not think that this is just going out of S&amp;P or domestic strategy, they are going to go into more I would say as clients spend more time investigating beta strategies they are also going to be bar belling and moving more into more actively traded equity strategies like our Global Allocation Fund. So I think you are going to see bar belling as people have a higher concentration in beta.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Deutsche Bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank Larry. Just a question, when you get to these asset levels, the question always come up is on the organic growth side and you know to maintain maybe not the level this year, but just a healthy level that continues to drive pretty good earnings growth, so I think we can always try to gauge where investors are and the flow commentary is helpful, I guess on the distribution side, whether it's on the retail platform or the institutional or the U.S. and particularly international, just now with the new BlackRock including BGI where are you and where do you see like the greatest opportunities whether it's getting into new clients or offering some of the products that maybe weren't in those distribution channels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think the biggest trend as I said to Craig was I think you are going to see continue large allocation to beta strategies, large allocation from retail into ETFs as you have instantaneous flexibility of going in to a sub category whether it's a financial institution index or a semiconductor index or a healthcare index or if you want to have beta strategies that are going into country-specific of Mexico or Brazil or India or China to regional indexes like MSCI and other product areas. So we've never had that flexibility.</p>
          <p>And this is one thing I've said this very loudly to almost with anyone who would listen to me in terms of working with regulators and governments; I think people don't truly understand the transformation of investments for individuals and institutions with the advancements of ETFs that they have such quick flexibility of moving into different asset strategies. We never had that flexibility of instantaneously investing in Brazil or Taiwan or India.</p>
          <p>And so the speed in which investors can migrate into different strategies still is going to play out for the years to come. And it's going to change its scope of investing. And I think this is something that is still not totally recognized or understood. But I think we're going to continue to see some very strong flows in our beta strategies institutionally and retail.</p>
          <p>We are very constructive on alternatives. I didn't say that enough in my prepared talk, but I think as I said clients are both institutionally and retail are going to do more bar belling strategies. And this is and we saw some very good flows at our BAA platform as clients are putting large sums of money back into hedge funds. This is just all part of the beta &#x2013; the bar belling strategy that we're seeing.</p>
          <p>As I said in my prepared speech, I don't expect to have or we should not plan on having the same type of organic growth that we had in 2010. But I'm pretty constructive on our positioning for organic growth versus our peers. I'm not here &#x2013; I can't project what type of organic growth we're going to actually achieve because it is a function of the growth of the global capital markets.</p>
          <p>But one thing is certain for me as central banks worldwide move away from quantitative easing or in other words buying assets, what that means to me is they are going to be more dependent on the growth of capital markets because who is going to finance the U.S. or who is going to finance Europe as central banks are not going to be the financier in the future and it's going to be more dependent on the global capital markets to be the financier of developed growth.</p>
          <p>So I am quite constructive that the global capital markets will continue to grow and I can't think of another firm that is as well positioned to take advantage of that global growth. And that's going to add to the organic growth as our clients will start building more cash, more opportunities, they are going to looking to put more money to work outside of cash. I think we're just in a very good position.</p>
          <p>I would say though we need to continue to build out Asia and Latin America to really seize a lot of that. We're not as well as positioned as we should be, because of much of that money is not going to go with the dollar based assets, its going to go into local markets as China and other regions build their own domestic capital markets. And so that's where the opportunities are, making sure that we are positioned to take advantage of the growth of global capital markets in the world.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then Ann Marie just two questions on some of the numbers. On BGI, the margin looks like it's coming in at 45%, which is much stronger than it was last year, a lot due to the markets. But, when you're talking about the synergies of the 200, just so we get where the run rate is today, are there much of those synergies in the current run rate on the expense level?  And then on the performance fees overall, any sense of how much of the performance fees were related to BGI?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, as far as the BGI margin, and going forward we're not going to try and segregate the two results because really as a combined firm it's a bit random where the results end up, because we now have BlackRock people reporting to BGI people and BGI people reporting to BlackRock people. So I wouldn't try and dissect a lot into the individual margin or trend that. As far as the performance fees of the 125 about 24 on the income statement was related to BGI.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi guys. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions, I was wondering if we could still come back to BGI yet again, maybe, you talked generally about the defined contribution maybe Latin America etcetera, I was wondering if you could a little about specifically where you see the greatest lift for BGI over the next 12 to 24 months?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think, I said this last Bill. I think it will be in the beta products where I just believe we're going to continue to see some real growth, real opportunities. If we're able to expand the products by having actively manage ETFs especially in terms of asset allocation products, I think that will be a very large growth area. I do believe we're going to continue to see very large growth in our non-U.S. ETF products. And I do believe clients are going to continue to allocate heavily into fixed income, into municipals, especially GOs. So I think more of the same is going to happen, Bill. I don't think there's going to be a remarkable reversal. I don't think we're going to see a huge reversal into actively managed equities, but I do believe as we see today in our mutual fund area, we are seeing a continual growth in active equities, but not to the same extent as what we're seeing in the beta products.</p>
          <p>Alternatives will continue to be an area that we're going to be emphasizing. So as the world improves, as the global capital markets stabilizes, I think we are just in a very good position to take advantage of those opportunities and flows. So I don't think if there is anything that I could highlight other than maybe the beta products as we see more and more clients barbell using beta and alpha. So and we're just very well positioned for that type of conversation of managing both beta and alpha products.</p>
          <p>I would say which I didn't say in my prepared text, the one thing, I could say a surprise too is we are not seeing as much of issues with our clients in terms of concentration issues. I don't want to say we haven't seen any, because we have seen some, but I would say they are less than we budgeted when we announced the transaction last June and clients have separated the beta and alpha strategies by and large in terms of thinking about how they should think about the new BlackRock.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's helpful. My second question I asked this last quarter and I suspect I'll get the same answer this quarter, but I'm going to ask it anyhow. You're obviously generating a significant amount of free cash flow, you put the term debt on, sort of curious if you could talk a little bit about dividend policy, maybe share repurchase. And share repurchase in the construct that you've had some interesting legislation being proposed by the President about ownership of prop trading desks, etcetera, and two of your largest shareholders obviously have indirect ownership on your stock. Sort of wondering if there is an opportunity here maybe to enhance the float somehow or maybe use the shares to repurchase from that, sort of curious just more broadly on your capital management plans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, dividend policy is reviewed in the first quarter by our Board. But I think our policy has been consistent in the past and I believe that consistency will continue on going forward. I don't want to speak on behalf of the Board. And so that's something that will be announced sometime in February when we have our next Board meeting in terms of dividend policy, but I think we're going to have the same consistency, so you could look back and see how we have done it and I would think it would be pretty similar in the future.</p>
          <p>But I don't see anything addressing what the President announced in prop trading. I would actually say that as, we still don't know what ultimately will happen. It will be, it will take some time for Congress to come to terms with what the President spoke about. I guess we could now call it the broker rule or broker plan or whatever. I think if something of that nature occurs, I would actually think the investment in BlackRock is actually a better thing, because we have proven to be a higher returning asset for them. And so if anything, I would think their ownership of us is probably more stable than it would have been otherwise. I can't speak about my large investors and their financial situation. But, there is no question, a) we are, we will be thoughtful in the future in terms of thinking about float if there are any opportunities with any of our large investors. We will be thoughtful in terms of share repurchases if there is any changes with our large investors. So, I think all those things are open issues.</p>
          <p>You are correct in saying, we're going to have some very large free cash flow and with that free cash flow we either can utilize that in terms of more acquisitions in terms of BlackRock Solutions space, we could use that for just general business opportunities or we can use that in some form of dividend or share repurchases. And I think we're going to have many options with the free cash flow that we're going to have in the future. Ann Marie, do you want to add anything to that?</p>

          <p>Okay, just one last question. Thanks for taking all the questions. There's been some sort of interesting developments coming out of the SEC which I guess is going to get potentially voted on over the next day or so around the money market business. Just sort of wondering if you could give an update on sort of how you view the business? How do you see it economically, viably? Obviously you talked about some further market share erosion this year to demand deposits that seems straightforward, but just sort of longer term, maybe your thoughts on the business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I love the business. It's a business that we think with our position, with corporations and our scale is going to be a great business for us. And I do believe we will be one of the strong entities in this space in the years to come. I do believe the money market business is an area that government needs to reflect on and look at because of the reserve fund situation. There was a period of time where the money market business was under severe stress. We needed the liquidity Bank of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the money market business and the commercial paper area and so one of the outcomes will be some form of capital, that we will be set aside, which would obviously lower margins in the money market business, if that's going to be required. We have been very involved in conversations with our regulators on this. It's something obviously that we are involved in and that we will continue to be involved in, but we believe the money market business will evolve into a large scale business with few. And I believe we will be one of those fews that will be heavily involved in that in the future. It may have lower margins in the future if capital needs are going to &#x2013; capital is going to be needed to stabilize the business.</p>
          <p>I would also reflect though after the crisis is over in terms of the Reserve Fund I believe they returned pretty &#x2013; over 99.75 of all &#x2013; of all monies back to their investors and so much of the problems of the money market business was some &#x2013; was a liquidity run. And some of it obviously was credit which &#x2013; that's why they returned 99.75, but it's going to be clear to make the money market business robust and strong for our clients, I believe there is going to be some form of need to having reserves of capital associated with that business.</p>

          <p>Hey, Larry, how are you?  A question on the DC channel, can you help put that opportunity for BlackRock in perspective particularly we're hearing a lot more about guarantees in that channel, and that seems more to be an insurance product rather than asset management product. How do you sort of plan to go to market there, and particularly could you comment on guarantees in DC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You're correct in saying that's an insurance product. We are working with some insurance carriers on that as a &#x2013; so we will be the manufacturer, they'll be the distribution and the wrapper. So that's one area that we're working on. We're working with our scale now with our products; we're working also directly with many more corporations in terms of offering a more diverse product. I believe because of diversity of our products whether it is beta products or alpha products more distribution platforms are adding more BlackRock products to their channels. We have a dedicated DC team that we are committed and building out. So it's an area that quite frankly was an area that we underinvested in. It was an area that we did not have the appropriate scale and now today we have the scale and the investment to be &#x2013; to be a player in the future.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just in terms of the pipeline, can you give us some information on the long-term of the breakdown of the pipeline by assets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Somebody is turning to the page and giving it to me. Ann Marie just gave it to me she knew the pipeline so let me &#x2013; the pipeline walk forward. Total un-funded, okay, so fixed income is 23 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Total pipeline 25.7, excuse me, 25.7 is the pipeline of fixed income, broken 50:50 with passive and active and equities is 6 billion. It is 3 billion of outflows in fundamental and 9 billion of passive.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The quant.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's still the issue of the quantitative active equities. So it's obviously out of the pipeline 36 billion of the stated 32ish is long-dated and there is year-to-date outflows in cash.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then what are we seeing in terms of your win rate of business since the closing of the deal, have you noticed any change in the metrics or search activity, that's notable?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Searches, very, very strong and that's a function of clients re-looking at their risk tolerance and starting to think about making more money than cash returns. And so that's a function of where we are in the cycle. I don't have any trends in terms of wins versus anything. I can tell you we're involved in more special situations. We're involved with much more multi-asset product strategies with clients. Clients are looking to us to spend a great deal of time.</p>
          <p>I think the important trend which is very different than any year and that is in the ETF space of iShares. Historically, and I think this has been noted by many analysts ETFs have very strong fourth quarters and very weak first quarters. So you see for tax strategies, a lot of people buy ETFs to offset stock selling to take gains or take losses and they get the beta through the ETF and they reversed that trade in January as they have taken the tax strategy that was appropriate and unwind that trade in January.</p>
          <p>I would say in December, we did not see as big of inflow of ETF that we were seeing in the last few years, but I can tell you now in the first quarter, or January to-date, we're seeing positive flows, which is a very large trend change. So, a) it say we have actually more net new demand than the outflows from tax strategies or maybe December suggested there was just not as many tax strategy trades at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>And so that's &#x2013; that obviously, it's only a month now, we don't have the trends, we don't have any long-term trends, but clearly the momentum in ETFs in January are pretty resounding compared to the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, that's helpful. And then just in terms of sec lending, what impact did that have on your revenues this quarter and how should we think about that going forward given sort of the outlook for rates?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, three issues in sec lending. Sec lending one is you make money on the cash balance of that. Cash is virtually zero and the return, so that will continue to be pulling down the returns on sec lending. The other issue on sec lending though is just borrowing rates. And we saw as I said earlier very large flows into hedge funds. And then also we saw that hedge funds in November/December actually de-risked a lot because we've had such big gains. So the real question is, are we going to see higher utilization rates on sec lending as hedge funds have more capital to invest. It's too early to make that determination, but those are the two big areas for sec lending, the cash return which is going to be small and will remain small and the borrowing rate on the equities or fixed income. Ann Marie, do you have anything else?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the other comment I would make is that for reporting, we are combining our sec lending revenues along with our base fees. And the reason for that is the really split between those is a bit random So some clients might choose to pay no base fee and really we take a 100% through some kind of revenue share; some might not share much of the sec revenue, lending revenue but might pay a larger base fee. So that as we really analyze this business, we found that really representing something as a sec lending revenue number was a bit of a random, not fully representative number. So we've included that because we really view it as a bundled business and it, the bundled pricing is the relevant pricing not the individual segment.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

          <p>Okay, great. Thanks.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Hopson of Stifel Nicolaus.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Couple of questions, on the number side the BGI 95, does that, is that just pure operating or does that include the effect on interest expense?  And then, Larry on the ETF business, obviously you have a great market share, great momentum, but a number of players have come into the business, some significant and some concern about fee pressure there. Can you respond to that concern?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are very bullish on our position in the ETF space. We believe our position is one of tremendous strength. We see more opportunities than we've ever seen before. And yet because of the increased competition, because of the expansion of the product, we have never anticipated or believed that our market share will remain as strong. We believe our growth will be very strong because we believe the space is going to grow very fast. As more and more players get in it actually feeds upon itself. And so, we look at this as a growing business and yet we may, we would not be surprised if our market share went down with new players, new opportunities.</p>
          <p>I would say though, there are lot of noise about active ETFs. I think in many cases active ETFs is misunderstood. Active ETFs will be a very hard product to have the liquidity that people are looking to have when they invest in ETFs. That is one of the key components of ETF and that's liquidity. And so, I would say clearly having first mover and scale is going to be, will remain to be a very dominant reason for people using iShares. But, if you cannot create the liquidity in the construction of an ETF, it's going to be very hard to have liquidity. And so, in active, in a pure active ETF, the constructors are going to need to know the active managers portfolio every minute to construct the &#x2013; of underlying assets to build ETF and create liquidity and I think that is not understood as well as it should. The reason why ETF has succeeded is in my mind the liquidity and the opportunity to invest in a product or a region or a area and I believe that will continue to be the dominant reason for investing in ETFs.</p>
          <p>So as we expand ETF products, the key is do we then &#x2013; can we create liquidity in those other products and that's less certain. So I think we're in a very good position. We have dominant positions in most of the regions of the world, in many of the products. We have continued to innovate and create new products. We're focusing on many products such as fund-to-funds of ETFs, which will allow us to have the liquidity, a global allocation ETF, those are the types of products that we think will have lot of applicability in the future. But we welcome the competition. We would agree with those competitors who are getting into the space. This is a space to be in and so we're certainly not frightened of it and we believe there is room for many more.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then coming back to your first question, the 95 million related to BGI net income is indeed just an after-tax statement of their operating result. So it does not include the interest expense or any other expenses associated with really the transaction or in the case of the interest expense what would be an ongoing expense.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Roger Smith of Macquarie.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Roger.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, how are you doing?  Thanks a lot. I just have one follow-up on the money market funds, you talked about regulatory capital, could you give us some more specifics around what you're thinking there, would you believe that a Tier 1 ratio would be in line or is this something with an industry fund?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, the last thing we are looking for is an industry fund. I think the biggest mistake in the system is socializing credit risk and that's exactly what &#x2013; that's the banking system and that's why people are now looking at, okay, we have socialized risk, how do we manage socialized risk, and I think that's one of the keys of the Obama plan is to reduce some of that socialized risk. So the last thing we need to do is socialize money market risk.</p>
          <p>So I believe firms that get into the money market business need to set aside capital. It's not Tier 1 or anything like that. Setting aside capital associated with the business, whether that's 4 basis points or 5 basis points, no different like a loan loss reserve or whatever that number is appropriate, and I'm not here to suggest it has been determined yet, but setting aside capital and building up a capital base over the course of a number of years, so you have capital associated specifically for that business. At the moment, our auditors will not allow us to do this. We are not allowed to set aside capital because &#x2013; and so we need relief on this to allow us to set aside capital, specifically for this business as a means to have a loss reserve for that business.</p>
          <p>And right now it is prohibitive, because we can't do it. And this is the type of thing that we are suggesting. I'm not suggesting we should not have some form of maybe industry wide liquidity bank, but the liquidity bank cannot have &#x2013; cannot take credit risk and the credit risk has to fall on the individual manager. And to me this is a dividing line between us and some other players, I must say, because we don't believe in the socialization of credit risk. And I think the Obama plan is actually stating that related to the banks. And the last thing we needed a new socialization of credit risk.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, great. And then on the alternatives, it does look like things are starting to get a little bit better here. Can you tell us what you think the appetite or the view on risk is from institutions in here?  And is it really looking for multi-manager funds or is it single manager or what sort of happening in the alternative space?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's really a function of the clients' experience in '08, '09. I think if you had, if you brushed with fire and badly singed, those institutions have less risk appetite than those who only marginally were harmed and now are looking at opportunistically investing. So, we see in a multi-manager products large continued interest. We did have a great year last year in our multi-manager products, and so we are seeing flows and inquiry because of our experience. And in our individual products, we are starting to see more flows. Just this week, we won, I think it's $300 million, going up to $600 million mandate from a state pension plan in our global asset fund. This is a legacy BGI, a single strategy of global investing. And so, it really depends on the client appetite. But worldwide I would say, as I said clients are looking for multi-manager products, but they are also looking for single manager strategies. We are benefiting from both and I think this is all a function of the barbelling that I discussed repeatedly during the phone call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, okay then just lastly on the Scientific Equity, what's going on there that are causing investors to leave the product and then how big is that product at BlackRock right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The product is approximately 100 billion-ish today, am I right Sue? Scientific is about a 100 &#x2013; approximately 100 &#x2013; it's a product &#x2013; it's an area that industry-wide that has underperformed the last few years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>145.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>$145 billion. And it's a product that has underperformed for the last few years, industry-wide and it's an area that investors aggressively invested in over the years. It has had probably a seven to ten year great track record, in the last few years a poor track record and we are addressing it. As I said, we're very constructive on it. But it is an area that other firms have announced they're either abandoning, other firms are de-emphasizing and we are committed in building. So it's an area that we &#x2013; it is going to be an area that's under stress in 2010. It's an area that we knew is under stress when we looked at the pro-formas of BGI and it still remains to be under stress, but it is an area that we believe has real strong long-term applicability as an investment product in equity.</p>
