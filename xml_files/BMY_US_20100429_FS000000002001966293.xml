          <p>Operator: Good day, and welcome to today's First Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Elicker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Audra and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us on the call to review our Q1 results. You've seen the press release out already at about 7:30 this morning.</p>
          <p>With me this morning we have several members of senior management: Lamberto Andreotti, who will be CEO effective next Tuesday at our annual meeting, he'll have prepared remarks; along with Charlie Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for Q&amp;A are Elliott Sigal, our Chief Scientific Officer, as well as two additional senior leaders; Beatrice Cazaloa, who is Senior Vice President, Global Commercialization also with operational responsibility for Europe and our emerging markets; and Tony Hooper, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations with responsibility for the U.S., Japan and several other markets.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, let me handle the Safe Harbor language. During this call we'll make statements about the company's future plans and prospects, including statements about our financial position, business strategy, research pipeline concerning product development, product potential that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor Provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. These documents are available from the SEC, the Bristol-Myers Squibb website, or from BMS Investor Relations.</p>
          <p>In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our estimates only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Lamberto?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by acknowledging once again the great contributions that Jim Cornelius has made in leading Bristol-Myers Squibb for the past several years. I now look forward to the opportunity to take the baton from Jim and lead the company with the ambition of having Bristol-Myers Squibb become a new benchmark for the industry.</p>
          <p>During the past six weeks, since we met at our March 4 investment community event, I have focused on making certain that we have the right team and the right governance structure in place to take Bristol-Myers Squibb to the next level. I have confirmed a number of key executives in their roles, but have also made some senior management changes among my direct reports and their direct reports. And with our pure biopharma focus now in place, I also simplified our governance structure with the goal to improve the speed and quality of our decision-making.</p>
          <p>We are now fully ready to accelerate the delivery of our strategy and let me remind you that the key elements of our strategy include: (1) a profitable and quality growth, driven by an innovative and diversified pipeline; (2) a continued focus on productivity; (3) a good expansion to our balance sheet and capital structure; and (4) the fulfillment of expectations of shareholders, patients, prescribers, payors and employees.</p>
          <p>Now moving to our first quarter update, I'm sure you expect my comments about healthcare reform, a topic on everyone's mind since the U.S. legislation was enacted. As we noted in our press release this morning, the 2010 EPS guidance we announced in January excluded the potential impact of the U.S. healthcare reform, simply because at that time there were no details on which to base any realistic estimates.</p>
          <p>With the approval of the reform legislation, we now know that the increases in Medicaid-related rebates and the changes in ratably healthcare cost tax deductibility, taken together, had a $0.03 a share impact on our EPS in the first quarter. And as we see continued implementation of the reform during the rest of the year, we anticipate its negative impact to amount to about $0.12 a share. However, our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance does not reduce the range by this $0.12, but only by $0.05.</p>
          <p>We started taking mitigating actions earlier in the year in anticipation of the approval of the reform. We plan to take additional measures during the rest of 2010, and our business is performing strongly. As a consequence, we expect to be able to absorb about half of the healthcare reform impact this year.</p>
          <p>I'd like now to turn to our first quarter results and how I view them. We had a strong first quarter. I'm glad, very glad of our 11% top line growth, or 8% net of foreign exchange. One of my biggest priorities is on revenue growth, both in the short and longer term. The strong sales increases in this first quarter are encouraging and the emphasis on top line growth will continue, not just for the rest of this year, but certainly as we navigate through healthcare reform and the patent expirations.</p>
          <p>Charlie Bancroft will give you later on additional details around the good performance of our key brands. I only want to say a few words about ONGLYZA. ONGLYZA, our most recent product launch, did not do as well in terms of revenues as we were originally projecting. I must acknowledge that we were expecting a steeper sales uptake, also counting on a faster growth of the DPP-4 class that has not, in fact, happened.</p>
          <p>However, we are not giving up on ONGLYZA at all. This is a great medicine with significant glycemic-efficacy and a low rate of side effects. And we are continuing to see solid progress in generating new prescriptions and getting additional physicians to try it. All leading indicators on patient uptake and physician response are moving in the right direction, and we have fine tuned our messages on endocrinologists. We are initiating a DTC campaign in the U.S., and the FDA has accepted our SMDA for a fixed-dose combination of ONGLYZA with Metformin which we hope to launch by the end of this year.</p>
          <p>Moving from sales to the rest of the P&amp;L, you have seen that we have continued to improve our operating margin and increased our net income. We have been able to gain that kind of leverage by adding our by-now established cost discipline to strong top line growth. As I told you back in March, we have no intention at this time of creating a third wave of formal productivity initiatives. Instead, we are relying on the fact that productivity and careful cost management are now part of our operating culture. As a result, we continually improve our cost base without touching any investments that are necessary to support top line growth.</p>
          <p>We will have an interesting ASCO this year, a very interesting ASCO, with, among other things, the presentation of data for ipilimumab in advanced melanoma, and SPRYCEL in first-line CML. Both products, ipilimumab and SPRYCEL first-line, are on track for global submissions in 2010. And ADA will be also interesting as we expect to present another Phase III study of dapagliflozin for Type II diabetes.</p>
          <p>As you know, the PDUFA date for belatacept is just a few days from now and we are waiting the news. The Agency is digesting a great deal of information we have submitted to them, and we are respectful of the fact that this requires work and time. What counts, and counts a lot, is that we had a positive recommendation for belatacept's approval from the FDA Advisory Committee in early March, and are confident about its rich benefit profile of patients.</p>
          <p>And in April, we presented very encouraging Phase II data on our NS5A, as well, inhibitor for Hepatitis C, at the European Liver Congress. BMS NS5A, as well as the peg[lylated] interferon lambda that we acquired from ZymoGenetics, are significant compounds in what we believe is a well differentiated Hepatitis C portfolio in earlier stages of development.</p>
          <p>Business development continues to be a key component in our strategy to grow the top line and help ensure pipeline sustainability. In early March, we acquired an asset ready for Phase II from Allergan to address neuropathic pain, a condition that bridges two of our therapeutic areas, metabolic disorders and neuroscience.</p>
          <p>So in conclusion, a good quarter, with results that were better than we had originally planned, and I understand also, better than what you expected. Healthcare reform affects our results, but does not change the underlying strength of our business and the focus of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Now, Charlie Bancroft will provide additional insight into our first quarter performance. Before turning the call over to Charlie, to him, I want to congratulate Charlie on having gone from interim CFO to official CFO, and this is thanks to his capabilities and track record. Charlie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lamberto. We did have a very strong quarter. We delivered on non-GAAP EPS of $0.56, that's up 33%, despite a negative impact of $0.03 from U.S. healthcare reform. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by good sales growth, continued expense management and fewer shares outstanding due to the Mead Johnson split-off in December last year.</p>
          <p>Now I want to give you some highlights from our first quarter financial results, discuss the impact of U.S. healthcare reform, and talk about guidance before we go to your questions.</p>
          <p>The company reported first quarter net sales from continuing operations of 4.8 billion, an increase of 11%, or 8% excluding foreign exchange. Healthcare reform had a 1% negative impact on net sales in the quarter, and volume was up 4%. The first quarter sales performance was powered in large part by double-digit increases in our cardiovascular and virology franchises. PLAVIX grew 18% in the U.S., confirming its established strength and continuing potential. U.S. sales were driven by a 2% increase in prescription demand, a higher average selling price, and we did see some inventory build in the retail channel year-over-year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, generic lopidogrel was available in most of the countries. We already see the majority of our business in important countries like France, Germany and the U.K. impacted by generics. We expect erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe to begin slow, but it will continue. The impact is primarily recorded in equity income from affiliates in our P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>Second, our Virology franchise demonstrated strong global sales growth, up 19% from a year ago. This sales strength demonstrates the continued strong demand for REYATAZ, the SUSTIVA franchise and BARACLUDE across both our U.S. and international markets.</p>
          <p>Finally, we had another solid quarter for ABILIFY, with global net sales up 5%. In the U.S., sales of ABILIFY were down 2%, despite a 9% increase in prescription demand that was fueled by our indications for bipolar and major depressive disorder.</p>
          <p>When comparing ABILIFY's U.S. sales for the first quarter of 2010 with last year, there are three things to keep in mind. First, due to the extension and revision of our contractual terms with Otsuka last April, our share of net sales was reduced to 58% from 65%. Second, we are amortizing the 400 million upfront payment to Otsuka as a reduction of net sales, so there is an approximately 16 million quarterly charge that was not in the first quarter last year. And then lastly, ABILIFY sales in the Medicaid channel were negatively impacted by healthcare reform.</p>
          <p>All right, now let me give you some highlights from the rest of our P&amp;L. Our non-GAAP gross margin remained relatively flat at 73.5% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Improvements in product mix, price and productivity were offset by changes in the way we account for the agreement with Otsuka and the impact from foreign exchange.</p>
          <p>Advertising and promotion expenses were down 15% to 212 million for the quarter. The decrease is due to less spending on the promotion of certain products at the end of their lifecycle and to Otsuka's reimbursement of certain ABILIFY, SPRYCEL and IXEMPRA expenses. This was partially offset by increased spending for the ONGLYZA launch and other pipeline products.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses increased 12% to 855 million. This growth rate is higher than our full year guidance, as we are absorbing the R&amp;D spend from Pearls acquired during the second half of 2009, most notably Medarex. We expect this growth rate to slow in the second half of 2010.</p>
          <p>Non-GAAP other income was 87 million, approximately 60 million higher than last year. There are a lot of small items that impact this number which vary from quarter-to-quarter. Two of the more significant items that drove the favorability in the first quarter were manufacturing profits from partners and a one-time foreign exchange gain indirectly related to the sale of the manufacturing plant in Latina, Italy. These are not recurring items.</p>
          <p>Equity income declined 34%, driven by continued erosion of PLAVIX sales in Europe from generic clopi[dogrel], as I mentioned earlier.</p>
          <p>The effective overall non-GAAP tax rate on earnings from continuing operations was 24.8% in the first quarter. This rate was negatively impacted by the one-time healthcare reform charge and the lack of the R&amp;D tax credit, but was offset by favorable earnings mix and one-time discrete tax items. Our guidance remains between 23 and 24% for the year. However, the tax rate will vary by quarter depending on when we see the resolution of the R&amp;D tax credit. As a reminder, we will only account for the tax credit in the quarter in which it happens.</p>
          <p>We continue our focus on cash flow and we currently have 9.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. This helps provide the financial flexibility we need to support our dividend and invest in potential business development opportunities. As we said in March, we will also consider additional options, such as share repurchases or debt restructuring.</p>
          <p>Now let me turn to financial guidance. As Lamberto mentioned, the passage of U.S. healthcare reform is already having an impact on our results, and we expect increasing rebates as the new healthcare law is implemented. For background, in 2009, Medicaid fee-for-service, managed Medicaid and 340B programs together were approximately 12% of U.S. net sales. The products most exposed to Medicaid are ABILIFY and our Virology franchise. In addition, in 2009 approximately 30% of U.S. net sales were from Medicare Part D. PLAVIX is the product most exposed to Medicare. And remember, we share the impact with Sanofi.</p>
          <p>As we look at the rest of this year, we estimate healthcare reform to result in a negative impact of 350 to 400 million in net sales, or about $0.12 per share on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. We are updating our 2010 GAAP EPS range to $1.84 to $1.94, and 2010 non-GAAP EPS guidance range to 2.10 to 2.20, including the impact of U.S. healthcare reform, which was explicitly excluded from our original guidance. The $0.12 per share negative impact from healthcare reform in 2010 is expected to be partially offset by the strength of our underlying business and mitigating actions we are taking. As a result, on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis, we expect to offset approximately half of the $0.12 impact.</p>
          <p>In 2011, we estimate the impact to roughly double at both the top and bottom line, as the donut hole coverage in pharmacy take effect. Remember that the sales impact will be relatively higher than earnings due to the accounting treatment for PLAVIX, where we record 100% of sales but share profits with Sanofi.</p>
          <p>Looking at 2011 and beyond, it is important to note that there is a range of impact, given uncertainties on the healthcare reform implementation guidelines and on the eventual volume of patients and their utilization within some of the programs. As Lamberto has indicated, we'll be looking to maximize our revenue opportunities, as well as identifying mitigating actions consistent with our track record of delivering on productivity.</p>
          <p>At our investors' meeting in March, we also provided 2013 minimum non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.95. That guidance also excluded the potential impact of U.S. healthcare reform. Now that we have more visibility on how healthcare reform could affect our business, we are reviewing and updating our strategic plan and expect to be able to update you on our outlook for 2013 in the coming months. We are confident in the strength of our underlying business and the opportunities we have, both on the revenue and cost side.</p>
          <p>In closing, by any measure, Bristol-Myers Squibb had a great first quarter. Double-digit sales growth driven by key products and franchises and good management of expenses led to solid operating margin improvements. We remain focused on managing the impact of U.S. healthcare reform, and at the same time, we are committed to making the right investments to ensure the sustainability of our pipeline.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn it over to your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Charlie and Lamberto. And Audra, I think we're ready to go to questions. And just a reminder that in addition to Lamberto and Charlie, we also have Elliott here to handle any of your R&amp;D questions, as well as Tony and Beatrice on the commercial side. Audra?</p>

          <p>Thank you. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> We'll go first to Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. Good morning. Lamberto, we've been doing some diligence on a number of international countries, be it Germany or the U.K. or France or Spain, and the impacts of international healthcare reform. I'm curious if you could comment internationally, because we tend to focus too much, I think, on the U.S. and how you could see some increasing pricing pressure internationally. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tony, it's interesting that I was expecting the first question to be on the U.S. healthcare reform and now you take me back to my international years. And it is true: there are a number of countries that are under pressure; Greece, obviously, under everybody's attention. Greece is a country of, I would say, approximately $200 million of sales for us, and we are carefully monitoring what's going on there. There are signals in Germany that they want to go for price preview, and other similar measures are being studied in other countries.</p>
          <p>Now, we have been dealing with that for years, and what is important in those countries, as it is important in the U.S., is to have enough innovative products to offer to the marketplaces, and there you can secure the proper access and the proper pricing, and also to be good at improving productivity. And again, I think we have a track record at Bristol-Myers Squibb for dealing with those situations. So I don't see anything particularly different from what we have been dealing with in the past in the various countries.</p>
          <p>Let me add one point, that all of us here have an international background, and I tell you, this international background is becoming very useful in the U.S. dealing with these different access situation we have here, and we are using some of the experience we accumulated outside of the U.S. in the U.S. itself.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Tony. Can we go to the next question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll go next to David Risinger at Morgan Stanley.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks very much. I've got a couple questions. In terms of the American Diabetes Association, I believe that you're presenting just one Phase III dapagliflozin study. If you could just provide some details on that, and then what else we should watch for later in the year to get more clarity on the infection risk for dapa?</p>
          <p>And then second, regarding ipilimumab, could you please comment on your discussions with regulatory authorities in the EU and U.S. regarding the filings that you're planning? And then finally, SPRYCEL was very, very strong in the quarter. It was up $47 million sequentially, to 166 (sic) 131 million. Can you provide a little bit more color on that please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, what I thought, David, and I will ask Elliott to take the dapa and ipi questions, and Tony and Beatrice, you can comment on SPRYCEL. But I just start with a comment that all three products are three very important products to us, and the degree of confidence in their future and the contribution that they can give to our sales is increasing, and for all of us spending a lot of time and attention at getting ready for the potential launch of dapa and ipi, and for the potential launch of the new indication of SPRYCEL. Elliot, why don't continue with that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, David, on your question about the ADA, you're correct that we'll be presenting in June, data on dapagliflozin for our Phase III study that studies dapagliflozin in the context of add-on to insulin. So patients that &#x2013; since this is an insulin-independent mechanism and unique in that regard, we're very excited to present data on patients that seem to have a lot of insulin resistance in large doses of insulin, and the question of the study is, can the addition of dapagliflozin decrease the amount of insulin and insulin dependence, and what would be the improvement in what we're after of the triad of clinical benefits with regard to glycemic control, blood pressure control and weight control with dapagliflozin.</p>
          <p>We've now completed eight Phase III studies of dapagliflozin and the emerging profile is, as we have been reporting it. We will roll out three more Phase III studies in September of 2010 in Europe: Data from the add-on to the sulfonylurea study, data from an add-on to Metformin versus sulfonylurea, and data from an add-on to the insulin Phase III study. Actually, similarly as we will do in ADA, we'll do this in Europe, so we remain excited about that.</p>
          <p>You asked about infection risk. To date in the program, the rate of signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of urinary tract infections is about similar to placebo, while the rates of signs, symptoms and other reports suggestive of genital infections &#x2013; these are usually candida infections &#x2013; are higher than placebo, and educating the patient and being proactive to deal with this what we think of as a tolerability issue, is our focus. And more of this data will be presented in the forthcoming year.</p>
          <p>With regard to ipilimumab, yes, March 4. You detected my enthusiasm about immunotherapy in oncology in general, ipilimumab's potential in melanoma, and we remain enthused and looking forward to ASCO. I did refer to the fact that there were ongoing health authority discussions then, which we always do, to make sure that we are in line with what the Agency expects in the content and the form of a submission. We've had these discussions now in the U.S. and Europe and expect to submit applications for regulatory approval of ipilimumab in both the U.S. and Europe over the next couple of months.</p>
          <p>Our discussions with the regulatory authorities have focused on the data we have in hand from the 020 study and the indication would be appropriate to the data in that regard, and we look forward to ASCO the first week in June, where we'll be presenting more ipilimumab studies, our first Phase III study in melanoma with survival endpoint, and a Phase II study in lung cancer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And Beatrice, do you want to speak about SPRYCEL?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Clearly we are very excited about the possibility of adding our first-line indication for SPRYCEL on top of our current indication. So as you know, worldwide, there are 15,000 patients diagnosed each year, and about 100,000 in various stage of the disease. So as we are today the most-prescribed agent indicated for Gleevec-resistant on enteral CML patient, the possibility now of opening up to the na&#xEF;ve segment for SPRYCEL first-line will be very exciting.</p>
          <p>It will also allow us to increase the size of our fibroline market; patient maybe switch earlier and we are hoping for earlier switch from Gleevec versus today, which will continue to be titrated up &#x2013; instead of being titrated up on Gleevec. That's very important because, as you know, Gleevec today continues to be demonstrating long-term <mark type="inaudible" /> benefit and simplicity of once daily dosing with no food restriction. So we also have once-per-day dosing with no food restriction and no black box warning for QT prolongation. So very exciting times based on very strong track records of such facts as we have now today, and Tony, if you want to comment now about the U.S.?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Just a question on U.S. Our first quarter was about 27% up on the same time last year on 19% growth versus fourth quarter last year, which, as you know, was in contrast to the market itself. The TK market went down 1%. Our favorability was driven by strong volume growth, as well as a price increase. Two-thirds of all Gleevec patients that are switched are switched to SPRYCEL, and to further support our SPRYCEL growth, we have increased our sales efforts in the community by leveraging our ERBITUX sales force. And lastly, we've recently launched a new patient education program designed to reinforce compliant behavior throughout treatment and also includes a co-pay assistance program for eligible patients.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to ask you a quick follow-up on SPRYCEL and then a question or two on healthcare reform. On SPRYCEL, could you remind us, in terms of the first-line study, if those patients will remain on therapy, and what other kind of studies you might have to show the durability of response? Obviously, survival being most important but the durability of the response of SPRYCEL versus Gleevec to try to attract those that might be a little bit less amenable to change.</p>
          <p>And then on healthcare reform, I wanted to ask you about, when you made the comment about the doubling effect for 2011, I assume that you will be looking for ways to mitigate that effect, and I also wanted to see if you could characterize the assumptions that you made. Is that doubling just because the doughnut hole was added, or is there a step-up in Medicaid rebate effect?</p>
          <p>And have you been pretty conservative in regards to some things that aren't really ironed out about things like the rebates that you provide today to managed care, and what's going to happen to those when you get in the doughnut hole, and those kinds of issues? So I know I'm throwing a bit at you, but the devil's in the details here. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Catherine, this is Elliott, and with regard to the first-line CML trial for SPRYCEL, the study is a five-year study, so we are clearly after duration and survival, and as Gleevec did, as our competitor is doing, the approach to getting approval in first-line is to do a five-year study. But we have worked out with the agencies around the world that a first-year readout of important markers that are correlated with survival in this disease will be acceptable for potential approval on a conditional basis, on an accelerated basis, and then full approval will be available to either agent that shows the proper results at five years. So we will have data on an ongoing basis out to five years with these patients, with regard to durability. We also will be investigating switch information for this.</p>
          <p>The two trials are different. Our primary endpoint is a major cytogenetic response which was what Gleevec showed for its approval, and is the accepted primary endpoint recommended by healthcare authorities. Major molecular response is another important emerging biomarker, the secondary endpoint for ours.</p>
          <p>Our trial also differs in the fact that we did include cardiac patients, and this is very important for the community. We did not exclude them as is the case in the Tasigna trial, and of course, Tasigna already has a black box warning. So we feel we have a very good study, and I am corrected that the primary endpoint is complete cytogenetic response; I may have said major cytogenetic response. Complete cytogenetic response. We feel this is an important study in the field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Catherine, let me start addressing your question on healthcare reform and Charlie will give you some details. It is clear that we are going after mitigating actions in 2011 and the years after 2011. In fact, as I said before, we started looking at the potential impact of healthcare reform at the very beginning of this year, and we've already implemented a number of cost containment actions, and also before the approval of the healthcare reform itself. We have a track record, I would say, of both reacting to unexpected events in a very aggressive and effective way, and we also have a track record of going after productivity.</p>
          <p>So the entire Bristol-Myers Squibb, not only the U.S. based units, are after cost containment elements to offset impact of healthcare reform, and the underlying strength of the business will help us, too. So we are going to announce the results of our analysis as soon as we are ready with our more definite conclusions, and Charlie?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Cathy, said 2011, as we said, double; that's before any mitigating actions, so the doubling relates specifically to the healthcare reform impact as we see it. As far as the ramp-up, in the first quarter on an operating basis, excluding the retiree drug subsidy one-time item, it was roughly $0.02, and we see the balance of the year $0.09. So there is a little bit of a ramp-up through the year, because 340B pricing, or expansion, is really not much in the first quarter as well as some of the Medicaid managed care, because that didn't take effect until towards the end of March.</p>
          <p>As we think about next year, the implementation guidelines around, particularly the pharmacy and our share of the overall percentage of government sales, is still to be determined and the regulations aren't fully written there, as well as senior behavior entering the doughnut hole, there's still more work to fully understand the impact there, but we've included that in our range. We feel comfortable that we're about in the midpoint of our range for next year.</p>

          <p>Congratulations on the quarter, and thanks for taking the questions. First one for Lamberto, as you settle into the CEO seat and you've had an opportunity to reflect on the business, can you maybe just outline what your top three priorities are going forward?</p>
          <p>And then on R&amp;D for Elliott, on belatacept, I believe you have a PDUFA date coming up in the near term here. Do you have large quantities of the product, and will you be launching this sequentially right with that PDUFA date?</p>
          <p>And then on Apixaban, just an update on the QD dosing formulation. Is it something that you're going to be able to formulate appropriately? And then any timing around the development of that QD formulation? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me tell you that, despite all the emotions of the last few days, after everybody woke up to the reality of healthcare reform, I'm focusing again on continuing to build this company the way it can be built and the way it can be successful. My focus, John, is on top line, top line and top line, and on all elements that can contribute to the top line, so the products that we will continue to market, that are already key products in our portfolio; the products that we can expand, like SPRYCEL and ORENCIA, thanks to the good life cycle management programs we have; and the newer products that we have just launched, we are going to launch. So top line is my first priority. Productivity, we are not losing focus on productivity at the same time, and I believe that there is still more that we can do, especially in using other company or finding new partners for the different, many different things we do in manufacturing and in selling and in developing products, et cetera.</p>
          <p>Another priority, I wouldn't call it my third priority, is to continue to have good management, and I'm very blessed with a very strong management team here at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and my priority is to continue to have passion for the growth, selection and growth, of strong managers for the years to come.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>John, this is Elliott. Quickly on Apixiban QD, although we're working on a formulation, we will not have that at launch, and we're really targeting the type of benefit-risk balance that we believe we'll see with our appropriate dosing and BID dosing, and we think that that will be a very competitive situation.</p>
          <p>With regard to belatacept, you're correct that we had a positive Advisory Committee on March 1. We have a PDUFA date of May 1. We have been working with the FDA and the review is actively progressing. Both groups are actively engaged, but as you can appreciate, given that the Advisory Committee was held less than 2 months ago and the fact that bela will have a REMS that we propose, there is a significant amount of work that we need to finish prior to approval.</p>
          <p>We remain confident in the benefit-risk profile of the drug and the belief that this can be a new treatment for patients undergoing renal transplantation. We are all ready with the supply and the preparations for launch, and perhaps Tony would like to comment further on that.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="a">

          <p>Okay, thank you. So the U.S. team, from both a medical and the commercial organization, sales and marketing, are fully trained and ready to launch the moment we have a final label and approval. We have nude vials ready for labeling and packaging, and we should be in the market within 10 days of final approval.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great, thank you. First question, just can you elaborate a little bit, ONGLYZA? In your view, what is it going to take to achieve broader adoption in the DPP-4 &#x2013; just DPP-4s as a class? And in your view, how much of an issue is the expense of the DPP-4s relative to maybe other genericized class going to be a hurdle for uptake for the DPP-4s?</p>
          <p>And then sort of a second question on the NS5A small molecule combo data. Data coming at ASLD, is that going to be EVR data, or when can we expect to see SVR for that combo? And can you just talk about your strategy for the combo from there? Would you move right into Phase III with that? And is there any potential to file for accelerated approval, at least in interferon intolerant patients here? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start on ONGLYZA, I start with a joke. It takes a lot of patients and a lot &#x2013; but no, not joking, it takes a lot of focus on profiling the customers and continuing to focus our people on the things that can actually make a difference in the minds of the prescribers and the payors. Tony, why don't you elaborate on this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So it's clear from the marketplace at the moment that a fair amount of the diabetic treatment is happening in the generic market itself. I think the $4 script has clearly driven patients and physicians to that at the moment, and when we see our abandonment rate, i.e., patients going into the pharmacy with a prescription and then walking away not filling that prescription, it's clear that cost in today's environment is an issue. It's an issue we're addressing as fast as we can.</p>
          <p>I think it's linked back to what Lamberto was saying around selling the value proposition of this product in combination with Metformin. Once the entire environment starts to understand that to treat diabetes, which is a chronic disease that patients will either die from or die with, the importance of early intervention with a number of compounds with different modes of action is going to be the most essential and specific way of treating patients.</p>
          <p>So we have looked very clearly at the market in terms of what's required to drive an uptake. We obviously would like a steeper curve at the moment, but we do, as Lamberto said, continue to see good progress with our leading indicators, which make us feel fairly confident about our ability to grow ONGLYZA in this marketplace.</p>
          <p>Physicians who have tried the product generally continue to use it, and to accelerate this adoption, we are refocusing our efforts on specialists with a more targeted clinical campaign to endocrinologists. In addition, we've made pretty good progress with access and reimbursement, and almost 85% of targeted lives are now covered, with almost 60% in Tier 1 and Tier 2. We've had a value program in place for those patients not covered by Tier 2, and in a couple weeks we'll strengthen the offering to address perceived access barriers.</p>
          <p>Finally, our brand awareness is almost 65% with physicians, and to further this awareness from point of care to point of compliance and adherence, we've launched a new patient education DTC print campaign and will be launching a TV campaign in May.</p>
          <p>The two things we watch carefully, of course, are new naive Rxs and new physician trialers,, and in both cases, we see week-by week-increases. Our share of new naive DPP-4 prescriptions is now reaching about 6%, and the number of new physicians having prescribed ONGLYZA is around 20,000.</p>
          <p>I think we continue to believe that with more than 40% of Type II diabetes patients not achieving treatment goals on monotherapy, that we really have an opportunity to continue focusing on this product and ensuring patients and physicians understand the dramatic opportunity of putting them together and helping patients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. Let me just remind everybody, Chris, that we have a multi-pronged attack on Hepatitis C. We're developing a superior interferon, the lambda, that we feel can be added to any small molecule antiviral, and data for that will be available at the meetings towards the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Also in standard of care with the standard interferon in Ribavirin, we're adding superior small molecules, one of which was 5A that we just reported out for, and 12-week data this past meeting at EASL in Europe. We will have further information on that also at the end of the year at a conference. It would unlikely be SVR at this point, 24-weeks past, but we are doing a study that will define all of these parameters.</p>
          <p>We do have enough information to go rapidly into a dose-ranging trial and plan for a Phase III start next year for the combination of an interferon, Ribavirin and NS5A, which we are continually enthusiastic about. It's early in development and you might have seen the Nature paper that just came out. We are pleased to be leading this field.</p>
          <p>We're also doing proof of concept of two small molecules, whether that can be a sustained therapy for some people, perhaps around the world; there are advantages to having an interferon-sparing agent. It's not clear yet that two drugs are sufficient or whether we need three. We are doing a two-drug combination and we should have some data for that towards the end of the year as well, and that's a very exciting program. We have started in null responders, but we are now starting in naive patients in Japan and elsewhere in the world, and planning other studies.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Couple of questions. To me, the slow ONGLYZA launch, as well as some of the other drug launches that have been slow by other companies begs the broader question of whether drug companies have cut things like the sales forces too much, and I'm wondering if there's any broader lesson to be learned here with ONGLYZA, and what went wrong, specifically, and would you have done anything differently if you could roll the clock back?</p>
          <p>On SPRYCEL, I can understand why that drug gets used a fair bit in second-line CML, but first-line use is something quite different because there, I think the major driver will be tolerability and safety and I'm wondering how you see those two variables shaking out between SPRYCEL and Tasigna in those cardiovascular safeties that you're hoping to differentiate on mostly.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the question on what it means to launch a new product in the present environment. Yes, you're correct: it is more complicated to launch a new product nowadays. I don't think that the slow uptakes are &#x2013; the new products are related to less sale forces. I think they are related to a number of factors that have changed in the marketplace and that we have started addressing.</p>
          <p>It is more complicated to launch products that are perceived as less differentiating, and there are the new things we need to do, they need to be increased and accelerated, but it is &#x2013; there is a number of elements that apply also to very differentiated products that we are focusing upon. Beatrice, why don't you expand on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's clear that not only in the U.S. but globally it's more and more complex to launch products and it takes time. It takes time before and it takes time after launch. You have higher regulatory and access hurdles, and it gets critical obviously to clinically differentiated drugs, but we need to go beyond and create value for the patient, the physician and the payors, and the value need to be perceived by all those three constituents independently. So once a drug is launched, clearly you have a lot of planning to be done, and a lot of work to be done to communicate those comparative effectiveness data to gain the access at those three levels, and the reimbursement. As Tony mentioned, you can gain the first two and then the patient at the end rejects the prescription at the pharmacy level. So clearly, working the value for the patient, the physician and payors is key.</p>
          <p>So if you look at BMS strategy and our pipeline, we feel we are very well-positioned to deliver a number of potential first-in-class, and very well differentiated and meaningfully differentiated products. But we have already taken steps to ensure that we are very well prepared to launch all our future products.</p>
          <p>And one of the key steps was to reinforce the close collaboration with our R&amp;D teams and our commercial organization. We are spending a lot of time very early on in what we perceive the products to include, its outcome, and differentiation through its outcome data in early clinical trial design to provide the best beneficial for multiple stakeholder and of that carried along to the development of the products.</p>
          <p>We are also strengthening capabilities worldwide, not just on global level, but in every market on market access. Here we're focusing on physician, and I concur with Lamberto when he said it's not the number of sales force. Actually, there are a number of studies in some markets showing the decreasing role of sales force versus the access team, as well as the medical education team, so and you see that's where you need to spend more time and more people.</p>
          <p>So we have developed a stronger market access team across the entire company, and we have also spent a lot of time redesigning the way we are going to work and investing in <mark type="inaudible" /> education, as well as market development with Elliott and his team to better support our portfolio of normal medicine and <mark type="inaudible" /> information, and making through those very strong medical access team that we have developed.</p>
          <p>So those are some of the key elements. You see, as you mentioned, we are learning and we are living an experiment with ONGYLZA. We are learning from. We are also rolling out very quickly a lot of the learnings with the organization and redefining our launch effectiveness standards with all the learning we are capturing. So that's the activity improve there for the whole organization. So we are confident that with this and the level of experience we are developing, we will be able to further our customer business model to be even more effective in future launch.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Tim, this is Elliott. On your question on the SPRYCEL, I'll give you the medical view and maybe Beatrice wants to add the correlative commercial opinion. CML is a very interesting disease in that's there a relatively low incidence of new cases. There's 15,000 patients diagnosed each year, so you would call that as first-line, and I agree with you: the medical approach is going to focus on the experience with Gleevec to some extent and the safety.</p>
          <p>But there's a large pool of patients, 100,000 patients, in various stages of the disease, thanks to the initial success of Gleevec, and therefore, second-line therapy is also an opportunity, and we see that market growing, as people understand that we can improve upon the very important advance that was Gleevec with agents such as SPRYCEL, both in first-line and in second-line, and the earlier recognition of when a patient is failing Gleevec. This campaign, with two companies pointing out this scientific data, will increase the awareness of the limitations of Gleevec that we have been targeting to improve. So this is a very interesting change in medical practice that I think there are two important entries for us to consider for the patients.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I was there when we launch SPRYCEL in second-line and talked to a lot of patients, and when you were asking the balance of tolerability with efficacy and our ability to develop prescription in both segment, I think it is clear that those two are important in both stages, the early stage as well as the late stage. And all the patients will tell you that even in first line they want to look at superior efficacy first and increased efficacy. They want tolerability, but clearly efficacy is further. So that's why we believe that the data we have we'll be able to access the first-line patient.</p>
          <p>On the tolerability side &#x2013; you want to &#x2013; on the tolerability side, it's also very important that we provide a drug that the patient can take that's convenient, especially in the first stage, once-a-day drug. So the ability to deliver sufficient safety in first-line that's why it's so important. We believe that with Gleevec that we have a comparative <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we have market experience that when physicians have a choice between SPRYCEL and Tasigna, they are favoring SPRYCEL, and we believe that's due to the demonstrated clinical benefits, the simplicity of once-daily dosing with no food restrictions and no black box and concern for QT and other cardiac effects.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. Elliott, maybe if you could just please clarify your filing strategy on ipi once more. This 020 study is a second-line study where you are using 3 milligrams versus the 10 milligram study in the pivotal trial, as well as a non-approved vaccine, and if you could just sort of flesh out for us the strategy with respect to commercialization, just given that this 020 study is not the pivotal study.</p>
          <p>And then just a follow-on with SPRYCEL. Without survival data, do you still expect that SPRYCEL and Tasigna combined could become standard of care in front-line CML? Or what is the data that you think is necessary in order to drive a significant shift in use to standard of care?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jami. Let me address the comment. I would not call 020 not pivotal. It wasn't pivotal in our thinking years ago, and as a result of conversations with health authorities, and this is why we do this, we decide what is an appropriate indication to file for, and do we have data to enable a review. A Phase III study, that's survival with ipilimumab that does compare against an experimental vaccine in previously treated patients, we consider pivotal to the indication of metastatic melanoma in previously treated patients, where there is no standard of care and therefore, we feel it's appropriate to &#x2013; well actually standard of care is often experimental regimen to compare with a well-characterized experimental treatment, and we chose the vaccine.</p>
          <p>We have an adequate study, we believe, to check the contribution of the ipi alone, as well as ipi in combination with the vaccine. We do not plan to commercialize the vaccine; we do plan to commercialize the 3-milligram dose in the indication that I mentioned. The 024 first-line study is a different patient population and a different regimen, and when that data becomes available we hope to provide enough information from that study to talk about an expanded indication for the drug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Now, from the commercial perspective, when we have very good science we need to recognize it so that's I think what we believe we have with 020. So we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity in the second-line, and when we see metastatic melanoma, it's 32 to 40,000 new case every year, so basically, our ability to commercialize the product in that indication is extremely exciting and there is dose allowance care. So we will be providing, as everyone will find out, long-term benefit and raw survival. So 6, 9 months today is what we see with average survival in patients that are younger, less than 59 year old. So we will be very active in preparing the commercialization of the product in the second-line with this dose, and we will be also ready when 024 is available to move to a second stage of the launch.</p>
          <p>So while looking and preparing for the full commercial opportunity for ipilimumab, and we are obviously looking very carefully at the potential in term of length of therapy, pricing of <mark type="inaudible" /> share, those things where opportunities coming out of the launch that we hope will come soon once we have a file and get the approval.</p>

          <p>Okay. Thank you, Jami, and we're going to go to our last question. Audra, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And we'll take that question from Steve Scala with Cowen.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thank you. Two questions. First, is it reasonable to assume the impact of healthcare reform in 2013 will not be greater than 2011, and might even be less given that PLAVIX will be gone and there will be potential volume offsets across the business? That's the first question, and second, Elliott, everything you've said on ipilimumab suggests that you believe the first line study will not be necessary for approval, that the second-line study will be sufficient for approval. Can you just confirm that that is your belief? And on the first-line study, would you be able to tell us how many events are necessary to stop the study and what the power in the alpha is of the study? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Elliott, do you want to start with ipi?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think, Steve, I'm not going to discuss the power now, other than we have appropriately powered this study, and we want to be very careful here to get the result that we're after, and that's the way the study is being conducted. So we have perhaps a very conservative approach to making sure we get the answer.</p>
          <p>The events that we're looking for, we think we might reach by the end of the year, but the death rate is slowing, as I have said previously. Therefore, the study is taking longer than we thought. One can never predict a Phase III result with 100% certainty, but I believe this is information that is good for patients, obviously, and good for the drug. So we await that.</p>
          <p>Our discussions with the regulatory authorities have focused on the data we have in hand, that is the second-line 020 study, and we will submit based on these data. Study 024, people agree, is a different study in a different population. When we have that data, we would plan to submit it as well.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, in regard to healthcare reform regarding 2013, as I mentioned earlier, the implementation guidelines still need to be resolved, and then the utilization across the different programs we still need more experience there. Having said that, we would view 2013, because of the doughnut hole impact related to PLAVIX, most likely being somewhat less than what we would see in 2011, and also, that impact is before any mitigating actions in how we look at the strength of our business, as well as the maturity of our pipeline.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Audra, thank you for coordinating the questions and thanks, everybody for asking the questions. Before we close it down, I think Lamberto has a few closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, John. First of all thank you again for your questions and let me give you a couple of final thoughts at the end of this conference call.</p>
          <p>First these very, very good first quarter results have continued to build on the momentum that we have created over the last few years since we announced and began implementing our BioPharma strategy, and I must say, we are very proud that we have executed against that plan and continue to deliver on our commitments.</p>
          <p>Second, we have driven EPS growth significantly. We have booked strong sales and operational leverage. We're continuing to prudently manage in costs. Third, we have a number of potential exciting filings in the next 12 to 18 months, ipi, SPRYCEL first-line, ORENCIA secure, et cetera, and these filings will further transcend our highly differentiated pipeline, and at the same time we are accelerating the pace of business development through our String of Pearls strategy.</p>
          <p>And finally, yes, we all face challenges. The biggest one is the impact of this U.S. healthcare reform in the next few years, but we at Bristol-Myers Squibb have taken the right actions to mitigate those effects and we expect to do even more. At the same time, we continue to give priority to revenue growth and pipeline sustainability.</p>
          <p>Well, thank you for your attention, and thank you to my colleagues here for having shared information with you today.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And that does conclude today's conference. Again thank you for your participation.</p>
