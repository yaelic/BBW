          <p>Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our conference call to discuss first quarter 2008 results. We have a simultaneous webcast on the Internet that could be accessed at the site, www.petrobras.com.br/ri/english.</p>
          <p>Before proceeding, I'd like to draw your attention to the slide two, we my make forward-looking statements which are identified by the use of the words will, expect and similar that are based on the belief and assumptions of Petrobras' management and on information currently available to the company.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me mention that this conference call will discuss Petrobras' results prepared in accordance with Brazilian GAAP. At this moment, we are unable to discuss any issues related to U.S. GAAP results.</p>
          <p>The conference call will be conducted by our CFO and Investor Relations officer, Mr. Almir Guilherme Barbassa. He will comment on the company's operating and financial highlights and the main events during this quarter, and he will be available to answer any questions you may have.</p>
          <p>Mr. Barbassa, you may begin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon to everybody. It is a pleasure to be here to discuss the first quarter results of this year. But first, let's go back to the first slide please. I'd like to begin with a few words about the covership. This is the net making of the top size in the <mark type="inaudible" /> of the P-51, which occurred in April 19 in Brazil. This is the first platform, where <mark type="inaudible" /> top sites were built in Brazil. Total Brazilian content is around 70%. We expect P-51 will be anchored in the Marlim Sul field some time during the first quarter of this year. We have already begun the construction of P-56, a clone of P-51 using the same shipyard and design of P-51. This approach will help us to control costs and accelerate our project for the future project of production.</p>
          <p>Going to slide two, let's begin with -- by looking at some of the principal drivers of our operating results. In this slide, you can see that domestic oil and gas production increased by about 3% quarter-over-quarter and about 2% year-over-year, with the ramp up of four new units that began producing in the first quarter of '07. New production systems added 91,000 barrels of oil during the quarter. Production increases were constrained during the first quarter by reduced availability of support vessels that connect wells to the P-52 and P-54. Additionally, FPSO-Cidade de Vit&#xF3;ria is producing more water than expected, the meeting production from this platform and the Golfinho field.</p>
          <p>With respect to the existing fields, it is worth mentioning that we have been allocating a greater amount of lead-time to the developmental and exploratory drilling at the expansion of lag time for workover and maintenance. This has temporarily result in reduced production at some of our existing units. Our investment in the production for testing and transportation of natural gas are beginning to show results, with an increase of 10% in the quarter. Production was boosted by non-associated gas from Esp&#xED;rito Santo Basin, mainly the Pero&#xE1; field. This gas is now flowing through the southern leg of the Gasin pipeline to thermal power plant in <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
          <p>Factoring in the delays that have already occurred this year, we are reducing our target for oil produced in Brazil from 2 million barrels per day to 1,950,000 barrels, plus or minus 2.5%. We are introducing the concept of a range, to reflect the intervent of  certainty of predicting average production for the year. Determining the average production for a year is an exercise in probability, and establishing a range more accurately reflect this reality.</p>
          <p>Reaching our targets will require increase in production from the first quarter level, by an average of more than 150,000 barrels per day during the rest of the year. The continued ramp up of P-52 and P-54, which only contribute 96,000 barrels per day of their combined capacity of 360,000 barrels per day, will be primarily responsible for this increase.</p>
          <p>In the slide three we can see the growth in domestic natural gas supply, and markets for the natural gas. Year-over-year, Brazilian gas supply available to the market increased by 7 million cubic meters per day, approximately 40, 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, while total demand for natural gas in Brazil increased by 14 million cubic meters a day, approximately 90,000 barrels of oil equivalent. In addition to the 7 million cubic meters of domestic supply and other 7 million cubic meters of supply came from increases in Bolivian production.</p>
          <p>Moving to refinery and sales volumes, you will see that quarter-over-quarter production of refined products declined slightly from 1.78 million barrels per day during the first quarter to 1.77 million barrels per day in the first quarter. This was largely the result of a programmed stoppage at the Replan refinery, the largest refinery in Brazil, in February. Prior to the stoppage, the refining sector set a new monthly record for the processing oil of 1.84 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>Product sales during the quarter were down from the prior quarter, generally due to seasonality. Year-over-year sales continue to increase at a rate of about 60,000 barrels per day, or 3.5%, largely from increased sales of diesel and jet fuel for agriculture, transportation, electricity generation and higher airline traffic. Despite the growing competition from ethanol, gasoline sales have remained flat.</p>
          <p>In slide five, you will see that the net trade balance has been declining, as a result of growing consumption in Brazil and the use of diesel for some thermal power plant, which was not fully offset by the ramp up in the production of our new unit. The first quarter was also affected by a substantial build up in inventories, as a precautionary move related to the programmed stoppage of the Replan refinery.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to some highlight of the first quarter that are important for our long-term future. I will begin by reviewing current activities in the Pre Salt cluster of Santos basin. In the slide six, you can see the map of the Pre Salt cluster. Currently, we are working three blocks; BM-S-8 Bem-te-Vi, BM-S-9 Carioca and BM-S-24 Jupiter. In BM-S-8 we are in the process of testing the well recently drilled. In the BM-S-9, we have just started the second well out in the southeast expansion node known as Guar&#xE1; and expect to test the well after the target depth is reached. In BM-S-24, the rig is being moved into play. For this block, we expect continue the drilling began last year, with the hope of reaching oil layers in addition to the natural gas we found. We also plan to test the well.</p>
          <p>We have also made important decision at the Board level to fast track the standard well test and the pilot system for Tupi. In the next two slides, you can see key figures for this project. For the expanded well test, we'll start a small production unit of 30,000 barrels per day production capacity from BW Offshore to start testing in March 2009. During the testing, which will last through March of 2009, we will drill three wells and test each individually. This will improve our understanding not only of the reservoir characteristics and well productivity, but also the optimal well design.</p>
          <p>For the pilot system, we are in the market for 100,000 barrels per day units to be starting in December 2010. In addition to continuing our understanding of the reservoir, and the most economical production method, we will also be testing the ideal way to maintain reservoir pressure and maximize the recovery factor either through water, natural gas or CO2 injection. The gas from this well will have to be transported via pipeline to the gas gathering facility of Michigan some 200 kilometers away.</p>
          <p>We currently have just three rigs that are working in the Pre Salt cluster. This is not the math to meet our drilling needs for the testing and pilot phase or to be on the continuous further exploratory work in the Pre Salt. As a result, we recently announced the contracting of three drill ships from Seadrill. These rigs will help in the development and appraisal of Tupi as well as expand our exploration and appraisal activity in Carioca.</p>
          <p>Turning to results, they were strongly influenced by the market value of our crude oil. As you can see in the slide 10, price have nearly doubled since the first quarter of last year This was the principal factor contributing to the earnings from our E&amp;P sector. As you can also see, our crude oil continue to trade at roughly 10 to $11, above discount to Brent due to the quality differentials.</p>
          <p>In slide 11 you will see that lifting costs have stabilized. Despite the near doubling of oil price and the introduction of a number of platform is still ramping up, we have managed a lower lifting cost when expressed in reais. Year-over-year lifting cost expressed in dollars have increased by $1.4 per barrel, even our spreads increased by nearly $40 per barrel. Year-over-year government production tax have increased by $7 per barrel, due to higher income subject to the special participation tax and higher royalty. Despite higher lifting costs and government take, the margin between the lifting cost and the price of Brent has increased from $40 to $72 during the past year.</p>
          <p>The comparison of Brazilian production, pricing and the international markets can be found in the slide 12. The trend we saw in the first quarter of last year continued into the first quarter of 2008. In other words, our practice of holding local price for diesel and gasoline constant as the stronger reais compensate for higher international price no longer works. Consequently, we had announced as of May 2nd a price increase of 10% for gasoline and 15% for diesel. The positive impact of these adjustments will only be felt in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>In the slide 13 you can see the impact of our net income of the fourth quarter of 2007 versus the first quarter of 2008. Higher oil and natural gas production, relatively stable producing price, and lower operating and financial expenses were the principal factors behind the improvement. Revenue increased by R$1.475 billion, as a result of modestly higher production and sales volume. Costs for production sold increased as a result of higher cost of reporting oil, and oil products, specially stabilized by the flat lifting and refining costs.</p>
          <p>Operating expense were sequentially lower by R$1.365 billion, as a result of lower SG&amp;A, export oil cost and absence of any impairment charge during the first quarter. Net financial expense were reduced due to a lower rate in the strengthening of the reais and combined respective results in our equity income led to a sequential improvement of R$1.090 billion.</p>
          <p>Minority interest also showed an improvement of R$240 million. After higher taxation for the period of R$1.613 billion because of higher income and no deductibility for interest on capital, net income increased by 37% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our principal segment, you will see in slide 14 that operating earnings in our E&amp;P segment increased by 13% quarter-over-quarter, mainly as a result of higher price of oil and a 3% increase in the production of oil and natural gas.</p>
          <p>Slide 15 illustrate that our Downstream segment was affected by the absence of a price increase in gasoline and drills in Brazil during the first quarter. Volumes were down sequentially through seasonality related to diesel. Higher price for our other oil products were more than offset by the rising cost in the crude oil and imported products leading to a loss in our Brazilian Downstream segment. The price increase announced effective May 2nd, would accrue directly to the Downstream segment.</p>
          <p>For the international segment on slide 16, you will see that the segment shift from our loss in the first quarter to an income of R$106 million in the first quarter of 2008. Production was flat quarter-over-quarter while the segment enjoyed somewhat higher oil and gas price. Volume and costs were down because of the downtime in the Pasadena refinery. Operating expense was especially less quarter-over-quarter due to the reduction in seismic acquisition, lack of write-offs of dry holes and the absence of impairment charge.</p>
          <p>Turning to the Gas and Energy segment in slide 17, the positive effect on revenue from higher gas price and volumes as well as a greater dispatch of electricity from our gas fired <mark type="inaudible" /> reduced the quarterly loss. Quarter-over-quarter, gas sales increased by 11%. We also signed a new contract with some of the local gas distribution company last year that has improved our pricing and allowed us to pass through the higher cost of gas charged to gas and energy by our E&amp;P segment. Higher gas prices were the leading cause of the increase in the cost of goods sold. In our Energy segment, higher market price and a twofold increase in generated electricity, substantially increased revenues.</p>
          <p>In January, we also started receiving income from the capacity sold under the new energy models 2005 auction. Some of these gains were offset by penalties of R$253 million, related to the non-compliance of contracts to provide natural gas. As we increased our supply of domestic gas, our capacity to enforce liquefied natural gas and our infrastructure to deliver gas, these penalties should not recur.</p>
          <p>Let me turn now to our cash flow generation. Our capital expenditure and the impact of this measure on our balance sheet, as you will see, during the period, our cash generation was roughly equal to our capital expenditure, which are about 24% higher than the period of one year ago. First quarter investments were increased by our payment for the Suzano acquisition. It is worth noting that during the first quarter, we did most of our interest on capital, which contributed to a small financing debt during the quarter. We have partially funded that debt with incremental financing as well as reducing our cash balance.</p>
          <p>Turning to our investment spending plan, we will continue to raise capital through the EF and the variety of sources available to us. As you can see in slide 19, our net debt to net total capital increased from 19 to 21%, still well below our target range of between 25 and 35%. The recent upgrade of the Republic to investment grade has been useful although Petrobras achieved an investment grade from each of the three rating agents for more than one year. Standard &amp; Poor's recently put Petrobras on positive outlook for an upgrade, partially as a result of its auction on the Republic.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. At this time, we will be happy to respond to any question you may have.</p>

          <p>Hi Mr. Barbassa, good afternoon. I have couple of questions. One is on the Tupi, can you give us some guidance, when the estimated reserves of about 5 to 8 billion will be booked? When do you expect them to be booked under the reserves? Hello?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. We are working to book this reserve, but it depends on a lot of work. The extent of the test we are going to run and afterwards the pilot plan, will give us information to better learn the results. And the wells we are going to drill will help us to better evaluate how much is the reserve and how much we can extract on the reserve lines. So it is going to take some time yet to...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Do you have any estimate on the CapEx spend for Tupi alone to develop this reserve alone at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we don't have. We are working as I said, this information we are going to collect is going to be very, very important for these evaluations and to decide on which way we are going to develop, which kind of well, which kind of platform, how we are going to export the gas. All this is under questioning, all this is being better studied to determine, to establish the model we are going to produce and then we will have price. At this moment, we don't have either price, nor the volume of CapEx. We are working our business plans right now over the period of '09 to '13 and we will have and we will deliver this information to you, we will have some of the information, but this shall not approve before September this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>With regards to supply division, do you expect the same trend to continue or do you expect there will be additional price increases for the supply divisions in the next quarter because I noticed there was losses for the supply division in Q1 2008, which you mentioned that it's because of the importation of the oil products. So do you expect the trend to continue for '08 or it will reverse in the next quarters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We -- it all depends on the trend of the international oil price. For us, we can reach the market, we are now with the price increase we announced effective from May 2nd. We are in line with the average price that is today in the international market. But one never knows if the price is going to be 140 or $90 in the next month.  If it will be in the average of the last three, four months, we will be -- the supply shall reverse the price increase we announced they shall reverse the results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good afternoon. Wondering can you give us an update if there is any change to the 2008 capital spending, given where the oil and gas price and your success in subsalt and also what is the preliminary outlook for 2009?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>2008, well, we are expecting to spend about R$55 billion and this includes the work we are going to do in the Pre Salt. At this point we don't have much expenditure addressed to the Pre Salt except the drilling of new wells. And as I said, at this point we have only three rigs working the Pre Salt cluster. More rigs will come next year, that is able to drill in this water depth. So we shall not have much paybacks for the Pre Salt during 2008. In 2009 maybe we will be increasing the volume. But we're going to know this depth when we release the new business plan by September. By now, we cannot give you anything.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I just wanted to make sure I got you right, so you say, for the full year it is R$53 billion. In the first quarter, you spent a little bit less than 11, so that means that for the remaining nine months you are going to spend about R$14 billion a quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is the normal trend of Petrobras in terms of &#x2013; we are growing continuously our CapEx. And the first quarter of last year, we had a higher CapEx than the first quarter of this year because we paid Suzano at December last year, November of last year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. And is that number going to be impacted by the OpEx with dollar continuing to depreciate against your -- is that number going to come down or that the bulk of your cost is really tied into reais, so the fluctuation in the dollar doesn't really impact on the reais term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It somewhat it helps, the real because part of our cost is in dollars. But we have a price established in the real value appreciates; you have lower costing in reais.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And any rough idea then how big is the portion of your cost is in dollar?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, depends. In the Downstream, for example, we have much more reais cost than dollars cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I am sorry, I am talking about the capital cost that R$53 billion then, roughly what's the percentage of that is in the U.S. dollar term, is based on the U.S. dollar denominator?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I understood, how much? Is about 50-50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>50-50?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are trying to increase the national content on our CapEx, so as you know, as I mentioned, we built the P-51 and we are going to build P-56 in Brazil. We are working to increase the CapEx, but the rigs even if they are built in Brazil, they are a part that has to be imported. And we import a lot of services, drilling rigs <mark type="inaudible" /> are all international supplied. So we are above 50, roughly above 50% in dollar expenditure compared to this reais that is below 50%.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. I think you guys have just filed something to the ANP on the BS-500, is there any data or any insight you can provide, or how is the result on that?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes on the BM-S-500 we have inaudible], but we are learning how to start production. In 2010, <mark type="inaudible" /> We are drilling there for this, the development phase of <mark type="inaudible" /> We are there already for this our development phase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what is the discovery there you said, I mean what kind of size we may be talking about the potential in gas discovery?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we don't publish results by fuel, [ inaudible] will have capacity to produce 10 million cubic meters a day possibly in 2010.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. A final question, can you give us a rough idea that how long the Jupiter well, the second well that you are drilling under BMS-9 that is going to take to finish and also that if you already have a firm day between you and your partner when you are going to drill on the BMS-22?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, good afternoon everybody. I just have a quick question on -- you have a number of E&amp;P concessions that will expire in 2008. So what is your strategy for those and that is one of the reasons why you guys are much more focused on exploration right now?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes that's why we are driving our efforts to the exploratory wells. We have <mark type="inaudible" /> exploratory problem towards the national agents that we must accomplish. And so we are paying attention to these &#x2013; all these share <mark type="inaudible" />. So we planned our exploration activity according to the concession contracts to fulfill all the obligations that we have.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And my second question is regarding the level of imports of refined products. You guys probably expect this level to come down in the second quarter and the rest of the year, right, on lower thermal generation and seasonality?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, there were three factors that influenced the higher volume of diesel imports. We in fact re-imported more than 100,000 barrels per day during the first quarter of diesel, only diesel. And this shall reduce because in the first quarter we wanted to increase the stock of diesel to comply with the stoppage of the great plant, and to supply the market that was using more diesel for electric -- power generation and the natural increase in consumption due to the economic builds in Brazil. So, at least two of these three factors is not going to happen again in the second half &#x2013; second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what about our expanding costs. Should they continue to be at the level that we saw in the last two quarters or could we assume that they will go down from now on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Expanding cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Expanding cost should go down because it does have any stoppage past the next quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, this second quarter we had no program to stop it. So, we expect to be refining more and reducing the average of the cost &#x2013; the refining costs.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The first one is related to BMS-8. You mentioned that you are on advanced stage for the test stage there. And my question would be when is that ending? And secondly if there is any recognition of the tax rate that would be applied to the pre-sold clusters?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I can tell you that tax rate is not under our decision. This depends on other levels of the government. With BMS-8 when do we expect it can be <mark type="inaudible" /> the drilling of these wells. And in the coming days we are finished maybe seven, ten days more.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much. And regarding the tax issue, the &#x2013; do you have an idea when the government might be communicating this tax regime or tax status.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not part of this kind of decision. So we don't know what is going on; if there is going to be any change or not. What we know is that what has been announced that part &#x2013; the contract that has been awarded is not going to be changed. If there is any change we will see in the future.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hello. Good afternoon everyone. My question is regarding the long-duration Tupi FPSO that's going to be placed on there next year in March. How long do you suspect it will remain working on Tupi, considering the contract is for 10 years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a lot of opportunities to have this FPSO &#x2013; different opportunities in the Pre Salt and other areas as well. So, as we do not anticipate where we are going to have drilling rigs operating, we do not understate our extended test as well. But for sure we are going to have the opportunity for it. And it is going to help us a lot in terms of information that we are going to collect from the different fields we have before planning the development.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so other opportunities, possibly Jupiter or possibly Carioca, those are all possibilities then, that it might be working on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No doubt, these are possibilities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. And one last question. As far as the Cachalote field, can you give us an update on that? I think I had heard that Seillean FPSO might be used for a pilot phase of Cachalote later this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Cachalote and Baleia Franca used in the blocks of Campos Basin in the Esp&#xED;rito Santo State. And they are studying now a possibility of bringing FPSO Capixaba, which historically is produced in the <mark type="inaudible" /> but is small production, only get 1,000 barrels per day. So, we plan &#x2013; we are starting to bring and to develop Cachalote and Baleia Franca is that to Capixaba. And the wells that are currently producing to FPSO Capixaba, we are going to direct them to FPSO Cidade de Vit&#xF3;ria in Golfinho field.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So Cachalote won't be receiving its own permanent unit, it will be a tie-back to Cidade de Vit&#xF3;ria?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it may have a final  yes of Seillean, but not decided yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the international refining, can you comment is it the trend on the utilization rates to continue on international. It looks like your utilization rates are around 60% for 1Q, is it like, was there a shutdown or can you comment vis-&#xE0;-vis the domestic utilization is high at 89 to 90%?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the international refining capacity was very much affected during the first quarter by the stoppage we had in the Pasadena Refinery, as we sold our refineries in Bolivia. Now, internationally we have in Argentina and in the United States &#x2013; and the United States stoppage for a long period during the first quarter. This was the cause of this low activity. But we do not expect this keep occurring for the rest of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is that due the &#x2013; on the follow-up on the refinery. The refinery you are going to build in Venezuela, the crude for that refinery will be supplied domestically?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You mean the refinery in partnership with PDVSA that we are building in Pernambuco Northeast of Brazil?</p>

        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's going to be supplied &#x2013; that refinery is going to be supplied by heavy crude in Brazil and heavy crude that is going to come from Venezuela.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>One last question on gas and energy. It looks like gas and energy division seems to be still making operating losses. Is this still related to those thermoelectric investments or what is the number which shows up as other operating expense that seems to be the number which is making the division earnings from maybe zero to a negative number. That's a number which persists all the time. So, what is the other line generally include in this? And the trend seems to be the same. It has never breakeven or &#x2013; so far in the past few years. Can you comment on the operating losses?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you can see we have diminished our loss in relation of next quarter &#x2013; the last quarter. It seems to be improving our operational revenue and &#x2013; I didn't understand exactly what you are saying about operational expense, could you be more specific?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It says other operating expense, which shows up as minus 417 million reais &#x2013; it's on page number 28 of the earnings release.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so you are talking about the Helkies natural gas contract with some power plants <mark type="inaudible" /> power plant, and these sales have extremely inflated by the price of the energy in the stock market. Okay. So, as we &#x2013; we can see the price of energy coming back in &#x2013; to lower mid-level. And we expect that this loss are going to be very lower and near to zero as we can improve our supply of natural gas. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there. How long these contracts &#x2013; these are 20, 25 year long-term contracts or -?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But as you see we are working in building up the Gasin, as we have the Gasin we can deliver the gas for such thermal power plant and we are near to receive GNL in the CRI stage in Northeast of Brazil, that will be able also to supply gas for such thermal plant. So, we will be able to supply very soon the &#x2013; or to comply with our contract commitment in terms of delivering gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Is there any target to make this divisions profitable or at least breakeven. Is there any deadline, like by '09 you'll make this? Is there any targets, deadlines for this division?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We do not give this information, but we are working hard. And as you can see from the last quarters; we are improving. And we hope to keep improving the next quarter. So, as our &#x2013; I said during the presentation, we sold more gas to Brazilian market, and this has increased the results of the segment. And we generated more energy as well. And Brazil is going to demand more energy as the Brazilian economy is going to grow. So all this will help our gas production is increasing in Brazil. We expect to be delivering, by the end of this year about 40 million cubic meters from domestic production.</p>
          <p>This is going to go to the grid of pipelines and delivering to different customers. And we expect to improve and make this segment profitable in sometime in the future.</p>

          <p>Yeah, just a follow-up on &#x2013; I think there has been a long rumor that you guys are going to acquire the Aruba Refinery from Valero. I am wondering that if you can make any comment on that, whether that is done deal and what I &#x2013; how important is Aruba to your overall strategy, and what kind of evaluation metrics that you are willing to project &#x2013; to share with us. And it looks like it is going to be very expensive to upgrade it into to a finished product refinery. So, is that the intention of the company, if indeed you are going to acquire it? Thank you.</p>

If we do not feel that the moment or the price or the condition are right, we are not going to acquire the refinery. And so we have no decision. At this point I cannot tell you much than this. We are evaluating all the opportunities we have, we evaluated many other and what I have for sure now is no decision.</p>

          <p>I have two questions on the &#x2013; by Internet. One is, if you were to use the recent price of gas and diesel increases for the first quarter 2008 numbers, won't the division <mark type="inaudible" /> shrink from an operating loss to profitability.</p>
          <p>We did not made the extrapolation that's always difficult to say. I don't have &#x2013; we have any forecast, this information.  I don't think anyone calculated this information. You can have a rough idea; take the percentage of this true oil product in our revenue and adding the average of the increased &#x2013; probably you are going to find that <mark type="inaudible" /> that I don't have this information. Okay.</p>
          <p>And the second one is how many more structures like the Carioca, do you expect buying in the coast of Brazil? Do you have any information on any other fields being exploit around that area?</p>
          <p>These are the most difficult. The one billion dollar question. no big structures <mark type="inaudible" /> .It's really difficult. We have a big expectation, a big &#x2013; take into consideration the expansion of the piece alp layer, that expands for about 800 kilometers by 200 wide. But we have to drill &#x2013; this area is relatively unexplored, so there is a lot of opportunity, but we cannot &#x2013; we do not have this rough idea of that.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much. There is no information. I want to thank Theodore. Do you want to say anything.</p>
