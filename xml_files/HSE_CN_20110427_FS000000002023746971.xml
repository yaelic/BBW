        <plist>
          <p>Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss our 2011 first quarter results. With me today are CEO, Asim Ghosh; CFO, Alister Cowan; COO, Rob Peabody; Vice President of Midstream and Refined Products, Terrance Kutryk, and Vice President of Downstream, Bob Baird.</p>
          <p>In today's call, we will provide an update on Husky's business strategy and an overview of results. Later this morning, we will also be holding our Annual General Meeting here in Calgary. A webcast of the meeting may be accessed from our website at huskyenergy.com. The AGM presentation begins at 10:30 A.M. Mountain Standard Time.</p>
          <p>Please note that today's comments contain forward-looking information. Actual results may differ materially from expected results because of various risk factors and assumptions that are described in our quarterly release and in our annual filings, which are available on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website.</p>
          <p>I'll now turn the call over to Asim.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning and thank you for joining us. This is first quarterly call of the New Year. As you can see from the results, this has been a strong quarter for Husky compared to the same quarter year ago. Our production was up 5%. Earnings were up some 70%. Cash flow was up 36%. So, on all key metrics, a good quarter. But actually, if you do a bit of deeper analysis, it is not just a question of increased oil prices because it's a mixed bag for number of reasons.</p>
          <p>We did have strong Brent oil prices driven by local recovery and of course the political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East. However, if you look at gas prices, at this time, most people in the industry thought cash prices had bottomed out. But in fact there is an abundance &#x2013; this abundance of supply continues to exert downward pressure. Secondly, as far as our particular business and a lot of Canadian &#x2013; Western Canadian industries are concerned, differential has widened between light and heavy oil as a result of lingering issues related to the Enbridge pipeline disruptions, and of course we had our own supply throughput disruptions at the Lloyd Upgrader which didn't allow us to get the benefit of that widening.</p>
          <p>Western Canada did not experience the full benefit, therefore, of the improved global crude pricing environment. On the other hand, the refining crack spreads widened in the U.S. due to the Brent WTI differentials and an improving economy which drove increased demand and the Downstream assets were able to benefit from that.</p>
          <p>Net, it's very clear that our asset portfolio, our integrated strategy allowed us to deliver good results because of strong performance in segments of our portfolio which more than offset challenges in other areas, and most importantly, the fact that all of our segments were able to deliver solid operational execution. And so therefore, we're in a position to take advantage of these factors.</p>
          <p>Now, coming now to production. Our production for the quarter averaged 310,000, a little bit over, barrels per day, which is 11% increase over the fourth quarter of 2010 and, as I said, 5% up from a year ago, so that's within our guidance. There are several factors for this strong performance. In February, we completed the acquisition of our properties from ExxonMobil, that while it's headlined as a gas acquisition, in reality, I remind you that it's a very oil and liquids-rich acquisition. That purchase began contributing about 22,000 barrels per day from production from that early February date. So we didn't have the benefits of full quarter on that.</p>
          <p>On the East Coast, our North Amethyst satellite development continued to perform well with production averaging 31,000 barrels per day in the quarter gross; so that's about 31,400 net to Husky. We also achieved a solid performance from our Western Canada heavy oil portfolio where we've initiated the, as you recollect from my conversations in previous quarters, a number of accelerated development activities outside, and these are organic outside of the acquisitions. So overall, we are pleased with the progress we have made in the production front. And we believe we remain on track to achieve our guidance of 3% to 5% growth over the five-year plan.</p>
          <p>I do wish to remind you that this is a cumulative production growth number. There will be variations year to year as we experience turnarounds and as we bring on projects, so this is really a five year average. A brief word on our Midstream/Downstream performance, they both provided solid performance for the quarter. Throughput from our refineries and Upgrader averaged 310,000 barrels per day during the quarter compared to 275,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2010. And some of that base, of course, was affected by the turnaround at Lima last year.</p>
          <p>Optimum throughput levels at our Downstream refineries were achieved, fortunately for us, at a time when we were able to capitalize on this record crack spreads that we've been seeing.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, the Downstream segment contributed some $153 million to net earnings compared to $9 million in the year-ago period. Midstream also performed strongly, contributing some $79 million to net earnings compared to $49 million a year ago.</p>
          <p>Coming now to the &#x2013; taking our eyes off the immediate quarter issues to the larger strategic issues, which are our three growth pillars. First of all, Southeast Asia, we continue to make solid progress in advancing this cornerstone project, which is the Liwan Gas Project. And as you know, we made three significant natural gas discoveries in Block 29/26.</p>
          <p>There's Liwan 3-1, Liuhua 34-2 and Liuhua 29-1, the overall development plan for Liwan 3-1 has been prepared undergoing final reviews, and we expect to submit the plan for approval later this year, and pricing contracts are at the late stages of being finalized.</p>
          <p>I'm not in a position to disclose the exact details because you know at the midst of a negotiation, but as we have said to you before, I can share with you that gas could be sold under a long-term contract at competitive prices in the South China, the Guangdong and Hong Kong markets.</p>
          <p>Project sanction is expected within this calendar year. First production targeted for late 2013 and it lasts up to 2014.</p>
          <p>In Oil Sands, we did tell you in the last quarter that we had sanctioned the project. The project, the Sunrise project remains on budget and on plan, and that is targeting for first oil in 2014. And contractual work has already begun in the quarter on Sunrise Phase II with an eye towards depreciating the economies of scale that would emerge from an expansion of that project.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the Atlantic Region, we continue to evaluate options for the next phase of our White Rose satellite developments. Key option in the consideration there is the possible construction of a fixed drilling platform, and again, like the South China Sea Project, we hope to be able to provide further details on this as well later in the year.</p>
          <p>In summary then, I think it'd be fair to say we are pleased with the progress we have made in the past 10 months to execute our strategic plan. You will recollect that we got clarity to the South China spinoff uncertainty. We got clarity to the Sunrise execution project. We did complete two significant acquisitions. And we're very pleased with the initial results of those.</p>
          <p>We undertook a comprehensive financing plan. And I think our first quarter results demonstrate some of the early guidance, and we continue to execute against the financial targets and operational milestones that I'd outlined to you in the Investor Day in early December. And I just would like in ending to reiterate the fact that our strategy of being an integrated company, which I told you we were integrated for some very specific reasons, specific to our particular portfolio. I think this quarter has been a vindication of that fundamental cornerstone of our strategy.</p>
          <p>Well, on that note Alister, why don't you pick up on the next section?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. As Asim indicated, we did perform well this quarter, but we did have some negative impact from a strong Canadian dollar, continued weakness in natural gas prices and the way the Western Canada crude oil dispensed to WTI that Asim talked about. However, these were more than offset by strong operational performance in production and refinery throughput and higher Brent related crude oil pricing for our offshore production and refining margins in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Net earnings were $626 million or $0.70 per share, and that compares to $368 million or $0.41 per share in the same period a year earlier. The net earnings did include a gain on disposal of non-core assets of $143 million after tax. Our cash flow from operations increased 36% during the quarter to $1.16 billion or $1.30 per share compared to $854 million or $1 per share in the year-ago period. And this compares to cash flow of $1.04 billion or $1.21 per share in the fourth quarter of 2010. I'd remind you that the cash flow related to the gain on disposal of non-core assets is not included in the cash flow from operations, it's included in cash flow from investing activities.</p>
          <p>Our financial results clearly reflect the transition to IFRS at the start of 2001 &#x2013; 2011. We did disclose in our Annual Report in Note 24 the full impact of that and we restated that in Q1 again. 2010 numbers have been restated for comparisons. Main impacts of IFRS for the quarter are exploration expense as a result of our move to successful IFRS accounting and higher depletion expense as a result of reporting on a field-by-field basis now instead of our fuel cost basis.</p>
          <p>That brings us to approximately to $93 million pre-tax for exploration expense as we've disclosed and roughly $40 million additional depletion charge pre-tax. Now, our production averaged 310,400 barrels boe per day and that compares to 296,000 boe per day in the first quarter of 2010 and up from 280,500 boe per day in the fourth quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>As Asim said, our U.S. Downstream business had a very solid first quarter with strong operational performance of the refineries and higher refining margins and that resulted in the Downstream segment contributing $153 million to net earnings in this quarter.</p>
          <p>The Upgrader resumed normal operations in mid-April, now following the completion of repairs due to the minor fire. The overall pre-tax impact including repair costs is estimated as an opportunity cost of between $70 million to $80 million pre-tax during the first quarter. We will have about another $10 million to $50 million impact in April as we ramped up.</p>
          <p>Pricing, we did see improved pricing environment which was a contributor to the quarter's results. Although I will say that the stronger Canadian dollar did partially offset some of that improved pricing. Our realized crude oil pricing was $76.78 compared to $69.29 for the same period last year. As I said, we benefited from higher Brent related pricing for our offshore production, which is approximately 31% of our liquids production. But that was partially offset by lowering pricing for Western Canada crude oil as a result of export pipeline disruptions. The light and heavy crude oil differentials averaged $23.11 per barrel and that compared to $9.29 per barrel in the first quarter of last year. But as Asim mentioned earlier, we didn't &#x2013; we were unable to capture the full benefit of our widening spread as the result of the reduced acreage of the Upgrader.</p>
          <p>However, I would say it did positively affect contributions from the Toledo refinery, which processes a significant amount of heavy crude oil. The refining &#x2013; realized refining margin in the U.S. Downstream averaged US$16.83 per barrel in the quarter compared to US$5.12 a year ago. Realized natural gas prices reflected weaker market conditions and was $3.66 per mcf compared to $4.81 per mcf last year. From a financing perspective, we completed two key initiatives as part of a comprehensive financing plan.</p>
          <p>These are designed to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility during the period of accelerated growth in our portfolio. The shareholders approved an amendment to the Corporation's articles which allows dividends to be paid in cash or common shares at these shareholders' discretion, and the April dividend that was paid in early April reflected that cash and stock split. We also closed our preferred share issue in the quarter raising $300 million in equity financing at very attractive rates. And our debt to capital ratio, we ended the period with 21% and debt-to-cash flow of 1.2 times on a trailing 12-month basis remains below our targeted ranges.</p>
          <p>As I look forward, we do see a reasonably good market environment going forward into the second quarter. When we look forward, I'd remind you for the rest of the year, we have supply and maintenance events. We're scheduled to complete the minor 45-day turnaround at the Lloyd Upgrader in the third quarter. During that period, the Upgrader will be at roughly 70% capacity.</p>
          <p>The Toledo refinery will have a minor 30-day turnaround in the second quarter on the cracker unit and for general maintenance. On the East Coast, the SeaRose FPSO is scheduled for a 16-day maintenance turnaround commencing in July. However, we are evaluating options to reduce our program's duration.</p>
          <p>We also expect that the originally scheduled 15-week dockside maintenance for the Terra Nova FPSO will be deferred from July 2011 to future date, the timing of the turnaround is undergoing finalization by the operator.</p>
          <p>As I previously mentioned, the transition from Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles to International Financial Reporting Standards will have an impact on retained earnings and net earnings. There will be no impact to cash flow as a result of this.</p>
          <p>For 2011, we have estimated that transition to IFRS will result in a reduction in net earnings in the range of $200 million to $275 million versus the comparable Canadian GAAP numbers.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Board of Directors has approved a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share and each shareholder's election will be paid in either cash or shares.</p>
          <p>Now at this time, I'd like turn it over to Rob, who is going to talk about the Upstream results.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Alister. While Asim and Alister described the first quarter as very strong from the standpoint of operational and financial metrics, it was more challenging from a safety perspective. As you will be aware, we had a fire at the Upgrader that resulted in reduced throughput. We also had an incident while fracking a well in Western Canada. I can assure you that both of these incidents are the subject of rigorous investigations. Lessons learned from the incidents will be shared throughout the organization and with our industry partners where appropriate to guard against any reoccurrence.</p>
          <p>Turning to production, as Asim noted, we made solid progress in the quarter in accelerating our near-term production. So far, based on our performance to-date, we remain on track to achieve our production guidance. In Western Canada, the foundation of our business, as described in the strategy, in the first quarter, we drilled 234 exploration and development wells. Looking at the type of wells drilled, 94% of these targeted oil or liquids-rich resource gas plays, in line with our strategy.</p>
          <p>In oil resource plays, we focused on developing our opportunities in the Lower Shaunavon and Bakken zones of southern Saskatchewan along with the Viking zone in southwest Saskatchewan and Central Alberta.</p>
          <p>16 wells were drilled in the quarter and six placed on production at a combined rate of 445 barrels per day. We continued to develop in our gas &#x2013; in terms of our gas resource plays, we continued to develop our liquids-rich natural gas assets. Our prime focus in the near term is Ansell where liquids production from the Cardium averages about 50 barrels of natural gas per million standard cubic feet of gas.</p>
          <p>At Ansell, four rigs were active and a total of 20 wells were drilled in the quarter. We're currently shut down for breakup. We plan to recommence drilling in the second quarter with 21 wells planned. In the third quarter, we expect to commission extra capacity at Ansell to take production to around 56 million cubic feet per day and over 2,000 barrels per day of liquids.</p>
          <p>Additional exploration and development drilling continued at our plays in northwestern &#x2013; sorry northeast British Columbia and with two Jean Marie development wells drilled at Bivouac and the first Muskwa horizontal well drilled in the Horn River Basin with very encouraging results.</p>
          <p>Through a combination of crown land sales and private purchases, we increased our land holdings in our gas resource play portfolio by 29,000 acres in the quarter. Looking at our activities in Lloydminster and Heavy Oil, construction of the 8,000 barrel per day South Pikes Peak project is about 60% complete. The project remains on budget and on schedule and we expect first production in mid 2012.</p>
          <p>Construction also continued on the 3,000 barrel per day Paradise Hill project, which was commenced at the start of the quarter. First production there is expected in late 2012. Our horizontal well development program, targeting new geological horizons in the Lloydminster area has been running at a strong base. 31 of the planned 104 wells for 2011 were drilled in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>And we continued to make good progress at Tucker Oil Sands project with production averaging 6,200 barrels per day in the quarter, and that compares to &#x2013; with 4,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2010. In the next quarter, we will be adding further production wells as we go through the quarter and subsequently through the year.</p>
          <p>Tucker generated positive cash flow and earnings over the quarter. Turning to our growth pillars, as Asim mentioned, the Sunrise Energy Project continues to progress on schedule towards first production in 2012. 12 horizontal wells were spud &#x2013; sorry 2014. 12 horizontal wells were spud and seven were fully drilled in the quarter, and the well logs and cores were getting back from that operation, showed that the reservoir quality is in line with our expectations.</p>
          <p>Several contracts were signed during the quarter for the key equipment, including contracts for steam generators, vessels with a water treatment plant and a camp to support the project.</p>
          <p>During the quarter, we advanced conceptual work for Sunrise Phase II. We have planned &#x2013; we do plan to commence pre-FEED work on that project in the second half of 2011. We also drilled 24 stratigraphic test wells to further delineate our Saleski Oil Sands lease.</p>
          <p>In the Atlantic region, production continued to be strong for North Amethyst. The field produced an average of 31,000 barrels per day gross during the quarter, of which Husky share is 21,400 barrels. In 2011, we expect to tie in another production well and one more injected at North Amethyst. At White Rose &#x2013; at West White Rose, our next satellite project, our pilot well pair progressed on schedule. These wells will help refine our understanding of the development potential of the full West White Rose field.</p>
          <p>First production from the pilot is expected in the third quarter of this year. In 2011, we also plan to drill an appraisal well at our Mizzen discovery and an exploration well to test another prospect south of Terra Nova.</p>
          <p>Looking over to Southeast Asia. As Asim mentioned, we continue to make good progress on the Liwan Gas Project as well. Towards &#x2013; and we're aiming to sanction the project later in 2011 and we continue to target first production in late 2013.</p>
          <p>All nine development wells for the Liwan 3-1 field have been drilled confirming the quality and the extent of the reservoir. Tendering of key pieces of the project including deepwater production equipment pipelines and installation services is advancing.</p>
          <p>In Indonesia, Husky and its partners continue to move forward with plans for the development of the Madura BD and MDA gas fields. Tenders for Madura's long lead items including the floating production storage offloading vessel are being issued, are to be issued by midyear.</p>
          <p>We continue to target first production from Madura in 2014. So in summary, in the Upstream, we continue to make substantial progress on accelerating near-term production and advancing our growth pillars and we remain comfortable with our production guidance for the remainder of the year.</p>
          <p>At this time, I'd like to turn you over to our moderator for your questions. And following that, Asim will offer some closing remarks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks and good morning, guys. Just I &#x2013; this question is for Asim. The pillars of growth you suggested delivering results. I wonder and we know what the sort of medium to longer term growth pillars are. In the near term, could you provide some clarity on your thoughts here? Are you focused on execution? Are you looking at incremental acquisitions? What's the very near-term strategy?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Good question. I mean first of all, I do want to say that what I talked was we were executing the interim steps of the pillars of growth. I'm not suggesting for a minute that the pillars of growth are giving us the results today, just so this is a small point of clarification there.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, I think we are, at this point, focused on becoming an execution machine. Okay, very simple, we have a strategy, it's not our plan to change strategy every day. We did have a need to bridge a short-term gap, and we have executed some critical inorganic steps towards that. And we're done with it for the moment. At this point, we are focused on executing what we have. And I think you would have got a flavor from what Rob was talking about both in terms of project execution for the larger projects and in terms of executing our present portfolio. That's what we're focusing on. We want to become a predictable execution machine.</p>
          <p>If something opportunistic which is very value accretive should come our way, we would be open to that in terms of inorganic stuff, and &#x2013; but always within the very tight strategic rigor we've laid out which is, I believe I used the term strategic contiguity. That's something that speaks to our core skills; that keeps us in the geographies that we are in, and most importantly is financially accretive. So I don't really want to box myself into a corner of saying something is always done. But having said that, at this point, our focus is on becoming an execution machine.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I've got some &#x2013; just some quick ones and then I did want to ask you something on strategy, mostly on the Downstream. But how should we be thinking about gas realizations then with Madura? Will those be &#x2013; are those &#x2013; I believe those are with power producers, but just wanted to get an understanding as to whether there'll be any linkage then with petroleum prices whatsoever?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the gas offtake agreements for Madura, we sold into Indonesia. So they're going to be kind of domestic pricing, which is clearly lower than what you might get in selling it to China. But there won't be much linkage with oil prices for those, Greg.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no problem. And that's what we thought before. With Liwan then, Alister, I think at your strategy session, we've been talking about 150 million cubic feet a day of production to your interest. I just wanted to take a reality check on the CapEx and see if you can comment, but we're somewhere around $1.75 billion, $2 billion for that development net to your interest. Are those numbers about right?</p>

          <p>Yeah, and that's associated with both &#x2013; for the full CapEx.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so your interest then will ramp to 250 million?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, over time as we bring on the &#x2013; the additionally, the other two fields.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I think what you were saying is boost CapEx accordingly?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Okay. Your release has got a lot in here just in terms of a very extensive land position in Western Canada and you've highlighted some of the areas. But are you &#x2013; would you plan or would you be open to sort of coming out targeted production rates, what have you with a number whether it's the Viking Cardium and what have you, are you open to do that? Just feels as though it's a lot going on, but it's just a question of bringing some focus in terms of what it's going to mean production wise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, do you want to take that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well maybe, if you just give me a little more clarity on what the question is?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think, Rob, it's really a question of just what kind of production &#x2013; is there a way that you could break down what kind of production targets you have just for some of the new plays that you're bringing on?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well we aren't ready to do a breakdown. But what we did do at the &#x2013; at our presentation last year, if you remember, was we &#x2013; our target production coming from these plays over the period to 2015 is to grow the business to about 30,000 barrels a day. And what we're seeing out there at the moment still leaves us very confident we'll be able to do that over the five-year period.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what &#x2013; and just as a point of reference then, where would those be at as at &#x2013; were they effectively zero at Christmas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They were about 5000 barrels a day currently.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks very much. And the last question is just really one on strategy. And obviously, we've seen a recovery here in terms of Downstream. If we, for whatever reason, this cycle gets extended and Downstream does start to attract more attention, strategically, is there any role like &#x2013; is Lima a necessary part of the portfolio longer term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think to be honest with you, our view on the refining assets is they are options, and we will reevaluate the value of the options as we -- as the situation unfolds, but basically, I want to be clear about this. Our strategy continues to remain to be integrated.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Thanks very much.</p>

            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Next question comes from Andrew Potter of CIBC. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, hi. Just a few questions. First, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about Mizzen. What is the &#x2013; a little bit more specifically about when we should expect this to spud and when we'd expect results, and maybe if you can talk a little bit about range of potential resource estimates? And second question was just on Tucker, maybe if you can just elaborate on with the new wells coming on, where would we expect to exit 2011 and maybe get a little color even on where we would expect this to go in 2012?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the Tucker question first, and then I'll hand you over to Rob for Mizzen. On Tucker, this project starts to cover our cost of capital and give an accretive return at today's pricing at about the 10,000 to 12,000 barrels a day range, okay. And our present projections lead us to believe that we could get to those sorts of figures by the end of this year. Since this project was conceived, oil prices are up. And I'd remind you that this project was conceived at a long-term oil price of 35 barrels. So the metrics that are required to make this project growth have changed materially. On Mizzen, Rob, do you want to take that one?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, just briefly. I mean we're planning with our partner, Statoil, to spud that well subject to rig availability sometime in the third quarter. In terms of what we have there, we have one exploration well. On the basis of the information we had there, we were awarded the largest significant discovery license ever given on the East Coast. But the key thing now is the delineation well to really understand the full scope and size of that development. So it'd premature to speculate on its size yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's fine, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>We will now open the question and answer session to members of the media. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call over to Mr. Rob McInnis for closing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, we'll turn it over to Asim for some closing comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you. So basically, I'd close by saying I think the picture that you see emerging, and I think that speaks to the point that George Toriola raised earlier in the meeting was, one of increasing momentum as we execute on our near-term strategy and fill in the building blocks of our growth pillars. But to refresh your memory, it's the Liwan Gas Project, which we expect to sanction in later in 2011 and that comes onsteam in &#x2013; at the end of 2013 and the Sunrise Energy Project which is progressing well, that comes onstream in 2014. And in the months ahead, we hope to be able to share some news on our third growth pillar of the Atlantic region,  where we are evaluating the  White Rose project, but in the meantime, we are focused on executing the existing parts of our portfolio.</p>
          <p>Thank you for joining us, a good start to the New Year. And all the best to everybody. Thank you.</p>
