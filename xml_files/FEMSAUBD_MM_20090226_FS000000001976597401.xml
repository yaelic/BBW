          <p>Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FEMSA's Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, and all participants are in a listen-only mode. At the request of the company, we will open the conference up for questions and answers after the presentation.</p>
          <p>During this conference call, management may discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning FEMSA's future performance, and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company. These forward-looking statements reflect management expectations and are based upon currently available data. Actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties, which can materially impact the company's actual performance.</p>
          <p>At this time, I will now turn the conference over to Javier Astaburuaga, FEMSA's CFO. Please go ahead, Javier.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FEMSA's fourth quarter and full year 2008 earnings conference call. Joining me today are Alfredo Fern&#xE1;ndez and Juan Fonseca, both of whom you know well.</p>
          <p>As you all know, 2008 was a challenging year across geographies and industries. And as we anticipated back in October in our previous quarterly conference call, the second half of the year turned out to be different from what we experienced in the first half.</p>
          <p>Consumer activity across our markets soften and the data coming from our three businesses during the fourth quarter, while not completely uniform increasingly pointed to a deteriorating consumer environment that obviously has made us cautious about 2009.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, GDP growth expectations were revised downward by the Central Bank as the year unfolded. Fourth quarter GDP growth came in at minus 1.6% and for the year it came in at 1.3% versus the original expectation of 3.7%.</p>
          <p>For each part, inflation also crept above 6% for the year further pressuring consumers' purchasing power.</p>
          <p>However, in spite of the challenging and volatile economic environment, FEMSA again managed to deliver solid results. Our consolidated operating income grew in the double-digits for the quarter and for the year. These results reflect our ability to achieve good results even in difficult times driven by the benefits of our integrated beverage platform together with our continuous improvement efforts at every stage of the value chain.</p>
          <p>For the quarter and the year, double-digit operating income growth at FEMSA Comercio and Coca-Cola FEMSA more than compensated for a decline at FEMSA Cerveza. In terms of business highlights for the quarter, Coca-Cola FEMSA's integration of Remil and Jugos del Valle far exceeded our expectations and has made Coca-Cola FEMSA the largest producer of still beverages in the region.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, FEMSA Comercio opened 286 net new stores across Mexico to reach 6,374 stores while once again delivering strong earnings growth. For it's part, the competitive environment in the beer industry in Mexico continued to be rational through the holiday season, allowing us to partially mitigate the pressure of general and specific industry inflation on our costs through healthy pricing, which also positions us well on that front as we start the New Year.</p>
          <p>Consolidated operating income grew 15% for the fourth quarter and for the full year, marking a solid operational performance for our company. However, below the operating line our net majority income fell significantly for the quarter, 78%, mainly reflecting non-cash charges caused by depreciation of the U.S. dollar against our local currencies, as applied to our liability position as well as a mark-to-market valuation of certain financial instruments.</p>
          <p>Let me spend some time on this. As you saw in our press release for the quarter, we recorded a loss of 3.2 billion pesos below the operating line of which 1.3 billion pesos are recorded on the financial instruments line. Most of the time that the reworkings we used meet the accounting criteria that allow us to account for them as hedges such as aluminum forwards that eventually flow through the income statement as part of the cost of goods sold.</p>
          <p>However, some instruments do not meet the accounting criteria to be considered hedges and in those cases, we must mark them to market at the effect of their unwinding on a separate line of the income statement. For example, if we contract debt in pesos and dame by dollar forwards to convert that peso liability into a dollar liability, the gains and losses generated go on that line. So the way to look at this is basically that over percent of the losses below the operating line are really foreign exchange losses, but they show up on four different lines in the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the balance sheet front, our position remains quite strong. As of December 31, 2008, our net debt to EBITDA coverage ratio was 1.1 times and our interest coverage ratio was 7.3 times. Approximately 77% of our total debt was denominated in local currency, mainly Mexican pesos and approximately 55% of our debt carried a fixed interest rate. As of today as you may know from Coca Cola FEMSA's press release and conference call yesterday they already have in their cash balance most of the dollars needed to repay their dollar maturities for 2009.</p>
          <p>Finally before moving on to our business units, let me remind you that the beginning in 2008 according to Mexican FRS, we discontinued the use of inflation accounting so for comparison purposes, the figures for 2007 have been restated in Mexican pesos, with purchasing power as of December 31, 2007. And our results for 2008 are in current pesos.</p>
          <p>Let me first comment on the results of FEMSA Cerveza. Softening consumer trends across markets were partially compensated by healthy pricing in Mexico and Brazil. In terms of volumes, we face tough comparisons versus the fourth quarter of 2007 across our markets.</p>
          <p>During the quarter in Mexico we saw a small contraction of 0.7%, while volumes in Brazil decreased 3.5% rescinding price increases we roll out ahead of the industry, and to a lesser extent to poor weather in key territories.</p>
          <p>However in our exports we continued to buck the global trend and grew our volumes by a strong 12.3%. In terms of pricing, in Mexico price per hectoliter grew 10% in nominal terms, of which approximately one-third is explained by volume growth into direct distribution and mix effects with the remaining two-thirds reflecting the actual price increases slightly above the yearly inflation taken in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In Brazil, pricing in local currency was up almost 6% as we selectively increased prices ahead of the industry. In the U.S., pricing in dollars has decreased slightly driven by package mix, but in pesos, we saw an increase of 16.7%. All-in-all, total revenue increased 8.6% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>On the cost side, raw materials pressure continued. Cost of sales increased 13.5%, again ahead of this 8.6% revenue growth. Cost per hectoliter increased a little bit over 14%, reflecting significant grain pressure experienced across our brewing operations, combined with higher aluminum prices and the depreciation of the Mexican peso against the dollar as applied to our dollar denominated costs.</p>
          <p>The impact of the depreciation was mitigated by dollar forwards we contracted at attractive levels for a significant portion of our dollar requirements. Gross profit increased nevertheless 4.6% for the quarter. However, gross margin contracted by 200 basis points.</p>
          <p>Here, I would like to elaborate on the subject of our hedging policy a little bit. As we have mentioned before, we view hedging as a way to reduce volatility from our cost structure and to mitigate external risks to the extent possible. As such, we contracted raw material hedges, mainly aluminum before commodities tumbled late last year, and therefore we will benefit only marginally from the lower price environment in 2009 and partially in 2010.</p>
          <p>On the flip side, and consistent with our policy, we contracted dollar forwards at attractive levels as I just mentioned, in order to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of our dollarized input and this is providing us with some relief today.</p>
          <p>Along the same principle, the mass majority of our long-term debt is denominated in pesos in line with our risk management policies. We intend to continue managing our risk going forward in a manner consistent with our policies.</p>
          <p>Now coming back to our results. Income from operations at FEMSA Cerveza decreased 9.3% to 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Selling expenses increased 15.8% versus 2007 in nominal terms, representing 31% of revenues, pretty much in line with recent trends. Once we've stripped out inflation, out of the 15% growth in nominal terms, the increase is explained by a high level of marketing activity, split more or less evenly between Mexico and the United States in this quarter, with the added pressure from the depreciation of the peso on the U.S. component.</p>
          <p>As was the case in the second and third quarters, we also had strong distribution channel investments Oxxo, as well as incremental expenses related to volume taken over from third party distributors mainly in the state of Chiapas. As we stand today, our direct distribution stands at 91% of our Mexican volumes.</p>
          <p>Here, I would like to mention that the combination of distribution improvements achieved in Mexico in recent years. The higher leverage we're beginning to realize from larger volume basis both in Brazil and the U.S. and the very significant rationalization efforts that are being put in place across the business should result in a change in the growth trend of selling expenses that becomes evident as 2009 unfolds.</p>
          <p>For their part, administrative expenses declined 6% in the fourth quarter. As a result, operating expenses added 50 basis points to the gross margin contraction with the operating margin decreasing 250 basis points to 12.7% of total revenues for the quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to our soft drink business. Coca-Cola FEMSA delivered almost 34% growth at the operating income level lapping a 12.6% increase in the fourth quarter of 2007 and reaching almost 20% growth for the year. This robust growth was driven by price increase implemented across markets together with incremental organic volumes and the integration of Jugos del Valle and Remil.</p>
          <p>Operating leverage in most markets more than offset raw material pressure coming from PET and sugar prices and from the depreciation of the Mexican peso against most of our local currencies. High leverage prices in Mercosur and Latincentro combined with volume growth driven by brand Coco-Cola and our non-carbonated beverage portfolio, together with moderate growth in Mexico resulted in strong 24% growth in revenues and almost 20% for the year to close to 83 billion pesos in 2008.</p>
          <p>Jugos del Valle, we have strengthened our still beverage portfolio with a number of products and formulas aimed at different consumption occasions. This category more than doubled its size in the quarter but still accounts for a very small piece of the business just around 4%. And for its parts, our newly acquired Remil operations had brand Coco-Cola grow more than 7% in the quarter contributing approximately 60% of incremental volumes.</p>
          <p>In Mexico, average prices excluding the fast growing jug water business improved 1.7% in spite of incremental soft drinks volumes in multi-serve presentations. Volume growth, stable pricing and tightly controlled operating expenses more than offset cost pressures driven mainly by higher concentrate prices and the depreciation of the Mexican peso supply to our U.S. dollar denominated costs, resulting in a 0.5 operating income margin improvement in the quarter. If you are unable to participate in Coca-Cola FEMSA's conference call yesterday, you can access the replay of the webcast for additional details on the results.</p>
          <p>At FEMSA Comercio finally, strong profit growth more than offset the reduction in the average ticket of 10.7% resulting in slightly better same-store sales than the fourth quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>As was the case throughout 2008, the average ticket was impacted by a migration from consumer purchases of prepaid cellular phone cards for which we booked the full sale prices revenue to the non-electronic air-time purchases for which we only booked the amount of our commission, as opposed to the full amount of the recharge. Therefore, average ticket figures are not comparable to 2007figures. But they will become comparable during the first quarter of 2009 as we have locked the full rollout of business service last December and as CC call prepaid cards continued to decline in the mix of air-time sales.</p>
          <p>For comparability purposes if we book the full amount of the electronic recharges, average ticket would have grown in the high single-digits during the quarter. As traffic and ticket figures we can't fully comparable in the coming months the performance of our same-store sales will revert to a normalized trend.</p>
          <p>In terms of new store openings we exceeded our objective for the year with 811 net openings and these normally is well ahead of our initial expectation of a little bit over 750 stores for the year. Revenues increased 11% during the quarter, reflecting our ongoing store expansion as well as increased food traffic to the store.</p>
          <p>Gross margin improved 410 basis points, largely driven by the change in the way we book prepaid cellular air-time, as I just described, as well as by a strong performance from high margin categories such as fast food and coffee and to a lesser extent, by better commercial agreements with our suppliers.</p>
          <p>Sequentially, operating expenses increased slightly above the previous quarter, reflecting the accelerated number of store openings and higher operating costs at the store level, mainly energy, as well as to expenses related to the strengthening of FEMSA Comercio's organizational structure in line with our plans for 2008. Despite the rising operating expenses, operating income increased 27% in the quarter and more than 30% for the full year, for the seventh consecutive year. In the quarter, Comercio expanded its operating margin by 110 basis points to reach 9.3% of revenues, the highest ever achieved in our retail operation.</p>
          <p>And let me now take a moment to reflect on the current environment and perhaps offer some thoughts on the year ahead. As macroeconomic conditions took an accelerated turn for the worse back in September and October, most notably evidenced for us by the sustained weakness of the Mexican peso and by the rapidly eroding growth estimates for the economies where we operate, the decisions were made to implement major cost expenses and investment revisions across FEMSA.</p>
          <p>Even though our products are very defensive in nature and we expect to be less affected by the downturn than many other industries, we are not immune. And so careful not to jeopardize long-term strategy, every manager at every level of our organization is adjustor for lean times ahead.</p>
          <p>Clearly, the fourth quarter is also to capture even the earliest effects of the measures being taken. The adjustments were begun through in the fourth quarter but are being carried out now, and we'll continue to cover it out, as the year progresses. We expect the aggregate effect of these adjustments to provide some relief to our 2009 results. However, the environment continues to deteriorate.</p>
          <p>After hanging in there for a long time, manufacturing data in Mexico is showing clear signs of deceleration. Construction continues to slow down as expected. And therefore real GDP forecast for 2009 have quickly shifted from flourish to ranges of minus 1 to minus 2%, while the Mexican peso has continued to weaken. Such volatility in our key forecast variable prevents us from providing any granular expectations for our performance in 2009. But we can share with you some broad directional considerations.</p>
          <p>We are assuming a moderate contraction in the amount across our products and markets, partially offset by pricing activity with exception of the U.S. We are expecting a reduction in our capital expenditures for approximately 30% in dollar terms, bringing the levels below those of 2007. And we're already engaged in a broadened profound actual size of costs and expense reduction at every level of our organization.</p>
          <p>Having said all that, we are convinced that our operations today enjoy a stronger competitive position in more markets than ever before. We have a better understanding of consumer behavior, as well as time tested tool for use in difficult times such as this, that allow us to micro segment the market base in particular consumer needs. We also had a management team that is committed to driving efficiencies across our organization, adjusting our spending levels in a matter consistent with evolution of our markets and maximizing the return on every dollar spent. And all these give us a conviction that we will emerge from this difficult times stronger than ever and more competitive than we are now.</p>
          <p>And with that I would like to open the call for your questions. Please, operator?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Javier. The question-and-answer session will begin at this time. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from Antonio Gonzalez with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I would like to ask you a couple of questions, if I may. First with respect to the hedging losses, we saw already 2.3 billion pesos in hedging losses in yesterday's results from KOF, regarding the debt denominated in dollars. However the additional 1 billion pesos loss that you recorded, I would like to see if you could give us some color on where is it coming from? If it's not from the aluminum hedges and if you could give us some guidance as to how the FX losses will be looking like during the first quarters of this year? And then secondly, with respect to the selling expenses in FEMSA Cerveza, are you planning to increase in particular your marketing expenses budget for '09 in the U.S. and how could potential savings and at the selling expenses line in terms of Cerveza could be &#x2013; could there be any. Could you give us some color on the split of those savings?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sure, sure Antonio. First if you look at &#x2013; as I said in the opening remarks, if you look at P&amp;L in FEMSA, we're showing a foreign exchange loss of 1.9 billion pesos. And basically that is the foreign exchange loss on the dollar denominated liability position both financially and operationally, and what I said is that out of the 1.3 billion pesos that we're showing in the unhedged derivative instrument loss, 80% of that 1.3 billion pesos is basically foreign exchange loss. The way it works here in terms of the accounting principles that we have to follow is that. For example if we have contracted peso-denominated debt and we bought cross-currency swaps to convert that peso-denominated debt into dollars, the foreign exchange effect on that dollar liability position needs to be reflected in these unhedged derivative instrument loss, not in the foreign exchange loss. That's an accounting treatment but in reality that is a foreign exchange loss, that's the way we should look at it.</p>
          <p>The rest of the amounts that are in the unhedged derivative instrument loss line in the P&amp;L of FEMSA are as a result of hedges, which because again of accounting criteria we cannot account in the traditional hedge way, that is going through the asset that it was originally hedged and then flowing through the P&amp;L in the future. But we have to reflect them in the quarter that it takes place because it wasn't fulfilled the accounting requirements to do it the &#x2013; any other way. So I hope I'm being clear on this but again the simple way to look at it is just taking close to 900 million pesos out of the 1.3 billion unhedged derivative and instrument loss line in the P&amp;L, and put that as part of the foreign exchange loss.</p>
          <p>The most important thing on the &#x2013; on that line, once you take out what is a foreign exchange loss, is basically a hedge that was drawn on the wheat as a reference for the barley program purchases here Mexico. That again because of accounting treatment we need to reflect in the P&amp;L as opposed to bring in it to the cost of sale as inventory is bought and consumed. And on the other part on the other questions, we are into 2009 still increasing accordingly to our commercial agreement with Heineken USA, our marketing investment in the U.S and we are very confident that those dollars are working very, very well in terms of the growth profile that we have been having in the last two to three years with a Heineken relationship. And that we will continue.</p>
          <p>On the rest, on the territories we think we're going to have the possibility to rationalize market and investments as well as selling expenses both from the operational point of view as well as from the commercial point of view that is terms and conditions that we manage with groups of retailers and as well as from the marketing point of view once we have come to a point in which we have provided good amounts of funds to the main strategies of the company towards Tecate Light, just recently Indio and the super premium categories. We feel confident that we will have some room there to maneuver and rationalize a little bit marketing dollars. So that's kind of our going position for 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. So regarding the FX losses, sorry, just other than the losses related to the U.S. dollar denominated debt, should there be more losses related to the hedging strategies in the first half of this year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the first half of this year, we basically didn't have anything.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>First half of 2009, sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>For 2009, what we can expect is basically an effect again of the foreign exchange, depending on how the pesos ends up being at 31st of March, but that will be basically the numbers that we will be looking at.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Now we will go on to our next question with Robert Ford with Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, good day everybody. Robert Ford from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. And Javier, if you could just help us out and maybe walk us through the volume decline in Brazil to the brand health indicators that you're seeing there and then perhaps also give us a little update year-to-date in terms of what's happening with FEMSA cerveza please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Hi Rob, volumes in Brazil were down for the first time in the last I think 10 or 11 quarters for our company. And we attribute a lot of it, a lot of the performance and of course we'll need still to wait for numbers from the rest of the industry. But we attribute a lot of it to a price increase that we implemented ahead of the rest of the players, I would say in a significant way in some SKUs, channels and regions in order to close price gaps.</p>
          <p>Once we start to get a good feeling about the brand health that would provide pr&#xE9;cisely for that gap closing. We anticipate that as we speak and basically at the end of last quarter, some of the players have also started to move pricing. And it will be because of again just the cost pressure on everyone. And it will be also because of the introduction of the new tax regime in Brazil that even though doesn't have a big impact on our company it does on the leader of the industry down there. So that's basically what we can sense about the volume declines, still we are very, very confident with the brand health indicators for the full year and for the fourth quarter. And another I would say impact would be on the fourth quarter about the weather. We basically have not had as good weather in fourth quarter '08 as opposed to '07.</p>
          <p>Once you have started, we are looking at better volume performance. So we are confident that we will &#x2013; we're getting our track again in terms of growing the volume base down there in Brazil. And in terms of the Mexican market as I described in the opening remarks what we're looking is again still &#x2013; if you look at the performance for the quarter taking into account that we implemented a couple of price increases during the year in Mexico. A very small contraction of the volume base looking at GDP for the quarter coming down, still makes us very optimistic about the resiliency of our products and of our brands. So all in all price taking promotional activity being in a very rational way and again consumers are sticking up there on consumptions levels. We feel good about that part of the equation. Again as I said, cost side pressures continue and will continue going into 2009. So we are going to manage the business accordingly in terms of again during 2009 being able to transfer some of those pressures into our cost structure, into pricing, and rationalizing the business cost base as much as we can without jeopardizing the long-term perspectives of the business because of the cost pressures that we will continue to experience due to the fact that we are not going to be benefiting from the declining commodity prices due to the hedges, decisions we took in 2008. So all in all we feel under the circumstances pretty good about the prospectus of the business and the performance for the fourth quarter of the business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Javier, I thought the pricing was extraordinary and I got to believe that what's in part mitigating some of the raw materials pressure in the quarter were your dollar forwards. Can you expand a little bit on that just to let us know I mean do you continue to have protection on a dollar for the full year 2009 or will these run out and then perhaps force some additional pricing increases in order to maintain your current levels of profitability. And I guess I'm trying to understand, the reason why I'm asking for a little bit of an update in January and February, is that I really want to get a sense for how volumes are reacting to these price increases. Because as you've said the employment environment, whether it's manufacturing or construction, other areas of the economy, they have continued to erode. I'm just looking for some &#x2013; give us the latest view in terms of a volume metric if you can provide one there to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Rob. Yes, for 2009, we will still have some relief, and I would say an important one in terms of the exchange rate, the decisions we took, basically for most of the deficit we have in terms of foreign exchange for the cost structure of the beer business. And that, but also the same time we wouldn't have almost any benefit of the decline in commodity prices for 2009. Some of those benefits will start to roll out in 2010 and almost full in 2011 definitely, but for 2009 we will still have some of the protection on the FX, but some of the not been able to obtain the benefits of the decline on the commodity. And in terms of the volumes, what I can maybe share on the start of the year is again, it's a little bit, I would say, early to tell, because as you've said the deterioration has been very fast and very steep in the last three months maybe. So volume performance for the fourth quarter, which was sensational I should say in due to the fact, I mean weakness of economy and the price increase that took place in August and September.</p>
          <p>I would say that still January was the month in which we had good weather. So it's hard for me to tell of how much of the good performance we still have in January which was good just to leave it there was due to the weather and how much is it having weakness on consumer demand because of that effect. So, again we will need to be clear on this regarding a couple of months when we have our April conference call, have at least to show to be more clear on these regards a couple of months when we have our April conference call have at least 3.5 months of the 2009 already there. So still little bit too early to tell but not that bad at the start of the year as the macroeconomic numbers and the feeling about the weakness on consumer demand could make a lot of people imagine.</p>

          <p>Good morning. As you spoke about going back on our investment spend for this year I was curious how this is going to impact your convenience store a lot this year I assume maybe we're not going to be as aggressive as we've seen in the past and also if you could just talk a bit more too about trends within the convenience stores with respect to store traffic and consumer spend, any update on that for this year would be helpful? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Lauren. Our range for 2009 in terms of operating on stores remain very high, I'd say close maybe to the numbers that we were able to achieve on 2008, maybe it will be clear than that, but we're not changing our gaining position for the year in terms of hopping of stores so basically the amount of resources that we are or the capital we are locating to the growth strategy also is not at the beginning of the year changing that much, maybe a fine tune here and there, but not the directionally anything there.</p>
          <p>Most of the projects we are now re-looking are either capacity-driven or efficiency-driven, and just being more demanding on the return from the projects that we are putting in place. So we are deferring some of those which even though are profitable are not as profitable as to engaging them in these times in which we are maximizing the effort to produce as much cash flow as we can and the leverage, I wouldn't say as much we can, but just to maintain a healthy balance sheet profile for the business. So the offshore capital location is not really being driven these days by that fact. Having said that we will be very cautious, and we are monitoring that very, very closely on a month-by-month basis. And what I'm speaking about having a year kind of numbers shooting the target for the CapEx for the year. The truth of the matter is that we were reviewing that on a quarterly basis.</p>
          <p>So we're approving projects basically on a quarterly basis just looking at the overall conditions of the economy, the performance of the businesses in the different geographies and the projects. So all-in-all that's kind of our gaining position for 2009 in terms of CapEx. And again for the beginning of the year, what we can share as I just said on the volume side for the beer business, same history I think repeats for the offshore figures for the start of the year. Still January is not showing something, which is radically different from what the trends were in the past months, but still we are still thinking that again weather could be a good lift up for the month. So we will need to wait for &#x2013; I would say between February and April to have a better read on what's being going on with Mexican consumers to really get a good sense of where this is going into the summer.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I wondered if you could characterize for us the spending initiatives that you have, and how those might differ from past sort of really ongoing vigilance on the cost side. Are there any targets, and if I missed that, I apologize, are there any targets specific to that you have in terms of percent of revenues or absolute less amount and I am talking specifically about the beer business here, maybe you can just give us anecdotally as to how this might be different from past efforts, if there was any relationship with compensation or performance metrics internally? If you give us color on that, please, that will be great.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure Celso. I should start by saying that the program for rationalization of spending and cost in the brewery for 2009 is I would say the biggest one we have had in the last &#x2013; I would say at least six to seven years. This is not only a part of &#x2013; I would say management reaction to the crisis, but also, a part to an ongoing process of building capabilities that would allow us to achieve that and our views maybe two or three examples just to give you an idea of what I'm speaking about, but also to complement the idea the program pretty much involves all areas of the company from the way we go to market, from the way we are organized within the company in terms of layers, areas of supervision, number of executives, all the way also to still initiatives in the value chain in which we are now looking at that the whole value chain all the way from the procurement of the breweries all the way to distribution at customers basically under the supervision of one organization, which has been a long journey, which started four years ago, but as we speak we're moving to one organization, which now takes care of the whole supply chain, which now having in place a system, some protocols that allows us visibility all along the supply chain where I mean that a lot of savings both in working capital and in operating expenses managing the supply chain of the brewing business for example, but.</p>
          <p>And in terms of marketing and I also described that we think that the buildup of incremental spending and we've talked a lot about this in the past &#x2013; in Brazil, U.S. and in Mexico we have to find that the different stages of the betterment of your brands called for a step up in incremental spending very, very clear reasons in the different markets, I mean we're looking at the results and I hope you are in agreement with us. We are looking at the results of growing double-digit in the U.S on an average for the last three years. And I think that has a lot to do with the way we have been working with Heineken USA for also because of the amount of resources in marketing dollar we're pouring into the Baghdad market, as well as in the Brazilian market in which we have been growing steadily across all geographies above the industry and also increasing brands here.</p>
          <p>So in 2009, we feel comfortable that we have some room to maneuver in terms of reducing marketing dollars in Mexico and Brazil, not necessarily in the U.S as I just said, and putting in place cost initiatives in all across the value chain. A couple of examples, more specific would be route to market, we are now in what we call alternate ways of making calls to the retail network, we are aiming to be close to 50% of our way of doing calls on the retail base, based on telesales instead of visits to the store. So that helps a lot in driving calls down, and at the same time allows people which are visiting stores to focus on developing the accounts. We are also simplifying the structure on how we take care of the retail base segmenting on premise and off premise specializing sales force and decreasing the frequency of basics both increasing the effectiveness of the basic because of now having basically 90% of the time being used to precisely depend on the accounts instead of just requesting how many cases of beer there will be and needing the next day.</p>
          <p>And in terms of simplification of the organization we have also made some decisions. Once we have been more comfortable of the practices and capabilities we have been developing, we feel comfortable at consolidating some regional areas or some local areas under the head of just one people instead of two. And so that is also creating some savings both in terms of head count at executive levels and also staff people because now having less centers in which decisions are being made. So all in all, I would say again what I said at the beginning, this is the more comprehensive and ambitious cost cutting and rationalization program and it's coming, as I said, a bulk of it as part of the ongoing efforts of the company to save where we need to save money and we have opportunities to reinvest in what we think is a good idea to invest behind the brand basically.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you. That's a very helpful description. And just to finish up, is there a way to quantify what one might expect to see after that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is definitely internal, not only broad numbers but specific. What I just say instead of mentioning the numbers of the actual savings we're aiming at because it is a delicate model, I think, I can tell you that 97 initiatives are supporting this effort of cost rationalization all across the organization and the effort is being done, I would say in the modern or in the most professional way but also pretty much pays off with as you said incentives which are basically established for people.</p>
          <p>We think that again we need to keep compensating people a lot on the value that they create pretty much in line with the overall performance of the company. But under these scenarios, we have been shifting a little bit the proportion of incentives, which are driven by internal actions of the people as opposed to the overall performance of the company because again due to the uncertainty of the environment which can basically produce not very good numbers for the company. But we would like to reward internal effort and internal delivery of these types of efforts, but still pretty much tied with continuing to improve the brand health of our brands. So it's not like, beseeching beers here and now cost economy is important here or there what's important and we're forgetting about brand sales but yes, we're diminishing the proportion of incentives which are pretty much based on the overall performance of the business or the business units in which people are responsible for and we are putting part of their incentive program towards the achievement of the objectives of the rationalization program we have put in place.</p>

          <p>Hi, Javier, hi, everybody. Clarification in the question, you said clarification regarding CapEx, you mentioned that it's going to go down 30% in U.S. dollar, does that mean that it's going to go up in pesos, Javier?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, no but we still are thinking that the relation is going to be somewhere between the mid 20s, for the full year once you take the average. And so in peso &#x2013; in peso terms it should come down and in real peso terms it should come down roughly 10%, I think. We are ranking basically for $900 million equivalent, maybe. But as I said this is a directional number that we will be looking at on a quarterly basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And the question I have is regarding beer and soft drinks, I mean could you tell us a bit about what's the progress and what we should expect, I mean not only in the short-term but in the long-term, in terms of the increased coordination and collaboration between the beer and soft drinks business you are describing here please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, I think that maybe this is a little bit more of the same in terms of the basic concepts, Alan, but I should say this is that &#x2013; if people or the questioned regards possible integration of actual operating on a combined mode either through pre-selling or distribution or warehousing activities. We are not in that pace at all in new markets. As we have stated we are pleased with what we are achieving and learning in the resilient market, which that is basically the more than which we are operating today.</p>
          <p>And we have again opportunities to do that as we have agreed with the Coca-Cola Company in some other markets in which we have not really found the best way to precisely put in place a dual model. But at the same time the two businesses continued to collaborate very, very heavily. We have been working for the last couple of years. I would say more closely then ever in precisely bringing different groups of people to share best practices, I would say a lot on the value chain management but also a lot in sharing marketing intelligence and sharing also segmentation models and protocols to execute those segmentation models in different customers.</p>
          <p>And I think that there has been learning for both businesses and as we speak both businesses are engaged in, I would say not even small pile of debts, but now I would say rollouts of concepts in which the segmentation models of both companies have been refined and brought with new variables into it. That would allow us precisely in times of these to select more &#x2013; in a more efficient way how we allocate resources, not only I am speaking about capital, but also time and how we place our best in terms of product development within the different channels. So integration is not what we are trying to achieve in the short term, but collaboration, coordination is basically the words that we are using more in the company these days, Alan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. Hi there, everyone. My question is just about the, just about the hedge comments that you made in the beginning where you said that most of the time the derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and without getting into a very technical discussion here, was the reason they did not qualify in the fourth quarter, the great volatility in the underlying instruments or I guess my question is did they qualify in the first three quarters of the year and in the fourth quarter there was a different criteria that led to a different application of their accounting principles? And if so how would your P&amp;L, your operating P&amp;L in beer, how different would it have looked had the treatment been the same as in the earlier part of the year. So I'm just trying to see what &#x2013; if you had been able to acquire to the cost of goods sold line would there have been a significant change in the operating numbers that we see in the release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I have a pen. No. The criteria for how these accounts I mean having changed and is not really related to the volatility in the fourth quarter. As I said the most, I would say, simple explanation I can offer is the one that I was just describing which again close to 900 million out of the 1.3 billion on that line is pretty much due to foreign exchange, but the main reason it's in that line is because the accounting criteria tells you that for example in the Coca-Cola FEMSA which was the case, which is the only business which had basically an important liability position exposed to dollars. If Coca-Cola FEMSA, which is the case, contracted peso denominated liabilities, and then swap that into dollars the exchange loss of that cannot be accounted as foreign exchange loss because of an accounting criteria. So that's where it should be allocated. So the bulk of that line again I will encourage everyone to look at it as basically foreign exchange loss.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But even if from one non-operating to another and as I would not have apply to the operating line at all?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. It's, I mean, it's within the internal resource of financing, but it's in a different line, but the way to look at it is basically foreign exchange loss on the loss dollar denominated liability position of Coca-Cola FEMSA which is basically close to 100% of what the effect of foreign exchange loss on FEMSA's financial consolidated statement is all about, the other component, the most important concept in it, it's precisely the unwinding of a hedge we had on weak while the negotiations with the barley growers in Mexico were taking place. As we have said in the past the formulae now for establishing the pricing and value in Mexico is pretty much linked to wheat. So when we started negotiations but that was in December we hedged the position into wheat so the timing of the wheat hedge didn't match perfectly with the timing of the final negotiations on the price of barley in Mexico so again because of an accounting criteria, we needed to reflect that on the quarter once the hedge on winding was made. So but again that is a modest component of the lump in 3 billion pesos derivative instrument loss line.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks very much and good morning. I wanted to just go back to the theme just quickly on CapEx, I think on the last conference call you were talking then about cutting CapEx in '08 if I remember correctly, you talked about $950 million and you came in at 14.2 billion for last year, which I think if I look the average rate is closer to 1.3 billion, which I think was the original budget so I guess I am just wondering why there wasn't more cut in the CapEx last year versus the intention and related to that if I look in the fourth quarter beer numbers, I am seeing a 20% rise in both the depreciation and the amortization in the fourth quarter at much higher levels than what we saw sort of on a year-to-date basis. So if you could talk about those trends, which I think are related, that would be helpful.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Lore, hi this is Juan. Let me first talk about the CapEx. There was &#x2013; and through 2008 there were significant capacity increases at the different businesses. In the beer business we added capacity here in Monterrey and in Oeresaba and Coke-FEMSA the capacity in number of places. We have discussed obviously the new plant which is in the very early stages of development and now as we enter 2009 we are in a position once you adjust for the volume trends probably not being as aggressive or as optimistic as they were six months ago or a year ago. Obviously we figured that we don't need as much capacity as soon going forward so we can differ some of this investment to 2010 and beyond. So we really are in a position to step on the brakes on a number of the projects because the volumes &#x2013; we are not going to demand that additional capacity or they are non critical projects which allow us to bring the forecast for '09 down to US900 which as Javier was mentioning it's a lower dollar number than what we had even in 2007. Right?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, okay. And the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter in the D&amp;A?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I will say that the number was there but basically the most important ones is capacity projects that were put in place which are now starting to be depreciated. The impact also of the foreign exchange in terms of how we affect depreciation, and also in the terms of amortization, I would say, the effect also of couple of price increases during the year also now makes the amortization of the some of the tight house agreements are significantly higher in nominal terms, which is the way these numbers are presented. But most of the impact is coming from the depreciation and most of it is coming from Coca-Cola FEMSA, Lore.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Actually, I'm looking specifically at the beer numbers. And it looks like it was 20% in both the depreciation and the amortization on Cerveza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On depreciation again, its &#x2013; as I said no capacity coming in line and the depreciation. And on the amortization, the bulk of it is as I said a little bit of mix in terms of the volumes on the quarter, volumes which are done more on exclusive basis than non-exclusive basis and the effect of the price of the two price increases, which ones you put in nominal terms to get you to those numbers.</p>

          <p>Thanks. Hi, everybody. My question is on Brazil. We're getting to 16, 17% of your beer sales now coming from that country in 2008. And I wanted to get a sense, I mean, first just a clarification were you &#x2013; did you follow some of these beer price movements in November and December, you might have mentioned that, but I wanted to clarify that. And as you look in terms of the quarter and in terms of 2009, I mean the profitability levels, I mean, do you &#x2013; are we going to be in a situation where we could see increasing or better profitability in 2009 compared to 2008. Is it really a focus still of volume, it looks like you did get market share during the year in beer in Brazil. And because this is obviously an operation that I think as you described it for, one, where you wanted to get a footprint, you build the track record now, and I guess you didn't really talk too much about selling expenses in Brazil in the fourth quarter. So is it &#x2013; if you could give us a sense of is EBITDA positive possible in 2009, is closing the profitability gap a priority or is it kind of still building out that volume footprint?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Alex. First on the pricing front, as I said, yes, we moved prices and as I said even closing gaps basically on other channels almost against any other brand, both for our Soul and Kaiser brands. So yes, we did increase price. We again ahead of the industry in the fourth quarter and that said, so I would say good tone into 2009. On the more overall question of our performance in Brazil, we still think that in '09 to be very simple on my answer that we can break even positive on EBITDA, not on EBIT, but yes on EBITDA, such as we did into 2008. Not that being the main mantra that the organization is pursuing. But I would say that the most important developments in Brazil had to do with what you just said in terms of establishing a good sound volume base, which can still keep on growing on a consistent basis going forward with a more reasonable level of spending behind the brands.</p>
          <p>I would say that's the biggest achievement, I think, we can talk about in the three year we have been managing this business and that creates again possibility for the profitability of this business to keep expanding once, we keep on growing volumes. But 2009 is going to be a challenging year to really produce an incremental profitability for the business due to the fact of again commodity prices also not being able to have the full benefit of the commodity prices decline because of agreements to buy both aluminum cans and barley being made, when the prices were not that &#x2013; I mean when the prices were high, and at the same time because of the valuation and in the case of Brazil as opposed to the case of Mexico, we are not going to have a release in terms of foreign exchange, as we do in Mexico for the beer business.</p>
          <p>So all in all, I would say that for the development of the business we feel very good about the brand health that is allowing us to close some price cuts, to start to close price cuts not to eliminate them, but to reduce them. And at the same time now having the ability to not invest on an incremental way of marketing dollars behind the brands because the brands have got to a level in which they can sustain reasonable growth on their own. But we're going to suffer those effects on the cost side, which wouldn't allow steel business to be on a profitable way on our EBIT lines, but definitely on the black numbers on the EBITDA line.</p>

          <p>Okay. And the new territory that Coke FEMSA had acquired in Belo Horizonte, have you seen some low-hanging fruit there just as far as that beer business and your share brand health indicators, I mean are there some opportunities this year or has it kind of really &#x2013; did you really kind of take it over last year and it's really kind of just doing more of the same into '09 in that new territory?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Definitely there are opportunities out there. The improvement in '09 during the second half of the year, when we took remain as significant. I would say, more in terms of volumes than in brand health just because of, I would tell you a bit more focus into the category and a little bit better execution, brand health should come along as we keep on increasing distribution and by making people try our products. But in 2009 we are still expecting a stellar performance of that region. So we still have number of opportunities to come, Alex.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Just a quick question. I'm curious as to know what potential steps you can take to protect your sales volume in Mexico and U.S. for Cerveza.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. To grow volumes, you mean Sohail.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, yeah. Just to protect them, because I mean in the U.S. I imagine that your volumes are going to take a significant hit, perhaps not so much in your Latin American factories. But I am just curious of what are the specific steps that you have planned or that you believe you can take to reduce the impact of the slowdown that you are looking to be?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. I would start by saying that packaging makes management easy. The starting point in terms of executing the price increases that we would like to implement during the year as we have done in the August, September timing to execute price increases in a fashion that pretty much takes care of what we consider the more price sensitive volumes on our mix. Which is very different not only by packaging brand, but also by region. So understanding elasticity on our policies is a key component of how we decide how to implement in a segmented way price increases.</p>
          <p>A second one in variable is to make a shift on the promotional marketing activity, driven on the channel activity to the returnable part of the portfolio, which is the one that pretty much starts growing or behaving differently in times such as this. So that's the second component. A third one would be the structure of the promotional activity I would say in healthier economic times is very different from the one that we are looking at into 2009. I would say in times in which there is more disposable income, there is more confidence of consumer more spending, discretionary spending. The nature of the promotions can be a little bit more of driven by emotions or people &#x2013; an example we made a promotion on the third quarter of people winning a trip to Las Vegas, for example.</p>
          <p>That's not the kind of promotion we are going to put in place in 2009. We are going to put in place promotions that, if you buy a case of beer or whatsoever you can get for free some, I would say more basic products at the time of purchase, instead of being part of the conquest or something like that. So I would say that a lot of things have to do with &#x2013; again the value proposition for the different portfolio brands and packaging that we have in the different channels. So that's basically the main trust that we have going into 2009. And this is not only applicable to beer. This is also applicable to coke. And it is also applicable to Oxxo, I mean. We are not I would say as optimistic as talking about margin expansion in Oxxo into 2009, because we are sure that we are going to have to implement some either promotional activity or price management in some categories that really give consumers more bang for their bucks. So that's kind of what we are trying to do here.</p>

          <p>Our next question will come from Katie Blacklock with Nevsky Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello. I just wanted to check, when I look at the currency mix of your debt and the 9.7 billion of dollars, does that include all of the debt that has been contracted in Mexican pesos, but then swapped into dollars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have both cases, Katie we have a case I think which we contract the debt in dollars and swapped it to pesos and the other way around. I would say that the bandwidth and that's had a lot to do with again efficiency in the cost of financing in certain times. There are windows of opportunity in which it's better, there's only one way or the other. So that has a lot to do with how the different financial markets operate both the Mexican and the U.S. markets in terms of financing. But I would say that the main &#x2013; the basic ways to look at this is, if you look at the mix again of the local currency against foreign, we have close to 80% of our debt denominated basically in local currency, mainly pesos with exception of some debt in Columbia, Argentina and those places in which we are able to get very, very soft interest rates as opposed to local inflation.</p>
          <p>So the cost of financing is pretty much negative to be honest. And that even has been moving more to the less exposed position into the dollar denominated kind of debt in the first couple of months. And as we said that has been achieved not so much by converting dollar denominated debt into pesos, but by buying dollars in the market to be able to have on the cash balances, enough dollars to pay maturities, which are dollar denominated basically in Coca-Cola FEMSA. So all in all they are close to 80% exposure to dollar denominated debt has been coming down in the past couple of months.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So when you say the 80% of your debt is a mix of pesos, is that as of now or as of 31st of December because on the press release when you show the table with your debt mix, it shows 70% of your debt in pesos. I just want to be clear whether that 70% because the additional 10% is actually swapped into dollars or whether it's actually when you are talking about 80%, you are just talking about the movement that you have done in the first two months of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>When I was talking about the 77% in local currency, both in Mexican pesos and Colombian and Argentinian and Venezuelan and Brazilian reais, so the 77% which is consigned in the press release. And that 77% in local currency has been even incremented in this couple of months because not a reduction in the dollar denominated debt, but because of accumulating cash in dollar, so the net exposure has been declining instead of now having 22, we maybe now below 20% for February the 25 or 26.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So if you are talking about 11.6 billion of debt coming due this year and then refinancing 9.3 billion of that. Can you give me an idea of the change in turns and currency mix that we should expect as you refinance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I would say that once we finance and we pay maturities because &#x2013; I mean once we pay down the debt that we're going to pay with the cash flows and the cash balances. And we renew I think that we will be approaching &#x2013; I would say third quarter of the year to an exposition to dollar denominated debt which would be below 15%.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And just for reference Katie, Coke FEMSA did a placement of bonds in the Mexican market, but a month ago the rates of that we got on that was the TA on the rate, the reference rate plus 80 bips whereas a year ago or couple of years ago we were issuing TA minus three or four bps. So there has been an increase of the spread, there has been an increase of maybe 80, 85 basis points, and of course the reference rate has shifted, but that's pretty much where we are today.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hello, just couple of questions. First of all in Brazil I just wanted to understand the situation really after the 3.5% decline that you had in the fourth quarter, you were saying that the result after that so the beginning of this year were better, is that &#x2013; do you have a sense that you're gaining market share in Brazil or is it market really recovering, because my understanding was that at the beginning of the year was also quite soft for the Brazilian market overall and the second question was regarding the restructuring program they have in place, so you say one of the biggest you had for about six-seven years, does it only relate to FEMSA Cerveza, or are there very similar initiatives across the business. I understand there are other factors driving the margin this year for Oxxo and for costs, but would you say that there is an equal ambitious program of cost reduction throughout and I not just from FEMSA Cerveza?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, definitely I was referring to Cerveza because being the biggest one, but there are definitely efficiency programs all over the place, the most important one being FEMSA Cerveza because if you look at the way the other businesses are basically operating, these are not businesses which have suffered such a dramatic change both in terms of the portfolio brand strategy and the incremental dollars needed to improve brand health and also due to the fact that the practices, operating practices in FEMSA Cerveza that has been brought into the market place, has been just the most recent one as opposed to Oxxo and Coca-Cola FEMSA.</p>
          <p>In those two businesses the efficiency programs are more, I would say directed to recognize that the environment is going to present some challenges in terms of the ability to grow volumes, but not in terms of structure of things that we are doing as part of the transformation effort which is big. In terms of Oxxo, to tell you the truth, we are not canceling any project which is directed to the creation of infrastructure and even higher execution capabilities such as variety, replenishment and management spacing in a much better way segment in the markets and in the stores. So we have programs all over the company but the most important ones again due to the nature of the business being in beer.</p>
          <p>In terms of Brazil, I would say that &#x2013; when I was referring to a better start of the year we are &#x2013; when I'm make that judgment, I also take into account that numbers for on a calendar basis for January you will need to look at them in a careful manner because as opposed to last year Carnival and now end at being basically at the end of February, which in last year it was earlier so volume in January and February are having different performances against last year, but again we feel confident that what happened in fourth quarter of 2008 had a lot to do again with both poor weather and our pricing decisions going into the marketplace and reducing some price gaps and the first quarter of 2009 was a little comparable to what we were able will be able to still keep growing ahead of the industry.</p>
