          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Gilead Sciences Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Katina, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today, January 26, 2010.</p>
          <p>I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Hubbard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Katina. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Gilead's fourth quarter and full year 2009 earnings conference call. We're very pleased you could join us today. We issued a press release this afternoon providing results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2009. This press release is available on our website at www.Gilead.com. We have also posted slides that outline the topics discussed on this call.</p>
          <p>Joining me today are John Martin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; John Milligan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Young, Executive Vice President of Commercial Operations; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and Robin Washington, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll be prepared to keep comments brief to allow more time for Q&amp;A.</p>
          <p>I would first like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements relating to future events, expectations, trends, objectives and financial results that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on certain assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that would cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. I refer you to our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008; Form 10-Qs for the first, second and third quarters of 2009; subsequent press releases and other publicly filed SEC disclosure documents for a detailed description of risk factors and other matters related to our business. In addition, please note that we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>We will be making certain references to financial measures that are on a non-GAAP basis. We provided a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in the press release we just issued this afternoon, and on our corporate website at www.Gilead.com.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Martin.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With the completion of the fourth quarter, Gilead has closed out another year of exceptional commercial execution and financial growth. Total revenues for the fourth quarter crossed the $2 billion mark for the first time in our history, and we completed the year having generated over $7 billion in total revenue. This growth was chiefly driven by the continued momentum of our antiviral franchise, with record revenues of $1.6 billion and $5.8 billion for the quarter and year respectively. Importantly, we generated operating cash flow of $955 million for the quarter and $3 billion for the year.</p>
          <p>I am also very pleased with the momentum of our pipeline programs during the past quarter. Norbert will speak about these programs in greater depth but I wanted to highlight a couple of things.</p>
          <p>As you know, Cayston, our product for the treatment of infections due to Pseudomonas aerunginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis was reviewed by the FDA's Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee back in December. The panel recommended 15-to-2 that the safety and efficacy data generated from the two pivotal trials support approval of the drug, and unanimously voted that we have determined a right dose, 75 milligrams given three times daily, for this indication. We await the PDUFA date of February 13 and are hopeful that the FDA will follow the recommendation of the Advisory Committee.</p>
          <p>Cayston was approved last year in the European Union and Canada. And we have and will continue to make this product available to patients in the United States through our expanded access program while we work toward approval and commercialization.</p>
          <p>In preparation for 2010, we completed a thorough review of our pipeline portfolio, which now includes the cardiovascular metabolic programs brought to us through the acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April of 2009. We are very enthusiastic about the early stage work that is being done by our R&amp;D team, and now feel that we have both the commercial presence and R&amp;D capabilities that will establish us as an important company in the specialty cardiovascular space.</p>
          <p>While we were disappointed that the second Phase III study of darusentan did not meet its primary endpoint, we quickly and decisively came to the conclusion that this program should be discontinued, allowing us to redeploy our efforts and the funds that were earmarked to support this program to other more promising albeit earlier programs underway. I am confident that we have in place the people and capabilities necessary to continue to grow across each of our therapeutic categories.</p>
          <p>As you may know, significant progress was made over the course of 2009 to increase HIV screening initiatives in the United States. First in August 2009, the Veterans Administration adopted routine HIV screening. The VA is the single biggest provider of HIV care in the U.S. In December, CMS announced that Medicare will now cover annual voluntary screening of those at risk for HIV infection, as well as women who are pregnant. And California law now requires that private insurers must cover routine HIV testing, the first state in the nation to do so.</p>
          <p>Since 2006, when the CDC issued the recommendation that all individuals between the ages of 13 and 64 should be screened for HIV as part of their routine healthcare, 16 states modified their laws in furtherance of the recommendations. Only six states still require specific written informed consent for HIV testing, and we expect further progress on this front over the course of 2010.</p>
          <p>In addition, the extension of the Ryan White Treatment Act, adopted at the end of October, will provide $2.3 billion in funding in fiscal 2010, with annual increases through fiscal 2013, and will help to ensure that patients in the U.S. who are diagnosed, brought into care and prescribed therapy do not face any financial barriers in obtaining access to treatment.</p>
          <p>The Treatment Act also establishes, for the first time, a national goal for administering five million HIV tests each year. On December 1, World AIDS Day, the U.S. Department of Health And Human Services released the revised treatment guidelines that now recommend all patients whose CD4 cell count fall below 500 copies/mL should start antiretroviral therapy.</p>
          <p>As Gilead's products, mainly Atripla and Truvada, are the cornerstones of first line therapy capturing more than 85% of new starts, we see this as an important opportunity along with the drive to screen more individuals to continue to grow the number of patients on a Gilead based regimen. In fact, treatment guidelines in all our major markets favorably position Gilead's products and are moving towards starting patients on treatment earlier in their disease.</p>
          <p>And finally, we continue to make progress in our efforts to remove barriers to access to all patients around the world who could benefit from our therapies.</p>
          <p>We announced in November an agreement with GSK to commercialize Viread for the treatment of HBV in adults in five countries in Asia. This is a part of the world where HBV has taken the greatest toll with a prevalence greater than 8% in most countries. Under the agreement, Gilead will retain exclusive rights for commercialization of Viread for HBV in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. And in China, Glaxo will have the exclusive commercialization rights and registration responsibilities for Viread for hepatitis B virus. Each company will pay royalties to the other on sales of the product in their respective Asian territories.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Robin to review our financial results.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>As John mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2009 was another very successful quarter and completes another record year for Gilead. Total revenues, which include product sales and royalty, contract and other revenues were two billion, a 42% increase year-over-year. For the full year, total revenues were seven billion, up 31% over 2008, driven primarily by the continued strong growth in our antiviral franchise.</p>
          <p>Our net income for the fourth quarter was 802 million, or $0.87 per share. For the full year, our net income was 2.6 billion, or $2.82 per share. Our non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was 864 million, or $0.93 per share, representing a year-over-year increase in net income and EPS of 46% and 49% respectively.</p>
          <p>For the full year, our non-GAAP EPS was $3.06 per share, a 40% increase over our 2008 non-GAAP EPS of $2.19 per share. As a reminder, our non-GAAP net income and net income per share exclude the impact of acquisition related expenses, restructuring expenses and stock based compensation expenses, net of tax.</p>
          <p>Product sales for the quarter were 1.8 billion. Antiviral product sales grew to 1.6 billion, up 27% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Atripla contributed 698 million to our antiviral product sales, representing the first quarter that Atripla sales were higher than Truvada sales. Atripla sales increased 50% year-over-year and 15% sequentially resulting from the continued uptake of the products in the U.S. and Europe. The efavirenz portion of Atripla, which is purchased from BMS at its estimated market price and reflected in cost of goods sold, was approximately 264 million.</p>
          <p>Truvada sales contributed 671 million to our antiviral product sales, up 19% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, due primarily to sales volume growth in both the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p>Viread sales were 178 million, representing an increase of 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, driven primarily by sales volume growth of Viread and the treatment of patients with HBV infection in the U.S. and Europe.</p>
          <p> Rapira sales were 52 million, an increase of 44% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, driven primarily by sales volume growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>Ranexa sales were 46 million, representing a decrease of 6% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Finally, sales of other products were 159 million, representing a decrease of 2% year-over-year and an increase of 2% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Foreign currency exchange had a net favorable impact of 14 million on revenues when compared to the same period last year. On a sequential basis, foreign currency exchange had a favorable impact of five million.</p>
          <p>Our royalty, contract and other revenues for the fourth quarter were 228 million, an increase of 188 million year-over-year, and an increase of 76 million sequentially. Both the year-over-year and sequential increases were primarily driven by increased Tamiflu sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide.</p>
          <p>Royalties received from Roche for Tamiflu sales, and recognized in our revenues in the fourth quarter, were 194 million. These royalties, which are paid one quarter in arrears, reflect a royalty rate of approximately 16% as applied to Roche's net sales of Tamiflu during the third quarter of 2009. Roche is scheduled to report their full year 2009 earnings on February 3.</p>
          <p>The following discussion of all margin and expense related items are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude the impact of acquisition, restructuring and stock based compensation related expenses as applicable.</p>
          <p>Product gross margin was 75% for the fourth quarter, compared to 77.4% for the same quarter of last year and 76.5% for the third quarter of 2009. The year-over-year and sequential decreases were due primarily to the higher proportion of Atripla sales, which include the efavirenz component at zero gross margin.</p>
          <p>Operating margin was 56.4% for the fourth quarter, compared to 52.5% for the same quarter last year and 53.9% for third quarter 2009. Our year-over-year and sequential operating margins were favorably impacted by the increase in Tamiflu royalties, as I discussed earlier. We continue to see improvements relative to 2008 in our core operating margin, which excludes Tamiflu and efavirenz.</p>
          <p>R&amp;D expenses were 211 million for the quarter, an increase of 14% on a year-over-year basis and a decrease of 13% sequentially. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to additional hiring and increased clinical study activities to support the growth of our business. The sequential decrease was primarily due to the effect of the Tibotec R&amp;D expense reimbursement during the third quarter.</p>
          <p>SG&amp;A expenses were 223 million for the quarter, an increase of 28% on a year-over-year basis and an increase of 12% sequentially. The year-over-year and sequential increases were due primarily to higher head count and expenses associated with expanded sales, promotional and infrastructure expenses in our cardiovascular franchise. In addition, the sequential increase was also due to promotional spend seasonality in our international operations.</p>
          <p>Other income and expenses reflect a net expense of six million for the fourth quarter, compared to a net income of three million for the same quarter last year, due primarily to lower year-over-year investment yields. Sequentially, other income and expenses were three million unfavorable, due primarily to unfavorable foreign exchange translation gains and losses and increased cost of hedging.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate for the full year of 2009 was 25%, which was lower than our 2008 effective tax rate of 26.3%. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2009 was 24.6%. The year-over-year and sequential decreases were driven primarily by increased earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, as well as the fourth quarter 2009 resolution of certain tax audits with tax authorities, partially offset by the revaluation of certain state tax assets related to the integration of CV Therapeutics.</p>
          <p>Next, I wanted to update you on our restructuring activities. As we discussed during our third quarter call, we completed a restructuring plan to realign the cardiovascular operations of Gilead and CV Therapeutics. We incurred approximately 52 million in pre-tax restructuring expenses in 2009, with 19 million incurred during the fourth quarter. We expect to incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately 20 million through 2010.</p>
          <p>We generated 955 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and paid off the remaining 200 million of the credit facility that we accessed in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>We also repurchased 5.3 million shares of our common stock at a cost of 242 million, fully utilizing the remaining funds under the three billion share repurchase program authorized by our Board in October 2007. In aggregate, we purchased 63 million shares under this program.</p>
          <p>We enter 2010 with a strong balance sheet position. Our cash and marketable securities portfolio of 3.9 billion allows us the continued flexibility to pursue opportunities to expand our business and return value to shareholders.</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn to our financial guidance for the full year 2010. You can locate all of our guidance for 2010 on Gilead's corporate website.</p>
          <p>Our product sales guidance for the full year 2010 is a range of 7.6 to 7.7 billion, which reflects a 17 to 19% increase over 2009 product sales.</p>
          <p>Factors that may have an impact on our business include, but are not limited to, U.S. healthcare reform, international government pricing pressures, and the potential for continued volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. Please note that the non-GAAP product gross margin and operating expense guidance provided to you excludes the impact of acquisition, restructuring and stock based compensation related expenses where applicable.</p>
          <p>Our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance for the full year 2010 is a range of 75 to 77%. For expenses, we expect non-GAAP R&amp;D expense for the full year 2010 to be in the range of 850 to 870 million. We expect non-GAAP SG&amp;A expenses for the full year 2010 to be in the range of 900 to 920 million.</p>
          <p>As always, Gilead remains committed to conscientious expense management to sustain the continued profitable growth of our company.</p>
          <p>Our effective tax rate guidance for the full year 2010 is expected to be in the range of 25 to 26%, assuming the federal research tax credit is extended.</p>
          <p>And finally, we are anticipating the full year 2010 diluted EPS impact of acquisition, restructuring and stock based compensation related expenses to be at a range of 27 to $0.30 per share. Additional details can be found on our corporate website.</p>
          <p>At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin who will discuss our commercial highlights for the quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Robin. I'm very pleased to discuss with you our outstanding commercial performance for the fourth quarter. I'm particularly proud to highlight the U.S. sales and marketing organization reaching approximately $1 billion in sales during the quarter.</p>
          <p>For the fourth quarter, total U.S. antiviral product sales were a healthy 889 million. This result was led by our HIV products, with Atripla contributing 466 million, up 32% year-over-year; and Truvada with 318 million, up 25% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>I'm pleased to report that in the fourth quarter, for both Atripla and Truvada, prescription growth remained extremely robust. This is reflective of our market share position and the flow of new patients coming on to HIV therapy. It is also important to point out that these trends do not represent the impact of new DHHS guidelines that occurred in December.</p>
          <p>Non-retail sales, large components of which are direct purchases by state AIDS drug assistance programs, were in line with prescription trends, albeit at a higher pace. We currently have no waiting lists in the large HIV states, and the 2009 extension to the Ryan White Treatment Act provides federal dollars to help fund ADAP for the next four years.</p>
          <p>Absolute inventory levels for the fourth quarter stayed relatively flat compared to the third quarter across our three major U.S. wholesalers, which account for over 80% of our U.S. product sales. During the fourth quarter, we signed revised inventory management agreements with these three U.S. wholesalers.</p>
          <p>The new IMAs establish a band of days-on-hand and removes the buy-in option around price increases. While this provides a certain level of inventory consistency at the wholesaler level, we cannot account for any downstream purchase variability that may occur, particularly in the non-retail segment of the market.</p>
          <p>As a reminder, patient data for the U.S. lags our financial results by one quarter. In the third quarter of 2009, the numbers of patients treated with antiretroviral therapy grew by 4%, on a moving annual total basis, to approximately 578,000 patients.</p>
          <p>Atripla, the most prescribed regimen in HIV, had 189,000 patients on therapy, or one-third of all treated patients, and captured approximately 53% of treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients. Importantly, safety and efficacy data from Study 073 were recently added to the Atripla label, which will allow us to actively promote the switching of patients to Atripla. This remains an important contributor to future growth, as there are over 100,000 patients in the U.S. still on either Combivir or Epzicom at the end of the third quarter 2009.</p>
          <p>Truvada continue to add patients with 212,000 on therapy, or 37% of all treated patients, clearly maintaining its position as the backbone of choice for antiretroviral therapy in the U.S. Total Truvada, or Atripla together with Truvada, continued to account for approximately 85% of patients new to therapy, and were the components of all of the top-six prescribed regimens in HIV.</p>
          <p>It is also encouraging to see the growth of the newer third agents in the na&#xEF;ve setting is coming in tandem with Truvada. Approximately 81% of raltegravir patients and 91% of darunavir patients were co-prescribed with Truvada.</p>
          <p>Our HIV products in Europe continued to perform well, led by Truvada which contributed 311 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, up 15% from the same period in 2008. Atripla contributed revenues of 216 million during the fourth quarter, up over 100% from the same period in 2008.</p>
          <p>Despite the popularity of the protease inhibitor class in France, in its first six months, the uptake of Atripla has matched that of the U.S. And in November, Atripla market share in France overtook that of Combivir, and is quickly closing the gap on Kivexa.</p>
          <p>We now have the number one and number two HIV brands in Truvada and Atripla in Germany, Spain, the U.K. and Italy. And early indicators suggest that we will soon reach this status in France as well.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter of 2009, we launched Atripla in Belgium, and at the beginning of this year, Australia. We anticipate obtaining reimbursement approval for Atripla in Switzerland during the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>At the end of the third quarter, the big five countries of Europe had approximately 287,000 patients treated with antiretrovirals, representing a growth rate of 6% on a moving annual total basis.</p>
          <p>Approximately 23% of patients receiving Atripla converted from Truvada plus Sustiva in the third quarter of 2009, while 33% were switches from other regimens and 44% were na&#xEF;ve to therapy. Total Truvada increased its share to approximately 76% of treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients, up from approximately 71% in the fourth quarter of 2008, while Kivexa's share dropped to 10% in the fourth quarter 2009, down from 14% in the fourth quarter of 2008.</p>
          <p>Now, turning to our U.S. hepatitis franchise.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we began executing a significant modification to our HBV promotional efforts, centered around the addition of a new group of sales representatives focused on the largest Asian communities, namely Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco. By the end of this quarter, we will have a field team 50% larger than in 2009. We believe these additional resources will be the catalyst for driving growth in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis B.</p>
          <p>Viread continued its strong uptake during the fourth quarter, where HBV prescriptions grew by 17% quarter-on-quarter, more than offsetting any decline in Viread HIV total prescriptions, and generating a 4% quarter-on-quarter increase in total Viread prescription volume across both indications. The latest December monthly data point for total HBV prescriptions have Viread at an estimated market share of approximately 33% and Hepsera at 20%.</p>
          <p>As of the most recent data point in October 2009, Viread had achieved a 41% na&#xEF;ve patient share in the HBV market, whilst Entecavir's na&#xEF;ve market share continued to decline to 36% versus a peak of 49% in April 2008.</p>
          <p>Later this year, we anticipate having the 144-week data from our 102 and 103 studies added to our label. As a reminder, those data were presented at the American Association for [the] Study of Liver Disease in October last year.</p>
          <p>In Europe, Viread for HBV is now reimbursed in 18 countries, with late fourth quarter 2009 launches in Belgium and Australia. Poland and Switzerland launches are anticipated in the first quarter of 2010. Viread has continued to build on its lead over Entecavir in Germany, Spain and the U.K., our first countries of launch. As of October 2009, Viread's HBV market share in Europe was estimated to be 19% versus 7% in October 2008.</p>
          <p>In Turkey, where the Ministry of Health has given Viread a priority position ahead of Entecavir for patients who fail lamivudine, as of December 2009, we have achieved a 22% market share, up from 10% in December 2008.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the interest of time, I will concentrate my cardiovascular comments on Ranexa. Total U.S. sales for Ranexa during the fourth quarter were $46 million. This figure does not include any bulk tablet sales to Menarini, our licensee for Ranexa in Europe. It is also important to highlight the comments made in the third quarter earnings call when we stated we have seen a modest increase in inventories and a one-time sales benefit as we incorporated Ranexa into our Gilead inventory management agreements.</p>
          <p>During the fourth quarter, we saw strong prescription demand for Ranexa. And following our formal relaunch in October, we have begun to see early signs of increased usage as we look to continue to build awareness with our targeted physicians. The latest weekly data point has Ranexa at an all-time high of over 16,000 total prescriptions, compared to just over 11,000 at the time we closed the CVT acquisition.</p>
          <p>We have also seen a 9% increase in the base of prescribing physicians for Ranexa in the fourth quarter over the third quarter of 2009. Beginning this week, we will commence our Ranexa plan of action for 2010. The sales and marketing and medical affairs area have a comprehensive array of activities to execute on. We believe the significant potential for Ranexa in angina warrants this level of commitment.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Norbert to discuss our R&amp;D efforts.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Kevin. On the research and development front, as we enter 2010, we have a number of exciting opportunities across our therapeutic areas. And between now and the end of the year, we expect numerous and important data sets to emerge from these efforts.</p>
          <p>First, on the cardiovascular metabolic front. As we have previously discussed, we're evaluating the potential for Ranexa and follow-on late sodium channel inhibitors in a number of additional indications and settings. Based on desired product profiles, we will pursue some of these opportunities with Ranexa itself, and some of them with new chemical entities that would be emerging from our ongoing research efforts.</p>
          <p>The first such effort would be to evaluate the use of ranolazine for the treatment of patients with diastolic heart failure. We're on target to begin enrolling a Phase II proof-of-concept study in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction early next quarter, and will in parallel initiate discussions with FDA regarding the potential design for a Phase III program.</p>
          <p>We're also progressing GS 9667, a partial A1 adenosine antagonist, towards a Phase Ib proof-of-concept study which we expect to begin in the first half of this year. This compound has been previously shown in a single ascending dose study to lower plasma-free fatty acids. The Phase Ib study will assess the effect of GS 9667 on plasma glucose and insulin sensitivity, as well as its effect on plasma triglycerides. The study will help determine its potential use in patients with Type 2 diabetes or with hypertriglyceridaemia.</p>
          <p>In addition, we're exploring the utility of Letairis for the treatment of non-WHO Group 1 PAH patients. We have recently dosed the first patient in a Phase III study exploring the utility of Letairis for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension, secondary to IPF. The safety and efficacy of Letairis will be determined in this placebo-controlled study, which is targeted to enroll 255 patients at over 80 investigational sites with six-minute walk distance as the primary efficacy endpoint.</p>
          <p>We also continue in our efforts to support Phase IV studies of Letairis in PAH. And announced in November, our planned collaboration with GSK for an international event-driven clinical trial to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first line treatment setting for PAH. The study, called AMBITION, will evaluate first line combination use with Letairis and tadalafil, a PD-5 inhibitor, versus monotherapy, with each in approximately 300 patients with PAH.</p>
          <p>The question of first line combination therapy versus monotherapy is an important outstanding clinical question in PAH, and AMBITION will be the first large randomized clinical trial designed to provide some answers. We expect the study will be underway in the third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>On the respiratory front, as John Martin discussed, we're very pleased with the outcome of FDA's Advisory Committee meeting for Cayston, and we continue to work with FDA towards approval for the product in the U.S. Our head-to-head study of Cayston versus TOBI, which would support full approval in the EU and Canada and be helpful in marketing Cayston, completed enrollment at the end of 2009, with data anticipated from that study towards the middle part of this year.</p>
          <p>With regards to GS 9411, our epithelial sodium channel blocker or ENaC inhibitor, we have recently initiated a multiple dose study in healthy volunteers, which we expect to complete this quarter. We will also initiate a single ascending dose study in patients with cystic fibrosis shortly. This compound is designed to increase airway hydration, and therefore, could have applications beyond use in cystic fibrosis. As one such opportunity, we're preparing to initiate a proof-of-concept study in patients with COPD.</p>
          <p>In addition, the Phase III study of Letairis for the treatment of IPF is approximately 25% enrolled, with about 200 study sites in 17 countries. And we're targeting to complete enrollment of 600 patients in this study by the end of this year. This is an event-driven study with time to progression or death as the primary endpoint.</p>
          <p>With regards to our efforts in HCV, as we have discussed in our last call, we initiated a study to evaluate the potential for drug interactions between our novel HCV protease inhibitor, GS 9256, and our polymerase inhibitor, GS 9190. The data from this study confirmed an interaction between the two compounds, and we will be working to determine the appropriate dose of GS 9190 to move into combination therapy in HCV infected patients. We believe we'll be in a position to do so by the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>And in parallel, we're continuing our 9190 Phase II study in 250 HCV infected patients, looking at 12 and 24-week SVR data which we will have later this year, to see if GS 9190 has the profile that would allow it to be further developed in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin.</p>
          <p>Our caspase inhibitor, 9450, continues to make progress as a hepatoprotectant, both in HCV and NASH. The Phase IIb study in patients with HCV is ongoing, and is assessing two doses of GS 9450 or placebo in adults with chronic HCV infection. With enrollment nearly complete, the study will evaluate the 24-week efficacy histology endpoint. The data from this study will help inform us about GS 9450's further potential in HCV as well as NASH. We hope to be able to present data from both the Phase IIa studies in HCV and NASH at a major medical meeting in the spring of this year.</p>
          <p>And finally on HIV, as you know, we issued a press release the first week of January announcing that both the Phase II clinical trials of the Quad and of GS 9350 met their primary objectives. The first study in 71 HIV infected treatment age adults is comparing the Quad with Atripla. Based on 24-week data, efficacy of the Quad met the statistical criteria of non-inferiority as compared to Atripla, based on the proportion of subjects with HIV RNA levels less than 50 copies/mL. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were comparable in both arms of the study.</p>
          <p>The second Phase II study in 79 HIV infected treatment age adults is evaluating the safety and efficacy of GS 9350-boosted atazanavir compared to ritonavir-boosted atazanavir, each in combination with Truvada. The study met its primary objective of achieving viral load of less than 50 copies/mL at 24 weeks of treatment. Discontinuation rates due to adverse events were comparable in both arms of this study.</p>
          <p>We're very pleased with these outcomes, and have submitted the data from both these studies for presentation at the scientific meeting in early 2010. We will soon be reviewing these data with the FDA, and our goal would be to initiate three full Phase III studies before the mid-point of this year.</p>
          <p>I'm also pleased to share with you that we have completed the drug interaction study of GS 9350 with proton pump inhibitors and H2 antagonists. As you may recall, this topic was brought up during the Q&amp;A on last quarter's earnings call. We initiated this study to assess whether the pH-dependent solubility of GS 9350 could lead to a variable exposure depending on the pH of the stomach, particularly when used concurrently with PPIs or H2 antagonists. In short, neither the PPI nor the H2 antagonist altered the exposure of elvitegravir or 9350. So there will not be corresponding dosing restrictions as we head into the Phase III program.</p>
          <p>The Phase III study of elvitegravir head-to-head versus raltegravir in treatment-experienced HIV patients completed enrollment in December, and puts us on track for obtaining 48-week data from that study by early 2011.</p>
          <p>We continue our evaluation of fixed-dose formulations of Truvada with Tibotec's NNRTI drug candidate TMC278. The clinical data sets that would allow support &#x2013; that would support the filing of the fixed-dose in addition to bioequivalence data are the Phase III results from the TMC278 head-to-head program versus efavirenz in treatment-na&#xEF;ve patients.</p>
          <p>Tibotec has stated they expect to have data from these two studies before the middle of this year, which would allow them to file for the single agent of TMC278 in the second half of 2010. Our intent is to submit marketing applications for the fixed-dose of Truvada and TMC278 shortly after Tibotec's filing for TMC278 is accepted for review in the U.S. and in the EU respectively.</p>
          <p>In summary, we have a number of exciting opportunities, both for label extensions of our commercial products and for new chemical entities in development, or arising from our research efforts.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to John Milligan.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Norbert. I'm very pleased with our continued high level of productivity and consistent financial performance in 2009. As we enter 2010, it's clear that we have the opportunity to continue to expand our commercial business, to introduce new data sets on our products in clinical development, and to expand our pipeline on all of our therapeutic areas.</p>
          <p>Over the course of this year, we'll be working to leverage all the important catalysts occurred in 2009, namely the extension of the Ryan White CARE Act and changes to treatment guidelines to facilitate more patients with HIV into care and on to therapy.</p>
          <p>We'll also be supporting targeted initiatives in major U.S. cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., where the prevalence of HIV is the highest to increase HIV screenings in settings such as emergency rooms, pharmacies, correctional facilities and clinics. We'll be taking the lessons learned and the success from these programs to help establish best practices and support efforts in other settings and geographies.</p>
          <p>We're looking at similar efforts in Europe to reach those living with HIV but who are not yet diagnosed. We will continue to make strides in increasing access to patients in resource-constrained parts of the world through our Gilead Access Program which covers 130 resource-limited countries. Today, over 1.3 million individuals around the world are receiving one or more of Gilead's HIV medications, and more than 50% of these patients are in the developing world. We're proud of our success in helping expand access.</p>
          <p>With the recent changes in WHO guidelines, now recommending treatment for less severely ill patients including those with CD4 counts as high as 350, we now have even more work ahead of us.</p>
          <p>I believe that this will be a very exciting year as we chart the progress of our HIV pipeline candidates, particularly as we initiate the comprehensive Phase II program for the Quad and GS 9350 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We also anticipate the release of the TMC278 pivotal studies by our partner Tibotec. I look forward to the subsequent filings for the fixed-dose regimen of that compound co-formulated with Truvada by year's end. And approval of this new potential regimen would mark the introduction of only the second single-pill complete regimen since the introduction of Atripla in 2006.</p>
          <p>We're very much looking forward to the upcoming Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, or CROI Conference, which will be taking place in San Francisco the third week in February. This meeting is considered to be the preeminent conference focused solely on HIV and AIDS, and brings together both domestic and international thought leaders, guideline committee members, researchers, and caregivers whose practices are dedicated to treating patients living with HIV. We anticipate the presentation of numerous important data sets, both from Gilead's internal programs as well as from external groups.</p>
          <p>Beyond HIV, we have a broad and deep pipeline of product candidates in liver, respiratory and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases that will support our growth into the future. We look forward to sharing with you our progress on various product candidates.</p>
          <p>In summary, as we enter 2010, the hard work and diligent focus that we have maintained at our core for so many years have positioned us extremely well for the future growth of the company.</p>
          <p>We concluded 2009 with nearly $6.5 billion in product sales, including two products with sales of approximately $2.4 billion each, and a very healthy cash position of about $3.9 billion.</p>
          <p>Having now completed a three-year $3 billion share repurchase program in only two years, as well as the cost savings we will recognize from winding down the darusentan studies, we are actively and thoughtfully evaluating the potential future uses of cash, including further investments to augment our pipeline, all with a focus on bringing forward new medicines for patients in need while ensuring the long-term growth of our company.</p>
          <p>I would like to close by recognizing the dedication and contribution of our nearly 4,000 employees, who are focused on delivering on our promise to make a difference in the lives of many patients around the world benefiting from our therapies.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter. Wanted to ask you about the fourth quarter HIV trends. Kevin, you said inventories were basically flat sequentially. But I'm wondering if you can give us some color here about the sequential step up from 3Q to 4Q. Is it treatment guidelines, is it new IMAs that may have impacted the channel? Just help us out with a little bit of the fourth quarter demand.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Geoff. First, I just want to reiterate that it was a very good quarter from the point of view of prescription growth and that's the background to our optimism in our guidance for 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me specifically talk about Q3 going into Q4. There is really three considerations there, Geoff. The first one is going back to the third quarter. If you remember, there was about a four-day drawdown of inventories in the third quarter, which we talked about in our earnings call. So that has the effect of essentially bringing down Q3 and, therefore, Q4 on Q3 has that relative uplift.</p>
          <p>Specifically around Q4, there's two effects to talk about. First of all is pricing. For Q4, we had the full effect &#x2013; so the full three months of the price increase that we took in July on Truvada, which obviously affected Atripla. With our previous inventory management agreements, it allowed one month of buy-in at the previous price of our products. So essentially you only get a two-month effect in the following quarter. And then the subsequent quarter, in our case the fourth quarter, you get the full three-month effect. So that's the first thing to mention.</p>
          <p>But the second area is the most important area, and that is the non-retail. We did see continued strong demand from our non-retail area. That's primarily the ADAP programs, and that is very much around Florida and Texas. When we look at the information provided from Florida and Texas, and this is public information, we can see quite significant rises in ADAP patients that these two programs are covering.</p>
          <p>And in addition to that, it's important to point out that for Texas, they had the restatement of about $20 million of funding that was held back in 2008 because of Hurricane Ike, that's been reinstated in 2009. And they're obviously spending a lot of that money on antiretroviral therapies. So that has given some uplift to their purchasing in the fourth quarter.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay; hey guys, let me join Geoff, great quarter. I've got to ask you about R&amp;D. I was just looking at your R&amp;D guidance, it's obviously way below where most of the sell-side &#x2013; at least just modeling, it looks to me like it implies something like 10 to 11% of revenue for 2010 versus, I think, most of us are thinking 12 to 13%. Does this represent, A, what went &#x2013; why the slower growth than we were thinking? And B, is this the way we should think about modeling the company long-term or is it too early to make that call? Thanks a lot for taking my questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Mark. It's Robin. I'll start off and maybe Norbert can chime in. I think there is a couple of things. We do see overall growth in our R&amp;D activity, but if you'll recall, we talked about the darusentan trial being canceled. So from a run rate standpoint, that was a reduction which, as mentioned, we hope to find new alternatives to invest going forward. Also, we get a full year impact of the synergies that result from us consolidating CV Therapeutics as well as our own cardiovascular activities. And lastly, if you'll recall, we had about 52 million related to Tibotec in Q3 of 2009. We have only estimated about 25 million relative to reimbursements to J&amp;J going into 2010 at this point.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Mark, just I would like to add another maybe philosophical comment. We look at R&amp;D spending as very disciplined and judicious use of resources, both financial and human, and we will allocate it to programs that are very, very successful and are worth the investment in terms of expected return.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hey, guys. Congratulations on a great quarter. Some positive news in biotech is always welcome. I have a question. Not that you don't have a lot going on, but with the Phase II data in hand with the booster, I mean how do you think of potential applications, either in co-formulation or otherwise, with other protease inhibitors?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Michael, I think you know that we have committed to developing the booster by itself. And we still have to have a discussion with the FDA about exactly labeling, et cetera. But the booster will be made available as a standalone agent so it can be used with other protease inhibitors. But in addition to that, we are actively looking at co-formulation opportunities, other protease inhibitors in HIV and also other opportunities. But those things haven't advanced far enough that we'll be ready to talk about it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Michael. It's John Milligan. Just to elaborate on that, one of the reasons why we hadn't advanced any talks in this area is because it is always important to have some data. And so now that we have data in hand, as those will be presented at an upcoming meeting, that will give us an opportunity to then go and speak to partners who are quite interested to talk to us about various co-formulation opportunities. And so we'll have to make some decisions on how we'll do such things, but it does create a really interesting opportunity for us. And as Norbert pointed out, that could be both in the HIV and the HCV arena, as we see it today.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We have a protease inhibitor that we have shelved, and we're currently evaluating whether it would be feasible to bring that back and under what situations that might be worthwhile in this marketplace. Yes.</p>

          <p>The next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn representing Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. I might sneak in a second as well. I'm curious, John, your last closing remarks about your use of cash. Is there any potential that you're considering a dividend? And as a corollary question is, where should we think about strategically Gilead focusing? Are you going to continue to add to your cardiovascular products or are you considering adding new verticals? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So Rachel, yes, the question is use of capital. As we have been describing it to folks, we are going through &#x2013; and of course as you grow as a company, you go through a natural evaluation program. And we have had a number of groups ask us whether we would consider a dividend, and some have thought it would be a good idea for Gilead to consider a dividend.</p>
          <p>So at that request, and as you would always do with your company, with your Board of Directors, you go through the various scenarios for the future and you evaluate how you can invest in the company. So how you can grow organically R&amp;D, how you can bring in-licensed compounds to build the company, and as you know, how you can acquire to build the company. So that's part of the evaluation. You look at stock buybacks, which are an important consideration to return shareholder value. And then it's often true that companies at some point start to pay a dividend.</p>
          <p>So what we're communicating right now is that we're continuing to evaluate those various scenarios for now and for the future. I mean as you know, it's a long-term planning process for us and we go through these scenarios at various times. So as we and the Board importantly come to conclusions on what we should do in various areas, we'll communicate those as we can, or as we should, I should say.</p>
          <p>And then finally your question was, would we look at different areas? Our first and foremost opportunities are with our existing pipeline. So we'll continue to evaluate in-licensing opportunities to augment the different areas that we have, including cardiovascular disease where I think we have a good deal of expertise and some good opportunities.</p>
          <p>And then your last point was, would you continue to look at other verticals? I would say, in this business, there is always a chance that groups would do something that's opportunistic that might fall into a different product category, but it should have the same characteristics of the current products we have. So you can never rule that out because there is things that become available during the course of the year, and you have to use your team to evaluate things when they come up because they go away very quickly otherwise.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my question, and thanks for the good guidance. We definitely need it. I have a question about the Quad pill, and help us understand maybe a little bit your &#x2013; I mean, it sounds like the data that we're going to get next month, it looks like you showed statistical non-inferiority would suggest maybe even numerically you might be a little bit better, but it's obviously a very small study.</p>
          <p>So as we think of Phase III, I mean it sounds like you're really trying to show a difference on safety. And in terms of CNS side-effects, obviously Sustiva is pretty good. It has got an Achilles' heel in about 10 or 20% of patients in terms of neurotoxicity. So it's not a huge sample. So the question is really, how do you differentiate and how do you set up the clinical study to show a difference on safety? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. So Yaron, the Phase III design is actually very straightforward. It's a non-inferiority study. We just have to agree with regulatory authorities on the delta; from the delta, follows the sample size. But if you look at some past studies, it will be something like total of 600 to 700 patients, so 300 to 350 per arm.</p>
          <p>And with regards to differentiation, I'm in my &#x2013; if you ask me to speculate, I do think it will be differentiated in terms of safety because we have a fair amount of data on our elvitegravir, the integrase inhibitor, from our ongoing Phase II study that is now in its third year. And we do know a lot about the safety of elvitegravir, and it looks pretty clean. But again, this has to be shown in the Phase III study, and we just have to wait until we have the data.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much for taking the question. Kevin, just one follow-up to the data you provided us on HIV. Could you tell us, of the total Truvada patients that you mentioned in the U.S. and in the big five EU countries, what number or percentage are being treated with ritonavir in combination with the total Truvada? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that in my fingertips, Geoff. I can certainly follow-up later. If you look at &#x2013; I can certainly give you the split of NNRTIs to PIs. PIs are largely boosted here in the U.S. as they are in Europe. If you look at the ratio in terms of new patients, it's 55% NNRTIs to 45% protease inhibitors. But if you look at total, total patients, it's still 52% ratio in favor of protease inhibitors to NNRTIs.</p>

          <p>And as you know, Geoff, there is a fair spectrum in the use of protease inhibitors to NNRTIs across the five major markets. Spain and the U.K. are weighted towards NNRTIs because of the success of the Sustiva introduction there. And Italy and Germany &#x2013; sorry, Italy and France are the protease inhibitor markets, and they are skewed at about a 60/40 direction towards protease inhibitors.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Just in the past, you guys have stated that you would expect the absolute growth in patient volume in the HIV business to grow at a level consistent with what you have seen in the past or greater, given the HIV guidelines. Incorporating this guideline &#x2013; the guidance you have given us, is that a stable growth rate on patient volumes from '07/'08, is that an acceleration or is it some other number?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll take a go at that, Steve. We expect 2010, as you would see from the very healthy guidance, to be a good proportion of the applicable patients now coming under the guidelines to be moving on to antiretroviral therapy, and of course 85% of that is total Truvada.</p>
          <p>So I wouldn't call it an acceleration. I would call it a very healthy movement of patients under care to going on antiretroviral therapy. So the nice thing about this HIV market &#x2013; it continues to be very consistent in its growth. I actually went back and had a look at some numbers today. When guidelines last changed, that was December the 1st, 2007, where old patients were recommended below 350, and there was not a hockey stick but there was that continued very robust, very dependable growth of this market.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks for taking my question. When you think about the growth projections that you have for 2010, can you comment on the sources of growth relative to U.S., ex U.S., maybe ex outside of Europe, and also what you're factoring in for the non-retail component because that always seems to be a big swing factor quarter-to-quarter?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can certainly give you a qualitative comment in terms of what we're looking at, Jason. As we have talked about already, we'll certainly see our HIV business to be very healthy in 2010, thanks to guideline changes and, as been referred to, the initiatives we're now seeing on testing. Obviously, we are positive about our opportunities for Ranexa, now that we've put in our new field based teams and all of the extra resources. And Europe looks also of high opportunity because of full year effects with Atripla in France, and we still got several countries coming on stream. So I think, qualitatively, they would be the main drivers behind our vision of 2010.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask a question actually about the growth in the overall U.S. HIV market, but slightly different perspective than the answer that you gave previously. On the slide that you show, slide 26 with these numbers, I noticed that the growth in the number of patients who are being treated looks very different this time relative to the prior earning's slides. It's showing 4% year-over-year versus the six, 7% rates that you had calculated earlier. Should we be at all concerned about that? Are you surprised that it's that low, given the fact that the data around early treatment initiation and all these moves to increase the diagnosis rate has actually been out there for some period of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Thomas. Nice to have you back on the call. I'm not unduly concerned by this one-quarter effect. Again, I went back and looked at our data over the years, and of course this is the Synovate survey data, and we do have from time to time quarters that are flat quarter-on-quarter. So we do see this.</p>
          <p>The survey is what it is. It is a survey. It is only based on 200 physicians who present 20 patient records per quarter; so it's 4,000 patient records. And then it's extrapolated up to national levels.</p>
          <p>So I think we should always look at prescriptions as the lead indicator for the health of our growth. And obviously, you know the IMS and Walter School data, and it looked pretty good for the fourth quarter. So I would say we do see these type of sideways moves from time to time.</p>

          <p>And Thomas, this is Susan. I'm just going to add one more point to Kevin's response. Obviously, the Synovate data is on a quarter lag, right? So that's Q3 data, and that certainly also was in advance of the U.S. guidelines changing for earlier initiations. So that's just one more point to add to that.</p>

      <speaker id="16" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. This is, I guess, just a little bit of a twist on some of the previous questions. So putting your 2010 guidance in sort of the broader context, first I was wondering, in terms of the guidelines &#x2013; like if you could think about in terms of your kind of waterfall diagram, what the drivers of growth are? And how much of it is coming from the guidelines changes?</p>
          <p>And secondly, looking backwards, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in terms of the non-retail sales that the point was that it looks like it's going to be robustly sustainable, and it wasn't sort of the &#x2013; you didn't see sort of a lumpy pattern in 4Q 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Davis. I'll take your second question first. It was a strong quarter for non-retail, and that comes back on the back of a strong Q3. So we've seen a couple of pretty strong quarters. If you recall the supplemental grants for ADAP were given out early in 2009, so that might indicate an earlier ordering pattern, and I did mention this extra benefit that Texas had.</p>
          <p>Difficult always to make predictions about non-retail. It's always qualitative comments that we get from our discussions with Florida and Texas ADAP. But it looks like Q1 will be a healthy quarter for that purchasing. But we never quite know. They are &#x2013; at the end of the day, they are state run establishments.</p>
          <p>Going back to your first question, probably the best way to look at it is, you do know that the gap between the patients under care and the patients currently on antiretroviral therapy is over 100,000 patients &#x2013; it's approximately 125,000 patients. If you just look at the patients who are 500 CD4 counts and below, that's in the region of 60 to 70,000 patients. And they would be the obvious patients that we'll be addressing with physicians, and indeed we do have campaigns going directly out to patients. So what we have considered in our expectations for 2010 is a healthy conversion of those 60 to 70,000 patients coming on to therapy.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. John, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there were still six states that need to change their laws in order to accommodate the CDC screening guidelines. And if memory serves me, some of those states are some of the ones with the larger high-risk patient populations like New York and Massachusetts. So I'm wondering if you could give us an update specifically on New York and Massachusetts and the other larger high-risk states, where they are in their legislative process.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I'm not sure if you meant John Milligan or John Martin, but I'll take that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it was John Martin that mentioned it, but I'll take either answer.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Anyone, thank you. So yes, with regard to &#x2013; the legislative process in any state is slow. And I know that we have folks help trying to make those states understand the importance of these various initiatives. I don't know specifically when Massachusetts or New York, and those are two of the most important states, when we would expect those things to change. It's kind of impossible to predict these things. So we'll just have to give you updates as things happen. But I don't have any further update for you now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And we also have screening programs within those states that allow for more expeditious compliance with those requirements while we're waiting the guideline &#x2013; or we're working on the guideline, or on the legislative changes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And what's at risk for these states who haven't changed their laws under the new Ryan White CARE Act? Could they actually lose their Ryan White funding if the laws aren't changed and screening programs aren't put in place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, Phil, they don't have to specifically change their laws. They are required to test a certain number of individuals in accordance with the prevalence in their state. And so if they don't test that number of individuals, they are at risk for some penalties and loss of funding.</p>
          <p>So, of course, states never let that happen. So we would expect them to test those number of people. But it doesn't mean you have to change those guidelines in order to hit that number. It just means you have to be more vigilant in getting people in and taking them through all the steps necessary to get there.</p>

      <speaker id="18" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks for the question. I just wanted to revisit, I think it was two questions ago, the number of patients that are available with CD4 count over 500 and under care of a physician, did I correctly calculate that that's about 55 to 65,000 patients? And then when do you expect or when would you model that growth coming? It doesn't sound like it's 2010. Is that something that you expect to see thereafter? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, hey Tom. It's Kevin. Yes, your calculation is about right. The number that you've got would be over 500, and what the survey classifies as CD4 count not recorded. So there is a little bit of, if you like, of sort of other in there. So you'd have to make some assumptions about what their CD4 count was.</p>
          <p>Don't forget that, today, we do have physicians that are treating patients above 500. If you actually look at our survey, of new patient starts, about 10% are already being started above the 500 level. So as we've often said, guidelines often follow clinical care. So no doubt there are going to be a growing number of physicians who want to start patients above 500. And the guidelines committee voted 55% in favor of that starting point. So, yes, I think there will be patients &#x2013; there are patients and there will be more patients begun above 500.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="19" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi guys. Just wondering if you can maybe speak to the positioning of the new fixed-dose combinations that you're working on, both the Quad and the 278 combo. Just trying to get a sense, of the current patients on Atripla, what percent are not satisfied either by virtue of side-effects or inadequate viral suppression? And how do you position this for a switch, and what patients you think you will successfully gain on entry of either of those products?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Jim. I'll take the first part, and I think John will come in on &#x2013; in terms of the positioning. If you look at Atripla today, 53% of new patients start &#x2013; begin on Atripla. When we look at the type of patients, there is very, very little difference when you look at Caucasian, African-American and Hispanic. It's remarkably similar in terms of the use of Atripla.</p>
          <p>Probably the two differences we do see is that Atripla is less commonly used in females due to the cautions around efavirenz and pregnancy, and probably less commonly used where patients have very low CD4 counts &#x2013; below 200. So that would be your profile of the type of usage of Atripla.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, so Jim, we're going to try to do a couple of different things here, but it will really depend on the data at the end of the day. And if you think about the TMC278-Truvada fixed-dose combination, that's going to be head-to-head with Atripla basically. It's efavirenz plus Truvada. So that will be the data set that we would have to detail off of.</p>
          <p>With respect to the Quad, we'll have &#x2013; Norbert's program that he has put together will have two studies, one versus Atripla, and one versus boosted-atazanavir. So ideally, we'd have good data sets on both going out that would allow us to then position the product versus a protease inhibitor or versus Atripla.</p>
          <p>But at the end of the day, we're going to have to look at the data set of the TMC278 fixed-dose combination and the Quad, and determine what's the best thing for patients based on their relative profiles. And we obviously can't do that until we have the full data sets out there.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thanks for taking the question. Norbert, I just wanted to ask a point of clarification. Did you say that you had actually confirmed the drug-drug interaction between GS 9256 and 9190, and does that complicate things potentially?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Bret. So I did say we confirmed the drug interaction, and it doesn't &#x2013; I wouldn't say complicate. That's the wrong word. We just have to probably dose-adjust the 9190. 9190, as you may remember, was 40 mg BID, and we're seeing about a doubling of the exposure when we co-administer it with the protease inhibitor, and that we think is too high in terms of the QTc risk.</p>
          <p>So we just have to figure out what that lower dose is. It's not &#x2013; I think it's pretty straightforward to figure that out. You just do another drug interaction with a lower dose, and see whether you get the same exposure as you get with the 40 mg BID without the protease inhibitor.</p>

          <p>Hi. Thanks a lot. My question is the Quad for the Phase III studies in the treatment-na&#xEF;ve. I'm wondering what the gating factors are to start that. I think you mentioned a meeting with the FDA. Do you have to wait for the 48-week data for the Phase II studies &#x2013; and any other commentary on timing? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Joel, so the only gating data that we need is really some confirmation of safety and efficacy from a Phase II study, which we have now. We will take these data now to FDA, present it to them. And that will be the gating factor to go into Phase III. That's an agreement we previously had with them. We wait on patient numbers. So I think it should be pretty straightforward.</p>
