          <p>Good morning and welcome to the presentation of Telenor's First Quarter Results for 2008. My name is Scott Engebrigtsen and it's my pleasure to guide you through this morning's presentation.</p>
          <p>We hope that everyone has the material that we have made available, and that is our press release, the quarterly reports, and a copy of the presentation to be used here in a minute. You may also watch this presentation live or in recording on either the Internet or on a mobile phone, provided it's capable of showing live video.  And you may also send in your written questions during this transmission, and you'll find both the material that we have available and instructions on these alternatives from our website at telenor.com.</p>
          <p>There will be a Q&amp;A session directly after the presentation here and we will start-off as usual with audience present, then turn over to the ones participating on the phone, and finally, the opportunity to do individual interviews.</p>
          <p>But now let's get down to business and take a closer look at the figures and to present the first quarter figures today we have our CEO, Mr. Jon Fredrik Baksaas, and our CFO, Trond Westlie. And first I'll leave the floor to Fredrik.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Scott and good morning to all of you. We are here to go through the first quarter 2008 from Telenor.</p>
          <p>Also in this quarter we can record a considerable growth, it continues.  We also have a stable EBITDA margin compared to what we've had in the previous. And what bothers us a bit on the topline here is the fact that the Norwegian kroner is still appreciating compared to the previous periods. So, our revenue growth underlying is, for this quarter, 7%.</p>
          <p>In Norway, we had in fourth quarter a setback in our mobile activities that has now &#x2013; I seem to forget my work here, here we are &#x2013; in Norway for mobile activities, we see sort of a rebounce of &#x2013; DSL and the mobile in the Norwegian marketplace. It significantly improved, and the efficiency measures that we started off after and during fourth quarter is starting to payoff.</p>
          <p>In Kyivstar we have an outstanding, I should say, performance this quarter. All parameters seems to be on the right side and Kyivstar has done remarkably well based on the market share and margin in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Also in this quarter, we have added quite a significant number &#x2013; new number of customers, 4.3 million to be exact, and this time is all in Asia. It's our four operations in Asia that contributes to this growth:  Pakistan with 2.1 million, Bangladesh 1.3 million and Thailand 900,000. And we can now sort of the see the 150 million milestone number of customers coming up on the horizon, seeing 147 million at the end of this quarter.</p>
          <p>The question about the rising food prices in Asia and in the world in general has been sort of a question. And we see that purchasing power are under pressure to a certain extent yet we don't see an effect on that other than some initial signs in Bangladesh, the way we see our markets develop in these days.</p>
          <p>Let me then move over to some of our operations. In this quarter, we've picked Norway, Ukraine, Pakistan and Thailand for specific comments. And I will start with Norway.  It is a very satisfying fact to note that our underlying retails revenue in Norway is growing like 5% and this figure was 4% in fourth quarter.  And it is then our own retail that basically are building up also knowing that this is the last quarter where we have volumes from the Tele2 wholesale contracts on board for the Telenor mobile figures in Norway.  In this quarter, revenue-wise, this figure is about NOK130 million.</p>
          <p>Among the major <mark type="inaudible" /> in this marketplace, we were the only one that increased our customer base in this quarter. We expanded our customer base in particular a very satisfying around postpaid, and that also takes the average ARPU on the customer base up.</p>
          <p>The cost initiatives that we launched for this activity in &#x2013; both during and in the first quarter has started to paid-off. Of course, in such quarter, there will be sort of some short-term effects coming out of this. So, also on the longer-term horizon, we will need to address the cost structure of this operation going forward.</p>
          <p>But still, seeing this kind of means given the effects in the first quarter the way it has, we think this is a good sign. So we are maintaining comfortably the margin that is set for 2008, being on the level of mid 30s &#x2013; all in all, the way we see 2008 from first quarter perspective.</p>
          <p>If we then go to fixed Norway, at first glance it might be a disappointing top line here. This includes, and luckily, a reversal of some lease line revenue of NOK50 million, and it includes the price reductions of naked DSL and wholesale DSL that was initiated from 1st of December last year. And to a certain extent, there is a minor effect coming from the Easter period.</p>
          <p>On the OpEx side, there are some one-offs related to restructuring costs and a loss on an IT project, totally NOK114 million. And if we take this &#x2013; the revenue comment and the OpEx comment and look at it holistically, the underlying EBITDA margin is at par with our targets, 36% for this quarter.</p>
          <p>On the positive side, this quarter is the quarter where we have had the lowest loss of the &#x2013; the lowest line loss since first quarter 2003, meaning that it's almost five years ago since we've had such a low line loss as we've recorded in this quarter. We maintain the targets, the targets for the year of a 3% &#x2013; around a 3% revenue decline figure for this operation in 2008, and the cash flow target of 3.5 billion for the same year.</p>
          <p>If you than go to Kyivstar. Kyivstar has an outstanding performance this quarter. It has maintained its market leadership and it's solid now at 43%. And in this specific quarter we do not have the heavy seasonal effects coming from the usually high number on new SIM cards being distributed in Christmas and New Year season.  And this takes the average revenue per user up to 18% in the quarter and as a consequence we can record a 27% revenue growth overall in this quarter for Kyivstar.</p>
          <p>It's very &#x2013; it's a very good performance and it takes the margin to 60% in the quarter as such. And our congratulations basically, goes to the management of Kyivstar having managed to the develop Kyivstar also into the most valuable consumer brand considered in Ukraine in these days.</p>
          <p>Moving then over to Pakistan. Pakistan is a &#x2013; this quarter, the number one contributor to customer growth in Telenor, in first quarter 2008. But it's also the number one in &#x2013; when it comes to number of customers among the players in Pakistan, with 2.1 million new subscribers in this quarter alone.</p>
          <p>And we've now been in Pakistan for three years. We've reached 17 million customers after three years of operations now in April. And this is the result 15,000 people passing our outlets every day in three years, 365 days a year, in three years consecutively, because that's what it takes to reach 17 million customers in only three years of operation. It's a phenomenal performance to facilitate those kind of volumes both network wise and also, of course, customer handling wise. So Tore Johnsen and his team has done a remarkable job over these three years.</p>
          <p>We are now at 20% margin in &#x2013; sorry &#x2013; 20% market share in Pakistan and we believe ourselves to be solidly number two in the marketplace. This happens at the same time where ARPU, average revenue per user, is reasonably stable.  We're still at $4 per user per month, and this is also a strong figure for parts on the way we see it.</p>
          <p>On the negative side, there has been rising energy prices, which has put to certain extent pressure on our OpEx in the quarter.  And there are two reasons for this happening. Number one is that electricity supply is generally not secure enough, so the backup coming from diesel-run electricity is part of this game. And that of course also put the pressure on both the logistics around it and also experience to the general price in energy prices.</p>
          <p>In this quarter, CapEx were anticipated to be higher than what's recorded here. But we have seen that some completion of network installations have been deferred into future quarters because of the &#x2013; partly because of the unrestful season that was a fact in a Pakistan at least in the beginning half of this first quarter.</p>
          <p>In detached, we have had a good customer growth also in this operation in this quarter &#x2013; 900,000 new net customers. But more importantly, there is a slight strengthening in average revenue per user. And this has been a long sought after effect after we adjusted the price plans &#x2013; beginning to do so in third quarter last year.  And then we've also been able to improve the traffic balance between the operators in such a way that the interconnect balance has improved for DTAC in this quarter compared to previous quarters.</p>
          <p>The number one question for Thailand in this year will probably be &#x2013; the question around 3G. We do already possess an 850 license upon which we can use for 3G purposes. And what today &#x2013; it's also anticipated that there'll be a process around 2.1 gigahertz during this year. Of course, seeing DETAC participating in that process.</p>
          <p>As for the rest of operations, I will be very brief at this stage, I'll start with Russia. There are in Russia two more legal claims that has arrived in this quarter. Alfa, our co-shareholder in VimpelCom, has raised a arbitration claim in Geneva for US$1 billion, up against claming that the delay of VimpelCom to access URS was Telenor to blame.  A similar case came up from a company, a minor shareholder in VimpelCom who's residing in Khanty-Mansiysk in Siberia, raising a claim of US$3.8 billion on similar grounds. We believe that these two claims are without merit at all.</p>
          <p>In Malaysia, we expect DiGi to start working at its 3G license in second quarter this year. And this will of course enable DiGi to further develop the mobile internet service offering in the Malaysian market, at par with the two other players in the marketplace.</p>
          <p>In Bangladesh we have a good performance this quarter, but the purchasing power is probably under pressure. And we believe that this market will be a challenge for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Then lastly, I will give a comment on Serbia, and we're happy to see here that the management has been able to strengthen the EBITDA margin in this quarter as well as building successfully the Telenor service offering as a good perception in the Serbian marketplace.</p>
          <p>And that leaves my comments for this first quarter and I live the floor to Trond.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen from me as well. Telenor had a good 7% underlying growth in the first quarter, but if we also &#x2013; if we exclude the currency adjustments, revenue growth was as high as 9%. But then again I will explain you the effects of the currency.</p>
          <p>We are going from the revenue in first quarter of 2007 from 25.3 billion to 26.3 billion this quarter. The Asia region is developing with and increasing with 1.1 billion. That's an underlying revenue growth in the mobile sector in &#x2013; of 17% in Asia.  Pakistan is the main driver in that growth. It has a year-over-year growth of 80% from first quarter 2007 to first quarter 2008.</p>
          <p>In Central/Eastern Europe, a growth of 700 &#x2013; more than 700 million, it's an underlying growth of 14% and the main driver in that region is of course Kyivstar with a growth of 27% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>But marginal decline in the Nordic, broadcast is having an underlying growth of 14% and in total the gross is approximately 2.3 &#x2013; the gross increase is 2.3, but the currency translation effect takes about 55% of that growth and leaves us with a growth of 4% reported, not reported but including Kyivstar and for year-over-year purposes.</p>
          <p>If we look at the detail of the currency development, the column in the middle here, it is the change from the first quarter of 2007 until the first quarter of 2008 and it has weakened compared to Norwegian kroners more than 88% in total over that period of time. So, you see that it has effect on the translation into Norwegian kroners.</p>
          <p>Going then to the earnings before interest impact depreciation and amortization, it increased with 5% from 8.8 billion to a bit more, 9.2 billion, NOK440 million. And it is driven by the two negative events from Norway, both fixed and mobile.</p>
          <p>Grameenphone is having a negative effect basically as a result of currency translation in local currency as an increase. And then it's a change in Denmark and then you have the positive contributors in DTAC, Kyivstar, Pakistan as the main drivers going up to an increase of NOK440 million.</p>
          <p>The 9.2 billion is before other items. We have some other items this quarter, it's totaling NOK236 million. The two major part of that is in Norway, its restructuring cost of approximately 100 million and its scrapping other IT projects that is 70 million that comprises 170 of the 236 and that's the two main drivers in this. The other part is basically content write-downs or content write-offs in Thailand and Denmark.</p>
          <p>Looking a bit at where the CapEx development goes, we divided the CapEx allocation in Nordic, in three regions, in Nordic, Central/Eastern Europe, and Asia. And if you go to the right hand side of the slide, you see that 95% of our subscriber growth comes in Asia this quarter.  Asia had underlying growth of 18%. We see that CapEx to sale in the Asian region this quarter is 23%. And it takes about 58%, of our total CapEx space in the mobile sector.</p>
          <p>The numbers from the Central European, Eastern &#x2013; Central and Eastern European is that CapEx to sale this quarter is 11%.  It is a bit low relative to the cyclical trend in CapEx.  The first quarter is a bit lower than in some of the others. And you see that so that the 11% on the average is followed the &#x2013; on a bit low side.</p>
          <p>And then in Nordic region as 10% CapEx to sales, and takes about 21% of our mobile CapEx in this quarter.</p>
          <p>Going to the reported P&amp;L numbers, revenue base saw 23.2 billion and EBITDA of 7 billion, 123 million, leaves an operating profit or earnings before interest and tax on 3.8 billion &#x2013; 3 billion, 862 million.</p>
          <p>The difference between 2007 and 2008 is of course the associates &#x2013; associated companies increasing as result of Kyivstar, but also that VimpelCom is doing better and in addition to that, the volume of associated companies of almost NOK3 billion is including the gain of Golden Telecom of 1.6 billion.  So, the number comprises of the 1.6 billion, approximately 615 million from Kyivstar and then VimpelCom and other smaller associates is approximately 750 million.</p>
          <p>Another big change from first quarter of 2007 is net financials going from a positive of two &#x2013; more than 200 to a negative of 600.  The main difference there is that we, it's the market investment or the derivatives that we have &#x2013; that we account for market-to-market wise. In first quarter 2007, we had a gain of more than 800 million and this quarter, we have a loss of about &#x2013; a bit less than NOK100 million. And that basically is the total difference between those two quarters.</p>
          <p>The net financial cost, meaning that the net interest paid is approximately the same and there is no other changes either in that &#x2013; well major all the changes in the net financial items. That leaves us at profit before tax of 6 billion, 253 million.</p>
          <p>We have an effective tax percentage in the quarter of 20%. The underlying operating entities tax has not changed. The weighting has changed a bit, so it's increasing a bit from 2007 to 2008. So the underlying tax rate is now approximately 33%.</p>
          <p>But when we're coming down to the tax rate calculation, we have to take out basically the whole line of associate companies, of course VimpelCom and Kyivstar is already &#x2013; is already included every tax deductions. And the sale of Golden Telecom is tax free. And that leaves basically the underlying tax rate of 20% going down then to a tax cost of NOK1.2 billion. And that leaves a net income for the quarter of 4.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Earnings per share is NOK2.72. If we take out the gain from the Golden Telecom and also adjust the 2007 number from the market-to-market derivatives, we have for 2008 an earnings per share NOK1.77 compared to NOK1.10 the last quarter, and that leaves us with basically an earnings per share increase of 60%.</p>
          <p>Continued reduction on net debt going from starting of the year with 40 billion in net debt, going down to 36 billion, driven by of course the natural effects of interest and tax, CapEx, and you'll see that sale of Golden Telecom coming in of 4.5 billion and the EBITDA leading us at 36 billion. That is going to change during May as a result of the dividend payment of 5.7 billion.</p>
          <p>Going to the outlook, no change in the outlook on the face of it.  What has changed &#x2013; if we &#x2013; if you can remember the currency slide, is that the currency has changed from beginning of the year until the end of first quarter.  So the currency effect has an effect on the revenue guidance. Currency &#x2013; comparing the currencies, it has actually an effect overall, approximately 2 percentage points, but as a result of acquisitions done in the period, we are maintaining the guidance of around 5% reported revenue growth during the year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA margin is also maintained above the 31% level and CapEx to sales is still estimated to be around the 20% level. And with that, I conclude my part of the presentation.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Trond. We are now ready to take your questions. So I invite Fredrik back to the podium.  And before you ask your questions please wait for a microphone to be passed over and also please introduce yourself. We have a question here, please.</p>
          <p>We had Martin Hoff from Arctic Securities.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Concerning your revenue growth balance of 5% wasn't -- was it correct in Q4 that you gave it on the organic basis?  So, the 5% now is -- how does that compare to the 5% you gave this last quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The written guidance is always made on the reported growth, the reported numbers, that means excluding Kyivstar and it's not made on underlying. So basically it was made on organic growth correctly. So in the ultimate guidance, we always say that it's guidance on the current &#x2013; ownership of assets, basically, that they have. So in addition whatever acquisitions and sales we do after we give the guidance is of course adjustments to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So IS partner viewed deal, is that it?.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 1.7 billion, it's made for that, then.  So, under -- so the organic growth compared to the root one you gave us then is approximately 3%, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically, what I said was that the currency effect on the guidance that we gave is about 2%. And as a result of IS partner and numerous other changes, we are upholding the 5% level.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The ARPU is down in all Asian markets and part of that of course is currency related. But you also mentioned that there are indications -- early indications in Bangladesh that reduced purchasing powers is having a direct effect on customer spending. Could you elaborate on that?  You expect this trend to continue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The comment was, you can in a way speculate that &#x2013; pressure on purchasing power will also sort of hit &#x2013; the telecom industry. Generally speaking, if you take a look at Hungary for example, Hungary hasn't necessarily reduced its telecom spend for the year 2007, despite the government ambitions of taking back purchasing power throughout that year. Now, when basics are at stake here, you can do in the way, ask the question differently.  Would that mean that our industry will be sort of seeing effect from that. And volume wise we haven't necessarily seen that in Pakistan, in Bangladesh either. But we have to be realistic on the fact that, if the situation on food prices rises and that creates a sort of real situation around how people will use their funds, then I guess that there will be an effect there. At the same time as this happening, Bangladesh is still having a little penetration on mobile phones. Meaning that the competitive situation around getting new customers on board, will still be there. So, the characteristics of the markets will probably be that of a have a high number of new customers being connected, but that the marginal customer with a low ARPU attached. And here of course, the operators Grameenphone including -- included will have to consider its efforts in the marketplace in such away that you balance off OpEx and CapEx in the right way.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a question here as well. Please wait for a microphone.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You mentioned the loss on that &#x2013; an IT project of 100 and some million and which you incurred, can you elaborate on what that relates to?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. The project on that is related to the cellular consolidation ambitions that we entered an agreement with the IBM on a couple of years ago. And we have not been able to proceed with the required progress on that project. So we will have to redesign the project and put it into sort of another context. And that &#x2013; we are in midst sort of doing. Cellular consolidation means that in the telecom industry, generally speaking too many servers are poking up at too many places in the network and you get the sub-optimal utilization of the servers &#x2013; could see such a situation.  And if you bring these into one management area, you could probably utilize and get good efficiencies into the serve &#x2013; the usage of servers in your operation.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Ulrich Rathe and the company is Dresdner. Please go ahead.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Three questions please, and the first one regards Kyivstar.  Is the exceptionally good result in Q1 a hiatus in the competitive situation that will then revert in the second half of year, is this on a sustainable result and to what degree it is sustainable? It was my first question. Second, with regard to the food price inflation, you talked about Bangladesh. I heard DTAC local management talking quite unconcerned about food price inflation because I believe the rural population is actually benefiting a lot in Thailand, could you sort of outside Bangladesh maybe talk about your views i.e. Thailand, Pakistan, Malaysia? And then third, with regard to our guidance from the region six topline you are talking about 3% revenue decline.  I remember from the Q4 call that you actually talked then about minus two to minus three.  Is this just a rounding error here, or have you actually reduced your expectations in Norwegian fixed on the topline? Thank you.</p>

          <p>Kyivstar exceptionally good, we agree to that.  Whether it's exceptional or not I mean over the years we have had that question sort of coming to us quite regularly. And it is very well done by Kyivstar to maintain this level the way they have over many quarters in a row. Already in a way, not so many years that there will be a firm 60% margin, in all quarters going forward here. But, I mean Kyivstar will operate in what we think is a good marketplace in 2007 through 2008. They are very well positioned and it's a non-subsidized market, meaning that the competitive means in the marketplace is a receivable and so we believe that Kyivstar will have a good performance throughout 2008, not guaranteeing you the margin level in all the quarters in 2008 of course.</p>
          <p>In Asia, you are right in the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> of DTAC elaborated a bit on that and Asia -- and Thailand is a bit in a difference because they are a net exporter of rice. And what they see is that basically the rural areas through this development probably will get access to funds in another way, that the cash flows in the society will move.  And is &#x2013; we've already seen a higher pick up of mobile communications in the up-country areas of Thailand. So this is very -- this is a diversified situation in the country. You mentioned Malaysia as well, and we don't see any signs of this in Malaysia, also seeing inflation in these two countries quite low compared to other areas.</p>
          <p>In Pakistan, the rise in energy prices has had an effect on our OpEx, but we have not seen any effect on the demand side for telecommunication services.  So our comment on this is, for the time being, being cautious on the development in Bangladesh.</p>
          <p>As for the fixed line whether it is a difference between two to three and now around three, well, the price adjustment that was done on naked DSL and wholesale DSL is a 100 million Norwegian kroner reduced element on revenues for 2008. We believe this was necessary in order to balance retail prices and wholesale prices. So, around 3%, that's our comment for 2008 the way we now see it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, it's Maurice Patrick from Bear Stearns. Just picking up on the energy price comment, could you share with us how much of your OpEx is exposed to energy prices in Pakistan and perhaps contrast that with, say, Norway &#x2013; where I imagine it's lower. And could you please talk a bit about if there are any sort of things you're putting in place to reduce energy consumption and how you see that moving forwards? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah I wouldn't have access to details of that level unfortunately. However the energy situation in Norway compared to Pakistan is very different. The reliability of public supply of electricity is weak in Pakistan and downfalls, so, energy supplies have been quite frequent throughout the winter. And this takes, that this puts a higher burden on other energy resources being used to keep the networks running. And that is why in a way, you -- we end up with the pressure on our OpEx prices coming from &#x2013; stemming from energy. We are working and I'm trying to address two questions in Telenor when it comes to energy. Number one is energy security, having a secure source of energy when we run our systems, and number two, the cleanliness of the energy source as such. And we are a, high-energy users when it comes to keep the networks running and we're consuming energy very spread around all our base stations. So, access to energy is important. And here there are sort of ideas of bringing both solar energy and wind energy into the formula of covering the energy in need of our base stations. And we are trying to use some tests, brining those kinds of elements both from solar and wind into our energy supply in the years to come.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. It's fair to say that &#x2013; in that we are in not like a factory. We don't have our energy consumption linked to one place. We need energy supply all around in the system. It was better in the old times when the analog systems didn't require electricity to be run. This is not the case anymore. So, energy needs to be distributed in the network and needs to be fed into the network at many places.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Peter Kurt Nielsen from Cheuvreux in London. I'd like to focus on the domestic operations, please. If I may just return to the fixed line revenue growth, how confident are you that you can keep yourself minus 3% for the year? Given what we've seen in Q1, I mean, where do you expect an improvement or stabilization for the remainder of the year? And on that note, any comments on the competitive situation in the domestic DSL market at the moment, and where you stand, so to speak, on your triple play offering at the moment? And secondly, on the mobile market, now three months ago, when you talked about, yeah, the initial outlook for '08, you obviously faced the likelihood of losing the Ventelo contract. Now, that has sort of been transferred into a roaming agreement. Does that mean, are you more optimistic on your domestic mobile performance in 2008 compared to three months ago and does the, sort of your comments on less marketing spend in the first quarter, does that in, in &#x2013; sort of reflect a more stable Norwegian mobile market compared to what we saw last year, or is it just a seasonal effect? Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I start with the Ventelo risk -- you are right in the fact that at last reporting sequence, we had risk attached to how the Ventelo contract relationship would end up, and we are now satisfied with the fact that we have secured a wholesale contract as well as a roaming contract with Network Norway. And this will then give us a period of time where volumes will be at -- it will be reasonably sort of visible. And the insecurity around that is then taken away. The other side of this is that we're, will be reversal of the 50 million Norwegian kroner effect from last year into this quarter of course gives sort of a additional visible effect to the topline, affecting this quarter specifically. And so we are reasonably confident that we are going to maintain a level of around minus 3% because the competitive situation is not that very much changed the way we see it. The intensity in the marketplace on mobile has been high from our side, in the period where we tried to secure as many customers that we possibly could in the migration period from the Telenor Network to the Netcom Network for the Tele2 customers. And I'm happy to say that given the positive development of Telenor retail, I think we can say that we have been reasonably successful in our endeavors to securing that kind of development, though the absolute numbers in customers being fairly small. Still, we're on the positive side and the only among the majors as I've said, who has been able to build customer stock in that period. Okay?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are two questions on Bangladesh. The voice over IP, yes there is a remaining element for discussions between BTRC and Grameenphone over that issue. But there hasn't been any sort of development in that question over the quarter. Yes, there is an investigation going on. And I have no additional comments to that basically at this stage. We're also discussing, of course, with the regulator and the authorities in Bangladesh the potential of making a IPO of Grameenphone in Bangladesh during this year. And we believe that this could also be helpful to the general equity markets in Bangladesh. But around that, there also need to be a framework that is reasonably well understood and transparent in order to understand the conditions that subsidiary and IPO is done upon. When it comes to industry consolidation, the way it has been speculated over in newspapers over the last couple of days, I have of course no comments to that question. That question has been with us as long as I've been in this group and if I say anything, in any direction, it will probably be misunderstood at all, so there will be no comments on that question.</p>

      <speaker type="q">

      <speaker id="6" type="a">

What have they said in the past to you?  And then, some specifics on financials &#x2013; your depreciation fell 5% in the quarter and despite a trend of increasing CapEx over the last few periods; can you explain why that is and can you give you some guidance on the depreciation for the full year? And then finally, on Norwegian mobile, can you just specify what revenues you received from the Tele2 MB&amp;O contract in Q1? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mostly, I guess. Well as you know our strategy for financial flexibility is to try to achieve a single A rating to make sure that we have the necessary flexibility when the situation arises and that means that we going to be flexible on the single A rating when situation arises that we feel comfortable and going forward. We have not stated at all how far or how much we can reconsider that, relative to the circumstances so I guess for a number I don't have an answer for you. And that also comes with sort of a combined combination of your first and second question, how much our main shareholders will dilute themselves. I guess that they &#x2013; you have to ask them. They have made some political statements, but it is also open for Telenor for industrial structuring that that might happen. So it's not sort of locked in as such, but I guess that you -- for we don't know what circumstances and how much, I guess that you have to sort of, talk to our main shareholder.</p>
          <p>Going to the CapEx discussion, as I said through my presentation it is the increase of subscribers that are driving our CapEx level. The CapEx level in Central Eastern Europe, as well as in the Nordic is on a fairly normalized place. We do have some expansion although in Serbia as well as in Kyivstar but not to the extent that it's excessive. So it is the elements of Pakistan and Bangladesh and Thailand that is basically driving it, and of course, one incident that comes up for accounting purposes is a non-cash CapEx of the 3G licenses, so all the frequencies in DiGi. But as we've shown it is a matter of CapEx or capacity as well as customer driven and I guess we can view that two ways. One is, of course, we have to manage it and make sure that we are not wasting our money. But also it's good CapEx relative to driving the growth going forward. So in essence I do think that we see fairly balanced, as we said in the fourth quarter we do see that it is the declining trend both in Bangladesh and Pakistan as well as in Thailand. So we actually see the trending down. How quick that is coming down is, really depends on the market growth.</p>

Can you quantify that? I should expect a bit of a bounce back in next quarter. And on the mobile business there are changed to interconnect by -- it was a beginning of July, and how should that affect the profitability in the second half for your side. Then finally, you sold Golden Telecom of course; should we expect that some of that money will be used for buybacks?

We also have to consider that it is 29 days in February so, that has an effect as well.  But now we are coming in to the basically, the nitty-gritty and so we would say that, yes, it has minor effect but not a substantial one in total.

          <p>Hi, there are three questions, please. The first one is just related to your comments on the economic outlook and whether you're seeing in Asia, whether you're seeing any extra wage inflation in that area, and also some of your Eastern European assets where inflation's running pretty high at the moment. The second is how those comments affect your appetite for M&amp;A, I am thinking specifically about Vietnam &#x2013; I wonder if you could just update us on the process out there, whether the comments you made have any impact.  And the final one is just on the broadcast operations whether there was a 35 million hit in the first quarter, can you just specify what that was whether that flows into the rest of the year as well? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can start off on sort of the general comment on inflation. Our industry has generally not the same ability to, in the short term frame, to raise prices in periods of inflation, of course there are limits to that. Generally speaking, the advantages of &#x2013; from the hand of the customers has the general benefit of the fact that telecom prices usually stays more stable under those circumstances. And as a consequence volumes are being driven up and usually the volume growth has been able to cover the inflationary element that you see on OpEx. As to M&amp;A activities, Vietnam is still a country, which from a telenet perspective, it is very interesting area. Though we have to say that the process has taken very long, whether there will be breakthrough on international players coming into the Vietnamese market. This year, as has been indicated from the authorities, will be very interesting to see. And if that happens, we will for sure be among them looking at that potential. As for broadband, the contract there is a long-term right, long term right that we have to &#x2013; to sport rights for the Danish market. And during the year we will put those rights into a second where they become part of the premium service offering in the Danish market. So yes, this is long-term contract and it's not sort of a write-down, it's a regular allocation of the contract attached to this period that has been taken as cost of goods sold in broadcast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. To just come back on the inflation report, I understand the point you're making in volume rises sort of covering inflation, but I guess the question is easy &#x2013; any extra wage inflation pressures which might all, you know, limit your ability to off-set the usage in the past, or you are not seeing any extra pressures at the moment?</p>

          <p>I talk in general term basically, so we don't see that negative effect in our -- that's you hinting at. However, take a country like &#x2013; Ukraine is probably best example of the subject that you are bringing forward. Because the air volumes and developments are in a way covering the inflationary aspects of the OpEx involved in the Kyivstar operation.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Soomit Datta from New Street Research. And so can I just want go back to the question on inflation and taking the Ukraine as an example. Have you actually been able to specifically increase prices in that market and is that something which is possible given inflation, as you have pointed out as running, I think it's sort of 20-25% level? Well that's the first question. And then secondly just on Pakistan, you have talked about energy costs generally but in that market, is it fair to say that in the meantime those energy costs are going to offset any potential scale benefits and so should we expect the margin in Pakistan there to remain around the 15% level, or I think its running in mid-teens?  And then just finally on Bangladesh you talked about a somewhat gloomy outlook for the rest of this year. Is it conceivable that under the outlook you will look to trim your CapEx budget? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the inflation side, prices in the telecom services in Ukraine has been reasonably stable throughout the last couple of periods. So, but it hasn't been such that prices have generally being raised either, meaning that there are, you don't see the same intensity that we had a couple of years ago, when new segments were to be opened from a customer acquisition point of view. So, there is a more price stable environment the way we see it and prices are low in that market given that there are no subsidies on the handsets.</p>
          <p>Energy costs in Pakistan &#x2013; margin &#x2013; we are running at 17%.  We believe that this margin will move upwards from here throughout 2008, driven of course by the significant customer stock and the fact that we are now covering more than 55% of the population with a very solid network offering reliable and very strong connectivity.  Given that we can handle the energy side, the energy factor as part of the equation of having the network up and running. Energy is very central in that respect.</p>
          <p>In Bangladesh, you used the word gloomy, we used the word challenging. We believe that there will be a hectic competitive period to compete for new segments of the population to reach connectivity, which is important for local economic development the way we see it, and we're happy to participate in that kind of competition &#x2013; building the market.  And of course, but of course, balancing this up against sensible CapEx when it comes to building the necessary capacities to handle the customer growth by using price plans actively to allocate traffic to all sub-periods during the other 24 hours of a day in such a way that you can extend the usage of the network.</p>

          <p>Hi, this is Jakob Bluestone from Merrill Lynch. I have just one quick question just on the fixed line side.  I mean you mentioned that you had the lowest rate of line loss in about five years and I was just wondering if you could talk little about the competitive environment that you're seeing in the Norwegian fixed line. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>The competitive dimension around fixed line in Norway is not of the kind that we had a couple years ago when voice over IP in a way became in a very strong wave.  Prices were realigned between PSDN and ISDN also a couple of years ago that balanced off the intensity around the voice over IP concept. And from that onwards we have seen a more stable competitive situation around the players active here. The players, the main players is of course, Tele2, MexicanTel <mark type="inaudible" />, TeleSonera, ourselves and the high number of regional players offering these services and many of these regions players originating from the electricity sector. The characteristics for the time being has a regional dimension to the extent that some electricity companies are also offering fiber installations, and fiber is becoming a more visible element in the service offering going forward. And that fiber will become also to be deployed in greater volumes in the years to come.  I think we have to recognize that that will be part of the, part of the future. And I, in that sense we believe that Telenor is very well positioned because our extensive backbone capacities and being able to handle the new volumes that also fiber in the access network would mean.</p>
          <p>We're reasonably satisfied with how we are positioned with the Telenos service offering here, using community pricing principles where we include both fixed and mobile voice as well as broadband services into the same way of meeting the customer.  And I think this trend will continue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to ask one follow-up question. Did you expect to generate 10 billion of free cash flow from the Nordic business?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On mid-term we have established a mid-term target for ourselves in the Nordic areas for a 10 billion cash flow target and that remains the way we see the present structure of the operations in the three Nordic fee-generating countries.</p>

          <p>Mr. Andrew Lee, Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good morning gentlemen, just one question on Norwegian mobile. You mentioned postpaid customer gains help the ARPU actually rise this quarter about 2%. What exactly is driving these postpaid gains and are you seeing any easing of the on-net bundling price competition we've seen over the past few quarters? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What drives this is again community pricing. We believe that the community -- the family as a community is a strong entity to bundle services, mobile and fixed in the same package. And so that has become a popular service offering from Telenor. The on-net feature yes, that is something which is here and asymmetric termination principle that still applies to the Norwegian market is a challenge for us. The fact that the regulator has stated that Telenor and NetCom with TeleSonera operation in Norway will be equalized when it comes to termination charges this year is of course welcome. But since both Tele2 and others are able still to maintain a very, almost double the charge, in asymmetrical termination charges, the community pricing with on-net traffic pricing products will be part of the future competitive characteristics in Norway, if you like. Of course, this debate is going on for how long and asymmetrical setting can prevail, Norway being the only country in Europe, in a way, still adopting something which is history in most other markets.</p>

      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, so can you just -- just to clarify, what exactly is it that's driving your ARPUs higher this quarter? And what is it that's driving your increased postpaid customers?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean this is -- the general feature that it's a popular service, it's the usage and that, of course, price pressure in this quarter has been acceptable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="17" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>

          <p>Next Mr. <mark type="inaudible" />, Handelsbanken.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. From Handelsbanken. Yes the question regarding the broadcasting side and also M&amp;A. How do you see your place there and access to compound, platform, satellites going forward?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, when it comes to broadcast, I guess we don't have any comments of our activities in the M&amp;A. We see that there are some movements going out there, but other than that, we stay on course relative to need for content and the good agreements with the content providers. And whether something happening in the market, we are following it but nothing more than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And maybe we should add there that we will replace two or five -- no two or three will replaced later this year with a new satellite to be launched, anticipated to take place in October.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
