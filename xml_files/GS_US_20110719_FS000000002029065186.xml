          <p>Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference facilitator today. I would like to welcome everyone to the Goldman Sachs Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Also, this call is being recorded today, Tuesday, July 19, 2011.

          <p>Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Director of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements.</p>
          <p>For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 2010. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment banking transaction backlog, capital ratios, risk-weighted assets and global core excess. And you should also read the information on the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures that is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website, www.gs.com.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dane. I'd like to thank all of you for listening today. I'll give an overview of our second quarter results and then take questions.</p>
          <p>Net revenues in the second quarter were $7.3 billion and net earnings were $1.1 billion. Earnings per diluted share were $1.85, and our annualized return on common equity was 6.1%. Year-to-date, excluding the impact of our $1.6 billion preferred dividend associated with our repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway preferred stock in the first quarter, our annualized return on common equity was 10.2%. Including the impact, our annualized return on common equity was 8%.</p>
          <p>The second quarter was dominated by concerns surrounding the state of the global economy. These concerns emanated from a variety of regions around the world, including Europe, the United States and China. While many of these concerns have been around for quite some time, further deterioration in economic data coupled with the passage of time without resolution of a significant number of political issues has led to heightened concerns among market participants.</p>
          <p>Sovereign risk in a number of smaller European member states increased, with a particular focus on developments in Greece. Concerns remain for other countries within Europe and the potential negative economic impact on financial institutions with credit exposure to these sovereigns. Within the U.S., concerns have centered on the political debate on raising the debt ceiling, the growing budget deficit, stubbornly high unemployment and potential further pressure on U.S. housing prices. Finally, there's also been greater focus on China given the important role it plays in the broader global economy.</p>
          <p>The complexity surrounding the interplay of these various economic considerations has created tremendous uncertainty about the state of the world's economy and among other things has resulted in limited conviction among market participants. As a result of this uncertainty, many of our investing clients have significantly reduced their risk appetite and thus activity levels generally declined. Despite these market uncertainties, we remain focused on serving the needs of our leading global client base.</p>
          <p>Within Investment Banking, we continue to focus on providing our clients with world-class strategic advice and superior financing execution, which is reflected in our Investment Banking lead table standings. Year to date, we ranked first in announced M&amp;A globally. We're also ranked first in equity and equity-related common stock offerings and IPOs globally year to date.</p>
          <p>We understand that our clients value consistent high-quality service and excellent execution. Effectively meeting their needs for advice, financing, risk capital and liquidity as well as asset management solutions is essential to our long-term performance.</p>
          <p>In the context of more difficult economic and financial conditions the firm launched an internal initiative to identify areas where we can operate more efficiently. Thus far, we've targeted approximately $1.2 billion in run rate compensation and in non-compensation reductions. We're in the process of implementing the cost reduction efforts and expect to complete them before year-end.</p>
          <p>I'll now review each of our businesses. Investment Banking produced second quarter net revenues of $1.4 billion, up 14% from first quarter results. Second quarter Advisory revenues were $637 million, up 78% from the first quarter, reflecting a number of significant deal closings. We advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the quarter, including Johnson &amp; Johnson's $21.3 billion acquisition of Synthes, Skype's $8.5 billion sale to Microsoft and Diversey's $4.3 billion sale to Sealed Air Corporation.</p>
          <p>We were also advisor on a number of significant closed transactions including Pride International's $8.7 billion merger with Ensco, Beckman Coulter's $6.8 billion sale to Danaher and Equinox Minerals' $7.7 billion sale to Barrick Gold.</p>
          <p>Second quarter underwriting net revenues were $811 million, down 11% sequentially. Equity underwriting revenues of $378 million were down 11% from the first quarter, reflecting more challenging equity markets. Debt underwriting revenues decreased 11% to $433 million, reflecting lower investment grade and CMBS issuance volumes partially offset by strong leverage finance activity.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we participated in many noteworthy underwriting transactions, including Prada's $2.5 billion IPO, Shanghai Pharmaceutical's $2.1 billion IPO and Wal-Mart's $5 billion long-term debt offering. Our Investment Banking backlog was unchanged compared to the end of the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Turning to Institutional Client Services, which is comprised of FICC and equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues of $3.5 billion were down 47% from the first quarter as continued macro concerns created more challenging market and operating conditions. The effect of these macro concerns is more pronounced within our Asian and European FICC franchises, which have historically been significant contributors to the Global franchise. Further, during the quarter, we were not as effective at navigating intra-quarter swings in market prices and liquidity as we have been historically. Consequently, we generated lower revenues from managing client originated market-making inventory particularly in our largely U.S.-based Mortgages businesses and our Global Commodities and Credit businesses.</p>
          <p>In this environment, we were particularly prudent in the management of our market risk. This is highlighted by the fact that VAR in the second quarter was at its lowest quarterly level since the third quarter of 2006.</p>
          <p>FICC client execution net revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter, down significantly from the first quarter as every major business generated lower but positive revenues. Our Commodities business was negatively impacted by asset price fluctuations. Credit experienced a more challenging environment for hedging and inventory management. Our mortgages results reflected the negative impact of asset price declines, reduced market liquidity and created divergence between our cash positions and corresponding hedges, particularly in non-agency products. Interest rates and FX were also down but to a lesser extent. In equities, which includes equities client executions, commissions and fees and securities services, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.9 billion, down 17% sequentially.</p>
          <p>Equities client execution revenues were down 36% to $623 million, reflecting lower net revenues within our Cash and Derivatives businesses but declining volumes and lower volatility impacted results. Commissions and fees were $861 million, down 11% from the first quarter on lower market volumes. Security services net revenues of $432 million were 16% higher sequentially, due to the seasonally stronger client activity.</p>
          <p>Turning to risk, average daily value at risk in the second quarter was $101 million, down 11% relative to the first quarter. Our value at risk remains at levels we have not experienced in a number of years.</p>
          <p>Now a review of Investing and Lending, which produced net revenues of $1 billion in the second quarter. The firm's investing and lending activities across various asset classes, primarily including debt securities and loan equity securities, are included in this segment. These activities include both direct investing and investing through funds as well as lending activities.</p>
          <p>Our investment in ICBC produced a $176 million loss in the quarter. Other equity investments generated net revenues of $686 million across our portfolio of funds and direct investments. Net revenues from debt securities and loans were $200 million principally from interest income. Other revenues of $334 million were primarily driven by operating revenues from our consolidated investment equities.</p>
          <p>In investment management, we reported second quarter net revenues of $1.3 billion consist with first quarter results. Management and other fees were 3% higher sequentially at $1.1 billion. During the second quarter, assets under management increased $4 billion to $844 billion due to market appreciation and fixed income assets.</p>
          <p>Turning to expenses, compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of prior-year equity awards and other items such as payroll taxes and benefits, was accrued at a compensation to net revenue ratio of 44% for the second quarter of 2011, a ratio consistent with the compensation accrual in the first quarter. Second quarter non-compensation expenses were $2.5 billion, 6% lower than the first quarter, which included impairment charges of approximately $220 million related to assets classified as held for sale, primarily related to Litton Loan Servicing. Adjusting for the $220 million impairment charge and provisions for litigation, non-compensation expenses in the second quarter of 2011 were essentially unchanged.</p>
          <p>Total staff at the end of the second quarter was approximately 35,500, relatively unchanged from the end of the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 32.6% for the second quarter. As a management team, while we were disappointed in the performance of certain businesses this quarter, we're committed to creating long-term shareholder value. We believe that the core drivers of long-term value continue to be the strength of our global client franchise and our employees' tireless commitment to serving that franchise. While the current environment presents a number of challenges, we continue to invest in expanding our global platform. Our efforts to drive greater efficiencies within our operations are an important component supporting this growth plan.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on generating superior returns for our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased 10.8 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.5 billion. Furthermore, our board of directors has authorized a 75 million share increase in our share repurchase program, bringing our total authorization to approximately 91 million shares.</p>
          <p>In this ongoing challenging environment, we'll continue to balance near-term uncertainties with longer-term strategic goals. We will balance holding more capital liquidity to protect against the current macro uncertainties with our commitment to providing strong relative returns to our shareholders. We'll invest for growth in attractive regions and businesses and reduce our commitment to businesses experiencing lower client demand. This adaptability is at the heart of our culture. While the outlook remains uncertain, we'll continue to respond accordingly with the goal of positioning the firm to best serve our clients and shareholders.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to thank you again for listening today. And I'm now happy to take your questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Nomura.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Glenn.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, if we can talk FICC for a little bit, I think that's where some of the focus is going to obviously come. And if you can give us a little more color towards kind of breaking down what is just bad positioning, bad trading quarter, weak environment versus &#x2013; is there something bigger going on that's impacting the Goldman franchise. Because you talked about lower VAR. So, it sounds like you purposely took down risk. But can we just talk through FICC a little?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I'll try. So, I said a lot of this in what I started with, but let me just give you a little bit more, Glenn. We don't believe there was really any impairment of our franchise at all during the quarter. But I don't want to sugarcoat things. I think we under-performed during the quarter. So, just a little more on that. Every business as I mentioned had positive revenue. So, it's not like there were big losses somewhere. Volumes were lower, but they weren't a lot lower, which is why I tell you that we don't think that there's any impairment of our franchise. We have certain &#x2013; it's harder to figure out volumes in some of the FICC businesses than it is in Investment Banking where you have lead tables, volume numbers. But we have several measures that we use. And I would tell you that they were down but down modestly.</p>
          <p>Given some of the macro uncertainties that we saw, many of which were driven by political rather than economic issues, so they're much harder to analyze certainly for us, we didn't manage the market making inventory that we get as well as we have in the past. That was true across the franchise. It was especially true in Europe and Asia where many of these macro political concerns existed. As a result, we retained very, very little risk. You saw what our VAR numbers were on average across the quarter. And I will tell you at the end of the quarter they were even lower than they were throughout the quarter.</p>
          <p>In hindsight, given the way things unfolded, that may have been a bad decision. It may not have been a bad decision. We don't know and we may not know for a while. But it's a decision that we made. And again given that, we, without sugarcoating, we did under-perform during the quarter. You know it's one of the very, very few quarters since our IPO that we've under-performed in FICC, but we did. We're disappointed in the results. We're glad that it's really nothing to do with our franchise and we're very focused on doing better in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm going to take my head in my hands on this one and ask &#x2013; with risk levels, macro uncertainty still out there in risk, still low at the end of the quarter, are we expected that this is a current environment run rate or do we get a little bit of a reprieve as we move forward from a tough second quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think there's such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I don't think there's anything normal. Look, we're 11 days into this quarter. So, it's very hard to make assumptions on what's going to happen going forward. Let me give you all the caveats. A, it's 11 days; B, it's the third quarter, which includes August every year. You can't avoid it. It will this year. C, there are other things besides our trading business and we have obviously a position &#x2013; ICBC, other principal investments, you've seen what's going on in the equity markets. That's not so good. That comes and goes. But as far as trading goes, while our risks remain quite low right now, it feels a little better so far in the second quarter. Let me again caveat that it's only 11 days into the quarter. But so far it feels a little better.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. The $1.2 billion that you identified earlier in the call, non-comp and comp, can you give us any thought on how much it's weighted toward non-comp and comp? Because I feel like &#x2013; and what is outside the normal managing the ratio to the revenue environment? In other words, it seems like you're identifying that $1.2 billion as an above and beyond reaction to the environment, regulation, things like that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, a couple things. First, just to be clear, that's $1.2 billion of run rate. You're not going to see a $1.2 billion reduction in this year's expenses. A lot of that we'll do this year but you won't see the expenses until next year. Second of all, that does not include, when I say comp and non-comp, that does not include lowering people's compensation. So, that comp would be a reduction of heads, which would therefore be a reduction in compensation. Look, we think that given A, some of the regulatory uncertainties, but, B, some of the economic uncertainties, it looks like the environment's going be somewhat slower for the foreseeable future. And so we decided it made sense at this point to cut some level of expenses to be more efficient.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Appreciate it. And the last one is on Volcker timing. Do you expect the draft in the near future &#x2013; I'm not sure you can comment on your back and forth, but just thoughts on timing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We don't know any more than you know about when things are going to come out. We think that there will be drafts sometime this year, but exactly when we're not sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Howard Chen with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Howard.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just revisiting the cost savings, could you just give a sense for how you arrived at that $1.2 billion target? Does that get you to a specific level of expenses or returns across the franchise that you want to &#x2013; or that you're comfortable with?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would tell you, A, it's more of an art than a science. It was done business by business. We looked at what we thought the opportunity set was going to be going forward where both &#x2013; business by business, region by region. So, it's not &#x2013; while it is somewhat across the board it's not exactly the same everywhere. And we tried to say what do we think the opportunity is going to be and how many people do we need and what do we need to cut back in expenses to have appropriate returns for shareholders.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thanks. And then on this quarter's investing and lending results, fairly positive in a more challenging environment for asset prices. So, could you give us a flavor for maybe realizations versus write-ups this quarter, David?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. I think that's one of the things that really drove the equity number. There were a fair number of realizations within there. The markets were down so obviously the mark-to-market on public securities was actually a negative in the quarter. But on the private securities were up a fair amount. And of what was up, probably 60% was realized.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks. And then finally for me, your share repurchase activity accelerated to $1.5 billion this quarter. Is that more a function of stock price or the approval of the Fed's capital plan last quarter? I'm just trying to gauge looking forward, clearly a strong confident sounding message with respect to the reload, but how aggressive you all want to be in terms of the share repurchase. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We want to do two things: A, as you know we want to keep our share count at least flat. No higher than flat from our equity-based compensation. And we do try and adjust it a little bit based on where we think the share price is. And we have very, very strong capital ratios. We continue to generate capital through earnings as well as through compensation. And so we want to be prudent. We're probably going to keep high-end capital ratios for a while. Higher than most others because we think it makes sense in this market. But we're going to also be prudent in returning capital to shareholders as we think it's okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Just a clarification on that maybe, David. When you say high-end, I know you've given your Basel III guidance without a lot of &#x2013; very conservatively at near 8% last quarter. When you say high-end do you mean kind of near 8% Basel III or are you thinking about a Basel I figure? Or neither?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes and yes. Right now we're under Basel I and so we're going to have to obviously pay attention to that and we will continue to keep as I said, high-end capital ratios, without being more specific. But we're also looking out towards Basel III because we know that's coming.</p>
          <p>Whereas we've told you, we'd be at around 8% if we were looking at it today. If you look out just a couple years before many of the requirements kick in, and you make some assumptions on consensus earnings and just passive mitigation with things just rolling off without us doing anything, you get to like 11%. Close to 11% numbers. And so, those are pretty high-end. I wouldn't expect we'll run things much higher than that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great. Thanks a lot, David.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>You talked a fair amount about the volatility, the results in FICC, particularly I guess in commodities and mortgage. It does seem to be &#x2013; and European credit &#x2013; it does seem to be more than usual. You've always had excellent risk management but I just wonder if after this bout of revenue volatility, you're looking at making any specific changes in the risk management regime.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>No, I wouldn't say so. I don't actually think it was a risk management issue. Like I said, it's not like we had losses. Maybe we made a bad decision in taking too little risk. I don't know. I'm not sure we would do anything differently with hindsight. One of the difficult things for us, if you look across the volatility in the markets, a lot of it was driven by political rather than economic issues. That's an environment that's very hard to analyze, very difficult for us, and so in that type of environment, we took risk down a fair amount and therefore again, not to pull punches, we under-performed.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. So, I hear you. Would you be able to update us a little bit on your exposure to the five European countries everybody's worried about? And maybe a gross and a net number? And talk about how do you hedge down to the net?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can give you now kind of general as opposed to all the specifics you asked for. On a net basis, Guy, our exposure is actually pretty modest. We have, I would say, total for the five that I think you're referring to, between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of exposure. It's really pretty modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of how you get down from whatever the gross number is to the net, obviously the question that people have in the wake of what happened with the mortgage problem here in the U.S. is that sometimes your hedges, not yours in particular, but hedges don't work as well as people would have wanted and you get wrong way risk, counterparties that get into trouble, et cetera. How do you get comfort with where you are on the sovereign stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>How about if we follow up with you on that offline in a little bit?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We'll give you some more detail. But I wouldn't &#x2013; don't take that to mean anything. Our gross exposure is not all that big either. We've been pretty cautious in that region for a while, but the net is really modest.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Fair enough. And then just in terms of head count numbers, as you pointed out, you're flat versus last quarter. You do have some cost reduction targets, but can you give a sense as to what we should expect in terms of the kind of evolution of your head count over the remainder of the year and into next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we sit here now, and, of course, as you know, things can change, the head count reductions that would be associated with that $1.2 billion I talked about would be in the range of 1,000 people globally. And that would come over the course of this year and then we'll see next year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But presumably we could then actually see a little bit of a boost still in the third quarter because of normal recruiting and stuff?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Okay. Just a final question. I think last quarter you helped us understand what the ROE impact was of maintaining the kind of global core excess that you have. Can you give us a sense for what the liquidity drag is at this point?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I actually don't know that number offhand, Guy. I didn't calculate it, but we'll get it to you.</p>

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. How you doing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good. So, just to come back to the capital piece here, in terms of net buyback, and I think you partially answered this, but given that you've got leading capital ratios among your peers, and some of them seem to have authorizations to do more meaningful net buybacks, my question is, is it fair to say that you just haven't asked to do that as opposed to not having been given authorization to do it?</p>
          <p>And also as you roll out to that 11, call it 11 percentage number under Basel III, if your minimum is 9%, would you expect to run at a couple hundred basis point premium to that? Because I thought something like more like a hundred is probably where you'd end up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me answer the second question first, which is no. We would not expect to run at a 200 basis point excess over whatever our minimum is. That would be higher. We would expect to run lower than that. I think you're right. Somewhere in the 100ish basis point range depending on what the minimum is might be where we would be.</p>
          <p>And on the first one, look, without giving too much detail on our conversation with the Fed, we're very comfortable that we have the authorizations we would like to have for the remainder of this year. As you know, the Fed has authorized the capital plan for this year. Next year is next year. We think we can buy back what makes sense for us to buy back over the rest of the course of this year. We will calibrate that based on performance, share price, the environment and a bunch of other things, but I think we'll be reasonable in our buybacks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But then this gets to the other part of the question which is how do you think about running at capital levels, rolling forward to Basel III relevant to the implementation days? Because JPMorgan just said that they'll do that when it's required years from now. It sounds like you're basically there probably at your minimum today or close to it. Would you run at or above the eventual required level as opposed to say buying stock back at one times book today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, look, we will certainly buy some stock back at one times book today. That's going to make sense for us to do in this environment. We will probably want &#x2013; we think the market is going to look at capital requirements and when the capital requirements are known then we're going to expect people to be there pretty quickly. We'll probably get there pretty quickly but that doesn't mean we're going to have to run above it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then two more quick questions. On the hedging that you talked about in terms some of the underperformance in FICC, on the mortgage piece, I thought that the derivatives under-performed &#x2013; went down more than cash kind of during that falloff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I would have thought it would have been a better hedge outcome for you if you assured that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think what you saw really across all credit products was that cash declined more than derivatives.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>

          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just on the &#x2013; you announced the expense initiatives but with the challenging environment kind of going on over a year, you've got fairly challenging capital market conditions, the macro issues, you mentioned them, whether it's Europe, the U.S., economic growth pretty weak. And then the regulatory changes pressuring certain businesses, even some that may otherwise not fall under some of the increased regulation.</p>
          <p>I guess are there any businesses or how long do you wait until &#x2013; instead of just expense initiatives, do you look at any of the businesses that may be better off either being spun off or restructured to compete with some of the pure play, whether it's asset managers, alternative managers, private equity firms, just any sense on that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've talked before. The two businesses we had that we knew we were not going be able to operate under the Volcker rules, those being two prop businesses, GSPS and Global Macro Prop, we've shut those down. There's no other business that we think we have that we won't be able to operate. Some will have to be smaller. Some will have to be different. In our Merchant Banking business we know that we won't be able to have more than 3% equity in any of the private equity funds. We still think that's going be a really good business for Goldman Sachs. We think it's going to be important for our clients to be able to invest alongside of us.</p>
          <p>We think our franchise will still be able to find really good opportunities and we think earning fees in overrides on that will be good for the firm. And so that's probably the next business that will be most affected. So, no, we don't think it will be better in someone else's hands. We're still pretty optimistic about that now, subject to whatever the final rules are. We will continue to evaluate things as the rules come out and if we think differently then we'll take action. But right now we don't think that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then as you've had more time to analyze each business, can you give any update on risk-weighted asset mitigation opportunities there? And then as well as any areas where you have seen or could possibly see re-pricing in the industry to aid returns?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think that we continue to go through the risk mitigation. We still are several years away from any of those things having to happen. And so we're not really going to take actions now because it wouldn't make any sense. But we'll continue to analyze those and take actions that are appropriate and more importantly not do things that are long dated that will have very high risk-weighted asset charges above and beyond what the returns could warrant. I think the only places that you're really seeing re-pricing of things is in tranche credit. Anything that's structured credit, which is the things that are most severely hit by the capital rules. You're seeing some adjustment for pricing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And last one just on the Investing and Lending business. You guys provide that sensitivity in the Q. But do you have any color in terms of the portfolio percent that is public versus private? Just in terms of trying to get a sense in the future. Obviously it's a challenge. But just the portion that's going to be more based on either DCF models and kind of long-term views versus the public markets.</p>

          <p>Hi, Kian.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>A few questions. First of all, the staff number reductions, the net 1,000. Can you give us an idea in what business segment we should think about potential staff reduction? As well as at what level? Is it more at the junior level or more the senior level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm actually glad you asked that question, Kian, because I should have mentioned it before. The reason I mentioned the dollars first is because we're much more focused on the dollars that the savings will create than the number of heads. And so businesses are actually looking to get to a dollar number. That's why gave you a number like in the range of 1,000 heads because it could be somewhat more, could be somewhat less. We're still working through exactly what it's going to be from a seniority level. But it's really more dollar focused than head focused. And so it's going to be &#x2013; the long way of saying it's going to be some more senior, some more junior people.</p>
          <p>As far as businesses, as I said, I'm not going be very specific on which businesses. Not going to be a lot in the growth markets because that continues to be a big strategic thrust for Goldman Sachs. And it is broad based but some businesses more than others.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And switching to revenues. If I look at some of the competitors who have reported FICC revenues, looking at a decline of 20%, 27%. Now in terms of run rate, would you argue that is a reasonable number if you take out your trading related issues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I do not believe there is such a thing as a run rate in FICC. I think it is &#x2013; and we &#x2013; you've heard me say this before, I think it's a very dangerous thing when we had our highest quarter ever in the first quarter of 2009 and people said is this the new run rate? I said no, it's not a run rate.</p>
          <p>When we had our lowest quarter before this quarter in the fourth quarter of last year and now this quarter, I would tell you no, this is not a run rate. I think it is very sensitive to what the economic environment is, what the activity levels are and what our clients are doing. And so I think that there is a run rate is a very dangerous thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But if I take your second quarter numbers and I'm trying to find out what is kind of a clean revenue number, and I look at some of your peers, which are down more around the 25% level relative to the first quarter, and I assume that against your first quarter, wouldn't that be a good reasonable thing to do considering that's reflective of the 16-some market to get an indication of what's kind of clean for you?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you &#x2013; if you're saying is that indication of what a definition of our underperformance in the first quarter, and you can do that analysis and the numbers are right, to say that that's a good way to model going forward, I just think you don't know.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And if I look at your return on equity, 8% in the first half, and it's fair to say that normally the second half revenues are always more difficult than the first half, how should we think about your ROE generation? And can you give us an indication of how we think about the ROE this year in particular considering also the second quarter trading issue?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, first just not to pick over this but in the first half you're correct. It was 8%. But obviously the repayment of the Berkshire Hathaway Preferred was a really unusual thing. Without that, it would have been 10%. I think our normal desire to get to 20%; I think it's going be very tough in this environment, very tough in this year. I'd be surprised if we did that this year. It's very hard for me to target ROEs. Tell me what the economic environment's going be and I can do a better job of telling you what it's going to be. But we just don't know what the economic environment is going be the second half of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, harder to have a lower comp ratio with lower revenues; it tends to go the other way. But as you know and you've seen the last several years, we're very prudent with our compensation. We take the firm's performance into account and if performance is lower, compensation's going to be lower.</p>

          <p>Okay. A lot of discussion has gone on this quarter about how total comp is less variable in the industry than it's ever been. And a lot of that was driven by the salary adjustments post U.K. bonus tax when salaries were re-rated up. Do you think it's possible for the industry then to re-rate those salaries back down?

          <p>Okay. So, I think we shouldn't overplay that first point. I think it is true that salaries have gone up. I know they have at Goldman Sachs, probably other places, too. In the context of the percentage of our compensation that is salaries, it's a minor difference versus what it used to be. So, I think our ability to manage our compensation expense is still quite high.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Look, I think there is actually a fair amount of non-comp that is related to heads. But the second biggest expense after compensation is really a step function expense because it's occupancy. And you have a building or you don't have a building. Most of our buildings are big buildings and so if we cut some heads in New York, that wouldn't cut our occupancy expense. There's lots of other non-comp expenses like travel and telecom and market data and all kinds of things like that that go with head count, but one of the biggest expenses does not.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. My final question is a strategic question around your Asset Management business. It's been fine but it hasn't been a shining star. It would seem now that would be a business that you would gravitate towards maximizing every potential profit opportunity, every potential growth option. What are you doing in that area?</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We continue to invest in the business. We think it is a very important business for Goldman Sachs. We think that within the context of the firm, it has the most stable revenues of the businesses we're in. We think that's important. We think that our client relationships give us great opportunities to gather assets. We think that our Private Wealth business within Asset Management is a really, really important asset gathering business and a really, really important business. So, we think, look, it's one of the few businesses we know. We're not the leader in that business and we have real opportunities to grow it and we're very focused on doing that.</p>

          <p>Okay. Then philosophically, do you view share repurchases as being limited by the amount of earnings that you generate in a period, meaning the buybacks would be less than you generate? Or could you imagine that in a world where your stock price is abnormally low compared to historical trading ranges at tangible book that you would buy back more capital than you earn in a period?</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. If I can just pull the lens back, why did you take so much less risk this quarter? Why did you bring bar in so much? I'm guessing it's due to the economic uncertainty, but was it also due to some of the regulatory uncertainty?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Had nothing at all to do with regulatory uncertainty. It was the economic uncertainty and the difficulty we had in managing the client-driven inventory that we had. And we just thought it was prudent given that uncertainty and the fact that a lot of the uncertainty was caused by political factors that were really in our view beyond analysis caused us to do it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And can you compare or contrast the U.S. versus Europe versus Asia? When you had wider spreads in the U.S. a couple years ago, you benefited. I'm assuming you had some wider spreads in Europe. I just wonder if you benefited from there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of the issue, for us at least, as I said, is that a lot of what was happening in the markets, at least it felt to us were not driven by the underlying economic issues, but by political issues. Markets were moving based on statements. That's very hard for us to analyze, and we found it hard to take advantage of.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

          <p>Is that still the case? Because you say the first few days are going better in the third quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think there's still plenty of that out there. As I said before, our risk remains pretty low. But the performance has been a little bit better. But please remember my caveats about it only being 10 days and things could change.</p>

        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. I think this question's been sort of beaten to death a little bit, and I'm not asking for a long answer, but in terms of the component of the FICC, the lower FICC revenue that you were seeing sort of went above and beyond just the weak customer volume.</p>
          <p>So, maybe beyond that 25% down from the first quarter. Could you give me a little more clarity? I think you were saying on the one hand, we took off risk positions. We took VAR down on purpose. That had an additional negative revenue impact. But were there actual &#x2013; were there some actual inventory positioning losses that you absorbed above and beyond that? Or could you just sort of give a little more color on that lower risk, lower VAR sort of portion of the under-performance or potentially actually taking losses on the trading inventory? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's very hard to quantify. And again, I don't want to sugarcoat this and say, "Oh, you know, no big deal. We just took risk down." We underperformed in the quarter. So, I don't want to sugarcoat it. Now, there were reasons behind it, but we did, and I want to make sure you hear that. We did take risk down during the quarter. Hard to quantify. If we had not taken risk down, what would our results have been? It's very, very hard to quantify because it depends when and what and how. And it's impossible to go back and know that. I've mentioned every business had positive revenues.</p>
          <p>So, it's not &#x2013; that doesn't mean that on any day we didn't have losses. We had loss days. You'll see that in the queue. It doesn't mean that certain positions didn't go the wrong way. They did. But overall when you look over the quarter, every business had positive revenues.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So, David, is it fair to sort of say then that okay, the environment was tougher in that customer volumes were less? That's number one. Number two, Goldman Sachs sort of went above and beyond what other peers did in terms of reducing VAR and reducing their risk position. So, that's number two. But even in the midst of that, did take at least some positioning losses, say in commodities or other areas on inventory because the hedging environment was so difficult; that's number three. Are all those three things fair statements for the reason that the revenue is down versus the first quarter on FICC?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The only thing I'll adjust a tiny bit to what you said, you compared our risk to others' risk. I only know &#x2013; I only really focused on ours. We took ours down. I couldn't say to you we took it down more than others or less than others, but yes, we took ours down. You make that one adjustment; I think everything else you said is correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. I just had a couple of questions. The first thing is I'm just trying to understand the timing on how the shares move and the buyback or how you get obviously new shares for compensation. Is it &#x2013; you're saying you want to keep the shares flat. Does that mean that reduction is just a timing issue so we'll see new shares coming in in the second half? And that was my first question.</p>
          <p>My second question was on risk-weighted assets and your comment that you didn't feel the need to do mitigation now. I'm just wondering what you're feeling about correlation because some of your peers are taking quite a lot of action on their correlation trading books and seeing quite a lot of mitigation. I'm just wondering what your view is there.</p>
          <p>And then lastly, I know we've really talked about FICC a lot, but is there a factor at all or is it relevant that the ABX was so volatile towards the end of the quarter? Does it matter? Do you think there's a factor in terms of how people may have interpreted the pricing towards the end of the quarter or not? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me try and do that, but I may make you repeat your third question. Okay. On share count, shares come in over the course of the year on compensation. I can't remember exactly how many, but over the course of the second quarter, for example &#x2013; we can get back to you, but some number of shares came into share count during the second quarter. Those were part of our calculation of share repurchase during the second quarter.</p>
          <p>The same thing will happen in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter. And it happens throughout the course of the year. So, compensation shares, and we're happy to offline talk to you about how the accounting works on that, come in over the course of the year, and we try and buy back at least that much so that we keep our share count each quarter flat.</p>
          <p>Second, on correlation, that's what I was talking about before with all kinds of structured credit and tranche credit are probably the things that are affected most by the Basel rules. And what I would tell you there is there's just not as much activity there as there has been in the past and we'll be probably less aggressive in doing new trades &#x2013; in doing new trades there. And can you repeat the third question on the ABX?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Could I just come back to that correlation? But some banks seem to be saying they're actually taking action to reduce their business significantly and take away legacy assets just to downsize it in advance.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I'm just wondering about the volatility in the index and whether there's a factor in terms of how one &#x2013; because it moved so quickly, some of the pricing moved so quickly towards the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What I would say just a little differently, I think you saw a pretty precipitous decline in the price of non-agency residential mortgages over the course of June. So, I think the ABX is just an indication of that, but I think you did see prices decline in non-agency mortgages over the course of the latter part of the quarter.</p>

          <p>Good morning, David. Just one final question, hopefully, on the more challenged European economies. In the first &#x2013; at the end of the first quarter according to the regulatory data, you all had what appears to be gross exposure to those five countries at about $10 billion, focused in two of those countries.

        <plist>
          <p>Oh. Sorry. It was less than $100 million. And it was probably 60%-ish, in fact, 40%-ish in equity. Something in that range. It was less than $100 million. It was very small.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>And just pulling the plane up a little bit, do you have any comments related to what the effect on your business might be from a downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit? And some of the comments that Treasury Secretary Geithner made earlier this week seemed to suggest maybe a return to a more adversarial relationship with the financial services sector. I'm just curious as to your thoughts about are we going back to a tougher environment with DC?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>First of all, I'm not going to make a lot of comments on what would happen if there was a downgrade of the U.S. I just hope that it gets resolved and I suspect that at some point it will get resolved. And no, I don't see a tougher environment between financial services and DC. I think the regulatory community is trying to do the right things and get things right and do things that are going to protect the financial system going forward.</p>
