          <p>Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter Results Presentation. This morning our Chief Financial Officer, John Cryan will present our results. After the presentation, we'd be very happy to take your questions.</p>
          <p>Before I hand over to John, I would like to draw your attention to this slide, which contains our statement with regard to forward-looking statements. I'd recommend that you read it carefully. Also, I'd like to point out that Tom Naratil, our Chief Financial Officer Designate, is on the call with us today.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to hand over to John.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Caroline, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to take you through the details of our results for the first quarter of 2011.</p>
          <p>These are the highlights of our performance in the quarter. Our net profit attributable to shareholders of CHF 1.8 billion represents diluted earnings per share of CHF 0.47. At the pre-tax level, we made CHF 2.2 billion after taking a charge of CHF 133 million from the tightening of our credit spreads on our financial liabilities measured at fair value.</p>
          <p>The improvement over the last quarter of 2010 is largely attributable to the performance of the Investment Bank. It reported a pre-tax profit at just under CHF 1 billion, excluding own credit charges. All of our business divisions made a positive profit contribution.</p>
          <p>We saw better net new money inflows of over the CHF 20 billion across the group, half of which were from Wealth Management clients outside of the Americas. Wealth Management saw an improvement in its gross margin, earning 98 basis points on its average invested assets.</p>
          <p>Our Wealth Management operation in the Americas also reported much improved results with good net new money flows and a pre-tax profit of CHF 111 million.</p>
          <p>I would characterize the overall performance of our businesses in the quarter as somewhat mixed with some pleasing performances and a few disappointments. And we still have some way to go to meet our own aspirations for profitability. However, our results are much improved over the rather lackluster performance of the group, and in particular of the IB, in the latter half of 2010.</p>
          <p>I'll cover the divisional results in more detail later, but first I want to comment on the tax line and on the attribution of profits to holders of our Trust Preferreds. The net tax charge for the quarter was CHF 426 million, implying an effective tax rate of 19%. As usual, there were a number of components of the tax charge.</p>
          <p>It was primarily driven by the expense of amortizing the Swiss deferred tax assets held against capital losses brought forward in an amount calibrated to match the first quarter taxable profits of UBS AG. These were assessed under Swiss GAAP and are estimated to be CHF 1.2 billion. The amount of the DTA amortization for the 21% effective tax rate was CHF 332 million.</p>
          <p>We also took a charge of CHF 116 million for the amortization of the U.S. deferred tax asset. This amount was calculated to match the taxable profits arising in the U.S. from our own operations and those of the SNB StabFund, which are taxable in the hands of UBS under an agreement with the IRS. There was an additional deferred tax asset of CHF 74 million created through the P&amp;L in Switzerland in respect to the small write-down of UBS Americas Inc. in the books of UBS AG.</p>
          <p>We released CHF 93 million of tax provisions previously held against open tax accounts that were resolved in the quarter. And finally, we took a current tax charge for corporate income and state taxes arising in certain non-Swiss entities of CHF 145 million.</p>
          <p>There was no allocation of profits to non-owner equity, i.e. to the holders of our Trust Preferred hybrid capital Tier 1 capital instruments, in the quarter. No event occurred in the quarter to trigger dividend obligations on our Trust Preferreds. And no dividend was paid that had not previously been accrued.</p>
          <p>In Q2 this year, we expect to allocate profit of around CHF 200 million to holders of our Trust Preferreds, representing dividends due in the quarter and not previously accrued. We also intend to seek approval from FINMA to call a $500 million instrument in June, which might also trigger the allocation of further amounts.</p>
          <p>Group head count in the quarter rose by 779, reflecting active hiring across the board, and particularly in Wealth Management.</p>
          <p>The net profit attributable to shareholders rose CHF 144 million quarter-on-quarter. Operating revenues improved significantly by CHF 660 million before own credit. The own credit line was CHF 376 million better, reflecting continued tightening of our senior unsecured debt curve, albeit to a lesser extent than in the prior quarter. We also saw a marked quarter-on-quarter improvement in credit loss expense.</p>
          <p>Non-personnel expenses improved 21% quarter-on-quarter. This is reflective of a number of factors. Litigation and regulatory provisions that significantly affected our results in the fourth quarter were CHF 163 million lower in Q1. We spent less on marketing and on our brand campaign, and we incurred lower run-the-bank IT costs. Finally, we were assisted by the weakness of the U.S. dollar against our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>Reported personnel expenses were CHF 630 million higher in Q1 than in the prior quarter. This reflected three principal factors. The first was an increase in bonus accruals, reflecting improved operating performance, and particularly low bonus accruals in the fourth quarter. Second, the month of March was impacted by the salary increases we instituted at year-end. Subsequent quarters will carry the full impact of the increases. Third, we incurred an overall charge of CHF 81 million in the Investment Bank for severance costs and related items.</p>
          <p>Personnel costs included a bonus-related charge of CHF 1.2 billion, of which CHF 467 million was in relation to bonus awards granted in respect of prior performance periods. Taken together with the salary increases that impacted the month of March and excluding the modest severance costs incurred by the IB, the overall effective non-discretionary personnel cost for the quarter rose to CHF 3.5 billion.</p>
          <p>Before I move on to the divisions, I thought it might be helpful to cover briefly some of the enhancements to our quarterly disclosures that we are introducing this time around. For both of our Wealth Management divisions, we're replacing the rudimentary split of income between recurring and nonrecurring with a more detailed analysis that we think will provide investors with a better basis for understanding the drivers of the performance of these divisions. We're also introducing information on loans and customer deposits to help you understand the interest result.</p>
          <p>In the IB, we've reverted to our pre-crisis practice of using a prior year quarterly comparator as the primary basis for explaining the division's performance, rather than using the preceding quarter. This brings us back into line with the majority of our competitors and reflects the seasonality of some of the IB's businesses. In the other divisions and at the group level, we will continue to use the prior quarter as the primary comparator, given that the balance of invested assets is an important driver of revenues. For all divisions, we will continue to provide detailed prior quarter and prior year quarter comparative data, and each division's MD&amp;A will continue to contain commentary on both bases.</p>
          <p>In the IB, we've reorganized the commodities businesses, so that they all sit within FICC. Previously, we managed our commodities index and some other minor related businesses in equities. For Q1 and in future, revenues from all commodities businesses will be included under the segment FICC Other, apart from those from precious metals trading, which will continue to be included in Macro.</p>
          <p>Also in the IB, it's our practice to charge our front office operations a market rate for extending credit to clients. We call this charge the Risk Management Premium, or RMP. In the past, where we took credit or related risks in the furtherance of our primary capital markets business, the securities trading operations picked up a share of the RMP, whereas any revenues from primary issuance were recorded in IBD. To align costs with revenues, in Q1 and in future, we will charge IBD with the full RMP.</p>
          <p>Some time ago, I led the charge on dispensing with the section of our quarterly reports that contained management's discussion and analysis of the results of the Corporate Center. Instead, we covered material items in the group MD&amp;A section.</p>
          <p>On reflection, I consider this not to have been an improvement. So, we've now reintroduced the separate section on the Corporate Center. Finally, we've introduced a separate analysis of our litigation and other related provisions in the quarterly report.</p>
          <p>So, moving on to the divisions, Wealth Management's revenues increased 7% on the back of a greater degree of client activity and higher net interest income. Costs fell 4%, in part because of the accrued charge we took in Q4 for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by the Swiss Government in assistance with the U.S. cross-border matter, and because of lower litigation provisions.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows improved as gross outflows continue to stabilize. All regions by Europe recorded net inflows.</p>
          <p>Revenues improved quarter-on-quarter in all reported categories. Net interest income increased 10%. This includes the effect of the steps we took in the autumn to boost interest returns.</p>
          <p>Management and portfolio fees improved slightly as a result of price improvements. Transaction fees continue to improve strongly, as did trading revenues, which in Wealth Management almost all derive from FX transactions.</p>
          <p>We saw a further recovery in gross margin in the first quarter to 98 basis points per annum. The improvement was across all revenue categories with a strong contribution from transaction fees.</p>
          <p>The increase in interest margin was partly attributable to an increase in lending. We remain focused on improving margins to 100 basis points or better over the course of the year.</p>
          <p>This is the regional breakdown of the balance of CHF 791 billion of invested assets at the end of the first quarter, together with the respective net new money flows. The breakdown is done on the basis of client domicile.</p>
          <p>Europe, overall, saw marginally net negative flows, though a number of markets performed well. We continue to be disciplined in our efforts to win net new money and remain focused on delivering higher returns on invested assets, both for our clients and for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>The Retail and Corporate segment continued to perform steadily. Net interest income remains under pressure, notwithstanding the actions we took in the autumn last year to alleviate the pressure on the interest margins from the continuing flat yield curve in Swiss Francs.</p>
          <p>The fourth quarter's interest result was affected by a one-off receipt of swap unwind revenues on a third party mortgage portfolio. The CHF 590 million of net interest income in Q1 is now more representative of the base level we're presently earning on our deposits and mortgages.</p>
          <p>The cost / income ratio for the quarter rose to 58% from 55% in the prior quarter on lower revenues and slightly higher expenses.</p>
          <p>R&amp;C's loan portfolio continues to perform very well. There were no material credit losses incurred in the quarter. Some 70% of the loan portfolio is secured by residential mortgages in Switzerland, and a further 19% is secured by commercial mortgages or by marketable securities. And the residential mortgages portfolio has essentially been problem-free from a credit perspective for many years.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Wealth Management Americas were up to 2% quarter-on-quarter in dollar terms, but down a similar proportion in Swiss francs. The CHF 143 million improvement on Q4 at the pre-tax profit level, was mainly driven by the significant decline in operating expenses of 12% quarter-on-quarter. This, in turn, was primarily driven by lower litigation and regulatory provisions.</p>
          <p>Personnel expenses rose in dollars, reflecting higher amounts of grid-based compensation for FAs, partly offset by slightly lower bonus accruals. The number of financial advisors increased once again slightly in the quarter. Attrition rates, especially for the most productive advisors, are now running at pleasingly low levels.</p>
          <p>Net new money inflows on the Swiss convention were CHF 3.6 billion, a slight improvement on Q4. When dividend and interest income are included, net new money inflows were CHF 7.8 billion in quarter. Net new money gains were primarily driven by improvements in share of client wallet, although we continue to hire new advisors, but only on a strictly disciplined basis.</p>
          <p>Invested assets ended the quarter at CHF 700 billion, CHF 11 billion higher than at the start of the quarter. This increase was mainly attributable to strong market performance, which added CHF 21 billion and to the net new money. The depreciation of the dollar over the period took CHF 13 billion off the balance in Swiss Franc terms.</p>
          <p>This is the new breakdown of divisional operating income, showing for Q1 and for each quarter in 2010 in Swiss francs and in U.S. dollars. Income has risen fairly steadily over the past year in dollar terms, but the improvement is not as visible in our reported Swiss franc numbers.</p>
          <p>We've made particularly pleasing progress in improving client-based fee and commission income. Net interest income has also improved in local currency terms, though this is an area where we feel there is scope to make further progress as we develop our secured lending business. The annualized gross margin in Swiss francs deteriorated by two basis points to 78 basis points. This was partly attributable to the one-quarter lag in the majority of asset-based fee pricing.</p>
          <p>This slide presents two of the measures we use to track the productivity of our financial advisors. You can see the steady improvement in local currency terms of revenues per advisor. Despite our progress, we still lag the industry leader on this metric, largely, we believe, because of weak revenues from certain credit products, most specifically mortgages for our clients. We've taken steps to address this weakness and expect our efforts to bear fruit in the coming quarters. In terms of invested assets per advisor, we're the industry leader reflecting in part the focus of our business on the high and ultra-high net worth segments.</p>
          <p>Revenues in Global Asset Management fell 8% on the fourth quarter, which had seen a better contribution from performance fees. We also saw management fees fall quarter-on-quarter, especially in A&amp;Q, Global Real Estate and in the Fund Services operations. Personnel expenses fell by CHF 14 million, partly driven by the effect of the performance fee sharing arrangements in A&amp;Q. Net new money inflows were CHF 5.6 billion and excluding volatile money market flows, net new money was CHF 7.2 billion, which was a strong performance.</p>
          <p>Invested assets rose by CHF 10 billion to CHF 569 billion as negative currency effects were more than offset by positive market performance and net new money. The overall gross margin for Q1 fell back by four basis &#x2013; by four points to 35 basis points per annum.</p>
          <p>In Fund Services, we saw net inflows of CHF 8.3 billion. Assets under administration were CHF 403 billion at quarter end.</p>
          <p>The Investment Bank reported a better result than in the previous quarter. And the improvement was driven by much better revenues in the securities trading businesses following the poor trading environment in the latter half of 2010. Compared with the first quarter of last year, however, operating revenues excluding own credit were down CHF 558 million despite an improvement in equities trading revenues.</p>
          <p>Pre-tax profit, excluding own credit, in the first quarter was CHF 967 million, a decline of 33% on the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>Revenues in equities improved slightly on the first quarter of 2010 with better performances in cash and prime services. Derivatives revenues fell 6% period on period, despite the pick-up in trading in Asia Pacific. The derivatives result in the first quarter this year excludes for the first time the effect of transferring to FICC, the commodities index business.</p>
          <p>Prime brokerage revenues increased year-on-year. More than all of the increase was attributable to higher client balances, because over the year, we've seen spread contraction. Exchange traded derivatives revenues fell on the first quarter of 2010 because of lower volumes and tighter spreads.</p>
          <p>And the combined revenues from credit, macro and emerging markets fell 8% on the same period in 2010. The rates business declined as market uncertainty kept volatility high, but reduced liquidity. This impacted both our short-term interest rate, as well as our long-term derivative and government bond activities.</p>
          <p>In FX, revenues decreased marginally as client activity levels were lower than they had been a year ago. Revenues in credit increased by a third on those at the first quarter last year. After two sluggish quarters in the latter half of 2010, we saw good client flow trading volumes.</p>
          <p>Good revenue opportunities also presented themselves in the structured credit markets in Europe and in the U.S.A. Although the revenues from credit trading came at the cost of some increase in risk taking, we were nevertheless pleased with the overall performance of this business.</p>
          <p>The emerging markets businesses had a slightly weaker quarter than in the opening quarter of 2010, but were much improved than the second half of that year. We continue to believe that our emerging markets businesses have more potential than they have demonstrated recently.</p>
          <p>Other FICC revenues were CHF 50 million. The main contributors to this were our commodities trading desks, including the index businesses moved in from equities. Unlike in the first quarter of 2010, our legacy trading positions had a relatively small net effect on the results of the quarter. The balance of the other revenues included a CHF 38 million negative impact from DVA on uncollateralized negative replacement values.</p>
          <p>Client revenues in IBD in the first quarter were CHF 660 million, down marginally on the first quarter of 2010. Advisory revenues were up 31% year-on-year, as we notched up strong market share gains.</p>
          <p>The picture in Capital Markets was as rosy. In Fixed Income Capital Markets, revenues were flat largely because of higher fees from our global syndicated finance desks, though we've lost some market share in DCM.</p>
          <p>Equity Capital Markets overall had a poor quarter, though its performance in Asia Pacific was more satisfactory.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, beginning this quarter we are allocating all of the hedging costs associated with the extension of credit to clients of the advisory and primary capital markets businesses to IBD. Previously, a proportion of these had been retained by the securities trading operations, even though the revenues were recorded wholly in Investment Banking.</p>
          <p>The pre-tax result of the Corporate Centre of a profit of CHF 116 million was largely driven by the fair market valuation through the P&amp;L of the positive replacement value, representing our option to acquire the SNB StabFund.</p>
          <p>The fair value gain in the quarter was CHF 192 million, bringing the replacement value on balance sheet to a total of CHF 1.9 billion. We run a lean model for the Corporate Centre, with the vast majority of its costs charged back to the operating divisions. This philosophy also extends to the majority of the revenues generated by our group treasury function on behalf of the divisions.</p>
          <p>We do, however, retain in the Corporate Center the results of the FX sell down process, by which we convert operating revenues and expenses back into Swiss francs. Our policy is to purchase options to hedge our foreign currency cash flows from adverse exchange rate movements.</p>
          <p>The option premium cost is retained at Corporate Center. And this is the main driver of the retained group treasury result. Operating expenses are generally charged back to the divisions, save for a modest amount, reflecting central corporate overhead. This amounted to CHF 46 million in Q1.</p>
          <p>Our Tier 1 capital ratio on a Basel 2 basis was 17.9% at the end of the March, on risk-weighted assets of CHF 203 billion. We increased our core Tier 1 capital in the first quarter by CHF 1.4 billion, to CHF 31.8 billion. At quarter end, it represented 15.6% of our Basel 2 risk-weighted assets.</p>
          <p>As it is our intention to request approval from FINMA to call for redemption the $500 million hybrid Tier 1 instrument that becomes eligible for redemption on the 26th of June this year, we reserved for the full amount of the instrument in our regulatory capital account. Our capital ratios, therefore, already reflect redemption of the hybrid instrument, even though at present we've not yet received the necessary regulatory approvals.</p>
          <p>On the 1st of January this year, FINMA adopted the Basel 2.5 convention for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital, one year earlier than that stipulated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Accordingly, we are now &#x2013; already regulated under this regime and are required to report to FINMA on the Basel 2.5 basis.</p>
          <p>And largely as a result of the incremental risk charge and the incorporation of stress-loss factors into regulatory VaR, the Basel 2.5 risk-weighted assets at the end of March were CHF 279 billion, CHF 76 billion higher than under the Basel 2 basis. In addition, under Basel 2.5, there was an incremental Tier 1 capital deduction for certain of the low rated securitized securities we hold. At the end of Q1, this was CHF 1.2 billion. Our pro forma Basel 2.5 Tier 1 capital was, therefore, CHF 35.2 billion or 12.6% of risk-weighted assets on that basis.</p>
          <p>This slide shows the movements in book equity during the quarter under IFRS. We saw negative movements across all of our OCI accounts. The foreign currency translation account was mainly impacted by the fall in the value of the dollar against our reporting currency.</p>
          <p>Our portfolio of U.S. and U.K. government bonds held available-for-sale was primarily affected by rising long-term interest rates in local currencies. The portfolio of fixed receiver swaps that we predominantly use to manage interest rate risk on our deposits in Wealth Management in Swiss Bank, and for which we obtain effective hedge accounting treatment, was adversely affected by a continued steepening of the yield curve in euros and U.S. dollars in the quarter. This further reduced the replacement values of those swaps and the change deferred in our equity account through OCI.</p>
          <p>Our share premium account was debited in the quarter by a net amount of CHF 1.15 billion, reflecting the cost of acquiring shares in the market to meet actual delivery obligations under share-based compensation plans.</p>
          <p>The increase in equity attributable to non-controlling interests was predominantly caused by the slight appreciation of the euro against the Swiss franc in the quarter. And then notwithstanding the net profit of CHF 1.8 billion generated in the quarter, our book equity attributable to shareholders barely changed.</p>
          <p>At quarter end, our book value per share was CHF 12.28, and our tangible book value per share was CHF 9.74. That concludes my presentation of the first quarter results, and I'd now be pleased to take your questions.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>The first question is from Mr. Jon Peace, Nomura. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. Just two quick questions, please. Firstly, in Wealth Management, how much of the increase in inflows in the first quarter and the increase in the gross margin was due to seasonal rather than sustainable factors? I mean I know you'd like to get to these numbers in the medium-term, but should we see 5.8% net new money and 98 basis points as a gross margin as the run rate going into the second quarter in the second half?</p>
          <p>The second question is just on the group ROE goal of 15% to 20%. You're obviously in the range in the first quarter, but with many peers lowering their numbers, do you still see this is a sustainable target given your business mix, and then the interplay between rising profitability, but also rising capital requirements? Thanks</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Jon. On the inflows in Wealth Management, I've never been able to convince myself that there is much seasonality in inflows in Wealth Management. I think there are periods of relatively subdued client activity, but the client activity doesn't necessarily map directly to inflows or outflows. Much of it is transacting within the invested asset base.</p>
          <p>So it's difficult to give you a precise view from management as to whether there was much seasonality. I do suspect that the month of January reflects some pent-up activity that just doesn't happen in December, which is generally very quiet. So, it may be that the run rate you saw in the first quarter is not one that you necessarily need to extrapolate. But I'd add a major proviso to that, which is it's always very difficult to extrapolate anything that relates to client activity levels.</p>
          <p>So on the sustainable rate, I think we just adhere to our view, which we expressed at the end of last year, which is we think that this year will be the year in which we start to see more sustainable inflows. They will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, but we do feel that a lot of the factors that were driving the gross outflows are now substantially behind us. And so we would expect, although it will be fluctuating, just generally to see net inflows from now on in.</p>
          <p>On the ROE target, the 15% to 20% range has been our range now for some time. In the first quarter last year, I think we exceeded it, in fact. And I said at the time, it was easier to exceed when we had relatively low equity levels. I can't use that excuse this time, because the equity didn't really go up. But it was easier to make 20% a while ago when we were less well capitalized than we are today. That's still the range, although I suspect given current rating performance, particularly in the light of the first quarter, we're more likely to see something at the 15% end rather than the 20% end, but it's difficult to gauge. The equity balance we hope to go up. That is obviously our goal and therefore, it does make it more difficult to generate returns on that equity base.</p>
          <p>I probably should have mentioned, because it's mentioned in our quarterly report, we've effectively capped the risk weighted assets under the Basel 2.5 metric. And that will, at least for a temporary period while we are catching up with our regulatory capital balance &#x2013; that will put a little dampener on the returns that we're able to generate on the equity. But I still adhere to that sort of range, but for the next quarter or two, it might be towards the bottom end of the range rather than the top. But you never know.</p>

          <p>Good morning. John, actually, I was just actually going to ask that &#x2013; on that &#x2013; this comment about the RWAs. AS you sort of respond to the different regulations, could you share with us any, sort of, shifts in your thinking about the right strategy for the Investment Bank? Do certain products get emphasized, some get deemphasized and what might the potential impact on RoE be? Thanks.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Huw. Yeah, I have categorized this self-imposed cap on RWAs. And what we've done is we've effectively said to the IB that we'd like to keep the group RWAs at a level that was commensurate with the level in the first quarter, so around about CHF 280 billion on the Basel 2.5 metric.</p>
          <p>And then &#x2013; and I liken that to our discipline on dividend, the fact we're not paying dividend, are both geared to remediating this situation where although we're reporting capital ratios, which are at the top end of the league table, we are still some way short of where the regulators and where we want our capital ratios to be. So, they're much part of the same strategy.</p>
          <p>This affects the IB because the transition from Basel 2 to Basel 2.5 really only impacts the trading businesses. And the idea was really to assist the IB in some respects. In the transition from risk managing its business on a Basel 2 basis, which is what it's done hitherto, to risk managing it on a Basel 2.5 basis this year &#x2013; because already this year, as I said, we're already under that regime with the FINMA, and that does change the types of business that we might emphasize or de-emphasize within the IB. So just that change alone will see some behavioral change in the IB. And to ensure that that's achieved, a temporary cap on risk-weighted assets has been imposed.</p>
          <p>More generally, you're right. We've actually added a sidebar, which extends to a whole page in the quarterly report. It's on page 17 for those of you who want to read through it. And much of what it does is it simply contains a summary of the events that have taken place to date in Switzerland, in the U.K. and the U.S. predominantly, in terms of regulatory change. And it makes a couple of statements. They're really just in the last two paragraphs.</p>
          <p>The first is that it says that as a consequence of these changes, or proposed changes, we are having to look at what I could describe as the strategy of the business. It's more actually the tactical implementation of the strategy. But it does go to which sort of lines of business we emphasize and de-emphasize. And most of this impacts the IB because most of the regulatory changes &#x2013; and we're here talking mainly about the capital changes rather than funding and liquidity. Most of those impact the trading operations, as opposed to the banking book.</p>
          <p>So we're having to look at the sustainability, profitability and, therefore, viability of certain product types and business lines, where the determinant will really be the elasticity of pricing and the capacity of the market to absorb increased pricing because the cost of writing those products goes up, because the cost of capital, regulatory capital, goes up because of the changes.</p>
          <p>And it's that price times volume equation which we're still gripping with as the market absorbs these new changes. So I don't think we've drawn any conclusions, particularly yet, although there are clearly some products which are being targeted by the regulatory change. And most of those impact the FICC businesses. So although it's too early to say what the impact will be, we're doing a lot of analysis to determine to what extent we might have to change the product mix a bit or emphasize and de-emphasize products to respond to these changes.</p>
          <p>The second point we make, which is allied to that, is a point we make about our organizational structure and our booking model. It's a bigger issue, and it relates less to the imposition of the new capital regime, but more to the resolution regimes that are coming in all of the major countries in which we operate. And there, I think, we do need to look at the booking model. And that will, in turn, impact to a degree the viability of some of our product types. So there's a lot of change, potentially, afoot, but it's too early at this stage, I think, to say anything definitive about what impact it would have on us.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Kinner Lakhani of Citi. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Good morning. Yeah, three questions, actually. Firstly on FICC, when I start to look at the product mix, there seem to be some quite important differences relative to your historic target. So credit trading making about CHF 1 billion this quarter. Historically, I think you've suggested about CHF 0.4 billion per quarter. And in contrast to that, global macro making, let's say, less than half of the original ambitions, which I think were around CHF 1.3 billion, CHF 1.4 billion, actually. So, your thoughts on sustainability of credit trading and where global macro can go from here.</p>
          <p>Secondly, on Wealth Management, given you've achieved the 98 basis points of revenue margin, clearly in an ultra-low interest environment, is the 100 basis points too conservative? And related to that, have you seen any early results from the investment products and services business?</p>
          <p>And finally, just in terms of the regulatory side, has the debate shifted any further in Switzerland on the too-big-to-fail, particularly around the legal structure and subsidiarisation? So, are we likely to see a kind of firm shift toward subsidiarisation? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. You're absolutely right on the fixed income breakdown. I think the numbers we originally gave was credit was around about half a billion, and it's out-gunned itself. Macro, I think it's fair to say, has been a bit of a disappointment recently. We were looking for a billion &#x2013; north of a billion now. And macro is a number of businesses. And I think it's equally fair to say that in the quarter none of them was firing on all cylinders. The big businesses are the big interest rate swap book, the linear swap book, which I think had something of a lackluster quarter, particularly compared with the comparator quarter last year. And there's the short-term interest rates business, which was also a little bit down in the doldrums.</p>
          <p>ForEx was down a little bit. It wasn't too bad, but it was down a little bit on the prior quarter last year. And then in non-linear, we haven't been aggressively engaged in the more complex exotic options arena recently. But in non-linear, actually we saw an improvement on recent quarters in the first quarter. So it's a bit of a mishmash, but generally, the performance there has been a little bit disappointing, it's fair to say. And we do aspire for that business to do better.</p>
          <p>Emerging markets is the missing link. And as I said in the formal comments, we do think that that business can improve, and we think there's plenty of room for improvement there. So we would &#x2013; we do see scope for some upside in fixed income. But at the moment, credit is the one that's performing exceptionally well.</p>
          <p>On the margin in Wealth Management, as to whether 100 basis points is too conservative, if I were to say yes, I'd have lots of people within the Wealth Management division jumping up and down. And if I were to say no, I think the boss might think that I was being a little too kind to them. He's already set the bar to something north of 100 basis points. So let's leave it at 100 for the time being. So not quite there yet, and see what it's like only when we get there, but I think the target's now in excess of 100, but we're not saying by how much.</p>
          <p>And as for the contribution from IPS, I think it's difficult to say. It's more of a service function within Wealth Management, so it's all really in the mix, but it must have been part of the contribution to what I hope is a slightly more sustainable level of return on invested assets.</p>
          <p>On the legal structure, as I said earlier in response to Huw's question, there isn't really anything we can say that's definitive at the moment. You'll be aware, as well as I, of the developments, in particular in relation to resolution. For us, that's particularly an issue in Switzerland and in the U.K. For those of you not familiar with our booking model, very briefly, our listed entity, UBS AG, is the bank. There's no holding company on top. And our practice is to book all business to the extent we can, and to the extent law and regulatory rules permit, in the bank. And we try wherever possible around the world to operate out of branches of the bank.</p>
          <p>And our biggest booking center, by quite some way &#x2013; in fact, is the vast majority of the Investment Bank and the majority of the balance sheet for much of the past four or five years &#x2013; has been the London Branch of UBS AG, where we operate a remote booking model. And we tend to book, for example, virtually all of our derivatives business into London from around the world. And that obviously makes a resolution plan a little more complex than it would be if you had individual subsidiaries.</p>
          <p>So there I think we would be relatively agnostic as to the legal structure of the group. Going from one structure to another could be quite painful. So there's an awful lot of thought going into it. It gets an appropriate level of attention from the board and senior management, to big working teams and task forces set up with all the subject matter experts within the bank.</p>
          <p>But at the moment, it's much too early to say what impact it could have on us. Not least, I think it's fair to say, because all the rules are not yet written. And it would be premature to come up with a solution before we know all the terms of engagement. So, I'm afraid that one will have to wait, but it is something on which we're working and on which, in that sidebar that I described earlier, we've begun to discuss within our quarterly reports.</p>

          <p>The next question is from Mr. Kian Abouhossein, J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. I got two questions, coming back to what Kinner indicated, the fixed income line, CHF 1.8 billion. Can you talk about more &#x2013; not so much from this quarter perspective, but what are you doing to close this gap? I mean you have an CHF 8 billion target. To get there, you should make more like CHF 2.5 billion to CHF 3 billion, at worst number of your peers so far. And put that in context of the comp, because still &#x2013; you're still hiring people in the IB, numbers up yet again.</p>
          <p>And at the same time, you're reviewing the numbers on a return on equity basis. So, I'm just trying to square things of revenue generation against comp against hiring against review. And if we don't look at this quarter, but we look a little bit forward, or what the issues are.</p>
          <p>And then the second question is regarding this bridge bank idea that came out of the systemic risk report. I'm trying to understand, do you have to create a bridge bank before you go into tail risk default scenario, or do you actually have to do it at that time? What does it mean in terms of capital allocation? And what businesses are likely to be captured in this bridge bank?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Two very different questions. On fixed income, if we look at the performance of our fixed income division overall, in first quarter last year and the first quarter this year, there's an argument that says that the performance in the first quarter this year is actually materially better than it was last year. And I say that for a couple of reasons. Although the revenues &#x2013; the reported revenues last year were higher, when you look at the breakdown of that, there was over CHF 110 million of a credit loss recovery, and there was about CHF 250 million which was a credit to the trading line from the tightening in that quarter of the monoline spreads.</p>
          <p>And so the contribution, I think, from the legacy positioned in the first quarter last year, which are obviously not really recurring, was relatively high, whereas in the first quarter this year, there was essentially none. Certainly, on the net basis it might actually have been a small debit. It certainly wasn't materially positive. And so there is a degree to which the revenues this quarter were harder earned.</p>
          <p>The next point I'd make is that &#x2013; and this is not an excuse, but I think it's instructive in explaining the performance, particularly the Investment Bank and the Wealth Management Americas. Both of those businesses are very highly geared to the U.S. dollar. And first quarter-on-first quarter, on an average basis, the dollar has declined against the Swiss franc by 15%. And so in dollars we made over $1.9 billion in the first quarter this year, and we didn't make an awful lot more than $1.9 billion in the first quarter last year. And embedded within that were quite a few contributions from one-off recoveries from the crisis.</p>
          <p>So there's a degree to which, notwithstanding the fact that we've hired more people, we have &#x2013; remember also, had a little round of redundancies in the IB in the first quarter. But we have hired more people, a lot of the hires in the first quarter this year were in the control functions in the back office, as we ensure that what happened before doesn't happen again.</p>
          <p>So there's a degree to which we're catching up on the logistics and control functions, but I agree with you that CHF 1.8 billion, the CHF 2 billion mark needs to be more sustainable because the business and its operating leverage is geared towards revenue levels of CHF 8 billion or so per annum in the fixed income division and not CHF 5 billion or CHF 6 billion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to &#x2013; just to, John, just to follow up on that, it's more about the CHF 556 million. What is not going right in the CHF 556 million, which should be more like two-thirds of your revenues if you compare that with peers? And secondly, is it geographic issue, is it a business mix issue, is it people? And you mentioned the dollar impact, but your cost / income should also improve because I assume your dollar cost base in the U.S., in the percentage of your revenues, is higher than your outside dollar cost base. So I would think actually your comp ratio would improve.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, there's certainly a case that the expenses are in dollars, but I was more comparing the revenues. The CHF 556 million, I freely admit is a disappointing result from a very big business. It uses a lot of balance sheet, huge replacement values from the interest rate swap books. And they basically have not &#x2013; they've not generated an attractive return.</p>
          <p>A lot of this business is in-force business. It's been on the balance sheet for some time. There has been some new business, but the new business has to paddle very hard to change the course of a substantial contribution from the balance sheet, which is not very high. None of that's an excuse, the business has certainly underperformed. And it would be impossible not to argue that &#x2013; that it must be an issue with people, because it cannot be an issue with capital or risk appetite, or balance sheet utilization, because there is plenty of all of that.</p>
          <p>So it must be, to an extent, people, it must be trading strategies, and it must be the way that we execute the business. So we are working on it. It's below our expectations, it's well below our targets. And it wasn't a very satisfactory performance in the quarter. It has shown that it can do better than that. It made CHF 922 million in the first quarter last year. So year-on-year, it's a poor performance, it's improved over the last two quarters of last year, but it's still not meeting our expectations.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And should we assume that the comp at CHF 54 million, or CHF 52 million, clean I think, is kind of a run rate level for the year assuming these kind of revenues?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know. It won't be too far away from where it earned up. But I think, if we look at our &#x2013; it's early days, it's very difficult to draw any conclusions from the first quarter results announcement. It looks a little on the high side, I think you'd probably tell us. So, it's difficult to gauge. What we want to make it is performance related. And so we need to see some performance before we can relate it.</p>
          <p>You asked a separate question on the bridge bank. And I'm afraid I'm really not the right person to answer some of the questions on the bridge bank because I'm not sure I understand it either.</p>
          <p>My instinct tells me it has to be set up before anything goes wrong, because this concept of rescuing a bank by executing a number of complex M&amp;A transactions in the context of the weak end in which banks get into trouble, strikes me as being at odds with the real world.</p>
          <p>So I imagine the concept must be to establish it beforehand, if indeed we were ever to be asked to go down in that path. We haven't been asked to go down in that path yet. So, I can't really comment on capital allocation, although there are some clues from the expert commission report on the types of businesses that would be systemically relevant, and therefore, candidates for inclusion in the bridge bank. And in Switzerland, for example, they would be the deposit business, certainly the Swiss franc deposit business from Swiss clients in Switzerland.</p>
          <p>I think the SME lending business is normally considered to be systemically relevant. I think undoubtedly the payment system, and in particular the Swiss franc payment system, something of the order of 40% or so of all Swiss franc payments go across our system. So that's certainly systemically relevant. And then question mark about the local mortgage business. So that local mortgage business is included in &#x2013; frankly, that's effectively the Retail and Corporate bank within UBS. So on that basis, the capital allocation will be something in line with what we already allocate to that bank. But if it's to stand alone as opposed to being part of Wealth Management and Swiss Bank, then arguably the capital allocation needs to go up to reflect its more standalone nature.</p>
          <p>But I think that's about the extent of my ability to comment on the bridge bank, because it's not a concept that I'm particularly familiar with, nor one which instinctively works unless it's set up beforehand.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a follow-up on the regulatory issues, and on page 17, you indicate there might be a relief on the 6% systemic surcharge. Can you discuss that a bit? And when should we know if this is going to be the case? Because you're putting it in writing, which indicates to me that this is probable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It shouldn't. The word "might" just means might, and it might not either. It's been dangled as a possibility that some rebate of the 6% surcharge might be forthcoming, if the resolution plan operates to the extent of limiting the systemic relevance of the overall group.</p>
          <p>Counter to that, there is also a possibility, of course, that the Basel Committee itself introduces a surcharge for SIFIs, a counter-cyclicality buffer, call it what you will, of potentially another 2.5% on top of the 19%. So the 19% is, for the moment at least, inked into the current proposals, and there's a possibility of a rebate down from that, but I wouldn't expect it to be very many percentage points. And I find the possibility of it being the full 6 percentage points unlikely. And there is a possibility that actually the 19% goes up as well, for counter-cyclicality effect. So, difficult to say and unfortunately not really within our control, but it's a possibility. And "might" really does mean might, to the extent that it also means might not.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the Basel 2.5 conversion, you're right, the actual for the first quarter, which was the CHF 76 billion, came in north of the original guidance we'd given. I think when we did give the original guidance, we stressed that it will vary from quarter to quarter. And the volatility of that number will increase partly because we're talking about incremental risk charges and stressed VaR, both of which are innately more volatile. And one of the reasons why CHF 76 billion is the CHF 76 billion is because of the particular trading strategies that were pursued by the IB in the first quarter. There's a relatively short look-back period for the stressed VaR and then the rest run off the trading that actually takes place in the quarter.</p>
          <p>And we will be able to change the way we trade in order to affect the Basel 2.5 number. And as I said earlier, we haven't been risk managing the IB to a Basel 2.5 metric. There is an awful lot of mitigation. Most of the mitigation we talked about in the past has been mitigation really against the Basel 3 further increment in risk-weighted assets. But it does affect Basel 2 and 2.5 because some of it is the run-off, disposal or otherwise eradication of some of our legacy positions, the biggest concentration of which is still the student loan ARCs.</p>
          <p>So there's still a lot of work we expect to do. There is a lot of relief we expect to get just from the passage of time and the amortization of some positions. But the numbers that we've shown you on page 23 really reflect the status in the first quarter, where we were not aggressively managing to a Basel 2.5 framework. And it was that that inspired management to impose a cap.</p>
          <p>I think you said the cap of CHF 280 billion was for the IB. It's actually for the group as a whole. So those are the group numbers, overall. The IB within that was CHF 193 billion. But we'd like to keep the IB to within there or thereabouts of the CHF 190 billion to CHF 200 billion range. And we think that it can operate relatively comfortably within that range. That does leave us at the bottom end of the risk-weighted assets and the VaR league table of our major competitors. But we still think that it can perform well within those confines.</p>
          <p>On the net new money in Switzerland, I'm afraid it is what it was during the quarter. There's a degree to which we're winning back clients in Switzerland. There's an equal degree to which we lost disproportionately in Switzerland. But it's driven more by &#x2013; well, the two driving factors, the outflows and the inflows. We had some decent inflows, and the outflows, in particular, have slowed down to relatively small amounts. So -</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, John. Three questions. Pardon me. First of all, the European outflows that you're still experiencing. Can you perhaps talk a little bit about what you think it's going to need to turn those around in terms of both market background, but also obviously the fact you have been reshaping that business post the crisis?</p>
          <p>Secondly, you talked about lending. And I see that I think lending increased about CHF 4 billion in the quarter, which is about 6%. Is this almost predominantly Lombard lending, or is it your efforts to go into big-ticket mortgages, SME type lending with your wealthy clients?</p>
          <p>And then, finally, just a follow-up on Fiona's question, really. What it looks like to me is you're saying to us that you're sort of 45%, 46% mitigation, you anticipate on your uplift under Basel 2.5 and 3. Nearly all of that you're anticipating comes out of the securitization uplift and the DVA uplift that you'll have in &#x2013; when Basel 3 comes in. Thanks, John.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Thanks. The outflows or the net outflows that we're still seeing in Europe, they were about minus CHF 0.5 billion or so in the first quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That is still the legacy effect of what I think is the sort of systemic decline in the offshore traditional Private Banking business within Western Europe, mainly from booking center Switzerland. These are clients domiciled in Western Europe booking assets in Switzerland. And for some time now, couple of years, we've seen a steady outflow. It's still fairly steady. The rate of outflow has materially slowed, but it's still steady.</p>
          <p>And the key to turning that around, I think, is what you alluded to, which was the reshaping of the businesses onshore. And they are all relatively new businesses in the &#x2013; compared with the offshore business. They were all really built in the past decade or so. They all went through an initial growth phase. They then went through what turned out to be a relatively difficult consolidation phase, because it coincided with the financial crisis and with some special UBS factors.</p>
          <p>And so that consolidation phase has perhaps taken a little longer than we would have ideally liked it to have taken, but we are still working on the onshore businesses. And we're starting to see some results, as I mentioned, at &#x2013; net outflow position is by far from the norm across Europe. And then some of the onshore markets we're seeing a relatively positive trading environment.</p>
          <p>So I think the solution is always to grow the business and to grow it onshore. And that's where the focus of much of the hiring and the investment will be in European markets, going forward. So there is still &#x2013; there's still a pool of assets that we expect over a long period of time will move out of the bank. And we just need to counteract that with new money and new business booked onshore in rest of Europe.</p>
          <p>On the lending, somewhere in the book, Caroline is showing me page 43, I think you can see that a lot of uptick is, in fact, in the category which is secured by securities, which is really the Lombard lending line. So, it's mostly Lombard lending.</p>
          <p>There are mortgage offerings. The mortgage offering, I think, is a little more relevant to our business in the U.S. than it has been to the business elsewhere. Although, we are looking to improve our overall lending businesses and jumbo mortgages would form part of that. So it's not a business that we're not interested in, but much of the increase in the first quarter was really from Lombard lending.</p>
          <p>And on the mitigation effects, it's a relatively high proportion of our pro forma Basel 3 numbers, you're right. I think some of that, though, reflects some of the idiosyncrasies of UBS. I think we've mentioned before two of the biggest contributors to the increase in risk-weighted assets from Basel 2 to 3 would be for example, our portfolio of student loan, auction rate certificates would be the &#x2013; and interestingly the option to acquire the StabFund, which takes on a very punitive capital treatment under Basel 3. And over time, given that we've got until essentially 2019 before Basel 3 continue to full force and effect, there will be a considerable amortization of these positions, even if we did almost nothing proactively to manage them ourselves.</p>
          <p>And of course, given the change in regulation, we change the way that we engage with this business and we risk manage it appropriately. So we will emphasize the reduction in those positions that carry very high risk weightings. Even frankly, if it comes at relatively small cost to the P&amp;L, if ultimately the improvement in the return on equity warrant that.</p>
          <p>So we will increasingly proactively begin to risk manage our Investment Bank, in particular, to mitigate the effect of the changes in the calculation metrics relating towards risk-weighted assets.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Next question is from Mr. Derek De Vries, Bank of America. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I have two questions, if I might. First, you talked about the benefit from hedging in the Corporate Center. I was just wondering if you could quantify that for us, so we can take it with the StabFund contribution and kind of get an underlying number there, if possible.</p>
          <p>The second question is on slide 24, where you show the movement in equity. And I just want to make sure I just understand it 100%, the CHF 1,150 million &#x2013; I don't know, I guess CHF 1.1 billion, CHF 1.2 billion from equity compensation, that's just the net impact of the fact that you're buying back more shares than you're issuing to employees in the quarter. If you could confirm that.</p>
          <p>And then the last point, you talked a little bit about this sort of new capital regime and you mentioned very specifically sort of seeing what elasticity of pricing does in terms of which businesses you'll go into.</p>
          <p>I'm just trying to sort of connect that with the fact that you guys are moving to Basel 2.5 and effectively pushing that on your Investment Bank a year ahead of when your competitors are doing that. So, if you're talking on the one hand about elasticity of pricing, but then forcing your capital allocation on your Investment Bank a year before peers do that, how do you kind of reconcile those two pretty different ideas or concepts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The hedging I mentioned in Corporate Center is the industry standard. And I mentioned corporate standard hedging of foreign exchange risk for our revenues and expenses, where we run a sell down process that brings back profits from our foreign branches and subsidiaries back to Swiss francs. And we generally just hedge those flows against adverse movements in foreign exchange conversion rates and we do that generally by buying options.</p>
          <p>And for dollars and euros, where generally we're making profits, we buy call options. And for the pound sterling, where on average we pay people and make less in revenues in pounds, we just buy put options. So it's a relatively straightforward option strategy, and those options are purchased in the market as part of a normal group treasury function.</p>
          <p>And the cost of those options is generally is retained under our charging mechanism retained in Corporate Center because it's a central corporate function. The businesses run themselves in their own currency. And the amount in the first quarter was &#x2013; Caroline is pointing at me &#x2013; very, very small, yeah, it's around about CHF 16 million. It varies from about CHF 10 million to CHF 30 million or so, depending on the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So you didn't have a big &#x2013; you didn't have a big benefit then in Q1 because the &#x2013; relative to when you bought the options, the Swiss is pretty strong, okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. Not, not particularly, no.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I misunderstood that then, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No. On the movement in equity, there are essentially two movements in the quarter, one of the movements through OCI, which you'll see every quarter. And then there's an item, which generally only will come up in the first quarter, which is this equity compensation plans number, which is a debit to the share premium. And the credit on the other side is cash. This is &#x2013; this relates to the actual delivery of shares in UBS to employees under existing plans.</p>
          <p>And the reason it's such a large number, is that we have a plan, which we call plan A for some reason, which is offered to people predominantly in Switzerland, which is a plan that requires the company to deliver the shares up front into a trust which then holds the shares. And then the shares are delivered over the normal vesting period.</p>
          <p>In plan B, which is non-plan A, which generally operates in the rest of the world, we just buy the shares when they vest for immediate delivery. But under these plan A schemes in Switzerland, there's essentially a trust and we buy a lot of shares on day one and place them in the trust. Now we don't &#x2013; excuse me, we don't have conditional capital out of which to deliver those shares and we haven't, in recent quarters, had much appetite for issuing new shares. As you know, we did that rather infrequently for period of time. And so our habit has been to go into the market, actually to buy shares and then physically deliver them.</p>
          <p>And the reason there's a debit to share premium is there's nowhere else to put the debit, but these are shares that were delivered before the P&amp;L is charged with the cost of those plan A shares under the normal IFRS bonus charging mechanisms. So, it's deferred compensation where there is no full career retirement, so it's not charged in the performance here, where it's spread over the vesting period, but where actual physical acquisition of the shares is done up front. And then they are given to a trust, which then releases them in accordance with the plans of &#x2013; the terms of the plan on the relevant vesting days.</p>
          <p>And so that's why there is a temporary timing difference where share premium is debited. And then it's credited out within equity as we charge the P&amp;L with the bonus accrual. And so that number reverses. That's not a permanent hit to equity at all. And in fact it will reverse on the average life of the vesting period. And most of these would be a three-year vesting, a third, a third, a third.</p>
          <p>So it's a bit of a one-off. It does happen in the first quarter. In our regulatory capital account, the reason you don't see that adjustment so much is we generally build the reserve, but under IFRS, you're not allowed to build a reserve for that sort of thing because actually, it is a market operation. We go into the market and buy shares. So, it hits the IFRS accounts sort of one go when we do it.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>On elasticity of pricing, it's a difficult one. I think what we're finding is that for those products for which there's a real client market. There is some tolerance on the part of clients to accept some increase in pricing. And we're finding that because regulatory change affects all banks, the cost of financial services products will go up, because the cost of equity is going up for banks, generally. But there are some products, where they are discretionary trading products, where the only reason the product exists is because it has, let's say, in-built leverage or it benefits from cheap funding or thin capitalization.</p>
          <p>And if that's put on a more expensive footing, because the capital rules change or the leverage has to come out, then very often the trading counterparty is no longer interested in pursuing that trading strategy, because it doesn't work anymore. And essentially, what happens is that product becomes, if not extinct, at least an endangered species. And so, what we're having to do is try to divine which products will withstand re-pricing across the market, which products we may have to re-price to a greater degree than some of our competitors, and then which products move towards extinction simply because they're no longer viable under the new capital rules. That's between banks, or between banks and other counterparties.</p>
          <p>And that, I think, will be an ongoing process for quite some time as the market develops. But inevitably, product will develop. There will be lots of innovation. All regulatory change act both as a risk, but also an opportunity. And I think the brains in the capital markets areas of all banks will be working hard on coming up with innovative new products, which neatly wind their way through the new regulations and generate attractive potential returns for banks and their counterparties.</p>
          <p>So I don't think there is any particular sort of waterfall or any day on which we need to impose on the idea a particular ban on doing anything. I think there will be a natural selection, if I can continue along its Darwinian vein, and there will be an evolution of product in response to the new regulation. And that's something we have to be at the forefront of, as you say, because we've had these rules imposed on us from an informal or &#x2013; sorry, from a formal FINMA regulatory perspective, one year earlier than our competitors, other than one obviously, which is in the same boat as we are.</p>
