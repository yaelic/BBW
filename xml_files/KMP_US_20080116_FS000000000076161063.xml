          <p>Welcome and thank you for standing by.  <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Today's conference is being recorded.  If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the meeting over to Rich Kinder.  Thank you, sir.  You may begin.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  Thank you, Anna, and welcome everybody to the fourth quarter analyst call for Kinder Morgan Energy Partners.  As usual I'll give an overview of the performance for the fourth quarter and for full year 2007.  Park will go through the financial details and then we'll throw it open for any and all questions that you might have.</p>
          <p>Also as usual we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
          <p>I think we had an awfully good year at Kinder Morgan for 2007.  As you know, we measure ourselves by the distributable cash flow we generate and distribute to our unitholders.  Today our Board raised the distribution per unit from $0.88 to $0.92 per quarter, or $3.68 per year.  That $0.92 distribution comes out of distributable cash flow per unit this quarter of $1 so we had very nice coverage for the quarter and for the year.  And that $0.92 represents an increase of 11% when you compare it to the fourth quarter of 2006 when we distributed $0.83.</p>
          <p>If you look at the full year, we distributed $3.48.  That's 7% above the $3.26 we distributed in 2006, and our distributable cash flow per unit for 2007 was $3.65.  That compares to $3.30 a year ago and led to a DCF above our distribution coverage of about $40 million for 2007.  Also, the distribution of $3.48 for 2007 was $0.04 better than our budget target of 3.44 for the full year.</p>
          <p>For the full year we produced DCF before certain items of $865 million, that was up 16% from $743 million in 2006.  So, those are a lot of numbers I know but I think the important thing is that we achieved these results without significant contributions from a number of large projects that we were building during 2007 and '08.  For example, the Rockies Express project, Kinder Morgan- Louisiana, the Midcontinent Express Pipeline, all of these will begin paying dividends in 2008 with REX-West completion and then increasing in 2009, 2010 and beyond as these other projects come online.  So, while we had a very good year in 2007, we certainly expect accelerating growth in 2008 and beyond as these major projects come online.</p>
          <p>Now, as we usually do, let me talk a little bit about the individual business segments and how each of them contributed to the growth and a little bit of what we have planned for the future in each of those segments.  And I'll start with our Products Pipeline group.  They had $586 million of earnings before DD&amp;A for 2007, that's a 17% increase in 2006 and nicely above the 2007 plan.</p>
          <p>The leading contributors there were our Cochin Pipeline, there we benefited from improved performance and from the fact that we now own 100% of it as opposed to 50% in the past.  We also had improved results at Transmix and Plantation Pipe Line but really each of the operating units of this segment were above 2006.  If you look across the whole Products group, revenues were up 6.2% for the year, volumes for the year were actually down 0.4%, four tenths of one percent, but if you strip out Plantation, which we usually do because as you recall, we had a major competitive pipeline come online there in mid-2006 -- if you strip out Plantation, we were up 0.8%, eight tenths of one percent on volumes and that's pretty flat of EIA's National numbers which were up 0.9% for 2007.</p>
          <p>It's a -- I think it's kind of interesting to see where these volumes were generated.  Our Pacific system was up 1.1% for the year in volumes with Arizona up 5.2%.  Of course, we added some capacity running through the East there during 2007.  The volumes in Southern California were actually down 0.5%, five tenths of a percent, and that was primarily lower volumes in the San Diego area and some of that certainly was as a result of the fires which occurred in the fourth quarter.  But, for whatever reason there was a decline in the San Diego area.</p>
          <p>Calnev, our line that goes into Las Vegas was off for the year by 2.3% in volumes.  Las Vegas was down 2.2%.  McCarran, the big airport in Las Vegas was actually up 1.7% and about 2/3 of the overall volume shortfall occurred on our intrastate deliveries off of Calnev as it runs through Southern California.  And, that's -- the good news there is that those are mostly the low tariff volumes.</p>
          <p>Our Central Florida pipeline was up 2% for the year, with Orlando particularly strong at 4.8% positive for 2007, and the Orlando airport up 6.6%.  Plantation as I've said was down for the competitive reasons I've mentioned about 3.5%, but we actually had positive revenues due to some tariff changes and the fact that most of the revenues or most of the volumes we lost were short haul volumes.  Looking at the expansion front for our Products Pipeline we finished around the first of December our $153 million East Line expansion from El Paso to Tucson and Phoenix.  That took our capacity to over 200,000 barrels per day on that line.  And when you combine that with the 2006 expansion, which we put in service in that year for the cost of $210 million, we believe we now have the capacity to serve the needs of the fast growing Arizona market from both West and East for many years to come.</p>
          <p>We began preliminary work on our major $400 million plus Calnev expansion project.  We expect to bring that in service in early 2011, and even since the end of the year we've completed an open season and signed binding contracts for all floating storage and blending of ethanol at our Tampa and Orlando, Florida terminals. This is not a huge project, it's a little over $25 million to be spent now, but I think it demonstrates the future potential for more ethanol activity in Florida and the Southeast, including the possibility of moving ethanol on a batch basis on our Central Florida pipeline from Tampa to Orlando.  We're now exploring that, we think it's going to work. If so that will be the first line in North America to run ethanol on a batch basis and we should have a decision on that probably in the second to third quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've entered into other arrangements that should help us continue to escalate our ethanol presence throughout the country.  Again, we're not investing in ethanol; we're just handling it on behalf of creditworthy entities.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Natural Gas Pipelines, we had earnings before DD&amp;A of $600 million in 2007 that was up 8% above 2006 and about 12% above our plan in '07.  The real drivers of this growth were the Texas Intrastate system where we had a record year.  I think there the good results came from higher sales margins on renewal and incremental contracts.  We had increased transportation revenues from higher volumes and rates and we continue to realize greater value for our storage activities in the state of Texas. Our transport volumes were up about 10% for the year.</p>
          <p>Our KMIGT and TransColorado pipelines, both Rocky Mountain pipelines of course, were modestly above both 2006 and the plan and our Casper-Douglas processing operation had a strong 2007.  This segment, the Natural Gas Pipelines segment is where a great many of our largest CapEx projects are housed and let me spend just a couple of minutes updating you on those.</p>
          <p>Of course, the most significant project in the whole company is our Rockies Express project and last Saturday, January 12, 2008 we went online with about 1.4 billion cubic feet of capacity on REX-West, running from the Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado to the ANR delivery point in Brown County, Kansas.  We have about 213 remaining miles on REX-West, which will continue eastward to Audrain County, Missouri.  We expect that last segment to be in service in early February.  That will take our capacity to 1.5 Bcf.  REX-West  is a little over 700 miles in length; 42 inch diameter pipe and we are now able to connect with KMIGT, Northern Natural Gas, NGPL and ANR; and again, when we finish the last spread in early February, we will also connect to Panhandle Eastern. So that's REX-West and we're delighted it's in service and that particular part came in pretty much on time; our target date was the end of 2007, as you recall &#x2013; and on budget.</p>
          <p>Now turning to REX-East, that's the last part of the project that will run from Audrain County, Missouri to Clarington, Ohio on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border and there we got a favorable draft environmental report in late November of last year; subject to receipt of the regulatory approvals we anticipate will go into interim service there, as early as the end of this year; the end of 2008 and be fully operational with all compression online by January 2009.</p>
          <p>When completed, we'll have a total capacity of 1.8 Bcf per day and all of that capacity is fully secured by 10 year long-term contracts from creditworthy shippers.  So, that's a big project for us and so far, so good; not without challenge, I might add.  Any time you're building any major project in North America today, you have challenges and we'll continue to confront those challenges and hopefully beat them on REX-East as we have on REX-West.</p>
          <p>In December 2007, we opened, completed a successful non-binding open season on an expansion of REX, which we have imagined will be called the Northeast Pipeline &#x2013; we're not too good with names; and that's a proposed 375 mile extension of REX that would do two things; it would extend the Pipeline's end point from Clarington out to Princeton, New Jersey and would also add capacity on the segment of the line between Lebanon, Ohio and Clarington and then on out to Princeton.</p>
          <p>Market interest was very good, it exceeded the Pipeline's initial design estimate of 1.5 Bcf per day. Clearly where the rubber meets the road is in getting the binding agreements done and that's what we're working on right now. Subject to getting these agreements and the regulatory approvals this pipeline could go into service in late 2010. So we continue to build off our success in putting the REX project together, although I will again emphasize, until we get binding agreements it's not a done deal as far as the Northeast Express project is concerned.</p>
          <p>Another one of our major projects in the Natural Gas group is our Midcontinent Express Pipeline. As you recall that's about a $500 million project extending from southeast Oklahoma across northeast Texas and northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, ending at a connection with the Transco pipeline near Butler, Alabama. It would have capacity of 1.4 Bcf a day. We have long-term binding commitments of over 1 Bcf a day now and expect to sign up the rest of that capacity as we go forward. We expect to bring that in service by March of 2009 assuming receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals and again as you know that's a 50/50 joint venture between ourselves and Energy Transfer.</p>
          <p>Our final major Natural Gas project is one of our older projects, the Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline. That's about a $517 million project that will transport natural gas from the Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG terminal across Louisiana over a space of 135 miles. We'll have the capacity of moving about 3.2 billion cubic feet a day, and all of that capacity is fully subscribed for 20 years. We now expect that pipeline to be in service by 1/1/09 and that's about three months ahead of our original schedule. So all in all, things are looking good on the expansion front for our Natural Gas Pipelines and as you can imagine and as you know this will be a huge driver of growth in the future and I think we're making good progress on all the projects.</p>
          <p>The completion of REX-West will obviously have significant positive impact on 2008 distributable cash flow and REX-East and the rest of these projects will have measurable impact in 2009, 2010 and beyond. So that's sort of the story on Natural Gas Pipelines.</p>
          <p>Turning to CO2, the CO2 Pipeline Operations produced about $537 million of earnings before DD&amp;A in 2007. That's up 10% from 2006 but significantly below the plan we had for them in 2007. If you look at the CO2 operations the oil production at Yates and our sales and transport business and our NGL production were all strong but oil production at SACROC was below plan and even below 2006. To put this in perspective the volumes at Yates were up 4% and a record production at Yates, at least since we invested there several years ago, but SACROC volumes were down 10%. NGL volumes for the year were up 8.5%.</p>
          <p>With regard to expansion there today, many of you know, about 22% of the oil production in the Permian Basin of West Texas to Mexico results from the use of CO2 and about 2/3 of that CO2 comes from the CO2 producing fields in southwest Colorado that we operate and then move that production down our Cortez Pipeline.</p>
          <p>We're spending about $200 million on an 8-8ths basis to increase the production and the pipeline capacity coming out of Colorado and it breaks down kind of like this. By mid-year of 2008 we will have increased our production ability or capacity at McElmo Dome from about 1 Bcf a day to about 1.2 Bcf a day and we will <mark type="inaudible" />, and there we own a 45% working interest. At Doe Canyon, a new field we're opening up, where we own 88%, we're bringing that online this week  and that should flow about 100 billion cubic feet a day and then we're completing the expansion of the Cortez Pipeline from Colorado to the Permian Basin by 200 million cubic feet a day.</p>
          <p>So we'll be increasing total production in southwest Colorado by 300, about 100 million of that we'll move on to a customer we have in southern Utah, and the other 200 million will come down the line to the Permian Basin. All of that will be completed by mid-year 2008 and it's running pretty close, slightly above our original budget, but still looks like to be a very nice project for us.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Terminals operations for 2007, Terminals produced about $442 million of earnings before DD&amp;A. That was up 12% from 2006 and about flat to our 2007 plan. The increase there was driven primarily by organic growth, by internal expansions, and somewhat by the acquisitions of Vancouver Wharves and the Marine Terminals that we made during calendar year 2007.</p>
          <p>I think we've also positioned ourselves pretty well for the future.  We have about 20 new tanks coming online either the fourth quarter of 2007 or the first quarter of 2008.  That added about 1 million barrels of new capacity in service in the fourth quarter of '07 and we'll be bringing online about 3.75 million barrels in the first quarter of 2008.  Almost all of this capacity is subscribed under contracts that average about five years in duration. So we have a very good idea there of what the sustained cash flow will be.  Again, these projects will be immediately accretive to the cash flow we generate.</p>
          <p>In addition, we've announced that we've entered into a long-term contract with BP to invest about $56 million to construct a new petcoke terminal at BP's Whiting, Indiana refinery.  This terminal will handle about 2.2 million tons per year of petcoke and from a new coker that BP is building to process heavy crude from Canada.</p>
          <p>I think this is probably important beyond just the amount of the project because we think it's an example of our strategy to expand our petcoke handling capacity which is now primarily concentrated on the Gulf Coast.  As many of you know, we are -- we believe we are the largest petcoke handler in America and we're anxious to expand and utilize that expertise in the Midwest and elsewhere where opportunities continue to develop.</p>
          <p>Turning to our fifth business segment, Trans Mountain, that's our Canadian crude oil products line that runs from Edmonton down to Vancouver and into Washington State, we had about $57 million of earnings before DD&amp;A, that's about 6% above our '07 plan.  The volumes were up 13% from 2006 due to expanding capacity from our pump station expansion.  That was a $225 million project that we completed during '07.  Our Anchor Loop expansion costing about $470 million is expected to be completed later in 2008 and that will raise our capacity to 300,000 barrels per day.  That's a much needed expansion of capacity and we should do very well with that project.</p>
          <p>Now, let me touch briefly on the certain items category from this quarter.  We ordinarily don't pay a lot of attention to them but we did have a lot of moving parts there.  In our certain items, we had a large gain from the sale of our North System which we completed early in the fourth quarter, offset by some legal and environmental reserves, primarily additional reserves relating to our ongoing series of rate cases on our West Coast products pipeline.</p>
          <p>These additional reserves, I think you could think of really resulted from three things.  First of all from the passage of time, which just means as we've said before as you go on without final settlement or final orders in the case, whatever reparations you owe continue to accrue interest.  We've set all that out in our prior regulatory filings.</p>
          <p>You also have additional refunds earned, owned on interim rates.  And here we've trued all that up through year end 2008, so we've done all that prospectively, not only for the time since we hit our last reserve here at the end almost two years ago, but we also have trued up through 2008.</p>
          <p>Then obviously we've had some new cases filed, we've taken that into account in computing our reserves. And then finally the third basket is the impact of new decisions in this rapidly or this slowly moving context, decisions on how you calculate your rates and how the numbers are calculated, the most recent of which came on at the end of December.  The decision's actually largely favorable to us because it included the full commission reaffirming our right to include our income-tax allowance in our rates.</p>
          <p>Obviously these reserves that we've set up are all non-cash unless and until our reparations are paid.  So let me conclude by reiterating that our 2008 budget target for distributions per unit is $4.02 per unit for 2008, that's up 16% compared to the 3.48 we declared for 2007.  This robust growth, as we've said previously, is being spearheaded primarily by REX-West, by higher hedge prices in our CO2 segment on our crude production and by anticipated strong performance from the rest of our assets.  We're going to go over our outlook for 2008 and beyond at our Annual Investor's Conference which will be here in Houston on January 24 and which will be web-cast live so anybody who wants to can listen in.</p>
          <p>And with that I'll turn it over to Park.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>All right.  Thanks, Rich, and I'm going to go over the financial pages that were attached as part of the press release. I'll start on the first numbers page after the text of the press release.  And this is the page with the income statement, the GAAP income statement. As we've been discussing since the second quarter the drop down of Trans Mountain and then also other certain items has caused distortions on the income statement, and so I really think that it's more meaningful to look at the second page and we'll talk about the certain items on that page; but just at the bottom, the last line of that page, you can see the Board today approved the distribution for the fourth quarter of $0.92, up from $0.83, that's an 11% increase. And for the year the distribution is $3.48, up from $3.26 that we distributed a year ago, that's growth of 7% in terms of the annual distribution per unit.</p>
          <p>With that let's turn to the second page and I'll actually start at the bottom of the first section. There's a line, "Weighted Average Units Outstanding," right above that you'd see the distributable cash flow per unit before certain items of $1 for the fourth quarter, up from about $0.87 in the fourth quarter a year ago, that's a 15% increase. For the year, as Rich mentioned, $3.65 compared to $3.30, that's an 11% increase. Once again our budget in terms of distributable cash flow per unit was $3.46. So we are significantly above our budget even with the higher distribution. Again, the budgeted distribution was $3.44 and we ended up at $3.48. This 3.65 compared to the distribution of $3.48 generates the excess cash flow that Rich mentioned of $40 million; and so we budgeted for $5 million of excess cash flow on a distribution of $3.44, we actually achieved a distribution of $3.48 and excess cash flow of $40 million. So it was a very strong year.</p>
          <p>Moving up from that you'll see net income per unit. I don't believe that that's as meaningful as the distributable cash flow per unit that we just went over. You'll see distributable cash flow before certain items $242 million for the quarter, up from $200 million in the quarter a year ago; and 865 in terms of distributable cash flow before certain items for the year, up from 743 million a year ago, that's the 16% increase that Rich mentioned.</p>
          <p>Immediately above that you'll sustaining capital expenditures. 58 million for the quarter, up from a year ago, about $153 million for the year. Our budget on sustaining CapEx was about $156.5 million so we were very close to budget, and in truth all of the variance is explained by Cochin. At the time that we did the budget our transaction with BP had not been finalized. The way that that transaction was ultimately negotiated, it actually reduced the sustaining CapEx that we realized at Cochin during 2007 and that really explains the variance between the actual of about 153 and the budget of about 156.5.</p>
          <p>Now, clearly, across all of our business units, some were a little bit up in sustaining CapEx and some were a little bit down.  But, again absent the change on Cochin we were essentially right on our expectation. And, the point I'm making there is that the outperformance in terms of distributable cash flow did not come from a reduction in sustaining capital expenditures.  Now, book cash taxes immediately above that, that is something that we added this year really as a function of the drop down of Trans Mountain.</p>
          <p>We have some differences, in prior years, and truthfully we have income taxes from some of our assets that are not qualifying that we own in Sea Corp.  That goes for Canadian assets as well.  We pay Canadian taxes on those assets.  So with the acquisition of Trans Mountain and of the other half of Cochin, those overall taxes went up.  And, the difference between our book taxes and our cash taxes became more meaningful, and we've been discussing this every quarter this year.  But, that's what that line is; it was a difference of $30 million for the quarter. It was a difference of $51 million for the year.  Significantly above where it was in 2006, you can see we've put the 2006 numbers in there.  Again, that's largely because of the acquisition of the remaining half of Cochin and of the acquisition of Trans Mountain which was effective at the end of April.</p>
          <p>DD&amp;A, it is up significantly, that's mostly driven by oil production at our CO2 segment.  It's also up because of the acquisition of Trans Mountain and at Terminals as a result of expansion projects and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>And that takes you again to the Limited Partners' net income and then the General Partner's interest and net income and the net income before certain items above that you'll see it's up about $50 million, over $50 million for the quarter and over about $70 million for the year.  Although, again I think that the more meaningful measure is the distributable cash flow number that we talked about.</p>
          <p>With that I'm going to continue just moving up the page and talk about the certain items, which is really the next section.  You'll see the first one, the Trans Mountain before drop down amount.  This is what I was talking about when we talked about the distortions on the income statement. Because KMP is now consolidated into Knight Inc. when we now do a transaction where an asset is sold from Knight down to KMP we have to account for that asset at KMP, as if KMP had owned it for as long as Knight had.  Now that's complicated, but effectively what it means is even though KMP did not buy Trans Mountain until the end of April, KMP has to reflect it on its financial statements as if it had owned Trans Mountain since the beginning of 2006.  Now it didn't own Trans Mountain until April, the end of April of 2007.  And so what we're doing in the certain items here is backing out the impacts of Trans Mountain from prior to that date, prior to the end of April in 2000.  There was one small amount in the fourth quarter, $1.3 million that related to some periods prior to April or earlier of 2007 so we are backing that out.</p>
          <p>Additionally, there is the large goodwill impairment that was actually taken at Knight Inc. in the first quarter of 2007.  Again it was taken at Knight Inc. before the asset was dropped down to KMP.  But, because of the accounting rules, we have to reflect that on KMP's income statement, again, even though it was a first quarter '07 item prior to the drop down.  And so that's the big amount that you see in the 12 months and again that's been in there all year, at least since the second quarter, the $373 million.  That's not a KMP item and so we are backing it out.</p>
          <p>The next item is the gain on sale; this is the gain on the sale of the North System. That was approximately a $300 million transaction; the book gain is a little over $150 million. So that we're not taking credit for that in recurring distributable cash flow, we're backing it out.  Here we did add to our environmental reserves, largely due to a change in the timeframe in which we are estimating them, that was about $15 million in the fourth quarter.  We added a little bit of an increment to them back in the second quarter, so the total for the year is $17.5 million.  The loss on debt retirement was back in the first quarter related to a refinancing at Red Cedar which is a joint venture in which we own a little under 50%.</p>
          <p>Allocated non-cash, long-term compensation, this is related to the MBO that took place at Knight.  This is compensation that for accounting purposes, we have to allocate KMP, but that KMP will never be responsible for.  KMP will not issue any equity for this, KMP will pay any cash for this, this will never be an item that economically impacts KMP.  But, for accounting purposes, we have to represent it on the income statement so again, we pull it out here as a certain item.  It's bigger for the 12th month because at the time of the close of the transaction, there was accelerated vesting on restricted stock and options. Again KMP was not responsible for that, did not pay any of that, never will pay any of that but it has to be reflected on their income statement.</p>
          <p>Legal reserves and settlements.  This is where the large increase to primarily the rate case reserves but also to some other legal reserves is showing up.  You can see it's about $139 million for the quarter.  Now when you look at it for the year, it's larger, almost $182 million.  That's because the Cora settlement and some other legal settlements are also in there, most of which occurred in the third quarter and were in the third quarter Q.</p>
          <p>Now I'll refresh your memory I think most people were aware of this, those settlements actually occurred after we released our earnings release in the third quarter, but before we filed our third quarter Q, so they were incorporated into our 10-Q for the third quarter.  They did not show up on our earnings release for the third quarter.  And then there's some items related to the hurricanes that were primarily a year ago, although a little bit of gain showed up this year that, again, we're not taking credit for. And then other is essentially minimal, except for 2006.  And there's a footnote that talks about the items that show up down there in 2006, contract settlements and a reserve release.  So, again, those are the certain items. We want everybody to understand them.  We want people to understand why we are not incorporating them in to what we believe to be our appropriate measure of recurring distributable cash flow.</p>
          <p>With that, I'll jump up to the top, and Rich has really covered a lot of the segments.  I'll go over them briefly.  Products Pipelines up about $9 million for the quarter versus last year, up $84 million year to date.  As Rich mentioned, above its budget, it's above its budget by almost $15 million.  And that's even in the face of losing the North System for the fourth quarter.  So we sold the North System effective the end of the third quarter.  So we didn't get any earnings from it in the fourth quarter even though it was included in our budget.  So a strong year in the Products Pipeline segment.</p>
          <p>Now the Natural Gas Pipeline segment even stronger, up from a year ago by $39 million in the quarter, for the entire year up about $46 million, significantly above their budget driven by the Texas Intrastate.</p>
          <p>CO2, while it is above last year by about $30 million for the quarter and about $47 million for year, is below our budget largely driven or completely driven by volumes at SACROC lower than our budget. Of course, as Rich said, the other piece is of the CO2 segment Yates and the S&amp;T business are performing very well.</p>
          <p>Terminals was essentially on budget for the year in terms of earnings before DD&amp;A.  It was a little bit under budget from a distributable cash flow perspective.  Terminals was one of the segments where sustaining CapEx was a little bit higher than what we had in our budget, but it's a very strong year nice growth from a year ago, up $17 million or 16% for the quarter; up almost $46 million or almost 12% year to date.  Trans Mountain, again, we did not have last year in there, although <mark type="inaudible" /> if you look on the front page of the income statement, it does include last year of Trans Mountain even though KMP didn't own it then. But the way that we think is the right way to look at it Trans Mountain was not a part of our distributable cash flow a year ago.  It is this year and essentially on budget for the year.</p>
          <p>Let me drop down to G&amp;A which is about 15 lines down, segment earning contributions. Below the segments there, you'll see G&amp;A for the quarter was up about $21 million from a year ago, it's up about $28 million for the entire year.  It was about $20 million above our budget, and the drivers of that: one, were Trans Mountain and that's in part an additional month of Trans Mountain.  In our budget we had the acquisition at the end of May; we actually did it at the end of April.  It's in part a function of foreign-exchange rates, which while they helped up in the segment, they help on the income aspect, they actually hurt on the expense aspect, they basically make the G&amp;A cost of Trans Mountain when you translate it from Canadian dollars back to US dollars greater in terms of US dollars than what we had in the budget.</p>
          <p>Legal expenses were up due to a couple of items that when we did the budget in November of 2006 we expected to be settled, they ended up taking longer than we thought to get settled and so we had additional expenses in 2007 related to those items.  That was about $7 million.</p>
          <p>Texas margin tax, which is a new tax, hit us by about $5 million, and then there were some additional head count, personnel expenses of about $3 million.  So that explains again the $20 million variance for the entire year between G&amp;A and our G&amp;A budget.</p>
          <p>On the interest line it's up from last year for the quarter about $15 million, year-to-date up $56 million but actually under our budget by a little over $4 million. So it came in right about where we expected it to be.  Compared to a year ago our debt balance is greater both for the quarter and the year.  Our average rate is about the same. In truth in the fourth quarter it's a little bit under where it was in the fourth quarter of 2006.  We're seeing a little bit of a favorable interest rate environment relative to a year ago, we expect that to continue in 2008.  And then the change in the debt overall I'll talk about when we get to the balance sheet.  So again those are the items that drop down to your distributable cash flow before certain items of about a per unit basis about $1 for the quarter, about $3.55 year-to-date.</p>
          <p>I'm not really going to talk about the front of the income statements because again all the Trans Mountain changes and the other certain items, make those comparisons not meaningful.</p>
          <p>There's just a lot of noise moving in and out, and so I will then go to the balance sheet which is the last financial page in the press release. In taking a look at it and once again, it is a little bit distorted even on the balance sheet because of the Trans Mountain transaction.  Again, we had to treat Trans Mountain as if it was owned by KMP since the beginning of 2006.  What that means is, that what this shows, the December 31, 2006 numbers that are here don't really reflect where KMP was at the end of 2006.  Because KMP at that time did not own Trans Mountain and if you go back and look at what we reported a year ago, you will see numbers that differ from what we are showing here. And that's because after that transaction was completed we had to go back and restate the end of 2006, as if we had owned Trans Mountain. And so again that distorts some of the comparisons.  But the most meaningful ones still apply, and so I will touch on those.  And again, this is consistent with what we have been talking about since the second quarter earnings call.  We talked about it in July; we talked about it in October, talking about it again now.  Hopefully we'll get beyond these when we get into 2008.</p>
          <p>You'll see your changes in these numbers, other current assets are up a little bit because of primarily accounts receivable.  PP&amp;E is up as a function of expansion CapEx, acquisitions and then clearly offset by depreciation during the year.  Investments are up as a function of our contributions to Rockies Express and the Midcontinent Express projects.  Deferred charges and other assets go down and that's because again, the Trans Mountain goodwill is in here as of the beginning of the year, and then Knight took a write-down on that goodwill in the first quarter. And of course that write-down, that initial goodwill balance has to be reflected here and the net write-down in goodwill has to be reflected here.  That's the big change in that line.</p>
          <p>Total assets about $15.2 billion, notes payable and current maturities I'll talk about when I talk about overall debt.  Other current liabilities, AP is up, accrued taxes and interest are up some.  Long-term debt, I'll talk about in a minute.  Value of interest rates swap just fluctuates, with the forward curve for interest rates.  The other line is moving as a result of two items; one, is our hedges which would show up on this line, and the second are the environmental and legal reserves, so that increase shows up on this line.  Similarly, the hedges impact accumulated other comprehensive loss, so that's what's driving the change there.</p>
          <p>Other partners' capital looked like it went down from a year ago.  In truth, if you go back and look at our December 31, 2006 balance sheet, what we reported at the time &#x2013; other partners' capital was about $4.9 billion and so if you compare to that, we are up about $951 million and so we're up significantly from where we were when we reported.  Now and again, even that increase, if you go back to a year ago, is distorted because we actually created equity through the Trans Mountain acquisition.  So because KMP has to carry Trans Mountain at Knight's asset value as opposed to what it paid for it, we actually created equity on KMP's balance sheet as a function of that.  So again, KMP is carrying Trans Mountain on its book at greater than what it paid and that created some equity. And again, that's just accounting; don't consider it to be overly meaningful.</p>
          <p>And really, for those reasons, we don't think the debt to cap calculation is an overly meaningful calculation.  You know, I think that's true for MLP's overall.  I think it's especially true when you have these kinds of distortions going through your other partners' capital line. So we'll focus more as we have been on the debt to EBITDA line. If you go to that section, you'll see total debt a little over $7 billion, that's up from a little over 5.7 at the end of December.  These numbers are good comparisons. So we're up about a 1.3 billion for the year.  Now for the quarter, if you go back and you look at where we were at the end of September, we were just a hair under $7 billion at the end of September.  So in the fourth quarter debt only went up by $11 million.  But I'll talk about those changes in debt in just a minute.</p>
          <p>Real quick, looking at debt to EBITDA, you'll see at the end of the year we're at 3.43 times, right at 3.4 times.  At the beginning of the year, we were at 3.3 times.  At the end of September, we were at 3.7 times and so, the debt to EBITDA measure which we think is a more meaningful measure of the strength of our balance sheet has improved since the end of the third quarter.  It is up slightly since the beginning of the year; that increase is consistent with our expectations. We're right where we expected to be and at 3.4 times, believe we have a very strong balance sheet.</p>
          <p>But let's talk about change in debt real quick. As I've said for the quarter the change is at about $11 billion, year-to-date it's a little under $1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>Talking about year-to-date real quick; our expansion CapEx was a hair under really about 1.55 billion.  Our contributions to our equity investments, again primarily Rockies Express and Midcontinent was a little under 300 million.  And total acquisitions was a little over 700 million.  Where that gets you is in between 2.5 and $2.6 billion of cash investments, for the total cash that we put out for expansions and acquisitions.</p>
          <p>If you're going to finance that 50/50, then you would expect your debt to go up by right around $1.3 billion which is exactly what it did. So consistent with our financing expectations there's the increase in debt. For the quarter, expansion CapEx was actually about $560 million so it's a very big quarter. Contributions to Rockies Express and Midcontinent were about $230 million and acquisitions were essentially zero.</p>
          <p>Now off-setting that. For the year we did assume about $43 million in debt when we acquired the other 50% of Cochin, so that is an incremental amount, $43 million adds on to that debt amount. And then the sources of cash, or the equity that we raised to finance the equity portion of this expansion and acquisition CapEx is as follows: asset sales were about $300 million, both in the quarter and for the year; equity issuance was about $343 million for the quarter, about $641 million for the year. The KMR distributions are essentially another equity issuance, they totaled about $63 million for the quarter, about $227 million for the year. And then we had a source of cash from working capital and other items about $85 million for the quarter, a little over $150 million for the year. So again those things net out with the investments and the expansion CapEx to get to your change in debt of $11 million for the quarter and a little under $1.3 billion year to date.</p>
          <p>Now I talked about sources of cash and working capital and other items, where that's coming from real quick. AR and AP for the quarter were actually use of cash of about $60 million, year-to-date a source of cash of about $13 million. Other current assets and current liabilities were a source of cash in the quarter of about $55 million, year to date about $90 million. Distributions versus earnings from equity investments basically flat for the quarter, a source of cash of a little over $30 million year to date, largely related to the refinancing at Red Cedar. We put on additional debt there, distributed additional cash out.</p>
          <p>We did terminate a couple of interest rate swaps throughout the year. That cost us about $15 million in cash in the fourth quarter and we're neutral on those terminations for the year. We did have incremental margin deposits for our hedges of about $30 million for the quarter, about $70 million year to date. We had other uses or actually sources of cash from operating activities, about $92 million for the quarter, about $114 million year to date. A lot of that is timing on dock premiums that we collect at our Westridge facility in British Columbia.  For the year, gas and NGL's in storage went down, that was a source of cash of about $12 million.  Debt issuance costs, cost us about $14 million for the year.  That was a use of cash.</p>
          <p>Changes differences in actual cash and bank accounts versus book, the change was about an $18 million use of cash for the quarter, about $27 million use of cash year-to-date.  CapEx accruals, so this is CapEx for the cash to pay our suppliers that has not yet gone out, about $67 million source of cash for the quarter, about $78 million year-to-date.  And then just ins and outs related to Trans Mountain adding that in at the beginning of the year, relative to where we ended up, a use of cash, year-to-date of about $71 million.  Now again, I know those are a lot of items and a lot of numbers but they sum up to right around $85 million source-of-cash for the quarter and a little over $150 million source-of-cash year-to-date.</p>
          <p>Now, expansion CapEx, let's talk about that real quick, again the numbers were big. Excluding Midcontinent Express Pipeline and Rockies Express, for the quarter it was about $560 million.  Year-to-date, almost 1.56 or $1.57 billion, so again we've talked about this, we have a number of very good expansion projects ongoing. We're going to see some very good results from that, going forward.  On a real high level, what those were, at the Product segment we spent about $72 million in the quarter, about $219 million for the year.  The El Paso to Phoenix expansion that came online in December was the biggest piece of that and some other Terminal and Calnev expansions.</p>
          <p>On the Natural Gas side, we spent about $95 million in the quarter, about $233 million for the year.  The Louisiana Pipeline was a big piece of that although it was less than we thought we would spend in 2007. That just got pushed back primarily to 2008. TransColorado expansion, some storage expansion, there is a number of things going on in the Natural Gas segment at KMP.</p>
          <p>At CO2, expansion CapEx about 117 million for the quarter, 387 million year-to-date, capitalized CO2 was a piece of that, the southwest Colorado expansion that Rich talked about, both expanding the source fields and the Cortez Pipeline was a big piece of that, clearly continued expansion at SACROC and at Yates to a slightly lesser extent.</p>
          <p>On the Terminals side, a tremendous year in terms of expansion CapEx, $146 million in the quarter, $472 million year-to-date.  As Rich mentioned, we brought on 1 million barrels of liquid storage in the fourth quarter and we're going to bring on 3.75 million barrels of new liquid storage in the first quarter of 2008.  We have contracts for all of that storage. That was taking place in Edmonton, Alberta and in the Houston Ship Channel, on the New York Harbor and in Chicago, so a number of places where we're adding that capacity.</p>
          <p>And we had some expansions going on primarily at Pier 9 and Shipyard River on the bulk side. And then at Trans Mountain clearly we have one major project continuing and another major project that ended earlier this year, we spent $128 million in the quarter, $265 million since KMP owned the asset in 2007. Most of that was on the Anchor Loop which is the project that is ongoing; a little bit of it related to the pump station expansion which was completed earlier this year.</p>
          <p>So again, that's high-level expansion CapEx and I think that wraps up the balance sheet. I'll hand it back to Rich.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The company name is Harts Capital. Thanks guys, a lot of information. Quick follow-up, I found it interesting you mentioned the use of pipeline for ethanol. To date my understanding has been conventional wisdom says that ethanol won't go through the pipelines. I was just curious what kind of issues you've run into and if you think long term this might be able to lead into using longwall pipes for ethanol transport?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, that's a very good question, and it is a very difficult conundrum to solve. As you may know the Brazilians have done this for some period of time. The conventional wisdom of course is that ethanol acts as a solvent so it picks up any extraneous material that you have in your pipeline and theoretically you can dirty up your ethanol and have impact on other products that you are moving through the line, like gasoline or jet fuel in a batch line.</p>
          <p>So in order to do this it requires a certain amount of capital to absolutely clean the pipeline, to install some new equipment to make sure we keep it clean beyond what you do just in a normal batch line. We're working all that in co-operation with PHMSA, the Department of Transportation and other regulatory groups, all of which are pretty enthusiastic about this. And we believe that on that relatively short line there's a good chance we will be able to introduce that, as I've said in the mid-year timeframe, second or third quarter; but only if we and the regulators get completely comfortable with the fact that we could do it without harm to any of the product that's moved through it.</p>
          <p>Now I don't want to over-emphasize the benefits of this.  This is a relatively short line; doing it on a100 mile line is different from doing it on a 1,000 mile line.  But certainly, it would have, I think, significant ramifications if we're able to do it even on this relatively short line.  And, of course, it would, if you could extrapolate that to a broader area, would pay enormous dividends because the biggest single logistical problem in ethanol is that it's almost all produced in the Upper Midwest where the market for it is limited.  It needs to go to California, it needs to go to the East Coast and increasingly, given the pricing arrangement, it needs to go to other places in the country, specifically including Florida and the Southeast.  So it could play a very important role in really implementing the mandate that the Federal Government has put on.  But again, we're pretty cautious about things like this and right now all we can say is, we think we have a better than 50-50 chance, pretty good chance, at getting this done in this relatively short line and then we'll see what happens after that.  But it's very interesting.</p>

          <p>Few things here, I was just wondering, given that REX-West has gone into service, first of all, does that mean that you need to now finance that out of KMP?  And then secondly, you mentioned the 500 million increase in your outlook and you mentioned the three main pieces were the REX-West, the hedges and then other items.  I was wondering if you could kind of break out the 500 million between those three pieces.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me answer that one first.  We're going to go through that in detail at the Analyst Conference in about ten days.  We'll take you through that piece by piece.  But the main parts are what we said.  REX-West coming online, the increased prices on the hedges, on our oil production in CO2 and then, of course, as Park mentioned, things like our Terminals business and other expansions we've done that bringing all this new Terminal capacity online, for example, will be a nice addition to Terminals' earnings.  Now with the REX-West being in service, I don't know. Park, you want to comment?</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we will as we've discussed before, we will put in place permanent financing as those pieces of REX come in service.  As I was discussing, we made a significant equity contribution to Rockies Express in the fourth quarter of last year.  We will continue to look at it as the year progresses, terming up some debt for Rockies Express, and consider the financing that we need to put in place once REX-East comes on.</p>

And we've actually with REX-West, and that's a big part of it &#x2013; Steve Kean's sitting right here -- about 3.5 billion is now in service so we have roughly 3 billion or a little over still to bring in service between now and basically middle of '09 for the most part.</p>

Well anyway we appreciate you listening in, and again we will have our Investor Conference here next week and we look forward to seeing a lot of you in person.  To the extent you're not, it will be webcast and you can listen to it.  So thank you very much and have a good evening.</p>
