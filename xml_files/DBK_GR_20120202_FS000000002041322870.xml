          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2011 Conference Call of Deutsche Bank. I'm the operator for this conference. Please note that for the duration of the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relations. Go ahead, sir.</p>
        </plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon. From Frankfurt, this is Joachim M&#xFC;ller, Head of Investor Relation and on behalf of Deutsche Bank I would like to welcome to you to our conference call on fourth quarter results. We have with us our CEO Josef Ackermann and our CFO Stefan Krause, both of which will lead you through the presentation slides, which you'll find on the website along with all other documents we issued today.</p>
          <p>Before we start, let me remind you of the cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements at the end of these presentations. I'm sure that many of you have already watched the press conference early this morning, so I'd like to reiterate that our focus is on 2011 and fourth quarter results and then neither Joe nor Stefan are in a position to make statements about the future management structure or strategy. It goes without saying that we'll provide you with comprehensive information when we are in a position to do, but as Joe said this morning there are no decisions being taken yet.</p>
          <p>With that I would like to hand over to our CEO, Josef Ackermann.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I'll begin on page two of my presentation with the usual overview of the bank's full-year 2011 results. I assume that you have familiarized yourself with the key data regarding the bank's profits, key capital and balance sheet positions earlier today. So I can move on to the key takeaways on the next page.</p>
          <p>So, page three. The year 2011 was clearly characterized by a multitude of challenges, particularly during the second half of the year, which is also demonstrated in the fact that we had a 55% overachievement in our &#x20AC;10 billion goal in the first six months and then as you have seen came down to 66% roughly at the end of the year. So very little contribution in the second half.</p>
          <p>I think today we can report solid, certainly not record results, but solid results, and above all record earnings in our classic banking businesses. Some people have challenged us a little bit on the term classic. I think some time ago we called it stable banking businesses. But as we have seen during the financial crisis even some of the stable businesses haven't been that stable, so we changed that into classic, but it's still the same areas behind it.</p>
          <p>In the investment bank, we continued our de-risking strategy recalibration achieved further market share gains while others are retrenching or have already retrenched. We clearly significantly strengthened our capital liquidity position, our Core Tier 1 ratio and liquidity reserves are the highest ever in the history of the bank and we continue to reinforce our funding position.</p>
          <p>You see on page three some of the challenges, actions we have taken, and the results of these measures. On page four, just briefly on the &#x20AC;10 billion pre-tax profit for our operating divisions, I think in the, if we take the total of the classic banking businesses, we are slightly above our ambitious target, namely &#x20AC;3.7 billion, instead of &#x20AC;3.6 billion. And you see that Global Transaction Banking and the Retail Banking Businesses have over performed. Asset Management is slightly below the &#x20AC;1 billion, but all together &#x20AC;3.7 billion versus &#x20AC;3.6 billion. Of course, the Investment Bank is substantially below our target of &#x20AC;6.4 billion achieving &#x20AC;2.9 billion, and as I said before primarily stemming from the second half and above all from the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>But I think it shows also that we have somewhat taken specific charges, which were not planned for litigation charges, Greek bond impairments and other special effects. If we added that all back to the &#x20AC;6.6 billion, the number would have been closer to &#x20AC;8 billion, which I think is still below the &#x20AC;10 billion, but I think given the very challenging environment, it clearly shows that we have the potential to meet these kind of goals also going forward.</p>
          <p>I will come back to some &#x2013; or Stefan in his presentation, some of the unplanned items, some of them therefore is accelerated, especially litigation charges. As I said this morning, I'm not one of the CEO <mark type="ph" /> kind (5:27) who likes to leave with a stellar result and leaves all the problems to the successors. I want to do it the other way around. That's why we took some hits, which is really an acceleration of things in 2011, which might have come in 2012 or thereafter. And some of them are the litigation charges or the settlements we have done in 2011; the Greek bond impairments primarily paying a price for having been a good corporate citizen, namely keep paying the commitment to some of the governments, especially German governments, not to sell the Greek bonds which cost us, as you know, quite some money primarily in the Postbank portfolio. And the other thing which you will see is not in the operating result, but mark downs in the corporate investments and I'll come back to that later on.</p>
          <p>Now on page five, the investment banking, I think, in general was impacted by slowing down in client activity. But I would add that the European sovereign debt crisis problem, having been the most prominent issue, and I think the impact is somewhat more pronounced given our prominent position in Europe.</p>
          <p>Market movements during the second half of the year in some asset class are far off what we saw during the fourth quarter of 2008. So the positive news and positive message is despite the fact that we have seen similar dislocations in the market, the losses have been of course much, much smaller than what we have seen in the fourth quarter 2008. So it shows that we have clearly reduced the risk appetite and risk positions dramatically in the last few years since the 2008 hit.</p>
          <p>We also generated &#x20AC;500 million to the integration of our CIB businesses, so that's part of our Integra project which is positive, so &#x20AC;500 million EBIT, thanks to that. But here again, of course, we are impacted by a number of one-off events, litigation and associated legal costs and you have seen that we are at about &#x20AC;655 million charges related to litigation; then we have this &#x20AC;310 million charge relating to the impairment of a German VAT claim.</p>
          <p>On page six, you see the relative performance because, as we said this morning, yes it is disappointing especially in the second half in absolute terms clearly underperforming our own target quite substantially; in relative terms, I think it looks better. We have improved our overall market position to number three in revenues in CB&amp;S after being number five in 2010. Now, I have to add here not all of our European peers have reported, so maybe there are some changes, but so far we are confident that we are probably top three or top four in 2011 which is a relative improvement.</p>
          <p>And we think that this is even more impressive given our overweight position in Europe, which I alluded to earlier, which was clearly affected more than some other markets particularly the United States.</p>
          <p>In the new regime, client market share will become a key differentiator and we have more top three client market share positions than any other bank and this has helped us deliver a lower decline in revenues than almost all of our U.S. peers, with the two exceptions, or one exception which is on the chart. So as we've said only firms at the top three or top five will be able to generate economics which can sufficiently offset increased capital requirements and I think we have clearly re-emphasized this morning at the press conference our strong commitment to investment banking, also to global investment banking and that we will not pull out of any important market or of any important product areas.</p>
          <p>Classic banking, of course, we are very proud about the record result in Classic Bank as a whole and that all banking, classic banking divisions contributed to the 78% increase year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Thus, we successfully delivered on our declared strategy to further balance our business mix. We are now at 56% contribution from the classic businesses, which is of course to some extent due to the weakness of investment banking. But we still think that even in normalized environment for investment banking, we would expect CB&amp;S share to increase again, but not in any way to the level, which we have seen in earlier years, so somewhat below 60% and above 40% for the classic business. And you see very strong performance in retail, &#x20AC;1.8 billion; &#x20AC;1.1 billion in Transaction Banking and in Private Wealth Management, Asset Management, &#x20AC;0.8 billion, all of them, very good performances even if you have to include some one-offs as well.</p>
          <p>Page eight shows where we are in terms of our efficiency initiatives and the integration of strategic acquisitions and you see that in terms of efficiency initiatives, we have realized all the savings which we have promised. That's true for the CIB integration. It is true for the Complexity Reduction Program; actually we are slightly ahead of our original target of &#x20AC;1 billion, now at &#x20AC;1.1 billion. We are ahead of plan, roughly nine percentage points in the Postbank integration. We are a little bit behind plan in Sal. Oppenheim and on plan in ABN AMRO. So all in all, I think, we can demonstrate that we have successfully integrated or merged certain businesses.</p>
          <p>The page nine shows that our risk, derisking efforts, which I think helped us from very early on, but from &#x2013; maybe from a more political point of view, even more important that we have increased our loan book in Germany without Postbank by 7% since the end of 2008, so we have not deleveraged our loan book and including Postbank, of course, it's even 105% up. But important also that we have really derisked our investment banking dramatically which helped us to have this kind of relative resilient result in a very difficult market in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>Compensation, the reduction of the compensation ratio from 41% to 39.5%; cash is down 37%, the variable total is down 17% and deferred is slightly up 5% despite the fact that we have 24% more people which have to be paid now. Now not all of them of course will get the bonus, but still the number, the head count number is up. Our deferral rate with these numbers increased to 61%.</p>
          <p>The capital ratios as you see on a pro forma basis, it would be at 10.8% Core Tier 1; Tier 1 14.7%. Now taking into account, of course, Basel 2.5, we are at 9.5% and 12.9% Tier 1 ratios. And I have to add that for reasons of being particularly cautious we have added another &#x20AC;1 billion or &#x20AC;12.5 billion of risk rated assets to litigation risks which actually, without that we wouldn't have had to take it this year, we would have been even higher of course in terms of our ratios. So it should demonstrate that we are not playing around with these numbers. On the contrary, actually; we want to be on the conservative side. The liquidity &#x2013; important we have the liquidity reserves of almost &#x20AC;220 billion now, and you see the discretionary unsecured wholesale funding of &#x20AC;133 billion and we see the composition of the liquidity reserves.</p>
          <p>So there is a reason that we never had any problems during the entire financial crisis in funding ourselves, and we were always very conservatively funded and have an additional liquidity reserves. If we had earned an additional 50 basis points on those assets so the &#x2013; on average we had &#x20AC;173 billion of liquidity reserves, our return on equity would have increased by almost 2 percentage points &#x2013; but we felt that is an important message to have this kind of cautious approach to liquidity. The liquidity reserves, if we had maintained them at the 2007 levels, our leverage ratio, by the way, would have been at 19%, so below 20%, and as you've seen, we are now at 21%.</p>
          <p>So, let me conclude by saying that we have clearly transformed towards a more balanced and lower risk business model. We have sanctioned the footprints in retail and private wealth management and transaction banking. We have delivered execution excellence in acquisitions. We are and continue to focus vigorously on high quality liquidity and funding profile, and we maintained the high capital discipline. And I'm actually very proud to say that we resisted any demands for capital raising because we knew that we can over deliver and meet the requirements six months ahead of time, and the same is true, as you will see, for the Basel 3 at the end of 2012.</p>
          <p>So, I'll stop here and Stefan Krause, the CFO, will continue.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon from Frankfurt to everybody. As Joe already provided you with your full year highlights, let me now go ahead and comment on the fourth quarter development. A combination obviously of legal charges and charges from legacy assets and corporate investments resulted in a net loss in the fourth quarter. However, thanks to the resolution of tax cases, net income was positive, and therefore capital accretive. The capital accretion got hand-in-hand with other remarkable fourth-quarter achievement, which was our substantial risk weighted asset mitigation. With a 9.5% core Tier 1 ratio, we clearly over delivered on the targets we had previously communicated to you. And obviously I will take some time to elaborate this in more detail later on in my presentation.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on from the overview to page four. As you can see, fourth quarter revenues were impacted by the continued dislocations in the capital markets. Thanks obviously to the first time full year consolidation of Postbank, we can nonetheless report record revenues of &#x20AC;33 billion for the full year of 2011.</p>
          <p>On page five, you see our non-interest expenses. They increased by &#x20AC;800 million quarter-over-quarter. This is due to extraordinary items that affected the fourth quarter, which we have highlighted on the slide, as you can read. The increase in compensation expenses is primarily attributable to the Postbank integration and the related severance payment.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, we also had to recognize a UK bank levy, so that jointly with the German Bank levy, the respective administrative expenses totaled &#x20AC;154 million.</p>
          <p>On page 6, we show you the usual chart on our provision for credit losses. As you can see, they came in at &#x20AC;1.8 billion. Included in this number are &#x20AC;761 million for Postbank and &#x20AC;402 million of which are offset in net interest income. Remember, in our group accounts, we record releases in relation to Postbank loans consolidated in December 2010 in net interest income. This is a technical accounting effect you should eliminate when you want to track our underlying credit performance, and that's why we highlighted the net number on the chart separately. Excluding Postbank, our provision for credit losses was down &#x20AC;139 million or 11% year-on-year, mainly due to lower provisions in PBC.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to page 7 which shows you our profitability. I already covered the fourth quarter profitability briefly in my overview. Hence, I would now like to focus on the tax rate, which was quite interesting for the quarter. The 20% tax rate achieved in 2011 benefited from changes in the recognition and measurement of deferred taxes and a favorable geographic mix of income. It should therefore not be perceived as an indicator for next year. Going forward, we estimate our mid-term effective tax rate to range between 30% and 35%, and I'm well aware that we've given this outlook every year and sometimes have beaten it. But I can reiterate that that's what you should put in your models on a longer term basis.</p>
          <p>Let me now move on to the segment results on page 9, our usual chart. Here we present an overview of the performance in the fourth quarter and we have put on the chart the significant items that impacted CB&amp;S and corporate investments.</p>
          <p>And as I will go into further detail on the performance of each segment, I will not spend more time on this and go on to page 10 in CB&amp;S. As you can see, the pre-tax loss of &#x20AC;422 million in the fourth quarter was impacted by continued low client activity and significant litigation charges. The increase in costs during the quarter driven by litigation was partly offset by lower compensation costs and other cost control measures in areas such as recruitment, marketing and travel.</p>
          <p>The underlying full-year performance was strong, excluding one offs, our EBIT decline is substantially less than what you have seen from our peers in 2011. We achieved our CIB integration, as Joe has already highlighted; our target of &#x20AC;500 million EBIT across CIB, and I can say that I'm really pleased with these results.</p>
          <p>On page 11, we show our sales and trading debt that had a reasonable quarter given the difficult market conditions. We showed good results in client solutions showing that clients still value advice around solving fundamental financial problems. We also saw improved flow credit performance after losses last quarter and reduced inventory given the lower client activity. We recorded lower results in FX rates commodities quarter-over-quarter, but it still was one of our best years ever. For full-year results, we expect to be ranked number two in fixed income. This would be the best relative performance since 2007, with more sustainable results than most of our peers.</p>
          <p>On page 12, I show sales and trading equity results. We also delivered a solid performance in light of the difficult equity markets and weak client activity. We also had much improved performance in derivatives quarter-over-quarter. We continue to have a strong prime brokerage franchise with very stable balances as well.</p>
          <p>On page 13, I show the advisory, the origination &amp; advisory businesses. The advisory business showed a solid performance in the fourth quarter given the market conditions. However origination continues to be impacted by the market environment. We ended the year ranked sixth overall, but with only a small gap to number five; that position we achieved last year, we couldn't quite defend. But this is a still a good achievement given that we continue to be number one in Europe where activity slowed down the most.</p>
          <p>On page 15 (sic) [14] (23:06), now I highlight GTB that really had an outstanding year. GTB generated record full-year revenues across all majors businesses such as trade finance, cash management and trust and securities services. Interest and fee income improved due to the higher business and transaction volume, aided by slightly improved interest rates in Asia and the Euro area during the year. Asia-Pacific remained one of the key growth regions in 2011, while EMEA and the Americas showed significant growth as well. The positive revenue trend was obtained during the fourth quarter as GTB continued to focus on fee income amid deteriorating interest rate environment.</p>
          <p>Turn to page 15, this is the summary page of our asset and wealth management business, but I will go into the single businesses. On page 16, I start with asset management. And with &#x20AC;131 million in pre-tax profit, asset management really recorded its best operational performance since the second quarter of 2008. This result is even more remarkable if you consider the challenging equity markets during the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>We've also gained some further benefits from the platform efficiencies and had a very successful quarter in RREEF. &#x20AC;28 billion up 5% invested asset increased due to &#x20AC;8 billion of net inflows and a good market performance demonstrates the quality of our franchise during the quarter.</p>
          <p>On page 17, I will show the results of Private Wealth Management. As you know, here as well the, turbulence and uncertainty in the world economy resulted in reduced client activity. In addition, PWM had to digest legal expenses and Sal. Oppenheim reorganization costs resulting in a quarterly profit dip, as you can see in the chart. Thus, you should not extrapolate fourth quarter performance, but take the average 2011 quarterly EBIT as a guidance for 2012.</p>
          <p>On page 18, we show our Private &amp; Business Clients business on a full-year basis. As you can see, our PBC business performed strongly above it's communicated target with the Postbank integration well on track and synergies coming through quicker than we had expected. In the fourth-quarter, PBC delivered a pre-tax profit of &#x20AC;227 million after taking &#x20AC;118 million mark to market losses on Greek bonds and &#x20AC;134 million cost to achieve for the Postbank integration.</p>
          <p>After the additional value adjustments in the fourth-quarter, the weighted average book value of the Greek government bonds in PBC's portfolio now amounts to 29% of notional. Revenues from investment products continue to be negatively impacted from reduced client activity as already in the third quarter, this was well offset by growth in revenues in credit product. Our loan production, especially in Germany, continued to show a very strong momentum.</p>
          <p>Before I move on, let me shortly highlight that we further increased the level of transparency on PBC's performance. As promised during the third-quarter analyst conference call, we have now added the impact from the so-called Postbank PPA, or more precisely the amortization of the fair value adjustments to our disclosure. You'll find in the appendix a comprehensive slide on all special effects that impacted PBC in 2011.</p>
          <p>On top, we also explained in a visualized ways the amortization pattern on a going forward basis and provides therefore guidance for you about the future EBIT impact and for your models and for your math.</p>
          <p>Let me now turn to our corporate investments, the corporate investments division was impacted in the fourth quarter by significant impairment charges resulting in a loss of &#x20AC;722 million. The &#x20AC;407 million impairment charge taken in Actavis was not related to business performance of Actavis, to say it very clearly, but was triggered due to a change in our exit assumption which led to an updated valuation. In case of the Cosmo in Las Vegas, the &#x20AC;135 million impairment was a result of an updated valuation taking into account the slower than anticipated recovery in Las Vegas gaming industry. The BHF reorganization cost taken in the fourth quarter were incurred in order to prepare it for any strategic option and we expect to get clarity on BHF's future in, obviously, the course of this year.</p>
          <p>Let me now cover, as usual, a couple of key current issues in my presentation, and of course as I know that that's your favorite topic, I will start with our capital ratios and risk-weighted assets. So let me say a few words about capital. First, with a Core Tier 1 ratio of 9.5% as of December 31 of 2011, we have fully delivered on our commitment to meet the EBA target of 9% ahead of time. And let me add that without Basel 2.5 effect, we would have had a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10.8% and that in either case this is our highest year-end Core Tier 1 ever. Second, Basel 2.5, as you know Europe continues to fully implement the Basel framework in line with globally agreed timeline, which means full introduction of Basel 2.5 for year-end 2011.</p>
          <p>So despite a resulting 130 basis points hit, our Core Tier 1 ratio increased year-on-year from 8.7% at the end of 2010 to 9.5% at the end of 2011; and the Tier 1 capital ratio from 12.3% to 12.9%. This increase is obviously a result of strong capital formation and a delivery of tangible management actions to reduce and mitigate the impacts of the Basel 2.5 regulation.</p>
          <p>It's also worth noting that you should not expect to see this Basel 2.5 effect on U.S. peers who still report under Basel 1 in case you make comparisons.</p>
          <p>Now, let me walk you through the key movements of our Core Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets and explain them in more detail on the next page, page 22. As you can see, our Core Tier 1 capital increased by &#x20AC;2.2 billion from &#x20AC;34.1 billion to &#x20AC;36.3 billion mainly driven first by &#x20AC;0.5 billion lower capital deductions in relation to securitization as a result of our risk reduction activities. You remember that under the old regime we had some capital deductions that we talked about that would be reversed with Basel 2.5. Second we had &#x20AC;0.9 billion deductions that were eliminated also under Basel 2.5. But to be clear the related provisions are obviously now risk weighted; that's the migration we explained to you.</p>
          <p>And third, obviously the &#x20AC;0.5 billion higher capital through FX effects, however, with effectively no impact on our capital ratios as we see a corresponding increase in risk weighted assets as shown in the chart on the right.</p>
          <p>On the right side, you see the risk weighted assets. The net $44 billion increase principally reflects the introduction of Basel 2.5, which added &#x20AC;54 billion. And if you look at the other movements, we had &#x20AC;14 billion higher operational risk, risk weighted assets principally due to the new safety margin we took intended to cover unforeseen legal risk from the current financial crisis that Joe talked about that is a measure we decided to take ahead of time. There is a &#x20AC;23 billion lower credit risk weighted assets through a combination of derisking, some Basel approved model extensions and other process enhancements and a &#x20AC;6 billion reduction in VaR based on market risk weighted assets, as already applicable under Basel 2, driven by our significantly reduced market risk profile towards the year end.</p>
          <p>On the next page, you'll find some more detail on the main change in the quarter, namely capital requirements for trading book market risk. So looking at page &#x2013; the chart on page 23, as you can see here by the end of the fourth quarter 2011, we completed our long standing Basel 2.5 related management action and de-risking program. Through further risk reduction efforts, our VaR is down to the lowest level in years, driving a quarter-on-quarter 27% or &#x20AC;6 billion reduction in Basel 2 based market risk, risk weighted assets.</p>
          <p>In parallel, versus September pro forma number, the Basel 2.5 risk weighted asset impact was reduced by 32% or &#x20AC;24 billion. How did we do this? That is a question, you will ask. First, VaR came down as we reduced risk positions and we lowered our general market risk profile as measured by VaR. Second, the reduction in VaR has driven a corresponding, but in absolute terms even higher reduction in Stressed VaR,  in effect further amplified by our targeted efforts to reduce stress sensitive exposures.</p>
          <p>Third, hedging of key main risk allow us to reduce the IRC charges compared to September of 2011. And fourth, we reduced securitization related charges through a combination of sales, hedging and roll off.</p>
          <p>So let me add that sales were conducted at mark and whilst it incurred some hedging costs in the fourth quarter, overall de-risking costs were immaterial for the quarter. When looking at the full impact from Basel 2.5, please bear in mind that we also see about 40% on &#x20AC;900 million lower securitization related capital deductions compared to Basel 2, because the related positions are now included in risk weighted assets. So the net impact of Basel 2.5 in risk weighted equivalent term is about &#x20AC;40 billion, so not the &#x20AC;52 billion.</p>
          <p>Lastly, let me say that we consider current VaR and SVaR levels, Stressed VaR levels, exceptionally low and that we expect some up tick in risk weighted assets, obviously, as markets normalize and client activity returns in 2012; so please keep that in mind. Overall, I can really say that the board is really pleased about the performance in this area.</p>
          <p>So as I anticipated that you immediately are now going to ask me a question around the Basel 3 simulation, I put this now on page 24. And with Basel 2.5 now being fully reflected on the numbers, I will now give you here also an update on Basel 3. First to just discuss, we expect some upward normalization of trading market risk, so we added &#x20AC;12 billion risk weighted assets for this in our simulation. Then in relation to Basel 3, we currently expect &#x20AC;105 billion additional risk weighted assets after management action, slightly less than what we included in our previous estimate, principally as a reflection of already reduced securitization deduction.</p>
          <p>Lastly on the capital side, we included the markets' latest estimates of our future net income. I hope you calculated them all correctly. Looking at the results, core Tier 1 ratios you see that we comfortably meet EBA's 9% target in June this year and that under Basel 3 we will be above 9% in 2013, consistent with previous guidance.</p>
          <p>Let me also remind you that this simulation does not consider any management action other than actions directly related to Basel 3, which means that we still have the full toolbox of capital management measures at our disposal in case that actual development deviates from our simulation or the market or regulators were to demand even higher capital ratios. Such measures could obviously, include letting legacy assets roll off without one-for-one replacements through new business in other areas, increasing collateral requirements to further reduce our risk profile or more significant actions like disposals of non-strategic assets, as well as compensation and dividend measures just to name a few.</p>
          <p>Let me now go on page 25, where we show you the exposure on some selected countries. As you know, we have already naturally reduced our sovereign exposure to these countries in the first half of 2011, which is the primary driver behind the 70% year-on-year reduction from &#x20AC;12.1 billion to &#x20AC;3.7 billion, which you can see on the chart. In the fourth quarter of 2011, our exposure to these countries decreased by &#x20AC;710 million. Year-on-year reductions are principally in Italy and Spain and driven by the need to reduce our overall exposure subsequent to the consolidation of Postbank in late 2010. And for Greece, the reduction report exposure primarily reflects, obviously, the mark downs, some fears, and to some extent, obviously, maturities.</p>
          <p>So this concludes my presentation. And obviously Joe and I are happy to take any questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>
            <mark type="Operator instructions" /> And the first question comes from Kian Abouhossein of JPMorgan. May we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Top-down question. LTRO, I listened to your press conference, you are thinking about it. I want to understand how I mean, first of all you re-fi needs for the next two years. Why not take LTRO to re-fi yourself and why not take LTRO to actually make additional money? So that's the first question. How you think about that when you discuss it.</p>
          <p>The second question is on page 23, is it fair to say that of the &#x20AC;30 billion risk rated asset reduction, &#x20AC;10 billion is real sales, &#x20AC;20 billion is roughly mitigation?</p>
          <p>And I'm trying to understand the number on page 24, the &#x20AC;12 billion increase. And the last question, if I may, is on page 24. Can you tell me what an update on the deductions on the Tier 1 capital on the &#x20AC;43 billion if I assume fully loaded basis?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Kian, thanks for your questions. Let me start with the LTRO question that you asked. Of course, from a pure financial standpoint it is because of its low costs, it's advantageous to P&amp;L, but when we have this discussion we also weigh always then the political discussion around us using these types of funds to survive. And in terms of the bank's liquidity and its access to the market, we really don't &#x2013; wouldn't need these programs. And therefore, what we decided in the first round to do is not to use them, not to expose us to any of these statements that we have seen other banks be exposed to that we had to use these type of funds to survive.</p>
          <p>And I think that was the balance of the initial discussion. Nevertheless, as we move on, we will always consider and counterbalance the financial decision, which obviously at some of the cost that these programs run, it's quite substantial for the bank versus what you could call a reputational issue that we have to address.</p>
          <p>On your page 23 question, I can say that yes, in principle, yeah, there is obviously a mitigation action, that is sales in about the amount that you said. So we had effective sales and the rest of the effects are about mitigation actions that were related to the effects I described in my description at our several different &#x2013; from several different nature.</p>
          <p>And on the update on the capital deductions, I'm not quite sure you referred, because initially I thought you meant the Basel 2.5, I don't know, because any &#x2013; after you said the Basel 3. So I wasn't clear what you wanted to exactly to know there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, sorry. On page 24, the &#x20AC;12 billion, just to understand what that is, the risk weighted asset increase for 2012. And on Basel 3, I'm just trying to understand what your full deduction will be, just an update on full deductions on a fully loaded basis for Basel 3, on capital, sorry.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I think you mentioned in the past &#x20AC;8 billion, out of my head.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. If I can just, then, one more question on the LTRO. Would you ever consider taking money and instead of using it for funding purposes use it to make investments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it's &#x2013; Stefan's already answered that question. I am normally not a friend of carriage risk. And I don't think that we would borrow money to buy sovereign risks, even if there is an attractive spreads. But as we said, we learned a lesson during the Fed activity where we were encouraged to borrow money from the Fed on a confidential level.</p>
          <p>And later on the list was disclosed and we heard that we had to accept help from the government and we just didn't want to do that. And that's why we have not participated in the Fed, and the fact that we have never taken any money from the government has made us from a reputation point of view, so attractive with so many clients in the world that we would be very reluctant to give that up. Now, if it is so attractive in a confidential way, we may see it differently, but it has to be very attractive from an economic point of view.</p>
        </plist>

          <p>Great. Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Clark, Matthew of KBW.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Clark at KBW here. A couple of questions firstly on the press conference. I think there's some commentary that trading revenues were down year-on-year in January. But then, presumably down here, it was very strong last year. So I'm just wondering how you're tracking firstly the more normalized periods. So maybe the second quarter, how January has gone compared to the second quarter run rate last year, for the market division.</p>
          <p>Second question is what contribution to group bottom line was made by the asset management units that are under strategic review and by BHF Bank so we can get an idea of what earnings power might fall out going forward. And then final question is on the proposed domination agreement with Postbank, whether this changes anything for you in terms of timing of cost synergies and issues like liquidity, whether this is going to help your net stable funding ratio, etcetera, and whether it changes anything from a capital point of view at Postbank. Are you still willing to run with Postbank on a <mark type="indiscernible" /> (44:19) capitalized basis? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me start with your January question. Yes, we did have a previous year record, and obviously compared to that, activity in January has been somewhat lower. But versus a normalized year, it is a good January and volumes and profitability is quite good, I can say.</p>
          <p>Your third question on the domination agreement, the domination agreement really doesn't change anything. Postbank is already fully consolidated. The domination agreement only will help us obviously in terms of the planned actions in terms of the synergies. It's important that in the domination agreement, it's legally for us easier to put certain measures in place. As you know today Postbank is an independent company. It has its independent governance bodies and obviously domination agreement helps us to ease down decision making.</p>
          <p>But on the financial point of view, no differences; it has been consolidated. It's planned. We have it in our financial ratios, et cetera. So in that sense, the Deutsche Bank group will &#x2013; obviously Postbank will be integrated and Deutsche Bank will support it. And so that's not &#x2013; you should not expect any substantial differences or any substantial financial or liquidity or capital impacts from the domination agreement itself.</p>
          <p>Your second question, I lost it; can you repeat it again?</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>For the Asset Management Review Unit and BHF Bank Corp, what contribution did they make to group pre-tax in 2011?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, BHF, as I told you, was a loss, so that will certainly &#x2013; but the loss was related to the restructuring activities we did in order to prepare, as I said on my slide, to prepare BHF for any of the strategic options that we may pursue.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>From a group results perspective, it's very minor. So it's not a material number from a group point of view, and on the Asset Management, the activities there, we are selling some businesses where we decided that we don't have the scale, yeah, and any business that's affected by the scale, by scale effects where we did not want to further invest or grow the business, also looking at where we decided to put our capital in the future. Obviously, these businesses did contribute, but also I would rate them in the lower end of contribution to the overall results of the group.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Derek De Vries of Bank of America.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, I have a few questions. First on slide 29, you say your coverage ratios have been falling. I'm just trying to reconcile that with your Q3 outlook that calls for a recession in Europe. And then given that these are coverage ratios on loans excluding collateral, can you just give us a sense of the average probability of default assumption that leads to a coverage ratio of 44% or 46%, depending on how you look at it.</p>
          <p>And then the second question I have is your period end VaR in Q4 was very low compared to historical times. And I guess that reflects the uncertain environment we're operating in. I'm wondering if you could say two or three things that would be encouraging for you and make you talk to the traders about taking more risk. And then finally on that subject, I guess I've heard some speculation that the very low end period VaR might suggest you haven't participated in the January rally to the same extent as peers.  I just wondered if you'd be willing to comment on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, let me start with the VaR question. No, we made a conscious decisoin in the last, in the fourth quarter of last year to really reduce risk. As you know, we were preparing to deal with a capital issue and the derisking for Basel 2.5. So, instead of &#x2013; despite the fact that you know we had not yet achieved our <mark type="indiscernible" /> (48:49), there was a conscious decision made looking also at the environment at the time, activity to just reduce activity a little bit.</p>
          <p>It did not impact our January results, as far as I can see from this seat right now at all, because the results are quite good and therefore not a concern at this point. And that's why I also told you in my comments, yeah, that you should consider that obviously that VaR is going to get up and it also Stress-VaR, both are going to go up and that's why in the capital plan going forward, we also added back some risk weighted assets for you to consider. I think that should give you the trend in terms of what &#x2013; how we believe VaR will be trending.</p>
          <p>On the coverage ratio, on this page 29, where we show the impaired loans, it's very important to note that we have a technical effect in this. We have only to restart -- that obviously the Postbank loans that were &#x2013; all were impaired in the single accounts of Postbank at consolidation date, obviously didn't go in the group statistic, yeah. In the group statistic, and now, as the longer Postbank is with us, and we start taking loan loss provisions against the Postbank loans, obviously they are now migrating into this number and that's why I had told you in previous conferences to expect this number to go up to about &#x20AC;10 billion, which is the historical covered or maybe &#x20AC;11 billion, if I add up the numbers that Postbank has in its single account versus how the numbers appear in the group accounts.</p>
          <p>The coverage ratio is driven by two things. We included a real estate exposure in the fourth quarter with a lower level of provision, which obviously drove the coverage down. But we have collateral and that's obviously important to keep the types of collateral that attract against the statistic different, and therefore obviously this is another of the effects so we had a slightly downwards trend in the coverage ratio. But I think it was not material, and in terms of our credit protection, certainly not a material thing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just on that the probability of default that would be assumed if you're looking at a coverage ratio of 46%, if you strip out Postbank, which is down from 54% at the end of last year, what kind of probability of default you are looking at on your impaired loans?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's obviously an aggregate of these loans. It's a difficult question, Derek. I don't have an average number that I could tell you right now. So, we would have to come up with an average to answer that question. Sorry.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But is it fair to say that the probability of default assumptions you've made have been falling as the coverage ratios have been falling?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, at the end, what we track here are defaulted loans; so they are defaulted. So the question would be: what's the probability of a non-reported loan under this category to go into default. Yeah, and that's &#x2013; in general, the only thing I can certainly tell you out of looking at our average, we've had quite low average as compared to our peers and there was especially at quite, quite low average as compared to American competitors.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And the next question comes from Philipp Zieschang of UBS.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, there. Three questions, please. The first one is on the operational risk weighted asset increase of &#x20AC;14 billion. You mentioned that you basically have set aside a good &#x20AC;1 billion in Core Tier 1 capital by these steps, so is it that technically once you do the litigation provision that the risk weighted assets are being reduced in the operational risk frame or how does it actually work once you take the charge or will the regulator only allow you to gradually reduce the operational risk weighted assets in that case?</p>
          <p>Second thing on the capital tool box, when you mentioned legacy assets and other components, could you just add some color please to the &#x2013; say to the ongoing earnings contributions of your &#x2013; around 20% legacy assets after Basel 3 mitigation? What is your view in terms of book value protection versus the benefits of some capital ratio accretion there?</p>
          <p>And then the third one is in terms of the investment bank and the capacity you obviously have highlighted it during the press conference, your expectations to continue to take further market share. However you've announced, I think 500 million &#x2013; 500 front office reductions in staff. How is your timing in terms of waiting for better markets to really benefit from higher market share, P&amp;L-wise, versus moving towards further capacity adjustments?</p>
          <p>And so what is your thinking then, if Q1 is not really good, would that trigger further reductions or how long are you actually willing to wait until you see the P&amp;L accretion from these positive competitive momentum? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Philipp, you were a little difficult to hear. So in case I don't exactly answer one of your questions just let me know. I understood your first question was related to operational risk weighted assets increase of &#x20AC;14 billion. That Joe already made the allusion to it. We had &#x2013; as you know, we have a little bit this situation that we &#x2013; to have this, obviously, legal activity going on that from our perspective and from an accounting perspective, we cannot estimate nor can we assess its likelihood. And therefore, IFRS does not include any provisioning for future unknown or uncertain or indescribable or not value-able legal reserves.</p>
          <p>In order to protect the bank and the bank's capital, we took this decision to take this &#x20AC;1 billion additional capital hit which was agreed with our regulator as well. And the point is, we translated that into the &#x20AC;14 billion risk weighted assets. And of course you're right. Technically, as we move on and either these losses would not materialize in their size or we would work through further settlements and the claims would go away, then obviously this capital charge will go away again.</p>
          <p>So, but we obviously don't expect this to come down one for one as we take legal charges, but from a timing especially point of view; yeah, so we certainly, as we cannot monitor that because of the uncertainty of when charges occur and how high they are. So, it's not like a mathematical one for one, but over time, over several year period at the latest you can assume that this will be reduced and taken out again. And that's the meaning of a capital charge of this nature to protect and to make sure that our capital is not overstated looking at the risk. Yes, in the accounting we can't do much there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And is it fair to add a tax shield so that the actual charge would then be &#x20AC;1.3 billion or so?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you have to say you could translate that into how much net income that theoretically would be and then you can gross it up for tax and then you could theoretically make an assumption of how much protection you have. And if you take a 33% tax rate you would see that we, that provides quite a substantial protection from a P&amp;L point of view. And I think that would be one way you could certainly look at it.</p>
          <p>The second on the capital toolbox, you did ask whether legacy assets contribute on an-ongoing basis and to some extent the answer is, these legacy assets some of them obviously are still interest earnings assets, so they do contribute P&amp;L. And that's certainly our decision sometimes to delay some of the sales had something to do with these legacy assets were providing.</p>
          <p>And the second, obviously, they are subject to mark-to-market charges that depending on how market go could be negative or positive. And that's something we look at it. So, in an improved environment, these legacy assets could eventually even also provide additional P&amp;L. But let's not forget that legacy assets are also tying up capital that obviously we could replace with much more profitable business in the future. And that's obviously why we have described them as legacy and certainly will use any opportunity we can to reduce that portfolio.</p>
          <p>The third question you asked is the investment. The best example I can give you, I think we have always reported on GTB that in times that we were gaining market share, that we were gaining additional clients. And you saw already in the last year that all these efforts have started to materialize and to affect the P&amp;L. And I can also say the good position that the investment bank has now gained in terms of its market share, in terms of its position that I have highlighted in the chart, of course is a great asset as markets recover to build upon.</p>
          <p>Yes, we have to, and that's always the call that management has to do, we have to take a bet or a guess and therefore, obviously, first we have decided to further reduce our cost base. And that's what we did last year as <mark type="ph" /> Andrea (59:08) said during the press conference, I think we're done at this point and that's the platform we believe, we have right now. But let's wait how the first quarter goes and let's wait how the European crisis get addressed and resolved and then we will have to make a decision. But certainly it's always helpful when you improve your market position, your client relationships, and your market share that at some point it certainly will translate into P&amp;L as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I had a few questions. The litigation &#x20AC;1 billion, what's the math behind that? Why &#x20AC;1 billion, why not &#x20AC;0.5 billion or &#x20AC;2 billion?

          <p>And then my next question was on the credit risk weighted asset reductions of &#x20AC;23 billion. Could you split that by what's the real reduction and what is model optimization?</p>
          <p>And then the final question was on your &#x20AC;12 billion increase in market risk <mark type="ph" /> weighted delays (1:00:19). That looks like an 18% increase, which would only take your VaR up to something like &#x20AC;66 million, which would still be a very low number. I wonder why you're still wanting to run with such a low VaR. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we &#x2013; to start with &#x2013; we decided to reduce risk and that's what we decided to do in the second half year of last year looking at the environment, and yes, we have been running a quite low historical low VaR in these months. And it's, at the end, a management decision, and that's sort of relative to &#x2013; it's obviously clear that at some point it will come up and that I can only repeat again that's why we have guided you to be aware that we are increasing. Our current VaR is at 56 right now for Q4. So you see about your number we are low down in that area, and that's not sustainable it's clear, and that's also not our decision to run the investment bank on that level in the future.</p>
          <p>The next question was the litigation, &#x20AC;1 billion, well the litigation &#x20AC;1 billion, again actually if I could estimate the amounts, and if I could estimate because I could do a reserve under IFRS. So don't ask me the question on capital that I'm not able to answer from an accounting point. It's our best guess of the type of protection we want without it referring to any math or any logical math or any calculations or any experiences we've had so far. It's just a number that we felt is, it's a conservative number to put on the books to protect our capital. So there is no &#x2013; no particular math behind it.</p>
          <p>And on the &#x2013; on the credit risk, risk weighted assets question, about half we can say is real risk reduction. The other half is about for model and process improvements. But let me take out one spin. These model improvements because there is always this spin like model improvements are something bad or some factoring the numbers, this is &#x2013; we are very scrutinized by the BaFin on terms of applying the Basel allowed frameworks, and the models were put in place and reviewed and approved by our regulator one by one after a long test and an audit. It's not something that we decided on the 15th of December to change our model, and therefore got these results.</p>
          <p>So our &#x2013; let's not forget the banking regulation based on the decision that we took, in terms of how we are going to deal with application of the regulation mandates us to continue and further enhance our models and roll them out, because that was part of the Basel 2.0 requirement that we have.</p>
          <p>So, I think it's important that these changes are longer-term. They need approval. They are scrutinized. Every bank, by the way, every bank could do that if they decide to embark on this as well. And I think, every bank would be under the same type of enforcement. So in that sense, half and half from these two measures.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Could I just go back to the litigation, because at the Q3 stage your put back volumes you disclosed were &#x20AC;508 million, and at that stage you said your reserves were not material but you believed them to be adequate. And now you've taken &#x20AC;1 billion extra. What changed there? The put back volumes gone through the roof or why has your attitude changed?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Joe, here. It's not something we changed in our assessment. The BaFin insisted on allocating &#x20AC;1billion to legal risk. That's why we are doing it, and I think it's also to clearly demonstrate that they are a tough regulator. And we felt that we wouldn't have had to do it this year. We could have done it next year; that was the agreement. But we did this year because, our Core Tier 1 ratio was so high and with the opinion even much higher that we said we take it and we are still at 9.5%. So, that is what has really happened here.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi there, I just wanted to follow up on the compensation disclosure, please. Have you given us, or could you give us the cost that you've expensed in 2011 for prior year bonus deferrals and also what that number was in 2010? So, that's my first question, the cost of prior year deferrals.</p>
          <p>The second question is, could you, just related to that actually, could you talk about the amortization profile of the amounts that you are telling us here you've deferred into the future. Does that get booked, say a third, a third, a third in the coming three years, or is it mainly in 2012. If you could talk about that, that will be helpful?</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Jeremy, I'm sorry. Please understand that on terms of these compensation items, we, for competitive reasons don't disclose much more than we have provided in the chart. I can help you a little bit in terms of the third, third, third. It doesn't exactly apply like that because obviously there are some early retirement effects also that tend to move charges a little bit and skew the third, third, third to a different pattern. But please understand that for competitive reasons we cannot disclose any further than we have already.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. And the next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good afternoon everybody. Yes, a couple of questions on slide 24, you won't be surprised. First of all, obviously having done such a good job on the mitigation in the fourth quarter, when we look at the left-hand side of that chart and look at the &#x20AC;105 billion uplift, I think that's after about &#x20AC;80 billion of mitigation if I remember rightly from previous slides. Can you talk a little bit about how you think at the moment that might split down between sales and between other measures and perhaps what you think about in terms of loss of revenue, because obviously, you said that you don't feel you had much impact in Q4 on that area?</p>
          <p>And then secondly, perhaps on the &#x20AC;499 billion, the products that you have going through to 2013, is that just a sort of simulation saying well we will leave the same number for the end of the year because we don't want to make any projections. Or is this something that you are planning to do? Because clearly, if it does go beyond that, then obviously that is going to have quite an impact on your capital. But at the same time, it seems that given you're taking market share and obviously doing really well in that area, it does seem that that might actually hinder you if you do stick at that kind of level and again have an impact on revenue which in turn of course will impact that &#x20AC;5 billion on the right-hand side that we are all forecasting at the moment. Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think this is always the same thing, if you provide disclosure then, if you don't, there is always more questions to answer. But let's only agree the Basel 3 simulation is really a simulation to give you a size on orders of magnitude, and of course, at the end we are running still a business, and we will grow and want to grow this business, and if there's improved markets and revenue opportunities what goes hand in hand is, obviously, our retained earnings should go higher, and therefore, we can put more risk weighted assets on the books.</p>
          <p>So there is &#x2013; at the same time, of course, VaR will increase, and therefore we will have some more exposure. So to promise many of these parameters moved in different scenarios and we have provided you with one scenario, which you're correct. We assumed that we will have no change in risk weighted assets and did what we always call <mark type="ph" /> et cetera parables (1:08:32) analysis just to show you the sizes of magnitude.</p>
          <p>And honestly, if you look back at our track record, we've rather stayed on the conservative, yeah, and in terms of giving market guidance of what we can do and what we should be able to do and obviously we do have some great opportunities there. So, I'm going to reiterate that we are very pleased with the progress we made for Basel 2.5. In fact, even after considering some future uptick in risk weighted assets as markets normalize, it will be still fair to say that we overachieved significantly our initial targets.</p>
          <p>And that having said, please bear in mind that there are still remaining uncertainty around the interpretation of certain specifics of the future Basel 3 rules as well. So, that's why I can't provide any definitive numbers here. So, depending on how the final interpretation come out, we might be facing higher or lower risk weighted assets before management action, but then the impact from the same management action would also be higher or lower in risk weighted assets some.</p>
          <p>And that's why I can only give you here now my &#x2013; our best estimate and it is our best estimate at the current point in time and obviously, we keep it updated so we can provide you the information around. But yes, of course we understand that there might be changes to this calculation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in terms of what you are thinking about in terms of possible loss of revenue in 2012 regarding that &#x20AC;105 billion, can you give us any view on that, or again you're thinking it's going to be really, really small?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our current thinking is that it's really small as we just finished our budget planning and honestly, there was not a significant impact from it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Well, thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, just to make one example again in Deutsche Bank alone we start at &#x20AC;70 billion. We always said you remember that during the capital raising that we think the core business will require roughly &#x20AC;40 billion. We are somewhat half the way. So, there is more to come, just from that side and that's no revenues because there was return on capital of almost zero in the non-core business and 30% in the core business. That gives you one example.</p>
          <p>And then we have the flexibility in terms of asset sales which we discussed before when we talked about maybe asset management pieces. That's another, quite a substantial part of it. And as you see, we are now between 8.5% and 9.5% and fully loaded. So without phasing in, we will be already at 7%. So, capital, once again, is not an issue here.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well. This last one. Could I say that's very impressive, and you have done well? But clearly the last banks who were still looking at non-phased in capital ratios in 2013 were your French competitors, who have now subsequently moved to looking to 2013 as the key date. So, I'm just intrigued by the fact that, and of course you're in line with the 2019 deadline. But I'm just intrigued that you're still very comfortable talking about the non-fully phased in ratio at that point in time, when all of your competitors have gone to something different. I mean it's good to stand out from the crowd; I agree. But I am just interested in your thoughts on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said before, we can fully phase it in and we are 7%-plus and that's without any further actions and we just talked about one action in the assets sale, which will add more so, so very comfortable on that side as well.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Next question comes from Jon Peace of Nomura. May we have your question please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you. I'd two quick questions please. The first one is, you enjoyed a relatively low tax rates in 2011 and I just wondered what we should expect for 2012. Should it be a return to the 34% rate you've guided to us before?</p>
          <p>And the second question was on the dividend. You obviously held it flat last year. How should we think about when you might start to increase that again and what you might target? Do you have a particular, for example, Basel 3, Core Tier 1 in mind, that you'd like to reach before the dividend becomes progressive again? Thanks very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Let me say, it's not really about Basel 3 requirement, markets will expect from us and of course if markets seem to be less patient and than regulators, we may have to adjust that. But for the time-being I think we are on the high side even certainly in terms of regulatory requirements but, I would also say in terms of market expectations, certainly in terms of the EBA numbers.</p>
          <p>And as long as the focus is on capital and it is on capital, I don't think that dividend makes a huge difference. But we decided to keep the dividend stable this year, because it wouldn't have made such a difference. I mean, we are talking about a few basis points ups and downs, if we had reduced it or increased it. So, I think, we have given the right, in my view, the right message that, yes, we believe in that we do not need additional capital; that's why we can keep the dividend flat. Otherwise, we would have reduced it and we would have been better off in terms of capital ratios.</p>
          <p>And secondly, that there for a time being the focus is on capital and that's why we didn't increase dividend, dividend increase of about 30% would have added roughly 6 basis points to capital ratio. So, it would not have been a big difference. But it wouldn't have given the right message in my view.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, the tax, to your tax question. Yeah, we had a low tax rate, obviously in the year. But that had something to do with the effects we saw in the fourth quarter. First of all, we did have less profits in high tax countries and we had higher profits in lower tax countries, which draws down the average. And second, we had some geographies where we had a loss carry forward that based on the profitability we accrued in these geographies we could use and therefore reducing our deferred tax as a position. So you have to look at them as more one-off effects. And therefore, as I stated in my presentation, you go please back and use 30% to 35% as our larger longer-term ongoing rate.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I had a few. Could I just go back to Joe's comment on look through? I think you said 7%, but I was unclear as to what year that would be obviously because that tells us what the deductions are. And the other area was liquidity portfolio. I'm trying to understand the fixed income result in the second half because obviously on a comparative basis to peers if you do your market share analysis that you talked about, looks somewhat different second half versus first. What are the factors because you are saying it's not derisking, so is it something to do with the liquidity portfolio? Does that &#x2013; does the relative absolute cost go through fixed income results? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. About the first question to be specific, it is January 2013 without phasing in, 7%. Okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then &#x2013; no, no &#x2013; our liquidity situation portfolio has nothing to do with that business area, that's not where we book the results. We keep our business divisions independent from our funding decisions. So that would not be a good comparison to make. It did not have an impact in fixed income.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So what do you think it was? Because if you look at the second half as a percentage of, say the top nine or something versus the first, in the performance is somewhat different versus the full year. And I'm just trying to understand what was...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well you know, Fiona, the market environment was quite different in the first than in the second half. This business is obviously impacted by the sovereign &#x2013; the European sovereign crisis. And let's not forget we always have a skew towards Europe, because our presence and strengths lies in Europe, on average. We have grown our U. S. franchise quite a bit and it has success there as well. But we historically obviously tend to have it skew towards Europe and Europe was more heavily hit by a lack of client activity and lack of activity overall. And of course you always have the choice to increase risks and take more risks to develop but we made the decision not to do so looking at the environment. And that's, by the way, what you also can see in all our risk metrics that we considered.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, hi. Yeah I had a question again on the Basel 3. Was trying to think about the <mark type="ph" /> RWA cyclality (1:18:07). From my understanding you have a point in time model and risk rates have come down quite significantly over the last three years of disclosure. So on the flip side as the default cycle turns, how much <mark type="ph" /> RWA cyclality (1:18:23) could we actually get in a more difficult environment.</p>
          <p>And my second question was around the German retail business, just trying to get a feel for what you're thinking about margins following the recent break-up? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me start with the German retail business. It's one of these misconceptions that we've had for years that German retail is not profitable based on the fact on how the market is structured. In the segment in which we operate with a business model that we have operated, we have always had good margins and to be honest, in the &#x2013; when I look at the profit that our business were able to achieve in the last year in Germany, we continue to have a very good margin development. Let's not forget, we have an advisory banking business model; we're not in significantly in consumer lending. Yeah, we are &#x2013; obviously, we are impacted by less activity in the markets towards the second half year because in our advisory banking we then will miss some fees. But a very strong mortgage business in Germany. That by the way we can demonstrate also now on Postbank it's the same effect, the mortgage business in Germany is very stable and because we don't have this real estate cycles and that business continues to be strong and delivers good margins.</p>
          <p>Let's not forget most of the mortgages in terms are longer-term mortgages with fixed rates that obviously now are benefiting from the interest environment in terms of the margin. On top of it we continuously have reported very low loan losses and reserves for loan losses classically in the German market which is a big benefit so the perceived affect that we have a little bit higher operating costs than some of our other European competitors in other geographies was fully compensated by the fact that we have much lower loan loss provisions. So therefore, it is a profitable business and it was a profitable business in the last year and interesting enough on the both sides on the Blue Bank and on Postbank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to clarify my question, on the net interest margin outlook, the lower interest rate environment you don't think will have a meaningful impact?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, over time of course, if we assume a longer term lower interest rate, that's a good question that will remain as the new business comes in. But that's not something that impacted us at that point in time. I think it's fair to assume that over a longer period of time that might have an impact on margins. But I don't see this as substantial.</p>
          <p>And then you asked in your question about the variability over the cycle, and you are absolutely right. There is risk weighted asset variability over the cycle. But I'm a little reluctant to give you a number right now because I think it change over time as the rules change. We just went from Basel 2 to 2.5 and we'll go to Basel 3. And therefore we have to adjust our positions in that. But I can certainly say, when we talk about modeling process contributing half of risk weighted assets reduction, this was obviously the credit risk; it was related to the credit risk only. There was no model or foreign contribution to the market risk weighted assets risk reduction to clarify that. And in terms of your variability, it's difficult to estimate on an overall portfolio basis.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But the point in time methodology that you use which is fairly unique, I think in Europe does make you more <mark type="ph" /> pro-cyclical. (1:22:15) Is that correct?</p>

          <p>So, to start with Taunus, this is an ongoing project still. We have come to our tax group which was one of the projects we had in the United States; so, we have a single tax group which puts us in a good position to use some of the deferred tax positions that we have in the United States. But we have not yet completed the debanking project. So, that's number one.</p>
          <p>And number two; your first question on the fixed income, the answer is none. It's non material to pass it on. And, on the &#x2013; we have on the goodwill and intangibles we have &#x20AC;12.9 billion goodwill and intangibles for <mark type="ph" /> our reg (1:23:42) purposes.</p>

          <p>Okay. So for Taunus then, will it be tough to undergo the U.S. stress test?</p>

          <p>Thank you. Just a few concluding remarks. First of all, thank you very much for your questions. Just let me highlight again that we focused on capital and liquidity and we continue to do so. That's clearly very, very important on our agenda. We have also accelerated some legal issues, settlements and markdowns in the fourth quarter, in order to be &#x2013; have an intact platform in 2012.</p>
          <p>And I think, the operating results have been strong for all the businesses with the exception of investment banking in the second half, after a very strong beginning. And we, as we said, we are confident that we have platform in place now, which can be very successful going forward as soon as markets normalize. We all depend very much on the Greek situation. Negotiations are ongoing and rather confident that we will find the solution within a relatively short period of time.</p>
          <p>So enjoy the day, and thanks for your attendance.</p>
