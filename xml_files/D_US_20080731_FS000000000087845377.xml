          <p>Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Dominion Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We now have Mr. Tom Farrell, Dominion's Chief Executive Officer, and other members of management in conference. Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of managements prepared remarks, we will open the floor for questions. At that time, instructions will be given as the procedure to follow should you want to ask a question.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Laura Kottkamp, Director of Investor Relations.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, and welcome to Dominion's second quarter earnings conference call. During this call, we will refer to certain schedules included in this morning's earnings release and pages from our second quarter 2008 earnings release kit. Schedules in the earnings release kit are intended to answer the more detailed discrete questions pertaining to operating statistics and accounting. Investor Relations will be available after the call for any clarification of these schedules.</p>
          <p>While we encourage you to call with questions in the time permitted after our prepared remarks, we ask that you use the time to address questions of a strategic nature, or those related to third quarter 2008 guidance. If you've not done so, I encourage you to visit our website, register for e-mail alert and view our second quarter 2008 earnings documents. Our website address is www.dom.com/investors.</p>
          <p>The earnings release and other matters that will be discussed on the call today may contain forward-looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations.</p>
          <p>Also on this call we will discuss some measures about our company's performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Those measures include operating earnings before interest and tax commonly referred to as EBIT. Reconciliation of such measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures we are able to calculate and report are contained in our earnings release kit.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tom Chewning. Tom?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Laura, and good morning everyone. After I give you an overview of second quarter results and third quarter operating earnings guidance, each of our business unit heads will review second quarter performance and discuss what they foresee for the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Following that, our CEO Tom Farrell, will comment on several key accomplishments and other items of current interest. We will then be happy to answer your questions.</p>
          <p>Dominion recorded GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share and operating earnings of $0.50 per share for the second quarter of 2008. You will recall that in the first quarter we made adjustments for weather and certain tax items which lowered our operating earnings by $0.03 per share.</p>
          <p>We made these adjustments to provide a clear comparison of actual performance through quarterly guidance. This morning we will do the same for the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Adjusting for weather health, storm damage and negative tax items result in operating income of $0.52 per share for the quarter, at the top end of our guidance range of 47 to $0.52 per share.</p>
          <p>As seen on our schedule of these adjustments on Dominion's Investor Relations website, under supplemental schedules, electric utility weather added $0.01 per share to earnings as a result of cooling degree days that were above their historic average, but that normally high storm restoration expenses costs us $0.02 per share.</p>
          <p>Additionally, our consolidated effective income tax rate was higher than our guidance. The variance was driven primarily by certain state tax impacts. At our effective tax rate in 37% as expected, earnings would have been higher by approximately $10 million or $0.02 per share.</p>
          <p>Looking ahead to the third quarter, Dominion expects operating earnings in the range of $0.87 to $0.92 per share. This compared to operating earnings of $0.86 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Drivers expected to compare favorably to 2007 include higher contributions from our merchant generation business, growth in electric utility sales, higher volumes and realized prices for the company's remaining E&amp;P operations and lower share count.</p>
          <p>Expected offsets include a return to normal whether in our electric utility service area, higher maintenance and depreciation expenses, in our regulated electric and gas businesses, and certain state income tax legislation enacted in July of 2008.</p>
          <p>Complete details of the company's third quarter 2008 guidance can be found on pages 39 through 46 of Dominion's earnings release kit.</p>
          <p>In consideration of our year-to-date operating earnings, and our limited sensitivity to commodity price changes, we are comfortable in tightening our 2008 operating earnings guidance range from $3.05 to $3.15 per share to $3.10 to $3.15 per share. We are also raising our 2009 operating earnings outlook from $3.25 to $3.40 per share, to $3.30 to $3.45 per share. This change reflects expected positive impacts of the sale of Marcellus shale drilling rights and higher margins from our generation business.</p>
          <p>During the last month, we have fielded a number of calls from investors, enquiring about Dominion's liquidity position. At the end of the second quarter, liquidity was $1.2 billion compared to $2.3 billion at the end of the first quarter. The primary reason for this decrease was rising commodity prices, resulting in posting of more margin to support our hedges.</p>
          <p>We have just closed a $500 million, 364-day credit facility that was syndicated to a dozen of our relationship banks. This new facility combined with a declining commodity prices since the end of quarter raises current liquidity to $2.4 billion.</p>
          <p>Also, we have restructured the margin requirements on the vast majority of existing hedges to reduce the need to post additional margins should commodity prices rise from present levels. We are comfortable that our liquidity position is more than adequate considering the number of hedge contracts we hold, and the underlying margin requirements.</p>
          <p>This concludes my remarks. I will now pass the call on to Dave Heacock, President of Dominion Virginia Power. This is Dave's first call as head with Dominion Virginia Power since taking over from Jay Johnson, who left us in June to join General Dynamics. Dave?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Tom. Dominion Virginia Power produced second quarter EBIT of $165 million, just outside the guidance range of 166 million to $178 million as shown on page 33 of our earnings release kit.</p>
          <p>Severe storm activity drove up O&amp;M expenses by $17 million. This hurt was partially offset by Dominion Retail's positive financial performance. Our regular electric transmission and distribution businesses faced significant operating challenges in the second quarter.</p>
          <p>Statistics on lightning strikes, wind speeds and tornado activity confirm that portions of our service territory experienced unusually high levels of extreme weather. Transmission lines were torn down and distribution facilities sustained hurricane type damage in several areas. Northern Virginia was hit particularly hard experiencing six severe storms in 17 days during June.</p>
          <p>Despite the extraordinary level of high risk situations our employees have been exposed to during storm restoration, we continue to see improvement in our safety performance in the second quarter of 2008 as compared to 2007.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date OSHA recordable incident rates are down from 2.4 to 1.8. This is the number of incidents per 100 employees per year. This quarter we announced our Virginia energy conservation plan which is expected to produce sizeable environmental benefits and cost savings to our customers.</p>
          <p>The key component of the plan is an investment of approximately $600 million in smart grid technologies that will enable energy to be delivered more efficiently to our customers as well as provide improvements in service reliability.</p>
          <p>Looking to third quarter guidance, shown on page 40 of our earnings release kit, we expect to produce EBIT in the range of 173 million to a 188 &#x2013; $189 million. Our expectation is lower than the EBIT produced in the third quarter of last year, primarily due to return to normal weather and higher O&amp;M expenses attributable to targeted investments in reliability and the 2008 energy conservation, demand-side management pilot.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Paul Koonce. Paul?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Dave. Energy's second quarter EBIT of $150 million was toward the high end of our guidance of 137 to 159 million, mainly driven by higher natural gas liquids margins at transmission and better than expected non-traditional sales at Dominion East Ohio.</p>
          <p>While we did not meet our margin expectations at producer services, this segment remains poised to capture low risk market opportunities related to its storage and transportation capacity. 2008 is setting up similar to last year producer services, with most of the transportation storage value realized during the transition from summer to winter season.</p>
          <p>Energy safety performance is not keeping pace with the general reduction in OSHA recordables we are seeing elsewhere at Dominion. This is our busiest summer ever at transmission, E&amp;P and distribution. But even when adjusting for man hours, OSHA incident rates are up.</p>
          <p>Year-to-date our OSHA incident rate is 2.7 versus 2.64 year-to-date 2007. While these are predominantly first aid incidents, not resulting in lost time, we are nevertheless taking a number of steps to further highlight safety.</p>
          <p>Operationally we experienced a 10% quarter-over-quarter increase of industrial throughput at Dominion East Ohio, due to increased steel and refining operations in our service territory. We are also on pace to have installed over 350,000 automated meters by year end. When this program is complete, it will improve customer service and eliminate the need for estimated bills. We began installation last year and we've had excellent implementation to date.</p>
          <p>At E&amp;P, production is up 14% quarter-over-quarter excluding royalty interest production, and we've drilled 109 new wells this quarter versus 103 wells for the same quarter of last year. As part of this years drilling program, we've drilled five vertical Marcellus wells in Pennsylvania with good success.</p>
          <p>These Marcellus wells were drilled in order to strengthen our view of the Marcellus shale value. To this end, we are pleased with the previously announced sale of the drilling rights to a 2,500 foot interval, on 205,000 acres in Appalachia to Antero Resources for $552 million. This interval includes the target for the Marcellus shale production.</p>
          <p>As part of the E&amp;P announcement with Antero, we are in the midst of an open season for Dominion Keystone, a one Bcf per day pipeline to move new Marcellus' volumes, from the basin to markets along the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
          <p>A number of other projects are either under construction or in late stages of development at transmission. Under construction this summer are the USA storage project and the Cove Point terminal and related facility.</p>
          <p>In addition to the two new LNG storage tanks and related vaporization equipment at Cove Point, the downstream portion of the expansion includes 162 miles of large diameter pipeline, eight new or expanded compressor stations and eight new storage wells.</p>
          <p>We are expecting a FERC certificate for our Hub I project any day now. And we are preparing FERC applications for our Hub II and Hub III projects and our pier modernization project. The pier project will enable Cove Point to receive the most modern and technologically advanced ships in the world. The pier modernization project is expected to be completed in late 2011, will require $50 million of new capital and it is fully subscribed by Statoil.</p>
          <p>During this quarter we also held an open season for Appalachian Gateway project, a combination of gathering, processing and mainline transmission, that will increase our gathering capability about 50%, processing capability about 25% and firm transportation by up to 500 million per day. The capital cost of Appalachian Gateway is expected to be in the 6 to $800 million range. We expect to execute binding precedent agreements with producers before the end of the third quarter.</p>
          <p>Looking to third quarter guidance, which you can view on page 41 of the earnings release kit, we project an EBIT range of 128 to $158 million, the mid point of which is an increase of approximately $14 million or an 11% increase over third quarter of 2007. We expect earnings to be up due to natural gas liquids margins and higher natural gas prices, offset somewhat by higher O&amp;M and higher DD&amp;A</p>
          <p>Now, I would like to turn the call over to Mark McGettrick. Mark?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Paul. Dominion Generation produced strong second quarter results with earnings before interest and taxes EBIT of $397 million. These results were $12 million better or 3% above the high end of our guidance range and $195 million above the second quarter of 2007.</p>
          <p>Even removing the positive effect of above normal whether in our utility service area, Generation result would still be at the top of our guidance range. The major drivers of these results were the return to full recovery of fuel in Virginia, stronger wholesale revenues and other margins in our regulated utility service territory and increased margins at our merchant fleet.</p>
          <p>Operational performance for our utility fleet was excellent, with a lower second quarter equivalent forced outage rate in three years at 5%. Our Nuclear performance was mixed with a 97.3% capacity factor excluding refueling outages and a record setting plant refueling outage at Surry Unit 2.</p>
          <p>However, our nuclear merchant fleet's planned outages ran 12 days longer than anticipated. We are very pleased that even with these extended outage days we were able to exceed our earnings guidance range.</p>
          <p>In addition to our financial results I would like to discuss four other key items impacting Generation business since our last call. First, Generation safety performance continues to be excellent. With our second quarter 2008 OSHA recordable incident rate for our nuclear, fossil and hydro operations coming in at 0.24 and 0.79 respectively. Our Millstone and Surry stations were recertified to Voluntary Protection Programs "Star" status and remain the only fully certified fleet in the industry.</p>
          <p>Second, new hedging disclosure for our merchant fleet; as you can see on page 48 of our earnings release kit, we have increased our Northeast base load hedge percentages in 2009 to approximately 90%, which reflects an average hedge price of $80. We've also disclosed for the first time our base load average hedge pricing for 2010 which are Northeast at $80 and PJM at about $56 per megawatt hour. With our merchant fleet almost completely hedged in 2008 and 2009, we have little exposure to near term dark spread reductions</p>
          <p>Third, our growth plans produced the addition of over 550 megawatts of new generation in our regulated and merchant fleets, bringing our entire fleet capability up to approximately 27,000 megawatts. Additions in our merchant fleet include 82 megawatts of new wind production added as our share of the NedPower joint venture in West Virginia and 60 megawatts added at our Fairless Energy facility in Pennsylvania.</p>
          <p>Fourth, we returned our last two units to operation at our Salem Harbor facility in Massachusetts earlier this month. This completes the restoration of over 700 megawatts to the grid following their forced outage in November 2007.</p>
          <p>Finally, looking to third quarter guidance you can see on page 42 of our earnings guidance kit that we project in EBIT range of 745 to $818 million, the mid point of which is an increase of approximately $45 million or 6% over the third quarter of 2007. We expect the quarter's results to be driven by continued strong growth in regulated electric sales and wholesale revenues in our utility fleet, and continue growth in margins in our merchant portfolio, partially offset by a return to normal weather in Virginia.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Tom Farrell.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. We had an extremely active second quarter in carrying out our strategic plans. In our first quarter call, I reviewed a number of significant state and FERC regulated projects that were awaiting regulatory action. I am pleased to report to you today that most of those approvals have now been received.</p>
          <p>As important as individual projects are in their own right, their role in collectively positioning us to achieve our overall growth in operating earnings per share of at least 6% annually, is equally as important.</p>
          <p>We keep a very close eye on meeting the targets in the growth plan we outlined for you early last fall. Today, I will give you an update on the substantial progress we've made during the second quarter and what lies ahead.</p>
          <p>As you know, we face a projected short fall of 4,000 megawatts in our regulated Virginia service territory. We continue to work to bring new generation and transmission capacity into service as economically and quickly as possible. New transmission lines to transport the addition megawatts that maintain reliability within the congested areas of our state are vital. These lines are not always easy to site or construct.</p>
          <p>We are pursuing about a dozen projects of Virginia, two of which are new 500 kV lines. I am pleased to report that since our last call the Virginia State Corporation Commission Hearing Examiner has recommend approval of both of those 500 kV lines.</p>
          <p>In May, the Carson to Suffolk line and just this past Monday, the key Meadow Brook to Loudoun line to serve the Washington D.C. suburbs. The Meadow Brook line is the final segment of a line that extends from Pennsylvania through West Virginia known as TrAILCo. Those two segments are still under regulatory review, and the recommended approval in Virginia for the Meadow Brook line is conditioned on approvals in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, which are expected soon.</p>
          <p>Each of the Virginia 500 kV projects is an approximately $250 million investment. We hope to have final SCC approvals this fall, with in service dates in 2011.</p>
          <p>In light of the challenges these projects and the others present, on July 1, we filed the request with FERC for an enhanced ROE of 125 to 150 basis points on 11 different transmission enhancement projects, beginning when each enters commercial operation. For Meadow Brook to Loudoun and Carson to Suffolk lines we have requested a 150 basis points adder to the 11.4% return previously authorized by FERC. We expect resolution of those requests which are in line with other rulings by FERC by the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Notably in late June we received the air permit, excuse me, necessary to begin construction of the Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center. We began work on the facility immediately. The plant will bring nearly 600 megawatts on line upon its completion in 2012. The start date allowed us to avoid any significant cost increase in our construction contract and we will not need any regulatory relief due to the delay.</p>
          <p>Predicatively several environmental groups have filed appeals of both the SCC approval and of the air permit. Under Virginia law it is a general rule; the actions of state agencies can only be overturned if they are found to be arbitrary and capricious. That is an extraordinary burden to overcome. Construction continues and will continue apace.</p>
          <p>Also during the quarter, we brought 400 new megawatts online in Virginia. Our gas &#x2013; our Ladysmith units 3 and 4 added 300 megawatt to the fleet and at four of our gas powered plants we completed up grades that provided another 100 megawatts to our service territory. Also in the quarter we began construction on Ladysmith 5, which will add 150 megawatt next summer.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter we also received notice at the hearing for our 580 megawatt Bear Garden combined-cycle facility will begin on September 30. That plant has an estimated in service date of 2011.</p>
          <p>Also in June we reached a settlement of our fuel case with the SCC staff, the Office of Consumer Counsel and many other interveners. The SCC approved this settlement and the new rights became effective July 1st. In light of the steep increase in commodity prices we are deferring as a regulatory asset a portion of the fuel increase to lessen the impact on our customers.</p>
          <p>Additionally in the second quarter, we notified the Department of Energy that we would file a loan guarantee application for a third nuclear reactor at North Anna. The deadline for filing Part I of the application is the end of September and we will be filing it in the near future. This is one more step in a multi-year process. Our next steps include obtaining the DOE loan guarantee, negotiating an EPC agreement and seeking State Corporation Commission approval.</p>
          <p>Let me emphasize, that we will not take on any undue risk for our customers or debt and equity investors. On a different note, a comment on the Court of Appeals ruling that overturned CAIR [Clean Air Interstate Rule]. We have completed our evaluation of the potential outcomes of this decision. We do not expect any impact on our future earnings outlook. As we have mentioned in the past, future sales of excess emissions have not been included on our guidance or presumed in our forecast of annual growth and operating earnings of 6% or more annually.</p>
          <p>Dominion has always been proactive in our approach to environmental compliance. But you can expect us to proceed cautiously both in our regulated and merchant fleet until we are certain of the new mandate. We are focused on executing our build plan to meet the growing demand for power through new plants, operates on existing plants and new transmission lines. But we recognized that better technology in our system and demand-side management program for consumers can help reduce the overall amount of electricity consumed. For this reason we announced a significant energy conservation plan which Dave Heacock spoke about earlier. We expect to file for approval of that program early next year.</p>
          <p>We were also working to reach a settlement with interveners in the Ohio Public Service Commission staff for new rates at Dominion East Ohio. This will be the first rate base &#x2013; this will be the first base rate increase at that LDC in over 14 years. The only unresolved issue is rate design. The Ohio staff supports a straight fix variable design; the consumer advocate supports a decoupling design. We can support either so we are working hard to bridge this philosophical divide and place new rates into effect.</p>
          <p>The sales process for people in Hub concluded at the beginning of this month. We have a new buyer for these properties and we expect a disapproval process will not face the same challenges as the last sale. We expect to close by this time next year.</p>
          <p>Many of you have wandered when you should expect additional announcements about our remaining Marcellus acreage in Appalachia which after the Antero farm out constitutes between 400,000 and 600,000 remaining acres.</p>
          <p>While we do not have a set time table, we are exploring other similar transactions in the regions. We continue to receive unsolicited calls of interest for similar transactions and we are being deliberate as we engage third parties. You can be sure though that we are continuing to explore ways to realize the value for our shareholders. We are keeping our options open including addition farm outs, retaining some acreage for partnering. We'll have more to say on this issue certainly before the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Lastly, I would like to discuss the recent court case involving Cove Point. Last week the D.C. Court of Appeals issued its decision on Washington Gas Light's appeal on the FERC order approving our expansion project. This project enlarges our terminal and adds related pipeline and natural gas storage facilities on both the Cove Point and the mini-transmission systems.</p>
          <p>WGL had argued for the re-gasified LNG from Cove Point that caused leaks in its distribution system and that the expansion project might increase the problem. FERC disagreed and found that the leaks resulted from the improper manner in which WGL, Washington Gas Light, had installed its couplings. The Court of Appeals upheld FERC on that key issue that WGL is responsible for the defects.</p>
          <p>However the Court did remand the case to FERC to better explain its conclusion that the project will not pose a safety hazard. We expect FERC to act quickly to address this very narrow issue. On Monday we filed a motion to expedite resolution of the case. FERC has already given notice of a technical conference to be held next week on August 6. Washington Gas Light itself has stated repeatedly, that its system is ready to receive LNG safely.</p>
          <p>We expect FERC to proceed in a manner that will enable the expansion to be implemented as previously planned during the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>We remain focused on our efforts to achieve annual operating earnings per share growth of 6% or more, as well as achieving a 2010 dividend payout ratio of 55%. To do so, we will continue to invest in infrastructure that enables our operations to serve our customers at optimum levels today, and in the future. You'll see us working to address the shortage of power we face in both our regulated and merchant markets through a new build, up rates and demand-side management programs.</p>
          <p>We are pleased that since we restructured Dominion nearly one year ago, we have consistently demonstrated that we can achieve predictable results and deliver on our forecast. This success and the continued execution our business plans in both our regulated and unregulated markets now permit us to raise the lower end of this year's guidance and increase our forecasted earning range for 2009, as Tom Chewning said a few minutes ago.</p>
          <p>I look forward to updating you on our continued execution of our plans during our third quarter call in October.</p>
          <p>With that we will turn the call over for questions. Lindsey we are ready to go.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. With respect to the change in guidance next year you guys have said that it relates to Marcellus. Should we assume that it includes some disposition of the remaining properties, or is the $0.05 revision related only to the Antero sale?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, it's Tom Chewning. I don't want to isolate that one factor too much. We do have a range of Marcellus from where we're now to a greater amount. But we also have some other changes that go plus and minus. So, the answer is, we have many assumptions and we have a low end of the Marcellus assumption and a high end. Obliviously when you start to pick a new number for the low end you get real serious because you want to make sure you don't go below that, and the upper end would indicate probably and logically that there would be more Marcellus sales.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow up on the Marcellus, when would &#x2013; you've got a royalty interest arrangement I guess as part of your arrangement with Antero. When would you expect to begin to receive payment under those wells or under that royalty arrangement?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Paul, this is Paul Koonce. The agreement has been reached, Antero is going through and doing a bit of due diligence, I would expect that transaction to close in September. Antero is making plans to move rigs into the areas. So they will begin drilling we believe immediately. And as soon as they begin production we'll begin to receive the proceeds on the royalty portion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So would that be in '09 or '10 or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly we expect that we'll begin receiving proceeds as early as '09 and that's going to be a function of how quickly Antero gets their equipment and manpower on site and commence drilling which again we believe is going to be before the end of this year.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I have a couple of things, you obviously disclosed the hedging on Generation portfolio for 2010 and I believe what you're doing is just disclosing the hedge position. But that wasn't necessarily entered into during the second quarter. Could you confirm that that's accurate and then maybe comment a bit on what kind of timeframe &#x2013; when you put &#x2013; when those hedges were put on, and how you relate them to where market is today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, this is Mark McGettrick. The hedge percentage I quoted was the actual percentages, where we stand today. If you look at it versus the previous tables we've increased our hedge percentages at Millstone '09 by about 6% and the Northeast coal units of about 9% in '09 and about 8% in 2010 from our previous disclosure all in the second quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But the 2010 hedges where you are giving us pricing for the first time, that was &#x2013; I guess we have a historical percentages, is that an informal disclosure?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I just have one thing on &#x2013; when I look at the quarter you have &#x2013; you seem to miss the contracted EBITDA number, in &#x2013; I guess largely the NEPOOL, and you mentioned that you'd run over on your outages, I figure that was just mainly the factor. But then within Generation that seemed to be offset by a really big upside versus guidance of the other line right below the DD&amp;A, it's on page 35. Can you explain what went on there in the utility that was not in any of those specific categories?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Jonathan. First, you're right on the NEPOOL assets or our Millstone outage ran over, so that's why we're outside at the lower end of that range there. In terms of the other category in Virginia, that's a combination of areas, it includes FTRs, ancillaries and capacity expenses that were all favorable to our guidance range. We saw a high degree of congestion in our region during the quarter. And we also had our units operated at a fairly high level in response to ancillary service revenues. So, that was much higher than what we anticipated in our original guidance when we put it out a quarter ago.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay thank you. And then just one other thing related to Marcellus. I know some of the other players have been having issues related to water permits and the like. Can you just help us understand where you stand on that issue, anything to think about there in terms of timing around getting this moving?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, this is Paul. We've drilled five vertical Marcellus wells, they don't require quite the same degree of water that a horizontal well requires. We've had these discussions with Antero. They've got some new thoughts about how they're going to deal with water, which we think are very creative, and we're looking forward to working with them in the basin to bring about adequate water.</p>
          <p>We don't see it is an issue, certainly not in West Virginia, and certainly not in the Pennsylvania areas where this acreage is involved. So we don't see it as an issue, they don't see it as an issue. And as I said we're looking forward to their getting equipment on the ground so that we can help them get their drilling started.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us a bit more color what you mean by creative ways of handling water? And how critical is the success of that for you to set out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think I would refer you to Antero. It's their technology and their work process, and I think it's probably best that you pursue that question with them.</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the issue of liquidity in the quarter. I am looking at your cash flow statement for the second quarter, and I notice that the net cash provided by operating activities of 528 is actually lower than the net cash you had generated in the first quarter of 551, seemingly implying that the second quarter did not contribute to net cash?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that if you take a look before working capital changes that's not true. But if you take a look at three large working capital items two which deal with margin requirements which were posted, which obviously drew down some of our liquidity. Also we had tax payments related &#x2013; state and federal tax payments related to some of the sale of our properties from last year that weren't made in that quarter.</p>
          <p>And I think third, we you've got to help me here deferred fuel was &#x2013; our agreement last year on our fuel clause was to cap the amount of the recovery of the '07 fuel factor. And so in fact, you are right that it didn't produce as much cash when you consider those items, but our normal operations did produce...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, no I appreciate that. I appreciate that I see three large items, I just wanted to make sure that I understood exactly what was going on, and let me just please, let me just quickly tell you what I think has happened and perhaps you can just correct me if I am wrong. I understand on the margin deposit and liabilities which ate about $590 million, this was your forward sale of electricity and at prices below market as the market price rose, the value of that obligation rose and you had to put up margin and that ate cash there. Is that right?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It is however I think if you notice in our remarks about our liquidity at this point we're back to $2.4 billion in liquidity as of yesterday afternoon, which shows the impact of a new credit facility but also over half of the billion dollars that's come back to us from declining positions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In addition to that, there are two other points Hugh, just, I can tell you the thing that I would lose most sleep over is if I didn't think we had an appropriate liquidity position.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But in addition to the markets coming down on additional facility we've changed the underlying margin requirements under most of our contracts. So, if prices go up again we're not compelled to put up as much of margin requirement as we did on those contracts before.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's good. The deferred fuel is just incomplete recovery of your power generation cost in Virginia?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, the fuel cost.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because we had an agreement last year I believe we had limited 2.5 to 4% recovery during the year. So that shows up and will continue to show up until we collect it in the future.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you had a nice positive inflow from deferred income taxes equal to almost a third of your net income. Is this something that you would expect to be a continuing positive flow of cash for you at more or less this rate or is there anything about the first half that's at normal?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Hugh, this is Tom Wohlfarth. That level that we experienced in the first half of the year was probably a little bit higher than what we would experience going forward. But we are building deferred tax balance, so we are going to have a positive cash flow from that. But that I think $300 million of service is the higher run rate that you would normally see.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and then just the last one is the prepayments. What is behind the outflow for prepayments?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The prepayments there is just the way that &#x2013; the way that we manage our quarterly tax liability, and to stay within the safe harbors avoiding tax penalties, we paid a little bit ahead on our federal income tax, what we project to be our tax liability and that will work its way out through the balance of the year, so that as we approach year end we will have smaller payments.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's really a cash outflow that you would not see recurring the balance of the year.</p>

          <p>Hi. Couple of clarifying questions; first on the 2009 guidance, just to clarify if you let's say had another similar sale to Antero tomorrow, something like that might &#x2013; is already incorporated in some way into that range?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, it's a pretty wide range.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, we got to be careful in the bottom end of that. But as I said before, I think the upper end of that implies some more...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And you did mention Tom that obviously when you updated this there were some things that got better which I think you said are Marcellus and Generation but maybe some things that also got &#x2013; had some pressures, any flavor on what some of the pressures are?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well I think...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is it just kind of cost inflation type of thing or...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's more or maybe some additional CapEx expenditures for which we have to more interest expense and that sort of thing, nothing, nothing that stands out as some sort big number but there is always a lot of pluses and minuses from what we do &#x2013; we just try to capture the big ones, but nothing alarming. But I think the market has a tendency to every time you give guidance something positive happens that they just add it to both ends of the guidance and I just want to remind everybody that if you run a business with as many moving parts as we do, you make a lot of assumptions and not all of them run out. One thing has been the declining commodity prices since we first gave those numbers, so that that's not an uplift in this forecast.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. And then one other question for Mark, on I'm wondering if you could just give us update on how you're dealing with coal just delivery supply and particularly your merchant generation, is everything going okay there; and also what your thought is on where the dark spread is right now? Would you even want to hedge any of your generation in New England at this point? Has the dark spread really contracted there?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Steve, we, on the coal delivery side, we don't have any issues here at all, whether it be international or domestic, or supply both for VP and to merchant is fine. In terms of the dark spread we did lay up about 8% of our coal supply and our corresponding <mark type="inaudible" /> in the second quarter, and we got pretty favorable pricing on that.</p>
          <p>So as people are looking at these very-very high Central App and international coal prices they are moving around dramatically. For example just in last three weeks they dropped $20 and so the signal you have out there on the spot price isn't necessarily what might be reflective by certain vendors that might take a year or two contract from you. So we're going to be very selective on how we lock coal in and lock power at the same time. But we did in the last several months get some, we think, attractive margins by locking in new supplies of coal and energy for our Denny units in 2010 and we will continue to look for that.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your question sir, our next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, just a follow up guys, just wanted to ask on if there is any &#x2013; do you have any kind of broad update to the CapEx numbers that you have most recently laid out? Where should we look for the most recent ones? I'm not sure if you have disclosed any in any of the schedules on the web today, I haven't seen them?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jonathan, the most recent CapEx is with our most recent presentation or in the IR reference book. We haven't updated that since the beginning of the year. Right now that CapEx plan kind of supports our earnings outlook, and so we wouldn't update that without updating our complete model. We're just &#x2013; it's not in our interests to kind of update specific line items without doing a comprehensive update, so the earliest you would see any update on CapEx is the fall.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But did I hear Tom Chewning correctly that there is some upward movement on the CapEx in aggregate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There is a potential for that Jonathan on incremental projects we had particularly in the wind area. Because we found more opportunities there and that's &#x2013; the reason we haven't updated that is because until we really identify specific projects we don't just throw in capital. But that doesn't mean &#x2013; into an exhibit &#x2013; but that doesn't mean that internally when we take a look at guidance we don't take that into account in terms of the need to borrow money et cetera.</p>
          <p>So, a lot of &#x2013; I don't want you guys to think that we believe for a second that we capture everything about next year in these models. But, we do a lot of range calculations and some of them involve less capital and some of them involve more capital. But, then we come out as we always do in the beginning of the next year and give you a plan that we feel we will follow, and I think that what we've done this year is that we followed our CapEx budget pretty carefully, but not every line item has been followed in the same way that we created it. We've managed our CapEx to the numbers that we thought we needed to do for the year.</p>
