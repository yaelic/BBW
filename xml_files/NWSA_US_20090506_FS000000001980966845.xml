      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Gary, thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. As you can see in today's earnings release, we are continuing to operation in a very challenging economic environment, and our current operating results reflect this. Operating income in the third quarter was $755 million, and this is down 47% as compared to last year's results. Primarily this reflects declines in our television and print businesses, partially offset by growth in our cable channel.</p>
          <p>The quarter also includes approximately $55 million in one-time restructuring costs at our print businesses. Equity losses of affiliates totaled $40 million in the quarter compared to equity earnings of $109 million a year ago.  This variance is primarily the result of the absence of DIRECTV and Gemstar's earnings. These two companies were disposed of last year.  It also reflects the inclusion of our share of losses at Premiere. Bottom line, the Company reported net income for the quarter of $2.7 billion.  This is in line with the 2.7 reported in last year's third quarter.</p>
          <p>Reported earnings per share this March quarter were $1.04 as compared to $0.91 reported for the same quarter a year ago, and this is due to fewer shares outstanding. It's important to note that this year's results includes a $1.2 billion gain in Other related to the partial sale of our NDS ownership, which was concluded in February.  The prior year's third quarter results also includes a $1.7 billion gain on the asset and stock exchange with Liberty Media.  In addition to these items, this quarter's equity earnings of affiliates includes an $81 million ITV write-down at BSkyB as compared to a $101 million charge recognized a year ago.  Excluding the net income effects of these items, adjusted net income was 1.59 billion in this quarter as compared to a similarly adjusted 899 million last year. Adjusted earnings per share this quarter were $0.61, up from an adjusted $0.30 in the third quarter a year.</p>
          <p>In addition, this quarter's net income includes a one-time, non-cash tax benefit of approximately $1.2 billion, resulting from the required adjustment of our opening tax accruals due to the completion of certain multi-year tax audits, which contributed $0.46 to our earnings per share in the quarter.  In accordance with FIN 48 we did not recognize the accounting benefits related to certain tax deductions in prior periods until we had final resolutions of these matters.</p>
          <p>With that, I'd like to provide some comments on the performance at a number of our business segments.  And we'll start with Film segment, which reported third quarter operating profit of $282 million, and this is 8% higher than last year's result, primarily reflecting higher contributions from our television production business, which was negatively impacted last year by the writers' strike.  More recently, our year-over-year performance in the movie business has also improved considerably, with a number of recent box office successes led by Wolverine and also including Marley and Me, Slumdog Millionaire and Taken, which are now starting to flow through the Home Entertainment window and are doing quite well.</p>
          <p>At our Television segment, operating income in the quarter was $4 million as compared to $419 million in the third quarter a year ago.  This result reflects weaker ad markets, higher entertainment programming costs at the network, and the absence of both the Super Bowl and contributions from eight stations that were sold in last July.  The eight stations accounted for revenue and earnings decline of 76 million and $24 million respectively.</p>
          <p>Excluding the Super Bowl revenues of approximately $30 million last year, revenues at our remaining stations declined 28%.  This is slightly less of a decline than the overall TV station market.  Virtually every category was down in the quarter, with continued weakness from Auto, Financial and Movie categories.  At the FOX Broadcasting Network, higher operating losses resulted from higher license fees on returning shows and lower prime time ad sales, reflecting 13% lower ratings.</p>
          <p>Programming costs in the year ago quarter were unusually low due to the writers' strike that precluded running the entirety of 24 last season and resulted in the broadcasting of several lower price reruns.  Lower ratings from NASCAR also impacted revenues and profits at FBC during this quarter.  And at STAR, earnings contributions were down, reflecting a general softness in the local ad markets in India as well as higher channel costs from the launch of regional language channels.</p>
          <p>Now moving on to the Cable Network segment, where we continue to show very strong growth, with operating income up 30%, driven by 11% revenue increases.  As a reminder, comparative results of this segment are impacted by the sale of three of the RSNs last year, which had revenues of 35 million and operating profit of 14 million.  Taking this into account, total segment affiliate fees for the quarter on a like-for-like basis were up 24% in the aggregate, and advertising revenues were down 6%.</p>
          <p>From a channel perspective, the largest year-over-year gains in the quarter were from the FOX News Channel, which achieved its highest quarterly operating profit ever, due to higher affiliate rates and increased subscribers.  New affiliate deals for FOX News are now in effect with all the major cable and satellite operators, except Charter and Cox, which should both be renewed over the next year.  The Big Ten Network reported operating profits as compared to losses a year ago, reflecting last fall's distribution agreement in the Midwest.  And the International Channels showed revenue growth, especially in Latin America and Japan, as well as lower operating expenses in Europe.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Direct Broadcast Satellite segment, SKY Italia reported operating income of $63 million, a $34 million decrease from the third quarter a year ago.  About two-thirds of this decline results from a shift in the timing of the soccer package revenue recognition, which we described in each of our last two quarterly earnings calls.  The balance of this decline is due to higher costs and unfavorable foreign currency movements that more than offset local currency revenue growth.</p>
          <p>SKY Italia's local currency revenue grew 7% in the quarter, and this is driven by a 7% increase in the average subscriber base as compared to last year.  Monthly ARPU in the quarter averaged &#x20AC;44.  This is slightly below the &#x20AC;45 achieved in the prior year.  Excluding the impact of the soccer revenue change, local currency revenue growths would have been two percentage points higher and monthly ARPU would have been approximately &#x20AC;46.</p>
          <p>In the quarter, SKY Italia also had higher programming costs, due to the larger subscriber base, increased soccer costs and the addition of 15 new channels.  Additionally, as discussed last quarter, we're also investing in new initiatives to drive higher penetration from premium services on our existing subscriber base.  These initiatives have an upfront technological &#x2013; technology, rather, and service costs.  However, these investments create a more durable and more profitable subscriber base.  For example, the churn rate for a premium service subscriber is 75% lower than a non-premium service subscriber. As a result of these efforts, at quarter-end, over 1.2 million subscribers were taking at least one premium service, such as an HD, a PVR, <mark type="inaudible" /> or second box, as compared to 730,000 subscribers a year ago.</p>
          <p>And finally, in the quarter gross additions were approximately 232,000, while net additions were approximately 46,000, bringing the closing subscriber base to 4.8 million. While gross additions in the quarter were 25% higher than the same period in the prior year, our net additions reflected higher churn, which we now expect to be around 12% for the year. The churn increase was exacerbated by a doubling on January 1 of the required VAT rate from 10 to 20% on our subscription rates and is also affected by the worsening economic conditions in Europe and in Italy in particular. Despite these factors, over 90% of the 1.2 million contracts expiring in the quarter were renewed. Excuse me for just a minute.</p>
          <p>Turning now to our Newspaper and Information Service segment, operating income in this quarter was $7 million, and this is down from $209 million last year. This year's results reflect significantly weaker advertising trends in all markets, unfavorable foreign exchange movements, as well as the inclusion of approximately $25 million in restructuring charges relating to cost reduction programs. In the United Kingdom, local currency advertising revenues were down 21% overall from declines in classified and color display advertising, and this is principally from volume declines at our quality titles. U.K. circulation revenues, however, were up 4% due to higher pricing, and in the United Kingdom we continue to focus on growing our market share.</p>
          <p>In Australia, advertising revenues were down 16% compared to a year ago. Classified advertising revenues declined 26%, primarily from reduced employment advertising, while display revenues were down 12%, reflecting the weak real estate market.</p>
          <p>And at Dow Jones, operating results declined largely due to a 33% advertising decrease at The Wall Street Journal, from both display and classified advertising revenue. This is essentially a reflection of the significantly reduced volume activity in the financial markets and in industry in the United States in general. Like at our other properties, Dow Jones continues to reduce its cost base to respond to the revenue declines.</p>
          <p>Turning to our Book Publishing segment, third quarter operating income contributions were down $67 million compared to last year. This decline reflects the inclusion of $30 million of restructuring charges as well as the weaker retail book market, with retailers scaling back inventory and a reduced number of strong new releases versus a year ago.</p>
          <p>And at our Other segment, we reported a third quarter operating loss of $89 million, $82 million below a year ago. Half of this decline is due to the partial sale of our NDS ownership in early February, at which point NDS results were no longer consolidated with News Corporation.  The remaining Other segment profit decline reflects weaker Fox Interactive Media results. FIM revenues in the quarter of $187 million were down 11% compared to a year ago, primarily due to 16% lower advertising revenue, which includes a reduction of branded and performance advertising revenues at MySpace. Additionally, total FIM's costs were up 7%, reflecting the continued rollout of the MySpace music joint venture and the addition of other new MySpace features. And Rupert will comment in a moment on recent changes at FIM.</p>
          <p>Finally, let me address our guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2009. As reminder, you will recall that we measure this guidance excluding from fiscal 2008 results the $253 million in operating profit contributions from businesses or assets sold in fiscal 2008 which are no longer included in our ongoing results, namely the eight TV stations, the three RSNs sold to Liberty and the U.K. land sale.  So when we look at measuring comparisons in fiscal 2009, we are comparing it to a base of 5.13 billion in operating profits for fiscal 2008, and our fiscal 2009 outlook excludes the effect of impairment and restructuring charges.</p>
          <p>In early February, we reduced our fiscal 2009 operating outlook to be down approximately 30% from the 5.13 billion fiscal 2008 result. While we have seen a little more deterioration at some of our advertising-driven businesses, particularly newspapers and Fox Interactive, we have also seen some stabilization of the decline in the local TV station business.  In addition, our Filmed Entertainment segment has regained much of its lost momentum with more successful recent film releases which include Wolverine.  As a result, taking all of these factors into account, we are maintaining our outlook for operating income to be down approximately 30% from the 5.13 billion fiscal 2008 result, and this guidance assumes there will be no further weakening in advertising markets and economic conditions.</p>
          <p>And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Rupert for his comments.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.  I'm not an economist, and we all know economists were created to make weather forecasters look good.  But it is increasing clear that the worst is over.  As you know, I have been uncharacteristically pessimistic in recent calls, though I would argue that it was a well-founded concern.  But there are emerging signs in some of our businesses that the days of precipitous decline are done and that revenues are beginning to look healthier.</p>
          <p>Clearly, as our results show, we continue to feel the effects of the tough economy.  But we are weathering it by sticking to the core strategy that has helped us grow into a major global media and entertainment company with a strongly diversified portfolio.  Our strategy consists of investing wisely in properties that represent the next generation of growth, maintaining profitable assets at various stages of development, conservatively managing our balance sheet to maximize flexibility and cutting costs and restructuring as far as possible without damaging our great franchises.  To that end, we have reduced staff levels by 3,000 people, affecting very few journalists or creative personnel.  We have streamlined and merged activities everywhere, but especially at our stations and newspapers.</p>
          <p>We know the economy will eventually rebound.  These strategies will allow us to emerge even stronger when that recovery begins.  We're beginning to see a number of bright spots that give us encouragements.  Most notably these include a resurgence at our film studio, the continued strong growth to our 200 worldwide cable channels and circulation gains at The Wall Street Journal and market share gains at our U.K. and Australian newspaper titles.  Let me go through each of them briefly.</p>
          <p>Firstly, the movie business, it is booming right now.  At Fox we could not be happier with last weekend's $85 million opening of Wolverine, the biggest domestic opening of 2009.  Globally, we added another $73 million, and in many individual markets we saw the best numbers of any X-Men film.  It's a testament of the strength of this important franchise and the overall health of the business.  Indeed, the movie industry is proving itself anti-cyclical.  Already in 2009, domestic box office revenue is up more than 15%.  And that's not just from ticket prices, but in admissions as well.  And with the event of 3D cinema, we think those numbers are set to rise significantly.  Similarly on the home entertainment side, the explosion of digital platforms is giving us more options to bolster an important part of our Filmed Entertainment segment.  We have a potentially great slate of films over the next 18 months and are busy building on them.</p>
          <p>Our Cable segment remains a vibrant performer, up 30% in operating income year over year, led by the FOX News Channel.  This past quarter, FOX News achieved its highest operating profit ever, nearly doubling its profits from the previous year's quarter.  It's a stunning achievement for a 13-year-old network that continues to dominate cable news.  It has held the number one position in cable news for 87 consecutive months, and in April, FOX News grew its primetime audience a staggering 63% over the same period a year ago in the key 25 to 54 demo.  Today it's the number two network in primetime among all basic cable networks and is closing the gap with the longtime number one network, USA.</p>
          <p>On the advertising front, in both cable and broadcast, volume and pricing are holding up well, and scatter is currently being done at or above up-front pricing.  We're seeing strong growth at the WSJ.com, as measured by our internal metrics.  We had 13.4 million visitors in April last year, whereas this last month we had 26.5 million visitors.  Ad revenues for the site are forecasted to rise 20% year on year in the fourth quarter.</p>
          <p>In just three weeks 360,000 people had downloaded the Journal's iPhone mobile reader.  As you can imagine, we will soon be making them pay handsomely for the privilege of accessing the world's best business news source.  That it is possible to charge for content on the web is obvious from the Journal's experience.  We're now in the midst of a public debate over the value of content, and it is clear for many newspapers the current model is malfunctioning.  We have been at the forefront of that debate, and you can confidently presume that we are leading the way in finding a model that maximizes revenues and returns for our shareholders.</p>
          <p>I can assure you we will not be ceding our content rights to the fine people who created the Kindle.  We will control the prices for our content and we will control the relationship with our customers.  Any device maker or website which doesn't meet these basic criteria on content will not be doing business long term with News Corporation.  Too many content creators have been passive in the face of obvious violations of intellectual property rights.  We rightly hold China and other countries accountable on this important issue, but the violation of these rights is rampant on the Web in our own country.  Our content is extremely valuable and the violators have recognized that value.</p>
          <p>Within the Company itself, the very bright people we have at our Slingshot Laboratories are devising clever ways to monetize the content of some of our long established print properties.  We will be matching their contemporary expertise in the creation of communities with our traditional expertise in the creation of content.  The incurrent days of the Internet will soon be over.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, despite the dismal ad market, we continue to grow our circulation and market share among many of our important newspaper titles.  Here in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal is the only major newspaper to grow its circulation over the past six months, up more than 2.8% in individually paid circulation.  The Wall Street Journal Digital Network reported a 38% increase visitors year-over-year during March.  In the U.K. all four News international titles, The Sun, The Times, The Sunday Times and News of the World, have each taken market share from rivals.  In spite of this, The Times and The Sunday Times have been particularly hard hit in their advertising revenues.</p>
          <p>We've also been dealing with tough challenges at some of our consistent growth drivers.  Dave mentioned earlier some of the issues facing SKY Italia, including the doubling of the VAT tax, that have depressed our results.  But I think it's important to note that we're taking advantage of the fact that SKY Italia is a technology leader in the Italian TV marketplace by investing in initiatives to exploit this competitive edge by further driving the penetration of premium services like high definition and PVRs.  Year over year we've increased the adoption of premium services by 60%, and these customers have proven to be stickier and more resilient than other subscribers.</p>
          <p>At MySpace, we believe the management moves we made over the past two weeks will help it regain its momentum.  We think the new team that Jon Miller has put together is going to help MySpace refine and shape its strategic vision and take it to a much higher plane of growth.  The truth is, we've had a lot of success in expanding MySpace into a global social portal with services like MySpace Music, and we think we've put the right people in place to capitalize on these successes by developing new features and products that will spur further growth and profitability, profitability I must say that has completely escaped our competitors.</p>
          <p>Finally, there's no doubt the traditional newspaper business model has to change, even though the present situation I think has been greatly exaggerated by the current recession.  Classified revenues are undoubtedly migrating to the web, probably not to return.  So all our great technological and creative resources which exist in many countries, from the United States to India and beyond, are being concentrating on developing new business models which will return trusted and famous journalistic enterprises to long term profitability.</p>
          <p>There is clearly a convergence of our various talents within News Corporation that is helping us to resolve these profoundly important issues.  For instance, we are developing and investing in exciting new digital businesses.  Hulu, for one, is off to a great start is a premier aggregator of video content on the web.  There are lessons in Hulu's success for other parts of our company, which is at its heart a creator and distributor of unique content.</p>
          <p>And before I turn it over to Peter, I'd just like to say a few words about what he has meant to this company.  He's been with me for most of his professional life, and I have watched him grow from a young executive to my trusted deputy in running this company for the past 12 years.  He's been instrumental in helping to build News Corp to what it is today, and we will all miss working with him.  Suffice it to say that he's been a key architect in growing our entertainment properties into industry leaders.  He's also helped nurture and support what I believe is the strongest management team in this business.  I look forward to working with him in his new television and film venture.  Now I'll turn it over to you, Peter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much for those very kind words, Rupert.  Since this is my last call, and my last earnings call, I'd like to start by saying how much I'll miss the relationship I've built with all of you in the investor community over the past decade.  I think back to the many trips to the Midwest in January, the countless chats over coffee in dank conference rooms, or most of all the thousands of questions I've answered on so many of these quarterly calls.  And it actually has been a real privilege and I appreciate it.</p>
          <p>It's also been a great privilege to work here at News Corp all these years.  I've had the ride of my life, and I leave knowing that the Company is in great shape.  If you look across the businesses, News Corp is the leader across so many areas of our business.  We're once again back to being the number one movie studio.  We will finish this year as the number one network for the fifth year in a row.  We have record market share in all of our television stations.  We are the industry leader in growth among cable channels, among cable channel companies.  We're the leading international cable channel company.  We're the leading international pay television company.  We're the leading worldwide newspaper publisher, and on and on and on.  I think you look across so many parts of this company, we are clearly in a leadership position, and it's something I take great pride having played a small role in it.</p>
          <p>More importantly, I think this company has hands down the strongest and most consistent management team in the industry.  These are men and women of great character, who I think are all exemplary leaders, and I've been fortunate to work so closely with so many of them for so long.  I've also been heavily engaged these past two months, and will be for the next two months, in this transition period.  And I think it couldn't have gone more smoothly.  And I'm really confident that between the caliber of the leaders and with Rupert's continuing involvement, that this team will deliver for years and years to come.</p>
          <p>Finally, I just want to take a moment to personally thank Rupert.  It's been a deep, deep privilege to work for the best leader in the industry &#x2013; a leader who is visionary, who's bold, who's supportive, and trust me, who's more exciting to be around than you can possibly imagine.  I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had.  I'm genuinely proud of our achievements, and I leave having had more fun and more satisfaction than anyone can imagine.  So thank you, Rupert.</p>
          <p>And with that, I guess we'll take questions you may have.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thanks.  I have one housekeeping for Dave, and then one for Rupert.  Dave, I just wanted to make sure that you said cable advertising was down 6 in the quarter.  Was that organic number and where was the weakness?   And then Rupert, you've been clearly proven right by being cautious.  But if you're saying the worst is over or clearly over, then when does the Company start buying back stock with the $6 billion of cash on the books?   So those are my two questions.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The answer is yes, and it was principally in the RSNs for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>In the RSNs, and is that continuing this quarter in terms of that trend?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can just expand on that.  It's only been down 6% this quarter.  We expect for the year to be up 2%.  And it is in the RSNs in local advertising and local sponsorships of local teams.  That's where we've been hit.  The general purpose cable networks are all up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  And then on the cautious, being proven right, what about if the worst is over, why not use the six billion for buybacks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>

          <p>Thanks.  Before a question I just had one comment.  I want to wish Peter all the best.  You've been such a big influence in my career and I just respect you enormously. It's sad to see you go.  And with that, I guess two questions.  One is, going to that cash question, the $6 billion on the balance sheet and building, would you consider not only a buyback, but also, repositioning the Company?  Given where multiples are, you're starting to see multiples expand as the market is looking for stabilization.  So I guess the question is what other uses of cash would you consider?   And then kind of on the other side of that, would you consider restructuring any parts of your business, meaning or including a spinout a la Time Warner, possibly separating out the newspapers?   What is your view of that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We believe that, as I said earlier, that we are a very strong, interrelated company, and that all our divisions help each other.  And that's it.  But I should just say about our repayments, or our cash position, it is true that we have $6 billion at the moment, and over, with a maturity averaging nearly 20 years, except in the first three or four months of next year, we do have $2 billion worth of repayments.  So let's get that behind us first.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks.  Two questions.  The first one is, with reference to potentially seeing some stabilization, can you talk about what you're seeing in the local TV business in terms of pacings for this quarter?   And can you talk a little bit about home video trends?  Obviously, you guys are at enviable point in the content cycle, which is great news.  What are you seeing from a secular perspective?  And are your views changing?   I think Bob Iger was a little bit more optimistic, it sounded a little bit like...</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On our stations, if you'd asked me that question a month ago, I would have had to say that the pacing for the next quarter looked frighteningly bad.  But we've already, in this month, improved by 15%, and the next two months look much the same.  Just to give you a completely honest breakdown of the thing, although we were down 28% in top line revenue in the stations, in this quarter, we expect to finish the year down 23% in top line revenues there. In FBC we expect to be down 6%, in Cable up 2%, and in local currencies, in Britain we expect to be down 13%, in Australia 10%, Dow Jones total, which includes all their Factivas and their special services, down 22%, and in the Fox Interactive down 4%, for a total adjusted for the year of top line revenues of a decline of 14%.  Now that's, you know, given our estimates for the next quarter.  But that's where we expect to come out.</p>

          <p>On the DVDs, Peter can be more precise, but, a big film, a good film, seems to go out as DVD and do as well as ever.  The library's a bit doubtful.  But there's a lot of other things going on with VOD and other developments where we feel we're going to more than make up.  We're in the leadership position, really, in the development of &#x2013; what is it, Peter?</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>...where DVDs will be sold at a higher price, much higher quality, and as Sony rolls out those machines in greater numbers, we expect that to be an important growth factor.  So there are various things which we believe are going to more than make up for the present slight decline in library titles.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I would just add to that, I think we're seeing &#x2013; I'd echo that.  We're seeing strong titles performing quite strongly, particularly the sort of middle American Wal-Mart-like titles.  We had a great result with Marley and Me, expect to have a very good result with Taken and Wolverine etcetera.  And where you're seeing a little softness is where they used to throw three or four library titles in, maybe they throwing only three into the basket or two right now into the basket.  But frankly, I'm not sure that's not as much a function of the economy as it is any secular decline.  I think it's too early to say the business is in secular decline.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, from our perspective, not only, we in February did a billion dollar deal with both 10s and 30s.  Since that time the credit spreads have went up.  They've now contracted.   I would say over the last week, the markets are really, are open and open at relatively attractive prices.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much. Peter, I would say that as strange as it might be for you not to be on the next call, it'll be just as strange for us not to have you on the next call.  But a question for Rupert today, Rupert, when I look at your results this quarter, one thing really sticks out like a sore thumb.  If you add up TV and print and your Internet businesses, it had no profits this quarter, but there's cable networks growing 30%.  Can you comment at all once we get through the Fox affiliate fee growth, which has driven so much of that profit improvement, what kind of growth outlook do you have for cable networks when you look out the next few years?  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I wouldn't say we're going to see the same percentage increase next year, but we'll certainly see the same amount of money increases, same volume and profit.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And what drives the growth of cable networks once they're...?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can I also just add to that?   I think you have, it's important to recognize that the Company has cable channels at so many different stages of growth.  So you know, there's still huge growth ahead on the Big Ten channel.  I think FOX Business has big, big growth ahead of us.  And then also, I think, which has never gotten quite the credit it deserves, those international channels are still in sort of very, very aggressive growth mode.  So I think even while you may see some slowdown in the short term of some, of that big bump we've had in FOX News or some of those others in the short term, there's so many nascent cable channels in the mix that still have a lot of growth ahead of them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd support that, and I'd just like to stress about what Peter said about the international channels.  We have 140 channels, some of them very small, run by the vet group.  And you've got to realize that the growth of cable and satellite and multi-channel television is really only beginning in the rest of the world, and we'll be right in on those there.  We'll be in on all those platforms with as many channels as we can.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much.  I wondered if you can talk through further restructuring charges that you expect during the fourth quarter.  And when you look at the full-year guidance from which restructuring costs are excluded, what will the total amount be excluded from the number of your guidance?  And then can you talk about when you expect the benefits of restructuring charges to start coming through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Jolanta, the benefit comes through immediate &#x2013; basically it's a one-year payback.  And the reason we've excluded the restructuring charge out of our guidance is because we really don't know what it's going be for the rest of the year.  We continue to look at it.  As Rupert said, we're looking at all our businesses.  We're looking at the way we do businesses in each one of these businesses.  So what it's going be, it's going to be, but again, it's a one-off cost, which is why it's excluded.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've taken about $100 million already out, a bit more than $100 million out of the costs of Dow Jones, and we expect another, it will be a total of 200 million by this time next year.  And that, you know, a vast variety of ways, for instance, linking the back office functions of The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post was what, a few million dollars, a handful of millions.  But there's a lot of a match.  We're looking at every detail everywhere.  And there will be, I think I'm confident in saying it, I will not specify it, because we don't know the details yet, but there will be major cost savings at MySpace and at Fox Interactive.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I just want to clarify, with respect to Dow Jones, those restructuring costs were contemplated in the acquisition, so none of those costs would go below the bottom line.  Any of the costs that we're incurring for that are included in our guidance.</p>

      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thank you very much.  So if I can focus on Fox Interactive Media for a second here, ad revenues down 16%.  That was quite striking to me, and it seems like all the categories were affected.  So I'm just trying to understand better what's going on in that business in terms of, I know you're taking costs out of there, but it seems like MySpace Music is still some ways off from actually turning profitable.  But overall, I just want to get a sense of where you see that business headed in terms of longer term with the new management in there, etcetera?  Any color would be helpful.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't help much.  They've only been in for two days.  But Jon Miller has a lot of ideas.  We've worked at it a lot, and we think we'll have a much more attractive site for people to visit and stay with and just generate a lot more traffic.  We are not looking for &#x2013; we may be wrong, but we're not going for the Facebook model of getting hundreds and hundreds of millions of people who don't bring any advertising with them at all.  And we're number one here, we intend to stay number one and get further upfront in the United States.  But I really can't be specific yet.  We'll try to be on our next call.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can just add a little bit about just where we are currently, which is I think MySpace Music is still less than six months old.  You know, we've had a tremendous amount of traffic.  I think the next thing that I know they're working hard on there is some of the monetization opportunities there.  And those are just beginning to roll out.  The other thing I'd add a little bit is that I think a lot of what's gone on in the MySpace branded site has been marketplace driven.  I think there's been real softness in that marketplace, and interestingly, we're actually seeing some signs that things are improving.  Our May pacing is up over last year, certainly over April, but also over last year, and currently our June and July pacing on the MySpace branded site is up, so a lot of that seems to be marketplace driven.</p>

          <p>Peter, I want to wish you well as well.  And just a quick follow-up for Rupert.  So I guess on the changes, management changes that were made, I think I've heard some concerns about kind of the increasing number of direct reports that's going to be reporting to you.  So I'm trying get a sense of how much significantly more involvement that you're going to be now?   Can you provide perhaps some assurance that the new structure that you've put in place with Peter's departure is not going to result in any major change in overall strategy or the direction of these businesses?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, not at all.  If we look at the Fox businesses, I guess there are four people reporting to me, where there were many more to Peter.  There's the two people at the head of Fox Film Entertainment, and we've streamlined that so that they will also report for the Twentieth Television production.  And there's Tony Vinciquerra, who will be reporting on all networks, cable and over the air.  And there will be of course Jon Miller on a, well not just for FIM, but on our broader business of digital.</p>

      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi.  Just a question on, trying to clarify, Rupert, you made a comment about 23% being kind of the rough decline for TV stations for the year.  I think you did 17, 20 in the first couple of quarters and you did 20 this quarter.  So is it fair to say you're tracking somewhere around 27%, so pretty close to the third quarter decline in the fourth quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's correct.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.  And then the second question is with newspapers profitability having gotten down to where it is, I assume it's fair to say that you actually have newspapers that now are actually beginning to lose money beyond just the New York Post.  You know, if that's true, is that just simply the way it's going be for the next 12 months, as kind of the newspaper business works its way through the current crisis and you figure out a longer term kind of profitable strategy?  Or can you actually cost cut your way to profitability in the near term?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the only other paper that's in loss, and it was, has always been, was the London Times.  But things like the London Sunday Times, which used to be a very big profit earner and had a lot of classified advertising, travel advertising, that sort of thing, that is still in profit, but it is only just so.  What's carrying us in London interestingly is The Sun, which is holding at three million circulation, and enjoying a lot of advertising from the supermarket wars that are taking place over there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="15" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>If I can follow up real quick on Alan Gould's question earlier, about four weeks ago at the NCTA you were pretty vocal on this being a bear market rally and really worried about the future, especially the near term future.  What's changed, or what have you seen in your businesses that's caused such a significant posture shift over the last four weeks?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think that everybody was in shock by the economy and all business sort of falling off a cliff in the last three months of last year, and it's taken them time, and including me.  And we saw that just in the disappearance of advertising and business in January and February, and March for that matter.  But now we are seeing people coming back into the advertising market and spending.  I think they realize they've got to keep their brand in front of people.  And it's not back to the old level, don't get me wrong, but if you have a look at today's Post and you see the retailers in there, it's quite remarkable.  If you look at television, you'll find Chrysler is back advertising.  Not, you know, Chrysler's come in with $5 million I believe into the market.  There's a lot of activity.  It is not at any stage back to the boom days.  But at the very least, we've hit a floor and we seem to be getting some bounce off it.</p>

          <p>Hi.   Thanks for taking the questions, guys.  If I could ask two, Rupert, if we could go back to an asset that you didn't focus on yet, which is STAR, and ask about that business, how it's performing and generally your thoughts on Asia and opportunities to invest there?  Are there any potential acquisitions or business models that you see emerging in China or India that look interesting to News Corp?  And then second, for you and/or Peter, on piracy in film, obviously there was a lot of noise on the X-Men front.  Is piracy a big deal to the business?  If it is, have you seen any technology or business model or law enforcement models out there that you think might work that need to be put into place?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, Peter can answer the piracy one.  You're asking about STAR.  We have had a difficult year in STAR.  Basically the difficulties have been in India.  We've got a new competitor there who doesn't seem to, which I presume financed by Viacom, they're even going on the air in primetime with no advertising night after night.  And that is affecting us.  But basically, you know, the advertising market is down very heavily in India, and we won't know how we come out of that until we see the results of this election and what sort of government comes.  Otherwise, no, we do not see things to buy.  We did buy this year, I should say, and it was a pretty good price we paid, for more channels in southern India, Asianet, which we are very, very hopeful of.  It's in the richest part of India, they're good channels, and so we're building our business to sort of give ourselves national coverage in India, which I am personally in the long term very, very optimistic about as a country.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>China, there's nothing to say really about it.  I mean, we don't see anything to buy there.  We don't see anything to do that will make us a lot of money.  We continue to watch it and monitor it very carefully.  But although business is getting better for some people and easing up, in media, it's pretty much a no-no.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can answer the piracy question just quickly, before...  Look, I think piracy is a serious issue for us.  You know, we now estimate that there are about <mark type="inaudible" /> million downloads of that stolen Wolverine movie that was up there, and so that's a serious issue for us.  And I think that the &#x2013; and an issue that we believe the government should take a more active role in, both in terms of movies and what Rupert was talking about earlier in terms of all intellectual content.  We think that you could make an argument that's as big an act of industrial espionage or industrial sabotage as we've seen in terms of its economic impact.  And we think that there should be more done.</p>
          <p>Overall, in terms of fighting piracy, you know, I think that there are a number of things that need to be done, which we regularly do.  We have seen, when Wolverine, many positive steps in terms of sites that link in to the movie taken down, it's more the peer-to-peer sites that remain so difficult.  We do, do a fair amount of spoofing, we use a lot of technology to avoid it.  We clearly will tighten up the procedures.  This was an isolated incident, but it was a good wake-up call.</p>
          <p>And then finally, I think that consistently the most important thing to do to combat piracy, which I think this company has been in a leadership position in, is to build alternative legitimate business models.  And that's clearly behind, that's what motivated us to start Hulu.  It's what motivates us to be constantly aggressive about looking for new technological ways to deliver our product legitimately to consumers.  So I think it is a big problem and one we consistently continue to fight, but also one, most importantly, that we need to attack from a business model perspective.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Great.  Thank you.  Just following up on that last point quickly, is the idea then to add streaming movies or subscription-based portals to the Hulu site?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>There are streaming movies already on Hulu.  They are limited in number, because we're obviously not looking to cannibalize our DVD business.  We're looking at everything.  I'm not sure we're ready to add a subscription model yet, although you should probably talk to Jason.  But certainly we are looking at all sorts of other electronic sell-through and video on demand models through multiple players, so we're consistently looking for ways to make all of our product legitimately available in electronic means.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just like to stress the importance of Hulu.  We really have very great hopes for that and I think we'll be trying, Jason Kilar, who runs it, will be trying different models there.  But it already is the third biggest video site in the country, and it's the only one that actually collects any revenue.  So we should really be very happy and very confident about that.</p>

          <p>Great, and then just real quickly, on the advertising market having hit a floor, as you think about the rebound, or potential rebound, what are the categories or the verticals or groups of advertisers that you think or at least looking toward to lead the way out in the second half of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think big national brands will be very keen to keep themselves in front of the public.  And while the public is still in its present mode of looking for bargains and tightening its belt, you're already seeing big increases from food chains like Wendy's and so on.  There is money there, and it's being spent, but it's not all the old money.  You can't have a crisis like this &#x2013; you'll find there will be different prominent advertisers and less of old ones.  For instance, I'll just say one thing, and we'll get off this, but far the biggest things at Fox Television stations, by far the biggest category was automotive.  And of course it was the one that was hit most of all.  And fast food restaurants you will see and that sort of thing will come up a lot, I'm sure.</p>

I'm hearing you express a fair amount of confidence for the newspapers that you do own and also for ways to actually make money by charging online for others, as you said before.  I'm going to bring up a question that people tend to ask a lot in this case, which is how long do you think it's going to take at News Corp for the kind of digital revenue you could get from charging and from advertising to make up for what's being lost in print?</p>

          <p>We are working very hard over this.  And there are a lot of things that we are looking at.  There's one thing charging, there's another thing, the use of, which I referred to in my remarks, the reuse of mobile readers of newspapers.  We don't believe in the Kindle business model, but we're very interested and think it's very significant that so many people go to that for their newspaper, or go to their Blackberries, for that matter, to get their news.  And there's a lot of ways we can make money out of content over and above advertising.  And there are many things we can do, but there's a lot of technology going on.</p>
          <p>Some of the greatest technological companies in the world are spending a great deal of money in developing advanced reading devices, mobile reading devices, and we're totally neutral about that.  We may invest some little thing in something experimentally, but, because we have such good people that can contribute to it, but we're not appliance makers.  There are other great ones in the world we'd rather go to and see and be quite neutral over.</p>

Given the continuing declines with stations, are you considering or making any specific changes in their expense structures?</p>

          <p>We're doing everything we can.  For instance, we're combining, at considerable capital cost, all of the stations into one IT system.  We expect that will save us over $100 million a year.  It will take us a year to get there.  Other things we're doing, we're expanding our news, time we spend on news services, because we have the staff there.  It doesn't cost money.  It saves us from buying expensive syndicated product.  You know, there are a number of things, none of them I would say are dramatic.  But we expect them all to help, and we also expect &#x2013; my own personal feeling is that we will see a return to television advertising faster than we see it to newspapers.</p>

Could you talk about, was that just maybe the DVD market or some other, perhaps something having to do with the release mix?</p>
