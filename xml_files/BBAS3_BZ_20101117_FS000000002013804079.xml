      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Hello, this is Gilberto. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our conference call about the third quarter results. I believe slide number three summarizes quite well what has brought about the third quarter <mark type="inaudible" />. We kept our leadership in Brazilian bank industry and delivered a consistent operation now with growth where the highlights were the growth of business revenues, reflecting increase on the net interest income and fee income and the reduction of credit risk, which allows a decrease in credit costs.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number four, where we have some of our leadership in the Brazilian bank industry. Once again, the highlight is our leadership in total assets with 21.2% market share, well balanced with other chunk whatever matters in Brazilian bank industry.</p>
          <p>Next to slide number five, we're presenting the Banco do Brasil results. We've ended the first nine months 2010 with a net income of R$7.7 billion and a recurring net income up almost R$7 billion, an increase of 38.8% when compared to the same period 2009, conclude that the strategies adopted by Banco do Brasil in the past year are again seeing consistent results.</p>
          <p>Now, talking about the financial results on slide number six, we again observe the evolution of our net interest income, which grew when compared to the same period 2009, led by strong growth in revenues from loan operations, which grew 34%.</p>
          <p>In slide number seven, we have the behavior of the spread in each portfolio and also the net interest margin of earnings assets. The contraction of the spread in individual portfolio is mainly due to the concentration both less risky operation, which also bring lower margins, such as stable loans and other loans.</p>
          <p>The right graph, where we see the spread adjusted by risk, confirms that the valuation in the spread comes from the shift in the portfolio mix. Our <mark type="inaudible" /> reduction in the net interest margin compared to the Q3 '09, when it is adjusted by risk, the behavior is quite different. Since Q3 of '09, the net interest margin adjusted by risk grew 80 bps, despite a drop of 20 bps in the net interest margin before provision.</p>
          <p>On slide eight, we can see the competitive advantage in our credit costs, mainly due to a high growth in core deposits and total deposits at 2.7% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Here on slide number nine, we can see that Banco do Brasil kept its leadership in the current markets with 20% market share in September 2010, amounting at the end of that month about R$340 billion in our credit portfolio. Here the highlight is the growing share of individual portfolio in total portfolio. Now, there we have 31.6% -- that's the stake of individual portfolio in the total.</p>
          <p>On the slide number ten, we have the breakdown of individual portfolio, which grew 25.3% in 12 months. We can observe that the payroll and auto loans are responsible for 52.8% of the total individual portfolio, which explain the drop in the spread since those operations have a better risk profile.</p>
          <p>The highlight in the quarter is the auto loan portfolio, which grew 11.1% over June 2010 and 31.4% over September last year. I'd like to mention also our R$2.5 billion in mortgage loans at the end of September 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 11, we show the evolution on the balance of corporate loans, which in 12 months grew 20%. We observe that the strongest growth was in operation <mark type="inaudible" />, which explain the spread reduction of those operations, but bringing a credit risk improvement. On the next slide, we would have further details on that book.</p>
          <p>As can be seen in slide 12, we have the breakdown of our business portfolio, corporate loans. We've highlighted investment operation that represents 21.9% of the portfolio to company, an increase of 7.2% in the quarter. One year to grow our debt book reached 34%.</p>
          <p>On the slide 13, we see that SMEs loans investment operation has grown mainly in BNDES line. We highlight this to BNDES Cards, which in the quarter had an increase of 19%. That performed mainly due to the operational flexibilities of that product.</p>
          <p>On slide 14, we have the evolution in balance of working capital operations to SMEs, especially those guarantees by the <mark type="inaudible" />. The balance from those operations reached 10.6% from the second quarter 2010 through the third quarter of 2010, ended the quarter with R$5.6 billion, more than 10% of the total portfolio to SMEs.</p>
          <p>FGO, we tried <mark type="inaudible" /> to quite a few companies that do not have collateral, contributes to reduce the average risk of the portfolio.</p>
          <p>The information from slide 15 confirms Banco do Brasil's position as the largest <mark type="inaudible" /> the Brazilian agri business with 61.9% market share. Indeed, the highlight on the third quarter was the growth of marketing operations up 13% from June due to seasonal reasons, mostly direct to companies.</p>
          <p>Complementary information on slide 15 on slide 16, <mark type="inaudible" /> increase in the use of rural insurance and other risk mitigation mechanisms. More than 67% on the cost operation from the 2010/2011 crops were affected with some kind of risk mitigation mechanism, while in '09 and '10 crops, only 61% of the operation were contracted with this kind of insurance.</p>
          <p>On the bottom of this slide, we have a chart with the amount of the percentile of risk mitigator for the main Brazilian cultures. We've highlighted korn and soyabeans operation that <mark type="inaudible" /> beside the traditional weather loss.</p>
          <p>The slide 17 brings us some information on Banco Votorantim, with highlight to the fact that the volume of its operation increased as the partnership signed with Banco do Brasil after the acquisition of 50% of that company, especially the growth of its market share in auto loans. Another highlight is the fact that even with the growth of new origination, the delinquency of Banco Votorantim had declining trends since the beginning of the partnership with Banco Votorantim &#x2013; Banco do Brasil, sorry.</p>
          <p>On the slide 18, we have a comparison between the levels of risks from Banco do Brasil and the industry. And as we can see, the percentage of operation with AA-C risk from Banco do Brasil increased in the past 12 months, ending September 2010 with 92.8%. Besides that, the concentration of operations with total AA-C risk level is higher than the Brazilian bank industry.</p>
          <p>The graph on slide 19 show that the strategy adopted by Banco do Brasil, its focus in its operation to lower risk has been successful. The delinquency ratios to individuals and business had a declining trend for the 12 months that &#x2013; in lower levels than the bank industry. Reductions in delinquency can also be seen in the growth portfolio in a quarterly comparison.</p>
          <p>On the slide 20, we can see that in line with improvement observed in the portfolio, there was a reduction in the allowances for loan losses, drop of 8.1% when compared with the previous quarter and 12.5% when compared to the same period last year. Even with the asset quality improvements, <mark type="inaudible" /> coverage ratio of provision over the past due loans over 90 days, which is higher than owned from the bank industry.</p>
          <p>On slide 21, we have the evolution of commercial revenues, which grew 20.6% in 12 months. The net interest income was the main responsible for the expansion, but it's also boosted by the group performance of fee income and insurance revenues. This behavior comes from the strategy to diversify the businesses as well &#x2013; you can see in the next slides.</p>
          <p>On the next slides, the slide number 22, we show some business with high potential to diversify our revenues, highlighting the amount of fee income. The Brazil bank industry has moved into a fee-based model and the segments shown represent high growth rates. Banco do Brazil is positioning itself to capture the opportunities from that scenario. As you know, we recently announced several measures to boost card insurance revenues and we are also turning our operation in capital markets.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 23, we can observe that Banco do Brasil was able to keep its leadership in the market, about 20% in credit and debit card business. Regarding card revenues, Banco do Brasil had a positive growth in the quarter, 11.3%. Actually that supported the debit and credit card NIM.</p>
          <p>On slide 24, we can see that the reorganization of our insurance area started in 2008, is already showing results. In one year, the insurance revenues in the results decreased 37.5% that's &#x2013; those after taxes. On in the quarter, this growth was 16.7% and the insurance ratio on the Banco do Brasil recovery results of 13.5%. The goal that you have is this rate to increase to 25% in five years.</p>
          <p>On slide 25, we have the admin expenses. Considering the comparison with the same period from previous year, the admin expenses grew 10%, in the lower range of our guidance. That pro forma number contributed a total an entire year, last year, <mark type="inaudible" /> Banco do Brasil in our figures.</p>
          <p>In line with our business growth and reaffirming the rigor, our Banco do Brasil in expense controlling and management. The personnel expenses had a higher growth due to especially the number of hybrids and due to favorable rates in September.</p>
          <p>On slide 26, we have the BIS ratio, which at the end of September reached 14.2% and a low &#x2013; an expansion of up to R$118 billion in current assets, weighting in 100%. And you can see that it's subordinated debt insurance. That's an amount of $650 million held in October. The expansion of BDC would increase to R$128 billion, with a BIS ratio of 14.4% debt pro forma in October.</p>
          <p>Before we end this presentation and open the floor to Q&amp;A, we have on slide 27 the guidance for 2010 compared to <mark type="inaudible" /> end of the third quarter 2010. We want to highlight initially that we revealed once again our guidance in terms of credit costs due to the improvement in the quality of our loan book and to the change in the mix of the portfolio with increase in the concentration in those lower risky operations.</p>
          <p>Regarding the spread, we have guided for improvement compared to the second quarter 2010 &#x2013; actually the third quarter spread annualized was 6.5%. We expect more improvement in fourth quarter to end the year within the guidance.</p>
          <p>The total deposits is too below our estimate, but expectation is that strong growth in deposit base in the last quarter of the year. With that individuals portfolio, we now expect a strong growth &#x2013; a stronger growth in the last quarter in order to fulfill the guidance in that regard.</p>
          <p>Well, those were the subjects that we would like to highlight and share with you. We can now move to Q&amp;A session. We're going to have with us Mr. Ivan de Souza Monteiro, our CFO, along with the Accountant &#x2013; General Accountant, Mr. Eduardo Pasa. Also <mark type="inaudible" /> Managing Director and other representatives from <mark type="inaudible" /> in the bank. REIT management, credit and debit card, M&amp;A, <mark type="inaudible" /> Votorantim corporate governance and agri business and also SME Directors.</p>
          <p>Thank you very much and we'll open the call to Q&amp;A.</p>

    <section name="Q&amp;A">
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now being the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Carlos Macedo from Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Gilberto. I have a couple of questions that I'd like to ask. The first one is with respect to tax because we saw your effective tax rate take a slight dip in the quarter. I was wondering if that's related to the extra capital for you &#x2013; that you've put in and interest in capital you're able to pay or is there any reason for the lower taxes and what we should expect going forward?</p>
          <p>The second question is with respect to the surplus that you have at Previ. I was wondering if you could give us an update on what level <mark type="inaudible" /> and then what could we expect for the fourth quarter coming from that and how we account for that in the fourth quarter, if that's going to be similar to the second quarter where you restated your earnings for the first quarter? Are we going to see a restatement in the earnings for the third quarter, at least managerially to transfer the surplus?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, thanks for the participation. Yeah, we basically talk about the &#x2013; this is specific ratio about &#x2013; we talk about the reduction of the <mark type="inaudible" />. And talking about Previ, I'd just like to add that we are &#x2013; in terms of <mark type="inaudible" /> in Previ, the leadership of the participant, just to try to reduce the <mark type="inaudible" /> in our balance sheet. We are trying to reach an agreement with <mark type="inaudible" /> that provides all the information for this agreement. But we'd like to do this in a semester a very good commission.</p>
          <p>We are on the schedule to do this, but &#x2013; and we hope that we can finalize this in 2010. It is difficult to forecast this, but we are working hard to do this, to talk about <mark type="inaudible" />.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So first of all, about the tax that we have in the third quarter, mostly it is explained by the fact that we have a capital rate, 79% in our capital rates. And as a consequence, we have more opportunities to have higher level of investment on capital that will be worked back to the bank. <mark type="inaudible" /> the guidance, the guidance has been for tax rate to be 31% to 34%. <mark type="inaudible" /> guidance, probably we'll be in 2010 reaching <mark type="inaudible" /> of the guidance in terms of tax rate. That's a benefit of course. A part of it comes from the benefit of having a capital raise and a higher level in terms of capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then I would like to just &#x2013; sorry to interrupt, but this means you are ending the year lower than you began and that presumably next year will be lower than this year because of the capital you raise?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, yeah. Of course, the first part of the year, we have a higher level of tax because we had a lower level of capital base. In the second part of the year, we're going to have lower level of tax. So as a consequence, for the entire year, we expect to have 31%, close to the 31%, considering the benefit of having higher level of &#x2013; than the present CapEx. That's it.</p>
          <p>And talking about Previ, what you're going to have moving forward, until December, we're going to have a R$183 million <mark type="inaudible" /> revenues that we have in the entire second half of 2010, the same level that we have from July to September, so we're going to have, again, from October to December. And at the end of December, we're going to have the same we had in June, the reevaluation, the reassessment of assets and the liabilities. We're going to hire a consultation company to reevaluate the liability and we're going to mark-to-market assets in order to see that if there's going to be <mark type="inaudible" /> at the end of the year. Of course, it tends to be higher than we have in June because <mark type="inaudible" /> investment in Brazil during the second part of the year. But definitely, what we do know for sure is the same revenue that will be until December, 183 million, but it's something that we're going to get only at the end of the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you give us some estimate based on what it was at the end of the third quarter?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It seems like the bulk of equity investment of Brazil, the big <mark type="inaudible" /> Petrobras, Banco do Brasil, <mark type="inaudible" /> and so on, and compare the value that we have in June. In doing that, the asset of Previ is R$130 billion. And this investment &#x2013; all these investments in equity, they are higher R$50 billion in Q2, okay? So probably, we're going to see the asset increase from R$130 billion in equity, R$145 billion at the end of the year. So after that, after the mark-to-market, so we have simulations here in the asset base at the end of the year. <mark type="inaudible" /> simulating, we're going to have an asset of R$145 billion and a liability of 80-something, R$85 billion. So at the end of the day, we are going to have R$50 billion that's left. In June, the surplus was from R$70, okay?</p>
          <p>But it's important to highlight that we need to expect the market conditions because we know the aim of the liability very well. But as we mentioned, the 70% of the total assets of Previ <mark type="inaudible" /> the capital markets. It is important and it's investment <mark type="inaudible" /> we need to be careful about these numbers, okay?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. But just to be clear, you will mark this fully. You will divide this between the third and the fourth quarter like you did in the first half of the year so far.</p>

            <mark type="inaudible" /> I don't know yet. I had a lot of complaint to that regard, okay?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Marcelo Telles with Credit Suisse.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. The first one, I was wondering if you could give a sense to us of what can we expect in terms of a loan growth for 2011. And it is &#x2013; on the individual segment, if you still expect the vehicle financing and credit cards to be the highest growth subsegment. And the second question is, looking at your margin, in one of your financial statements, you have a breakdown between margin with customers and margins not with customers. And there was a big reduction in the margin that's not related to interest and I was wondering if you could elaborate what drove that reduction? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks a lot. So talking about the loan growth, we are pretty positive for 2011 because not all &#x2013; there is a kind of perception in Brazil that the positive growth movement, 7%, even more than this in 2010 and there is a perception on the average for 2011, highest between 4 and 4.5. Banco do Brasil is very comfortable with these environments. And we'd like to continue supporting the Brazilian economy.</p>
          <p>
            <mark type="inaudible" /> 30 million, 40 million people that we'll call the new breed of customers markets. They are buying the new refrigerator, the new house, the new car. And we would like to support them. We know that our network distribution, <mark type="inaudible" /> subsequently. And it's important that we can keep improving our credit portfolio. You know the cost of this volume wasn't really the best cost in our country. And we are able to compete in a very good position <mark type="inaudible" /> Brazil.</p>
          <p>The second question, Ivan, could you please?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Marcello, as far as, let's say, our &#x2013; the table number five where you have the breakdown of the margin. That's the line of debate. We have &#x2013; what is actually &#x2013; to share with you, the fact that actually <mark type="inaudible" /> loans increased 24.2%. In other process, in other lines like treasury, like reserve requirements, like recovery, we have an increase of 16.4%. And that may be &#x2013; the idea is to <mark type="inaudible" /> an improvement to increase the size of credit portfolio in the generation of earning assets on the bank. Because we are &#x2013; we were behind of our peers when compared, for instance, the loan to the corporations. Last year, the loan to corporation was at 87% and now it is at 97%. So that's what the idea is to go deeper in our earning assets by increasing the credit portfolio because the yield in credit portfolio close to 10%, while other earning assets were in that net interest mark of Banco do Brasil, roughly 53%. So it's quite reasonable to say that it is better to maintain our strategy in growing our credit portfolio in order to gain a better margin or, I believe, a more defensive, more resilient margin considering the fact that <mark type="inaudible" /> credit portfolio itself. We are seeing the increase in the margin. So that's 8 billion. That's strength of the bank.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just to follow-up on the second question, I appreciate your answer, but I am referring to table 61, you have other components of your financial margins. There was a big decline from R$865 million to R$396 million. And if you split out the credit recoveries <mark type="inaudible" /> included in that line, you actually had a R$657million loss in that line compared to a slight positive number in the second quarter. So I'm wondering if there was any sort of mark-to-market loss that had a negative impact in the third quarter, so that's why I am asking this question. Thank you.</p>

          <p>Yes. Good morning, everyone. My question is on provision for loan losses which have been decreasing <mark type="inaudible" /> average loans throughout the year and <mark type="inaudible" /> much lower here on the year, much lower than you were expecting at the beginning of the year. Can you give us a guidance what you would expect in terms of provisions of average loans for next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Gilberto, can you please answer this?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The last time we got 3.8%, it is better than the last year, but it is higher than when we have prior to the crisis. Prior to the crisis, these rates would reach 3.6%. So it's very important to bear in mind that prior to the crisis, the size of loan, loans like stable loans and car financing, now recently mortgage loans, it is lower at that time than it is nowadays. So now, we have a better shape within the credit portfolio &#x2013; more defensive credit portfolio, more collateralized because we have a sizable volume of stable loans and also the size of the car financing. So now, we have a better shape in terms of credit portfolio, so the broad fact is to see over time this ratios, revenues having &#x2013; going to decrease even more. So we do not have yet the guidance for next year, but probably consider the fact that the condition of our economy, it is better than it is &#x2013; it was when we have the 3.6%. We are really confident that we are going to have room to decrease to have a better shape in terms of credit cost, having been even lower than 3.6%, 3.5%. We do not have the guidance yet, but the prospect is very good.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I may add, it's better to highlight what is there. When we closed the book, we aim to do see more and more the <mark type="inaudible" /> talking about the insurance that provides the protection against the problem with few assets and provide protection against the volatility of the product. That is very important. And creates a very good &#x2013; not always it is forecast for the 2010, 2011 for us, but we <mark type="inaudible" /> using more and more, providing this good behavior for our credit portfolio as a whole.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a very, very good point to advance for 2010 and 2011 problem, besides that we have contracted 6% to 7.3% that's guaranteed by insurance or price <mark type="inaudible" /> like a kind of derivative. So it's 5.3% of the total, of working capital line that was &#x2013; went through the former &#x2013; guaranteed by price inflations <mark type="inaudible" />. And the insurance would make a move. And another important fact is that the size of &#x2013; the reason that we have for those operation, that was <mark type="inaudible" /> effect. We have first time much provision to guarantee to cover delinquencies in those operations. So the prospect, it is &#x2013; we have an important size of provision. We have a 200% of the total 90 days of residual grace of the total portfolio. It is provisioned. And when talking about the provisions, our business, the level for which is extremely higher. So we are pretty much prepared to face volatility in the future and we have a better environment in the future also. So the prospect, when talking about credit costs, is very good for the system, mostly for Banco do Brasil.</p>

And just to follow up on a previous question, I'm not sure if I missed it, but do you have an idea of how &#x2013; what loan growth will look like for next year and also would you expect the individual loan portfolio to continue to outpace the rest of the segments?</p>

          <p>We feel comfortable that we can keep or increase our market share. We have &#x2013; we achieved 20% market share and <mark type="inaudible" />. But I need to tell you that for 2011, I believe that there will be more participation in the investment. You know that the new <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil, we are investing a lot in the economies. We need to follow the demand that is increasing a lot loss in Brazil, especially talking about the GDP growth. And Banco do Brasil is prepared to do this. And I believe that we're going to see some mix change in the credit portfolio, but we'll keep our leadership. And I believe &#x2013; and I hope in some sectors that as leaders of mortgage, we are going to increase more than the markets &#x2013; than the average of the market.</p>

      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, everyone. Actually it's Joao Batista. Much of my question is about auto loans in this quarter. Auto loans grew more than 10%. You know that there is a very significant difference in net cost from the new cars versus used cars. We would like to know what's the breakdown between the new cars and the second hand cars in the outstanding portfolio and in the origination? And if you talk about <mark type="inaudible" /> has changed their policy of reduced average term to used cars?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We all follow the market. When we acquired half of Banco Votorantim, we changed the portfolio origination. We are more focused on the dealers on the new car, new ones. It is different from the old portfolio that was most focused on the second-hand car. I believe that now, if we break down, this is 60 for the new and 40 for the second-hand. As of now, for the outstanding, well, I'm talking about the generation, the new ones that we're using every single day and we feel comfortable about <mark type="inaudible" /> or the average that we use directly to our customers. <mark type="inaudible" /> you see that the mix is going down and we increased the market share in the origination. We have now reached 22.8%. And we have to keep this position. We are not focused on increasing market share. We're focused on the profitability of Banco Votorantim and we feel comfortable with these levels &#x2013; these actual levels.</p>

          <p>Let me add with the outstanding &#x2013; talking about outstanding, we have a very important change. Last year, used car, again the third and fourth quarter, was slightly, at September 2009, was 82.9% and this year September 2010 70%.

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Two questions, one a follow-up on the earlier question on Previ. You mentioned that the third quarter increased by about &#x2013; due to that depreciation in the third quarter by about R$15 billion. I wanted to &#x2013; first of all, should we expect that increase assuming all things remain equal to flow through your book value in your earnings in the third &#x2013; in the fourth quarter? And secondly, what would that mean for 2011? Currently, I think you're thinking an ongoing gain of about R$183 million per month if the markets remain where they are at. What would that entail for 2011 on an ongoing basis in terms Votorantim?</p>
          <p>And secondly, a follow-up on the auto question. You grew 11% in the quarter. Can you talk about why you've been so successful there and sort of the leverage of Votorantim platform and how would you respond to some of your competitors who have been saying that you guys have been very aggressive in pricing and they feel <mark type="inaudible" /> little bit too aggressive in terms of your pricing and commission structure, how do you respond to those criticisms?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Beginning &#x2013; for the second part of your question, we're not so aggressive. We are seeing the market and I believe that we have through Banco Votorantim a really stable cost of funding. I'm rather talking about the size, talking about the cost, I believe that Banco Votorantim has the technology for working with the dealers. They developed, and it's a very good one, the methodology &#x2013; credit methodologies there. We just <mark type="inaudible" /> to directly &#x2013; to work with brand new car. It's different from the previous strategy. And I believe that we're in the market, we're doing well. We provide the funding, really stable funding and we are able to develop the new markets and we are doing this in aggregate. In the <mark type="inaudible" /> our main competitors, I'd like to remember that we are the last bank to reach this position. We are now the second bank &#x2013; we reached the second position talking about financing <mark type="inaudible" /> review and we'd like to improve and to be the number one in this market. Gilberto, could you answer the first part of the question?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First of all, <mark type="inaudible" /> that Previ assets very much dependable in the market price. 6% of the total asset of Previ is comprised by equity investments. But having it in mind, we can have a simulation <mark type="inaudible" /> the bulk of the equity investment of Previ, <mark type="inaudible" />. These shares, we might increase since June. The last time that we made a reassessment of the asset, the mark-to-market of the assets, these equity investments increased by R$50 billion, okay. So it would mean &#x2013; only for the sake of simulation, it would mean an increase of R$50 billion in the asset that we had in June. In June, we had as assets R$130 billion. Below R$15 billion it would mean R$145 billion. So from October to December, we're going to have again the same revenues that we accounted in the third quarter of R$550 million, R$183 million per month. And in December, we're going to hire a consultancy firm to reevaluate the liabilities, really be very much easy to calculate it, probably going to be increased by the application on interest rate for R$85 billion. We had in June, 83, we're going to have it increased to 85, I don't know.</p>
          <p>But in terms of assets, we have had a better environment for equity investment in the second part of the year. So probably, we're going to see the surplus increasing. The last number of surplus that we had in June was R$47 billion. Divide this, we have the surplus increase to R$50 billion because increasing liability and increase in assets. We have to oblige the rule that we are using to calculate the revenue that should be accounted. That is the application of <mark type="inaudible" /> asset. 10% of the asset divided by two and accounted the part that belongs to the second part of the year divided by the number of semester that we have to have everybody reaching 30 years in Previ contribution, okay. So I don't know, it's hard to project.</p>
          <p>And the size of revenue that we're going to have in last year, 2011, will depend on the size of surplus that we're going to get at the end of this year, okay. So that's good.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I had a question regarding your conversations with the central bank regarding the impact of the Basel III and methodology that should be incremental in the next eight years in Brazil. I'm asking where you have made a preliminary assessment of where your core capital raises would be, taking into account the new guidelines? And what is the outlook or possibility that the National Treasury would allow you to deduct from current taxes and the provisions you make for <mark type="inaudible" />, et cetera, in order to reduce the size of the deferred tax assets in your balance sheet, which is an increasingly important issue given the new regulatory guidelines?</p>
          <p>Secondly, we know that the level of provisions that the bank has relative to 90 billion non-performing loans are very hard because the provisions are driven not by the incurred losses on your actual net of home loans, but <mark type="inaudible" /> loans associated with the types of loans that you're granting? And do you think that there is any scope for this realization to change in light of the regulatory changes? Are you asking for any progress on this front? Because otherwise, it appears that Brazil is ready to have &#x2013; already has in place an expected loss provisioning method relative to incurred losses and should we expect this methodology to continue going forward?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. The first is regarding Basel III. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Yeah, we are proceeding on many discussions with banks in Brazil. We've also <mark type="inaudible" /> potential banks in order to see what could be the impact because &#x2013; on the back of the <mark type="inaudible" /> Basel III in Brazil. There are many discussions to be done because there are certain business strategies in Brazil. The main topic is tax credit because you may know tax credit is mostly linked to time differences that we have in Brazil, in effect that we do provision, for instance, in credits, upfront in Brazil, and it brings a lot of tax credits.</p>
          <p>So on one hand, we are reducing our capital base because of provision we made to prevent from any volatility in terms of credits. In other hand, we will have demand that banks invest the tax credit. It's pretty much linked to those provisions that we have made to prevent from having rate volatility. So that's something that we have &#x2013; we have to have a lot of discussion to understand better because we are talking about the same thing. Provision, it relates to prevent from having rate volatility, prevent from having setbacks in the future because of change in the environment and economy. And the tax credit, that is linked to the kind of provision that's being driven by the capital base. That's a thing to be discussed. We understand those that who have direct link losses, there is no &#x2013; that's not mature in our &#x2013; when talking about the tax credit in terms of Brazil. So talk about tax credits pretty much is linked to provision.</p>
          <p>So we do not have anything in relation on that for driving cash. We believe that in future when we have the adoption of this Basel III, we'll consider this <mark type="inaudible" /> in Brazil regarding mostly tax credits.</p>
          <p>The other items, goodwill and other items, it's not a big deal for Brazilian banks. The problem here is that &#x2013; the issue that we have on the table in discussion that we have with the banks is mostly related to the tax credits. So we do not have any projection on that regard.</p>
          <p>Bear in mind that we have to face the change in regulation from 2013, 2014, and we have &#x2013; it will take a while to fulfill 100% <mark type="inaudible" /> 2018 or 2019. So a lot of things to be discussed yet.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Talking about the provisions, we didn't see this from the regulator. We understand that they are going to change the rules for the provisions in Brazil. The provisions are upfront and they are linked with <mark type="inaudible" /> and it's the collateral that provides the guarantee for the loan. We didn't see any <mark type="inaudible" /> from the regulator that is going to change this. And we feel comfortable about this. I believe that this conservative approach that the regulator has in Brazil proves that was very good during the crisis. That's why I don't think that they're going to move.</p>

          <p>Hi. Yes, good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but just to follow-up on the credit quality question. Gentlemen, what do you &#x2013; what do you see in terms of current trading so far in Q4 in terms of credit quality? Do you see &#x2013; on the consumer side, do you see credit quality leveling off? Do you see at the margin any slight worsening in the SME portfolios or is this still going on a positive trend that we shall see no pressure here coming through on the credit quality side? And if you could give us some idea of kind of a range of maybe what we might expect in terms of NPLs for 2011, sort of initial guidance, and maybe also similarly a range for coverage ratio for 2011? And another question on capital, would you &#x2013; are you considering to do any kind of further capital increases and perhaps what options do you have left to you to &#x2013; and also increase Tier 2 capital <mark type="inaudible" />? Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. When we issued the new shares in July, we again basically increased the Tier 2. We have considerably &#x2013; we issued $660 million recently. We're waiting for the approval from the central banks to add this to market.</p>
          <p>This trend for the credit portfolio, talking about the differences, is a positive trend. And we can't tell you now what our numbers for 2011, we didn't discuss it yet. We are focusing on 2010. But as you said, it is a positive trend. Not only talking about SMEs, there is a &#x2013; you know that there is a movement in our economy that we call formalization that people that are coming into the formal markets now because there is a very good environment for doing business in Brazil. We see customers who work with these new SMEs uses our guarantee fund that includes &#x2013; that we put in place and we developed during the crisis that provides the guarantee for these new entrepreneurs and we feel comfortable about it, and the trend is positive. Despite all the competitors are fresh to the market and put a lot of pressure on the spread, but we feel comfortable where we have the best cost of funding in Brazil and we are able to complete these assets in our pocket to improve.</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I believe it's pretty much the same that we are <mark type="inaudible" />. The fact that &#x2013; we have with me Mr. Walter Malieni in Europe that's telling me that in the fourth quarter the trend is quite, let's say, an improvement in delinquency ratio, not only in the individuals portfolio, but also in property loans, SMEs, so pretty much the same trend in having improvement in those delinquency ratio in 2010 through the end of December this year. So for next year, the expectation is to enjoy the dynamics of our economy that's quite good. The prospect is quite good. The expectation is to see economy increasing about 4.5%. So quite good for a company and quite good for individual also. So that's &#x2013; that should maintain the trend of <mark type="inaudible" /> debt to a lot of looking to do business and improving the risk profile of our credit portfolio.</p>

      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Just one quick question on equalization. I noticed that equalization has been trending the historical high levels in the third quarter. Again, I also noticed that the equalized credit has been, if not crazy, been diluted by the increase of non-equalizable credit. So what is the expected levels for equalization in the upcoming quarters, do you have <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The level of equalization that we expect to see for crop of 2010, 2011 is R$500 million per quarter. That's the expectation that we have. The negotiation that we had with the government <mark type="inaudible" /> for 2010 and 2011 crop. So there's kind of carryover effect because consider that that's been maintained, we repeat the equalization as renewals with the average debt that's outstanding. So a part of this, above those R$2 billion, it can have a carryover effect. It would depends if by any chance we have more settlement or not. So we have &#x2013; if we maintain the average balance in a higher level, we're going to have more equalization revenues. So this 600 million &#x2013; R$631 million that we have, there's this flexibility that we have to comply with the reserve requirements, it's 48 billion. I referred to the figure of 27. That was something that had a carryover effect from the previous crop. For 2010 and 2011 crops, the negotiation was to have R$ 2 billion for the entire crop until June next year.</p>
