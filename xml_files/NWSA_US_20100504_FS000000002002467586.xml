          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the News Corp. Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Release.  At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode.  Later we'll have a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />  As a reminder today's conference is being recorded.  I would now turn the conference over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations News Corp., Reed Nolte.  Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our Third Quarter Fiscal 2010 Earnings Conference Call. On the call today are Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Dave DeVoe, our Chief Financial Officer.  Dave will give a detailed presentation of the quarter results followed by Rupert who will give his own perspective and color on the quarter.  We'll then take your questions, first from the financial community and then from the press.</p>
          <p>This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corporation's business strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corporation's Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2010 identifies risks and opportunities that could cause actual results to differ. And these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of and a reconciliation of such measures can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. And with that, I'll turn it over to David.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Reed, thank you.  And good afternoon, everybody. As you all have seen in today's earnings release, we're very pleased with the financial results of the third quarter of fiscal 2010. Revenues grew 19% over the third quarter a year ago with increases in all of our major segments led by double digit increases in our Filmed Entertainment, Cable Networks, Newspapers and Book Publishing segments.</p>
          <p>Fueled by this top line growth and benefiting from our cost reduction efforts, segment operating income exceeded $1.25 billion, an improvement of 55% from a year ago. This growth rises to 67% after considering the absence of NDS results from this year.</p>
          <p>Net income in the quarter was $839 million with earnings per share of $0.32. This compares to last year's third quarter's net income of 2.7 billion or 1.04 cents a share; and as a reminder the year-ago quarter included one-time items of $1.1 billion in after-tax income or $0.43 a share, this largely reflects the gain on the NDS transaction, as well as a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.2 billion or $0.46 a share.</p>
          <p>Included in this year's results are one-time items netting to after-tax income of $79 million or $0.03 a share and this is primarily related to News Corporation's share BSkyB's gain on their partial sale of iTV and a tax benefit associated with an asset sale.</p>
          <p>In looking at our businesses this quarter clearly the stand-out performances were from our Cable and Film segments, which together delivered nearly $1.1 billion of the company's operating profit.  At our Cable Networks we continue to deliver solid growth with operating income contributions up 38% on 16% higher revenues. Overall affiliate fees increased 16% from growth across all the channels and advertising revenues were up 19% reflecting the strength of FOX News and our International Cable businesses. Our Cable Networks now account for nearly 50% of our operating income and we expect this percentage to continue to increase.</p>
          <p>The primary drivers behind the year-over-year increases were from the FOX News Channel, which achieved its highest ever quarterly profit due to strong affiliate fees and advertising increases. The March quarter was the channel's highest rated quarter in the network history in terms of total viewers.  At this point we have renegotiated all the original carriage deals with major cable and satellite distributors that were made at the launch, and renewals will begin again at the end of this calendar year.</p>
          <p>Our Regional Sports Networks also generated higher profit contributions driven by double digit affiliate revenue increases. The RSN's advertising revenues were up only slightly in the March quarter which was adversely impacted by the NHL Olympic break. More recent trends suggest advertising on local sports is starting to follow the upswing we're seeing at our local broadcast television stations.</p>
          <p>The FOX International channels also reported a 48% profit increase on strong advertising and affiliate revenue growth particularly in Europe and Asia. And finally at our STAR businesses in India and greater China are showing renewed strength with higher profit contributions supported by advertising increases. STAR Plus in India has regained its leadership position in ratings and the strength of our Bengali regional channels and south India channels continue to drive higher revenue and profits.</p>
          <p>At our Film segment, third quarter operating income was a record $497 million, up $215 million or 76% over last year's results. This strong performance was very much driven by the phenomenal success of Avatar with over $2.7 billion in worldwide box office receipts. The quarter also benefited from the theatrical success of Alvin and the Chipmunks II as well as continued strong home entertainment performances from Ice Age, X-Men, and Night at the Museum 2.</p>
          <p>Turning to our pay television business SKY Italia, SKY generated segment operating income of $35 million as compared to 63 million in the third quarter a year ago reflecting the continued challenging business and economic environment in Italy. While SKY Italia's financial results are clearly not as strong as we'd like to report, we continue to remain very confident in the local growth of this profitable business in this under-penetrated market. Total revenues at SKY declined 3% in local currency terms as compared to the prior quarter largely reflecting fewer average subscribers and flat ARPU in the quarter compared to a year ago.</p>
          <p>Overall costs were flat as higher sports-related costs were offset by savings in other programming and subscriber acquisition cost. SKY Italia subscriber base declined by 39,000 compared with the previous quarter end as total quarterly gross additions of 118,000 were more an offset by churn.  SKY's total subscriber count at end of quarter was 4.7 million subscribers. At the end of the March quarter over 2.4 million subscribers representing approximately 54% of the subscriber base were taking in HD or PVR premium service compared with approximately 26% of the base a year ago.  As a result of the growth in these premium services, we've begun to see some improvement in the overall churn rate and currently the annual churn rate is expected to be approximately 13%, which is consistent with the prior year. We expect the upcoming World Cup broadcast in June as well as increased adoption of premium services to help stabilize churn and return SKY to growing subscribers.</p>
          <p>Our Television segment generated operating income in the quarter of $40 million as compared to 9 million reported in the third quarter a year ago. This $30 million improvement was driven by strong revenue growth at our television stations partially offset by increased losses at the broadcast network from lower ratings. Station revenues were up 18% in the quarter compared to a year ago reflecting improved local advertising trends particularly in the automotive and telecommunications sectors. As a result of the cost containment initiatives at the stations, their entire revenue increase was converted to increased earnings.</p>
          <p>Shifting to Newspapers and Information Services, operating income in this sector -- this year's quarter was $131 million, this is up nearly five-fold from 29 million reported a year ago. This substantial improvement is largely driven by higher advertising across all our markets and lower operating expenses throughout all our newspaper businesses. Ad growth at The Wall Street Journal was approximately 25% while UK titles in local currency revenues increased by nearly 10%.</p>
          <p>Our newspaper results also benefited from the favorable foreign exchange impact of nearly $30 million related to the strengthening of the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. In our Other segment we reported a third quarter operating loss of $150 million as compared to a loss of 88 million a year ago. The $62 million increase primarily reflects the absence of NDS's operating profits this year due to its partial sale in early February of 2009. The third quarter year ago including $60 million in NDS operating income; additionally the Digital Media Group reported higher losses principally from lower search and advertising revenues offset in part by cost reductions from our recent restructuring.</p>
          <p>And before I address our guidance, I'd just like to make a couple of comments related to our balance sheet. Our gross debt balance at the end of March quarter was $13.5 billion, a reduction of nearly 1.8 billion from the prior quarter. Our cash balance at quarter end was nearly 8.2 billion, an increase of over $900 million. These balances take into account the receipt of nearly $900 million from the Dow Jones index related transactions; the redemption of substantially all of the box exchangeable securities, at one point a $1.6 billion outflow; the maturity and repayment of a $150 million senior note; and approximately $2.1 billion in cash flow from operations less CapEx in the quarter. Note that this very high cash flow from operations includes the receipt of the majority of Avatar's box office revenues, a sizable portion of which will be paid to third party participants on the film in this current June quarter.</p>
          <p>Our strong free cash flow generation in conjunction with asset sales has led to the build-up of significant cash balances.  We're well aware of the resulting inefficient capital structure and are evaluating options for the best use of our surplus cash. This is an important area of focus for us and our Board of Directors as we proceed through our fiscal year 2011 budget process, which is currently underway. We intend to provide guidance on this issue by our next earnings call.</p>
          <p>And finally let me address our earnings guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2010. As a reminder, we measure this guidance excluding from the fiscal 2009 segment operating income results, the $121 million in operating profit from NDS, which is no longer consolidated in our results. So as we look at measuring growth in fiscal 2010 we are comparing it to a base of 3.44 billion in segment operating profit for fiscal 2009. Excuse me.</p>
          <p>In early February, we gave guidance anticipating our operating income growth rate for fiscal 2010 to be in the low 20% range, above the 3.4 billion fiscal 2009 adjusted result.  Although we have performed better than anticipated in several of our businesses, resulting in the 42% growth rate we just reported for the first nine months, we are currently forecasting our fourth quarter results to be down from a year ago. The primary reason for this is that despite the solid home entertainment performance forecasted for Avatar, we're expecting the Film segment to be down approximately $100 million from last year, principally due to year-over-year timing of releases. Last year's very strong result included a significant number of home entertainment and free and pay-TV releases; and also this year we are expecting slightly higher releasing costs for our June releases.</p>
          <p>In addition, we are projecting lower results at FBC due to higher programming costs, lower network revenues and higher marketing in support of our summer schedule. As a result, taking all these items into account and excluding the effect of the prior year's Valassis litigation settlement, we're increasing our operating income guidance to a growth rate of in the high 20% range above the fiscal 2009 adjusted results.</p>
          <p>I think it's important to underscore that this upcoming fourth quarter comparison is not at all indicative of the overall growth momentum of our businesses. While it's premature to get into a discussion around the guidance for our next fiscal year, we feel very good about the continued growth momentum for the company as we look to 2011. With that I would now like to turn the call over to Rupert for his comments.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, David. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Dave has just reviewed with you we had really exceptional results in this last quarter, pretty much across the board. We do feel good not just about this quarter but about the rest of the year and beyond and I think for five reasons. First is the primacy of our content. On this call last quarter I spent a lot of time discussing the value of content and the crucial role that content plays in the future of our company. Our results this past quarter continue to bear that out.</p>
          <p>Content is driving our outstanding performance. From the history-making film Avatar to the unstoppable FOX News Channel, to our popular regional sports channels to new hit shows like Glee and Modern Family, the growth at our flagship newspapers and international channels.  Fortune favors the bold. In almost every area of the media our approach to content is setting new standards for success and redefining the industry. In Film, Avatar is not only number one it has redefined 3-D.</p>
          <p>In Television, we have the number one entertainment network and we have the number one news network, something we were told was impossible. And although our newspaper division is only 17% of our total business we have the number one national paper on all three continents. The second reason I'm confident about our future is that we continue to extend our core businesses in innovative ways. New technologies like 3-D and mobile platforms are opening up new avenues for real revenue growth. Just last month Apple introduced its iPad, which I believe will lead a revolution in media consumption and create added value for both our news and entertainment content.</p>
          <p>As I said last time, these new digital devices are entirely dependent on the flow of high-quality content, the business we are in. We are uniquely poised to capitalize on this proliferation, which is providing another revenue stream to publishers and studios. In news, for example, we live in a world where the consumption in general has never been greater. By taking advantage of innovations such as the iPad we are now delivering first-rate journalism in ways geared to a new generation of consumers, a generation that relies on digital devices for both their professional and personal use.</p>
          <p>In just the first month alone we have more than 64,000 active users for the WSJ iPad app. And unlike the Kindle, we keep 100% of the subscriber revenue with the iPad.</p>
          <p>Today we're in final discussions with a number of publishers, device makers and technology companies. And we will soon develop an innovative subscription model that will deliver digital content to consumers wherever and whenever they want it.</p>
          <p>Only a couple of weeks ago for example FOX led a consortium of American broadcast groups in announcing a joint venture, one that will develop a new national mobile content service using broadcast spectrum we already own. It could prove a financial boon to companies like ours with a wealth of valuable local and national news content.</p>
          <p>The third reason I'm bullish on News Corporation's future is that our core businesses are strongly positioned to grow for the foreseeable future. In broadcasting, we're now on track to build a dual revenue stream that enables FOX to achieve real value, one that equals its strength and importance to viewers.  And we will continue to negotiate hard with all our distribution partners to ensure we remain on this track. Retransmission is a real breakthrough.</p>
          <p>In Cable, our channels are young. We have great momentum with plenty of room for growth both in the United States and internationally. This business accounts now for about half of our total company earnings. In the U.S. we are leading the competition with quality brands like FOX News, FOX Business, FX, and Nat Geo. And internationally we've built a position of true leadership with FOX International Channels, one that will only continue to strengthen as multi-channel subscription TV around the world catches up with the U.S.</p>
          <p>Finally, we continue to sharpen our focus by divesting in non-core businesses like bTV, Balkans TV and the Dow Jones index business while further investing in businesses and regions with high growth potential such as Germany and the Middle East. Let me close by saying that in the ad market we are currently seeing strong across the board growth particularly in the U.S. and Britain.  That bodes well for many of our core businesses. We're optimistic about the trends we're seeing.  We're even more optimistic about the clear momentum in our businesses which vindicate our strategy and build greater shareholder value. Thank you very much and I'd be happy to answer your questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Our first question will come from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks so much. I have a question for Rupert and Chase. Including fiscal year '10, seven of the last ten years News Corp. put up double digit EBIT growth and two of those three years that you did not were recession years and the other was 8% growth. So I think as we look forward to 2011 there's a lot of concern among investors you're not going to be able to keep up the same strong growth pace that you delivered last decade partly due to tough Film comps. So my question is do you believe strong growth will continue in fiscal '11, and if so, what gives you that confidence?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. But not 67%. And how strong?  Whether it be in single digits or double digits, I don't know. A lot of it is in timing on the films. We have as a matter of fact a great slate of films coming up but we don't have an Avatar in there. So, but that will be more than compensated for by the outstanding growth which is guaranteed in our cable channels. So if this present growth in advertising that's very evident at the moment continues, I think we can be very confident.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd just -- I guess to add to that probably in the Film segment we do have a tough comparison because of Avatar, but really across the rest of the business it's certainly the case. It continues to have great momentum. You see it in the numbers and there's really nothing -- no reason we don't continue to build on that. If anything you have got an ad market that is even picking up. And so you look at some of the sports businesses have probably been a little slower than others in terms of the ad markets taking up, and they're now seeing a pick up. I think the station business actually probably has some favorable comparisons when you look at the first half of last year, some benefits there.</p>
          <p>So I think we look at those businesses. We've got an ad market out there that really right now on almost every level looks great. It continues to be a strong scatter market on both cable and broadcast side.  You continue to have sort of really competition you haven't seen for a while in key sectors of the ad market whether it's autos or retail or telecom, consumer electronics. Again, I think we get some benefits on the newspaper side with comparisons against a year ago and sort of expect to continue to see the momentum there.</p>
          <p>So it is -- it is a business that -- it is a set of businesses that I think we feel pretty good about. You look at something like the broadcast business, re-trans is clearly just going to continue to build as more players come up, and we move through the next few years. So that will clearly be helping both the stations and the networks. So we think we got good momentum to the majority of our businesses.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. David, I just wondered if you could give us some more details on what capital management options are being considered.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can answer that if you like.  And just to say that, you know, the -- we're well aware that our balance sheet as Dave said, you know, is inefficient at the moment, given the amount of cash we have. We're looking at all our options, to make best use of this cash and expect to take actions within the next three months. Options available to us include increased dividends, stock buy-backs, debt repayments and investing in our businesses. Options -- and always opportunistic to make accretive investments that generate a good return for shareholders.  I think we have not done this in the last year because we have been nervous, we've thought that the world economy wherever we looked pretty fragile and now there is a growing air of confidence so we'll see.  But if the opportunities don't arise in the way that we expect to in the next few months we will do something else.</p>

          <p>Next question, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That question comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could give a little more color in terms of near term momentum particularly in local TV and newspaper, characterize placings in local TV and newspaper and then more specifically in the press release you talked about auto and telecom being the stand out categories. Auto's been a big driver. Are you starting to see kind of a broader -- a broader recovery in more categories? Difference between first and &#x2013; or first calendar quarter and second calendar quarter? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. First in terms of momentum I think the station business for the quarter we're in is sort of in the mid 20s. I think even plus that as we go through the quarter. So it certainly probably is strong, is stronger than it's been if anything.  And it really is a broad-based, at this point really pretty much most categories. So it's not just auto and telecom.  I mean again, if you look at the retail sector, you look at the financial sector which people have talked about and you got nice competition in the insurance space.</p>
          <p>So it is -- it's pretty broad and again, pretty healthy dynamics. Pharmaceutical sector is not one &#x2013; that one we're not that big into. So maybe not all of them. But it is &#x2013; I'd say it's a broad healthy market with many things, sort of I think people feeling they're going &#x2013; there's more competition for market share, an awareness that if you want to try and be in the game you got to &#x2013; and you want to build a brand, you got to market it. And I think Television in particular has once again sort of proven the test of time that &#x2013; as much as everybody sort of wants some of these new mediums to emerge, the power of television advertising is second to none. But it really is, it is a certainly not driven by a couple of sectors, it's a broad healthy market right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'd just add that I think we're seeing pretty optimistic and expanded advertising budgets from the big advertisers. When that money will drop, whether it will be in the -- our first fiscal quarter or the second one, I would be inclined to bet it would be more in the second one when they're launching all their new car models. But there's a lot of money out there on the boards and our advertising people are really very optimistic about the up front and the network.  And as -- although we get a higher cost per thousand, as free over-the-air audiences shrink, and ours have shrunk much less than anybody else's, that money is finding its way across into the cable networks.  And people now more and more they do their own networking, they've all got a DVR and those shows -- any sort of a rating can attract that good advertising. So it feels good. That's all I'm saying.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. I think that you mentioned that the FOX News affiliate agreements are coming up at the end of this calendar year. I was wondering -- you had very strong increases in the last go-around, I was wondering if you could frame for us how you're thinking about the next round of negotiations. And then separately, if there was any weak link at all in the quarter it was SKY Italia, just wondering if you could talk about plans over the next few years to drive penetration in that market. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think first in FOX News, I think what we said is they start to come up, they obviously come up over time so it's not one fell swoop. So they begin but it will be a number of years over which agreements come up. And I'm not going to get too specific, again I guess I think you should have negotiations in private not in public so I'm probably not going to sort of put out there any specifics on what our expectations other than look I think the FOX News Network and the power and importance of it is certainly -- maybe with ESPN, second to none. I think it is a channel that has built an enormous following, an enormous audience, is tremendously important, to a major segment of the country out there.  And heading into a complicated political arena that probably gets more complicated as you go between now and 2012, I think the importance of that channel and the value of that channel probably has never been higher. And what we're going to do is get fair value for that channel. So I certainly will pursue that appropriately aggressively.</p>
          <p>In terms of SKY Italia, it is -- it probably is somewhat what we talked about a quarter ago. I mean SKY Italia since the beginning, middle of last year it's clearly gone through a tough stretch. The economy -- the economy even actually continues to be tough. But I think more so. And it had a number of factors probably the biggest one being the tax that was thrown at it and we've largely digested that and now its renewals at a more ordinary rate. We had to restructure sales because Mediaset pulled the ability to advertise on TV. We got a competitor we didn't have, which is okay, but again a competitor that has some short-term advantages in terms of costs and programming like sports. So we digested those &#x2013; I think we digested those reasonably well. We've invested in building a foundation, I guess I would say initially foundation for long-term growth and we really do think this is a great long-term play, and that's about making sure we're the quality player there, clearly investing in HD and DVR technology, and that's still happening.</p>
          <p>We're going to ramp up to about 30 HD channels in the next month or so. We were only at about 10 the beginning of this year. I think we have got about a third of our customers now have HD. So that's come up; actually over half our customers have HD, a DVR, or a second box, so the quality installation in the home is growing. And again, that's not going to pay off in a quarter, that's going to pay off over time as you build behind that. We overhauled our packages to be more aggressive in the market. So I actually think we did a good job building a foundation.</p>
          <p>I think our priority as you look in the short term over the next year really should be on re-energizing momentum from a subscriber perspective into the business. And I think that's where -- that's what I guess I would say is really where our focus should be. I think that's obviously both churn and sales. I think as Dave touched on, we've already started to make some headway on churn. And as we digest the tax and the like, I think we'll make further headway.</p>
          <p>I think on the sales side, we've got some good momentum to that, we have got some events that will help us, I think the HD and DVR again has incremental traction. I think our sales organization is sort of reorganized to be geared to selling without the reliance on TV advertising that they have had in the past, and are getting much better at doing that. So I think we feel very good about our competitive position, clearly some of the regulatory issues that we reside under are changed the end of next year. And, look, we think there will be competition there but we think we have a great proposition with a quality offering that really doesn't have a peer, in a market that really still is in the early stages of its growth.  Again, I think our short-term focus should be on driving that business forward in terms of subscribers. I think profitability will follow behind it, and I still expect this to be a great business for us.</p>

          <p>Good afternoon. I just wanted to touch on a couple of the associates which look like may be big drivers of EPS growth in the next couple of years. First one SKY D.  Chase, could you just give us an update on your initial thoughts of that business now that you've become the Chairman there? And then on BSkyB, delivered another great result last week.  The business looks in fantastic shape. Do you think News Corp. would get greater recognition of the strength of that business if it was consolidated?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think in SKY Deutschland I think they announce earnings next week, so I'm probably not going to get too far in front of their announcement. SKY Deutschland we obviously haven't been in as long as Italy, it probably -- in some ways some of the things we just said are true there, though at an earlier stage. We've got some new management there, which I think we're very excited about, bring the expertise from BSkyB to Germany and Brian Sullivan. And we've made some the moves in HD and DVR, so like we're just right now putting out the HD and DVR box. We only just more recently overhauled the program packaging and the branding there. It's a different market than obviously with cable and sort of the dual distribution of cable and of cable and satellite and so it's not just a clone of the others but we did get a lot -- we have take an lot of steps I think to put it on better footing. It's clearly a work in progress, there's no two ways about that.</p>
          <p>But, look, Germany is a great market. I was just there for the first Board meeting I've been to and you can't help but be &#x2013; you hear always about the rest of Europe &#x2013; you can't help but be impressed about Germany. And I think there is a great momentum to that -- great opportunity to really build a really unique strong business. It will take time; it's not a 12-month plan. This is a plan to build over time.  I do believe that as we build on those strengths and really get traction in things like HD and get the right technology in terms of set top boxes and get an organization that continues to grow in expertise and strength in terms of selling and servicing that business, we are again still building some of that foundation. But I think we have got it going in the right direction but clearly I'm not minimizing the work in front of us. But I think equally not minimizing I think the opportunity in front of us with the country like Germany. Like SKY, SKY is a great business. And I admire them for the strengths they built.  And we have been a happy shareholder for 15 years. We are a controlling shareholder, and I think happy and comfortable with the shareholding we have.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much. I think a lot of folks on the buy side are looking at the acceleration of Netflix results with great interest. And I was just wondering, as you watch that business evolve, do you look at that as a good news story because it's an effective way to monetize sort of the older content within your library or do you look at it potentially as an opportunity to monetize your library in a better way, maybe better than you are today?  And how might the industry sort of change or evolve do you think over the next, call it two to three years if at all?  Thanks.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I think it's probably something we need to continue to evaluate so I probably wouldn't probably at this point come down clearly on either side. I think it's important for us to continue &#x2013; look, it's one of the great things about being content owners is the ability to develop different windows and different ways to monetize your product and provide product to consumers in interesting ways and interesting shapes and forms. I think there is a question whether Netflix model is getting us fair value for our product, and I think that's a question we need to continue to evaluate. We have obviously taken some steps in terms of already moving windows with some players on some of the newer releases. And I think as digital evolves, as VOD evolves, these windows are clearly a continually evolving business and we need to continue to study it and get smarter about it and make sure we are getting -- we're getting the value we should be getting for our products. And not having our product undervalued or devalued as it becomes available in the marketplace. I think it's a focus and something that I think you'll see continue to evolve as we go through the next few years.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much. Appreciate it. So my question is on the FOX audience network.  I wanted to get a little bit more strategic clarity regarding FOX audience particularly with the -- with the MySpace deal with Google I believe expiring sometime this summer. So just any color on how that unit could perhaps re-capitalize itself. I know there's been some suggestion that some of that may in fact be spun off to maybe some private holders to be able to attack the display advertising market more efficiently. So what's your thinking around that asset and how you can perhaps position yourself to monetize it better, particularly with the Google deal coming due?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Not sure the Google deal has a real impact on <mark type="inaudible" />; they sort of sell in different segments of the digital arena.  But <mark type="inaudible" /> has done a great job building a very effective efficient ad sales business there. I'm not going to comment on any of the rumors that are out there, we don't think it's productive. But I think they have the ability to go the distance and the challenge for them and the key is to attract enough traffic to make it a profitable business. I don't think there's any -- on the ad side of it, I don't think there's any rocket science but it doesn't really get affected by Google, which is really the search side of the MySpace business. So that we will deal with.  But I think they have done a really good job building a very effective and I think actually quite competitive and uniquely strong operation there. And the key is to build enough traffic to --</p>

          <p>No, I think the fact is that it's now become the leading music site and we are &#x2013; we've got to admit the in the last two or three years I think we made some big mistakes but we got to find new management now, we've started to introduce new features, there will be a lot of changes coming through the summer and we have got to judge it at the end of this year. The early indications and they're only early indications that we're getting more visitors and they're staying longer.  But it's -- when that gets more substantial we'll get more advertising.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. If I could ask just a little clarification and then a question.  On the guidance for the -- effectively the fourth quarter, Dave, you mentioned Film would be down I think about 100 million, you mentioned FOX network, is there anything else that you'd highlight on a year-on-year comp basis that is working against you? I'm thinking maybe Cable Networks might be one where you start to lap the affiliate fee increases at FOX News?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Our Cable Networks are going to continue to grow not only this quarter but for the foreseeable future. Those are the two principle operating units that create the down for the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I would just &#x2013; okay, I was just going to say on the future of these cable networks which Chase has referred to, at least in the next year or two we can see the growth that's coming just on existing contracts that we have. So we're really in very good shape there, unless there's some terrible downturn in advertising. The Cable side seems fine. On the Film side we have got a really great slate of films coming up for the next 12 months. But three big films we have for the summer, I mean they're not Iron Man or Toy Story, but they're very commercial and strong.  But it's costing us real money in this quarter, just as in the second quarter we booked a loss for Avatar and there will be a loss this time on A-Team and the new picture with Tom Cruise coming on July the 4th weekend.  We have very strong films coming after that, Wall Street in September, and a great Thanksgiving and Christmas schedule and we are feeling -- it all looks pretty good. And we even have the outlines now of a good schedule right through next summer. So as I said we haven't got an Avatar in there that's going to make us $400 million, but we have plenty of pictures there that have got a lot of upside to them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And this maybe stating the obvious but I actually want to add on to what Rupert said, look, the Film business obviously is one that doesn't have sort of quarter-to-quarter steady state but we have a fabulous team in the Film business that I think is second to none. As Rupert said, we have got a fabulous slate of, great slate of films we look at Christmas, fall, summer, even into the next animated picture next spring. So they're always timings in the quarter that can affect short term but we have a -- we have a great team there that does a great job and we couldn't be more excited and positive about the Film business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And the film financiers we have as partners and a lot of films they do that for other studios. They all say that we operate about 20% more economically than any of our competitors except perhaps we're equal in the marketing costs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And thank you for that. My question is actually on the Film business, Rupert, you talked about this review of how you want to allocate capital. You have a tremendous team in place and you have had a tremendous track record in Film. Are there things out there in the marketplace either other studios or libraries you are in the distribution business today with MGM they're clearly on the block.  Is there anything you would look at on the Film side across the board where you'd want to invest or acquire assets in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We could be tempted if something real came on the market but we don't consider MGM in that class. Certainly not at the prices they're talking. You know you have to be careful two studios may turn into just one and a half.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I think we're better doing everything we can to expand FOX Film and FOX Television production. There is a lot of money in making successful television programs. The ones that are successful are certainly a minority but they -- in our case they -- certainly the profits they make certainly make up for the failures and the write ups. The two big new shows this year are both made by us, Glee, which is on FBC and Modern Family, which is a big hit on ABC. So and they will show particularly Modern Family, great revenue flows over the future years.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Just a couple for Chase. Chase, first I was hoping you could just update us on any potential path towards profitability at your Digital Media Group.  Maybe quantify as part of that the step down that you have at the end of this year contractually from the -- from Google search revenue.  And then secondly, I thought maybe you could also talk a little bit about the relationship that the network has with your non--owned TV station affiliates and the chances you might start to get compensation from those affiliates that are accruing retransmission fees.  Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.  Yeah. I mean on MySpace, Rupert touched on it. Clearly, again, MySpace is a work in progress. And, look, we have made a number of changes. I think actually the team that we put in place is doing some really good things. Actually some of them we have had some recent launches, just last week we had -- or last week or so we had a tryout for Glee that got I think 28,000 auditions and then 80-something million votes about it. So I think again, speaks to the power of that platform and the restep platform still has. We got a lot of enhancements, we've improved the platform, made it a better customer experience, we got a lot of enhancements for launching over the next couple of quarters. Clearly our goal is to really build -- to put in place this year by the end of the calendar year, that business and create a foundation we can go forward with and really a foundation that we can look to and start to drive as a cash positive business going into 2011. And I think that's our goal.</p>
          <p>I think our focus this year is really more on improving the customer experience and creating a site that has growth.  If you look at some of the key numbers in terms of traffic and things like that, and the trends are better but they're not what they need to be. So we still -- a number of the key metrics are not going up.  But they're better than they were. And I think in the remainder of the year we need to turn that so as we get to the end of the year we've got all those metrics going in the right way and a business that we can look to confidently say will be a good solid business for us. That's the goal this year.  And that's where we're looking to get to. What's the other business?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>They're in discussions so I'm not going -- look, we clearly view the Network as the driving program out there for us and our affiliates and we think it's important for us to retransmission to receive appropriate compensation for the Network programming. And I think probably have a pretty good sense when you go ask a cable or satellite or telco provider what is the programming they're paying for, you know, the programming at the top of the list, and not trying to be argumentative, is the NFL, and American Idol, the World Series and House. So I think it's important for us --</p>

          <p>Hi, gentlemen. I had a quick query and it was concerning the Television revenues which if we've listen to the commentary during the quarter were up sort of 20, 25%, at yet when we look at the TV numbers they went from 1.15 billion to 1.16 billion. And I was just curious to know why that 20% growth at the station group didn't turn into larger growth at the overall Television segment.</p>

          <p>So a lot of this increased profit is coming from new efficiencies which we've discovered, new automation, centralization of services, you name it. There have been a lot of savings and both in personnel and in methodology.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that mean you expect a stronger contribution from the fourth quarter out of Television -- the Television segment itself as a result of those things rolling through?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Can we just be clear that we're talking about the same numbers, because our Television revenues in the three months are up $20 million.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. That's right.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So now what -- do you want to just give me the question again?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question was in the -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Are you talking about that the -- we're talking about the growth rates for --</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the discussion was earlier in the quarter that, say the advertising revenues, just broadly, and it wasn't locked down, were up 20, 25%. And I'm just curious to know why some of that growth rate or more of that growth rate didn't come into the 1168 number that you reported which as you say was only up 20 million on the 1149.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Because a part of the revenues were offset -- the TV stations were offset by the down on the Entertainment segment, Entertainment business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Some of you just need scale I think to it. Again, today the TV station revenues are much smaller than the Network revenues. So as you put it all together when you combine sports in the network and entertainment on the network, that pool of revenues is a much bigger pool than television stations which operate with a much higher margin. And as David and Rupert said, clearly the profit was enhanced as well by cost reductions, which we're largely working through to drive...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Does that -- do those sets of numbers form a run rate into Q4 for TV as well?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly the TV station -</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Alex, I think the issue you got is we're talking about our stations being up by 20-plus percent.  The revenues on the stations in the quarter are $350 million for the quarter. So the base of those I'm actually giving you the numbers, which we don't report, but I want to clarify this.  In a year ago our revenues were 310. So it's -- you're taking the 20% is on the TV stations is a much smaller, okay, increment. We're not saying that we're up 25% of the entire segment.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, that makes perfect sense. And do we think that ongoing situation with respect to sports and the network in Q4 as shown in Q3, is that an ongoing run rate for Q4 as well do you think?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I mean, as we said, if you look at Q4 with respect to the Entertainment business we expect that business to be down both in terms of somewhat revenue and somewhat cost.</p>

          <p>Rupert Murdock, Brendan Trembath from the AM Program. A story on the front page of the Australian newspaper I would like you to comment on, the former BHP Billiton Chairman Don Argus warns that a new tax on super-sized mining profits flashes an amber light to global investors. Any concern from you as Chief Executive and Chairman of a global corporation with a significant stake in Australia?</p>

          <p>I know you don't break out revenue numbers for FOX News beyond the top line but with 81 advertisers leaving the Glenn Beck show following the Color of Change action, the show now seems limited to in-house ads and gold ads.

I'm sorry not to be more specific, but right now we're charging about $4 a week for The Wall Street Journal and that's as an introductory thing. I imagine over the years it will creep up; and it doesn't cost us a penny in incremental costs. So that's -- yeah.</p>

          <p>Hello. I wonder if I can ask about FOX Network's ad revenue picture for Q3 and just moving forward in Q4. And then my follow-up is just are we seeing advertisers coming back to the online video world in the same level that we are to the TV world?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, the online video world, if you mean wsj.com, we're up I think 11% in advertising there. That's -- we have been going up all the time there. We're well over $100 million in digital revenue at Dow Jones. And in other places like foxnews.com, absolutely thriving. I don't know what the percentages are up, but it's turned into a very nice little profit.</p>
