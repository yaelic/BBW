      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Kristen . Good morning, everyone and welcome to Southern Copper's first quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Today we will be discussing our view on the metal markets as well as Southern Copper's production, sales, operating costs, financial results and capital spending program. After that we will open the discussion for questions.</p>
          <p>During 2009 we saw continued recovery of metal prices particularly copper, molybdenum, silver and zinc which are the most important commodities produced by Southern Copper. This strength has been strengthening in the first quarter of 2010. The take of copper prices increased by 110% from an average of $1.56 per pound in the first quarter of 2009 to $3.28 in the first quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>For molybdenum, our main by-product, prices went up by 80% from an average of $8.75 per pound in the first quarter of 2009 to $15.78 in the first quarter of this year. While silver and zinc prices increased by 34% and 96% respectively. What this significant price increase indicates is that metal markets are recovering from the economic slowdown that affected them last year.</p>
          <p>Looking at the copper markets, we maintained our positive view on this due to the following factors. Emerging economies increasing consumption is a current driver of the market. We believe that this growth in demand, led by China, will give support to copper prices for the rest of 2010.</p>
          <p>According to Copper Research Union, or CRU, Asian economies are now 57% of the world's copper demand. And these economies grew 18% in their copper consumption in the first quarter of 2010. As you know, most of the Asian countries are currently in a strong, ongoing orientation process and have been increasing their copper demand at a steeper pace than their GDP growth. The U.S. and European economies are also making copper consumption in 2009 &#x2013; in 2010 as a result of the end of an inventory adjustment as well as a modest restocking in some areas, particularly cable and wire. A reflection of this growth in demand is the 25% rod sales increase of our Mexican operations.</p>
          <p>On the supply side, we expect production to recuperate pre-crisis activity levels as a result of higher mining copper production as well as the scrap availability. However, grade depletion as well as significant production issues of certain major operations may offset new volumes from ramp up operations.</p>
          <p>For molybdenum, our first by-product was 16% of total sales in the first quarter of the year. We are seeing a demand that decreased significantly in 2009. Last year it decreased by 15%. Currently we're seeing consumption coming back to where it was before the economic crisis. For the rest of 2010 we expect a relatively balanced market at about $16 per ton for molybdenum.</p>
          <p>In the case of silver, it represented 5% of our sales in the first quarter of 2010. We think that silver prices will have the strong support in 2010 due to higher industrial demand as well as inflation concerns. For zinc, that was also 5% of sales in the first quarter of the year, we're expecting market to be balanced through the rest of 2010 at the current price level of about $1 per ton.</p>
          <p>Looking at our production, for copper we are reporting a 9% decrease in copper from our mines when comparing the last quarter with the first quarter of 2009. The major reason for this reduction in production was a 16% drop in the Cuajone ore grade that that resulted in a decrease in copper production of 7,700 tons. The remaining production decrease was caused by slightly lower ore grades and recovery at our Toquepala and La Caridad mines. The reduction in production as a consequence of lower ore grades is a temporary event that we're not changing our current guidance of 500,000 tons of copper production for 2010. This guidance assumes no Cananea production for the rest of the year.</p>
          <p>Regarding our metallurgical facilities, we're glad to report a 25% increase in rod production due to prior sales in Mexico and the U.S. As mentioned before, this is a sound indication of the recovery of durable goods demand in the U.S. and Mexican economies.</p>
          <p>On March 16, 2010, as part of a remediation program fully complying with international standards for mining industry, the company announced the closing of the San Luis Potosi copper smelter, which was in operation for almost 100 years. We believe more efficiencies will be achieved by having La Caridad absorb the copper smelting of San Luis Potosi. Our modern San Luis Potosi zinc refinery will not be affected by the smelter's closing and an expansion to double the capacity of our zinc refinery is currently under study.</p>
          <p>Going forward, all the company's mining and metallurgical activities in Mexico and Peru comply with the highest international environmental standards. Therefore the company will apply for ISO-4,000 &#x2013; 14,000 certification as a ratification of its clean industry standard.</p>
          <p>Regarding molybdenum, we have excellent production in the first quarter of this year reaching 4,800 tons or 17% increase, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. This better moly production was the result of improved ore recovery and higher ore grade at the La Caridad and Toquepala operations. The company expects to produce and sell 19,000 tons of molybdenum this year.</p>
          <p>Zinc mine and refined production slightly decreased by three and 1% respectively, when compared to the first quarter of 2009. The company estimates zinc sales of 110,000 tons for the year 2010.</p>
          <p>In the case of silver, silver mine production increased by 1% in the past quarter when compared to the first one of 2009. However, refined silver production increased by 45% for the quarter due higher production at the IMMSA and La Caridad precious metals plants. We estimate sales of 16.5 million ounces of silver in 2010.</p>
          <p>Focusing on Southern Copper financial performance, net sales for the first quarter of 2010 were 1.2 billion, 96% higher than the $622 million in the first quarter of 2009. The main drivers for higher sales were the previously mentioned recovery metal prices and the 18% increase in the volume of molybdenum payments.</p>
          <p>Copper sales volume decreased by 3% in the first quarter of this year. Silver volumes sold decreased by 13% due to a temporary variance not related to production. Zinc volumes sold decreased by 5% when compared to the first quarter of 2009 volumes.</p>
          <p>Our total operating costs and expenses have increased by 133 million when compared to the first quarter of 2009. The main variances are the following: fuel and power costs increased by nine million, exchange rate variances due to local currency depreciation increased by 10 million, workers' profit sharing increased by 47 million, royalties by eight million, third-party copper concentrate purchases by 35 million.</p>
          <p>The important thing to note here is that with the exception of energy and exchange rate adjustments, the major cost changes between the first quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2009 are clearly related to better metal prices that we had in the past quarter. That's the case for workers' profit sharing, royalties and third-party copper concentrate purchases which are the main variances that explain the difference between these two quarters.</p>
          <p>When comparing the first quarter of this year with the last one of 2009, you have a small variance in total operating costs and expenses of 3.7 million, less than 1% of a difference. The main variances are the following: power costs increased by $2 million; lower labor costs decreased by $2 million net of a pension fund adjustment of $3 million, that is including power administrative expenditures. Workers' participation increased by $6 million, and other costs and expenses reductions explain the remaining difference.</p>
          <p>As a result of the mentioned sales and operating cost variances, the first quarter of 2010 EBITDA was $691 million or 57% of sales. This figure compares with 616 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 that was 54% of sales and $226 million for the first quarter of 2009 that was 36% of EBITDA to sales.</p>
          <p>Southern Copper operating cash cost, including the benefit of by-product credit, was negative for the credit of 15 tons per pound in the first quarter of 2010. This figure compares to a cash cost of $0.60 per pound for the third quarter of 2009, a $0.75 total variance.</p>
          <p>Improvement in cash cost was the result of continuing operational efficiencies and higher by-product sales, principally from molybdenum. As indicated before, the molybdenum price increased by 80%, explaining that alone $0.66 in additional trades per pound of the total $0.70 positive favorable variance.</p>
          <p>The company first quarter cash cost per pound in this year in 2010 produced before by-product credit was $1.50 per pound, higher than the $1.29 per pound of the first quarter of 2009. The $0.21 cash cost before by-product variance is explained as follows: The 9% temporary reduction introduction that the company had in the first quarter accounts for $0.13; $0.08 are explained by higher cost of energy as well as royalty.</p>
          <p>On April 16, 2010 the company issued 1.5 billion in fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. These 1.5 billion notes were issued in two tranches, 400 million due to &#x2013; in 2020 at an annual interest rate of 5.375% and 1.1 billion due in 2040 at an annual interest rate of 6.75%.</p>
          <p>The proceeds of these issues will be used to accelerate the company's growth, which will further strengthen our position as one of the industry's lowest cost copper producers. We believe that Moody's recent upgrade of its corporate rating from Baa3 to Baa2 is a confirmation of the company's financial strength, stability and industry-leading position.</p>
          <p>In evaluating the timing for our breadth in international financial market, the company considered that longer date securities were available at historically low interest rates. In affirmation of the company views, demand for the notes was extremely strong with order nearly 9 billion, roughly equally split between the 10 and 30-year notes.</p>
          <p>During the marketing process, secondary trading levels for the company's fixed-term notes tightened considerably, and pricing of the new notes came at effectively no new issue premium to its existing agencies.</p>
          <p>As a result of the better market price, higher molybdenum volumes sold and efficiency gains, net earnings in the first quarter of 2010 were 383 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.45. This figure compares with net earnings for the first quarter of 2009 of 79 million or diluted earnings per share of $0.09. This is a 389% variance.</p>
          <p>As previously announced, the company is strongly committed to continue its organic growth program, and therefore the Board of Directors has approved an investment program of 2.8 billion over the next three years to develop new production capacity. This program is expected to increase annual production by 342,000 tons of copper and 6,600 tons of molybdenum, and to improve the company's cost competitiveness and efficiency. The company continues to allocate approximately 1.8 billion to Peru and 1 million to Mexico. From those, approximately 600 million and 200 million are intended to be invested in Peru and Mexico respectively in 2010.</p>
          <p>The company has expensed approximately $305 million out of the 934 million approved by this &#x2013; for the Tia Maria project. Out of which approximately 25.3 million was spent in the first quarter of 2010. The detailed engineering is in process and almost completed. Work on the project includes equipment fabrication and some early construction work, such as access roads and platforms.</p>
          <p>The second part scheduled for April 19, 2010 was cancelled due to social unrest in the Islay province of Arequipa in Peru where the Pan-American Highway was disrupted by a large group of people opposing the development of any mining activity in the region. According to applicable law for public participation in Peru, the public hearing has to be subsequently considered by the Ministry of Energy and Mines with other mechanisms of information to open a final round of public discussion for the Southern Copper environmental impact assessment for the Tia Maria project.</p>
          <p>In this debate Southern Copper will participate as required by the Ministry of Energy and Mines to further inform the businesses of the Islay province of the value of the product, the benefits that we'll bring to the region and to them. This process will take the next 90 days and only after such period the Ministry of Energy and Mines will be in a position to approve the environmental impact assessment. Construction will begin as soon as we've received the environmental impact approval &#x2013; assessment approval, which is expected not before the third quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Let me be a little bit more specific on the next steps in this process. They are the following. A special commission coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and with the participation of the Minister of Agriculture, the president of the Arequipa region and other local authorities as well as Southern Copper's personnel has been formed last week to review the Tia Maria environmental impact assessment. This group will conclude its work in 90 days, with a report to the Ministry of Energy and Mines regarding the environmental impact assessment of the project. At that point we expect the local communities and the region authorities to be fully informed of the important benefits of the Tia Maria project and the environmental impact study, the consequence also proved.</p>
          <p>As indicated previously, investment will be 934 million to produce 120,000 tons of copper cathodes using state-of-the-art technology which will comply with the highest international environmental and sustainable development standards. The project is expected to generate 4,000 jobs during the construction phase. When in operation, Tia Maria will directly employ 600 workers, and indirectly another 3,500. Through its expected 18 years of life, the project required services will create significant opportunities for small and medium business growth in the region.</p>
          <p>In addition to this fact, the company will develop social responsibility programs in the Arequipa region, similar to those already established in the communities near its Peruvian operations of Toquepala, Cuajone, and Ilo. On top of these initiatives, the mining voluntary contribution program is estimated to be approximately $5 million per year to be spent in Arequipa and could be immediately applied to the development of the communities near Tia Maria.</p>
          <p>To obtain the necessary water supply for the Tia Maria project, the company has offered to build the Paltiture dam with an increased capacity of 40 million cubic meters of water that currently drains to the Pacific Ocean. The company will only use 7 million cubic meters per year of this dam. The remaining additional 33 million cubic meters will be available for the benefit of the Tambo valley agriculture communities and Islay population.</p>
          <p>As part of its contribution to local communities, the company would improve the telecommunications facilities in the Tambo valley with better services for cell phone, television and Internet.</p>
          <p>Moving on to other projects, as of March 31, 2010, the company has expended 97.6 million on the Toquepala concentrator expansion. Detailed engineering was awarded and work started in December of 2009. One 320 ton truck, and 2 drilling machines and a second 73 cubic yard shovel were put in operation. The push back substation expansion was also completed and is currently in operation. The environmental impact study is still being conducted and is expected to be completed in the second quarter of this year.</p>
          <p>Regarding the Cuajone mine and concentrator expansion, the purchase of mine auxiliary equipment is in the bidding process. As of March of this year, combined commitments totaled 15 million and expenditures incurred were 22 million. The Cuajone expansion project also includes the installation of the concentrator of high pressure grinding rolls, a technology that we believe will increase the milling capacity of our facility. For this project, the scope of work and technical specification for our main equipment was completed and basic engineering started.</p>
          <p>The El Arco Project in Mexico is a world class copper deposit in the central part of the Baja California peninsula, with estimated mineralized material of over 1 billion tons with an ore grade of 0.51% and 14 grams of gold per ton. This project is expected to produce 190,000 tons of copper and 105,000 ounces of gold annually. The company continues to invest in land acquisition required for the project. The project feasibility study, with a cost of 15 million was recently finished.</p>
          <p>The company has also initiated a project for the construction of a Gas Fired Power Plant in its La Caridad metallurgical complex in Mexico, with an initial capital budget of 250 million. The nominal capacity of this plant will be 250 megawatts. The generated power will replace electricity sourced from the Mexican governmental agency Comisi&#xF3;n Federal de Electricidad.</p>
          <p>In addition to these projects, we have recently finished a pre-feasibility study for the expansion of the La Caridad concentrator. This expansion will offset the effect of declining ore grades and increasing rock hardness at the La Caridad mine. The pre-feasibility study shows that milling capacity of this plant could increase gradually from 90,000 tons of minerals milled per day to 120,000 tons per day.</p>
          <p>On March 16, the company put in operation a sewage treatment plant at San Luis Potosi in Mexico. This $6.6 million plant uses the state-of-the-art technology to treat 1.6 million cubic meters of sewage water per year that will be consumed by our facilities, thus reducing clean water consumption from the San Luis Potosi potable water grid.</p>
          <p>On February 11 of this year, a Mexican Federal Court ruled in favor of Southern Copper in the Cananea case. As a consequence, all the existing labor contracts were terminated. A workers' appeal was dismissed on April 21 of this year by the Mexican Supreme Court. At this point, all legal instances are finished in this process. We expect to regain access to installations in accordance with the law.</p>
          <p>The company is ready to resume operations at Cananea with a new labor contract, which we believe will increase productivity and competitiveness for this operation. The end of the labor struggle at Cananea could also make possible a Southern Copper investment of about $3.8 billion to expand Cananea's production from 180,000 tons copper to 460,000 tons of copper per year and 5,400 tons of molybdenum, as well as the development of the Pilares mine site, also in the Mexican state of Sonora.</p>
          <p>These projects include the generation of its own power requirement at a very competitive cost and will generate approximately 9,000 new jobs during the project construction phase and bring significant economic benefits to people of Cananea. Such investments were on hold until now due to the union activities.</p>
          <p>Regarding dividends, as you know it is a company policy to review at each Board meeting a capital investment capital plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generation from operations in order to determine the appropriate quarterly dividend. Accordingly, on April 22 of this year, the Board of Directors authorized a dividend of $0.45 per share. This dividend will be paid on May 25 of this year to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2006.</p>
          <p>With this in mind, ladies and gentlemen, we would like to open the phones for questions.</p>

          <p>
            <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Our first question comes from the line of Carlos de Alba from Morgan and Stanley (sic) [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Good morning, Raul, good morning, gentlemen. My first question would be in terms of the Tia Maria. What would be the worst case scenario for &#x2013; in this project? And second, what do you expect to be the operating cash cost of Tia Maria? And also if you can tell &#x2013; when would you like &#x2013; where are you going to get to the point of no return in El Arco? Clearly the preliminary studies have been &#x2013; or the factobility (sic) [feasibility] study has been concluded. When do you expect to bring this project to the board, and a decision will be made on this? Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Let me focus first on the Tia Maria scenario. Basically we have the &#x2013; where we are now is that a technical commission has been formed to discuss our environmental impact study. Objections to the study will be put on the table, and the company will answer those objections. At the end of the 90-day process that is a different way of pulling the previous process on this &#x2013; in this project, we will have a report issued by this committee to the Ministry of Energy and Mines. That will be one of the elements that the Ministry have to take into consideration before approving the environmental impact assessment of Southern Copper for the Tia Maria project.</p>
          <p>The main issue is, it's water, and from there the company has offered to build the Paltiture dam. As a possible, another option, there is the possibility of build &#x2013; of using sea water, desalinized and pumped to Tia Maria, sea water. Tia Maria is about 26 kilometers away from the coast and about 1,000 meters high. So water will be pumped from the ocean to above 1,000 meter on sea level and 26 kilometers away.</p>
          <p>Regarding cash cost, the project has cash costs of about $0.70 per pound. That number could vary. We are focusing on getting power at the lower cost than what we have seen for the project and that it's important driver for the total unit cost of Tia Maria. But at this point this is what we have as cash cost.</p>

          <p>In the case of El Arco as we indicated we are finishing the &#x2013; we finished the feasibility study. The project is moving forward at a good pace. The company is also securing some of the resources that we need to going ahead with the project...</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As you know Carlos the El Arco project is not in the three-year plan currently but I mean we've been moving forward with it now, since the land acquisitions and it's something that we do have in mind. It's a great deposit but then it's not in the three-year plan now. So I guess in terms of the Mexican government we're focusing on the plant generation on the Caridad expansion and mainly on the restart of Cananea. I don't know if you want to add to that Raul.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Raul. Good morning and Daniel. I would like if you can elaborate a little bit more on the cash cost before the by-product. And if you can repeat if it was correct to say that the cash costs of this quarter was $1.60, and which are your perspectives in terms of costs throughout the year, as we are seeing a lot of pressures there?</p>
          <p>And last but not least, if you can be a little bit more, I would say, specific on Cananea. One of the biggest questions is that do we have a date, a frame or when is this going to finish? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you, Victoria. Raul, if you like I will take the Cananea one and you can go ahead on the cost part of the question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, I'll take the cash costs. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Victoria in the Cananea we, as you know they've dismissed the last appeal. We believe there weren't any grounds to make that last appeal to the Supreme Court in Mexico, and they dismissed that &#x2013; so the Supreme Court has dismissed as well, for the second time, the last appeal they had. And so we are really just waiting on the application of the law. I mean, as you know, we have said &#x2013; I mean we have the position where we've concluded individual relationships with every employee, and the collective bargaining agreement. So we are entering into a new collective bargaining agreement with different union and just waiting for an enforcement of their decision in order to take control of the asset and begin with the ramp up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>But when you say we are waiting for the reinforcement of this, is there a timeframe? Has the government mentioned to you something? Are they going to give &#x2013; I don't know, a notification for the people who have taken over the mine? How long can you wait?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. Let me just &#x2013; the one thing to bear in mind that it's important that everybody has clear is that there aren't any other pending legal or administrative matters. It's just a matter of enforcing it. Unfortunately, in terms of timing we cannot give you an exact date. We are hoping that that is very soon, and we are just waiting on that enforcement. We believe the government is working towards the enforcement of the decision. And we are just, and I guess kind of like on hold until we have warning from them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Thank you, Daniel.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just one other thing lastly on Cananea. As you know, as Raul has commented on the conference, we have not budgeted any production for this year. Nor our numbers or any kind of budget past production or any other matter relating to Cananea. So we'll be looking at only wind fall, or upside, if you like, with the start of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, thank you. Raul, do you want to comment on the costs?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Certainly. Victoria, how are you? Let me explain you what we see in terms of operating costs. When we compare the first quarter of this year with the fourth quarter of 2009, pretty much we didn't have as much of cost pressure. So currently, for us, evidence does not support what you said, Victoria, in terms of we're having some cost inflation as we move on.</p>
          <p>The only exceptions to this is fuel and power, that has increased obviously. That the cost pressures that we're seeing are not basically related to somehow the better metal prices that we're seeing.</p>
          <p>Worker's participation or profit sharing has increased; royalty also, driven by higher metal prices has increased. And copper concentrator that we pay at market prices with some discount, with some credits regarding some discounts, are also increased. Those three are related to the new or the better metal prices.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash cost, what we have seen is our cash cost per pound went from $1.29 at the first quarter of 2009, to $1.50 before by-product credit. There is a $0.21 cash cost increase in that. And it's explained mainly by two major changes. The first one is a drop of about 9% in production that the company had in the first quarter of this year. And that's alone is $0.13 of the cost increase. Because we, basically milled the same kind of mineral, moved the same materials at our operations, and we incur in more or less the same cost just to produce less copper. So that alone is $0.13 of $0.21.</p>
          <p>And then we have $0.08 that are explained by the higher cost of energy. And energy, by this I mean fuel and power, as well as royalties. The other cost like profit sharing, are not included as part of the cash cost. So that's, those are two major elements explaining the increase in cost per pound. From those two we believe that the $0.13 related to production will be offset in the next few months. So that's how we see these cash cost right now, Victoria.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Just lastly, Victoria, just to point out that in the fourth quarter '09, the cash cost without by-product was $1.55. And the cash cost of this quarter without by-product as well is 1.50.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, Raul was giving you the explanation of the comparison, year-over-year. I just wanted to put in the quarter-on-quarter figures out there for you guys. Thank you.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Your next question comes from the line of Jorge Beristain [Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.]. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. My question was just again circling back on the Tia Maria project and the issue about the water. I just wanted to understand if this offer to build the $40 million cubic dam and allow the community to use 33 million cubic of that water, if that is something that is new or if that was in your original environmental impact study. And secondly, you mentioned the possibility of pumping up the seawater those 26 kilometers, could you qualify what that could add to the project cost if you chose to go that route instead of doing the dam, as I understand that could be an option?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. This has been an option that the company has considered &#x2013; I mean the dam, was an option that was also considered as part of the project, and from the very beginning we talk about that as one of the possibilities. For us the best one is one that is not accepted by the agriculture farmers that are close by the Tia Maria project which is pumping water from the valley, that is the Cocachacra Valley, so that one has been ruled out I think in practical terms by the farmers.</p>
          <p>Then we have two other options, the Paltiture dam; that has a cost of approximately $8 million and it will not have any extra operating cost for the company. The other option of pumping seawater has a CapEx cost of about $50 million and it will increase our operating cost by about $0.04 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, that's 5-0, 50 as in 5-0?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that's, sorry, $0.07 per pound?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, $0.04 per pound.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry, $0.04 per pound. Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So 50 &#x2013; so one of the alternatives, the dam, the Paltiture dam is $8 million, no increase in operating cost. The second which is to be the third option, it's pumping water from the sea, that has a CapEx cost of $50 million and will increase cash cost by $0.04 from say $0.70 to $0.74.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. And, sorry, just to follow up on Victoria's earlier question again just related to Cananea, Daniel I think had intoned that you're simply waiting on the government at this point to enforce the law. Is there anything on your company side that you can do before then? In other words, what are the next steps here because it does seem that we're just kind of at a stalemate, and are you able or willing to send in equipment and miners at this time to repair the facility, are you waiting for the government to secure the facility entry for you? What is the next step?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. Well two things, Jorge, that's a great question and thanks for that, it's really insightful. The company has been working with Real to help out and expedite the enforcement of this. How? First we offered severance to employees when we were not required to. And given the, if you like, the outcome of a legal battle, we've won that and we were not required to pay severance. We've offered severance voluntarily as an incentive in order to return the assets.</p>
          <p>Second, we've made a lot of compromises, if you like, and it's what Raul was just describing here, benefits to the region et cetera in terms of investments, for the well being of the region, the whole region not only our miners but also, as you know, these kind of cities, their economic future depends on the mine. So we've been doing that. And other than that, enforcement of a decision which was only finally dismissed until August 21 &#x2013; I mean, I'm sorry, April 21, Jorge, so that was just a week and half or so ago. So we are expecting the government to enforce that and now we cannot send miners now to the mine. The mine is still being blocked, the entrance by some of the -all the union guys and that we're hoping the government to really enforce. Is that clear?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. But when you're saying hoping, I mean concretely what is the next step? Have you received any indication from the government that they have the willingness to enforce the entry to the mine?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, absolutely. I think &#x2013; I mean the decision was administered on the 21st of April. I think we are &#x2013; I mean, it's just like any other decision by the court. I mean we'll be not enforcing it, it's something that's totally in our legal right. I mean, they're blocking illegal now. I mean there are no further legal remedies or appeals, so the mine is being blocked illegally. And yes, we understand the government's taking actions. I mean of course I can't tell you an exact date or anything like that because it's not in our control. But it'll be as exactly as if they were blocking the entrance to your house.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. But if they were doing that, I mean wouldn't the homeowner petition the government to enforce the law? I mean that's what I'm kind of getting at, I mean, you guys are asking for this and you're simply waiting on the government's response?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm not sure what is your question. I mean we have the &#x2013; I mean we have the judges in our favor, we are working with the government, but enforcement oppositions of this kind with force can only be made by the government.</p>
        </plist>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. Thanks a lot for the call. Just a couple of questions on Cananea. Can you comment on some news articles stating that some of the union workers have set up explosives around the Cananea mine?</p>
          <p>And secondly, if you can talk about that $3.8 billion number, what's the timing on that? How many years will that take to ramp up to the 460,000? And what are the financing requirements, if any, for that? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. First thing, explosives. I mean probably this is a group of very few employees or miners, ex-workers of the mine affiliated to the old union that lost the legal battle. They'd rather be making a lot of arguments and threats and what-have-you. We see no merit to it and I think that that should not happen in any case.</p>
          <p>In terms of the $3.8 billion, well that did &#x2013; I mean as you know around 60% of the reserves of Southern Copper are located at Cananea. So it is one of the, if not the largest reserve that we have. This is a mine that we acquired from the government and that we've been making more efficient year by year. There is a lot of potential, and this 3.8 was just a way to quantify the potential of that mine. We are not doing that now, if you like. I mean that's not either this or El Arco isn't part of the three-year plan that the Board has approved, and this is just the comment that was given to Jorge Beristain in a way that compromises that the company can make in the future in order to make a lot better atmosphere for the region, in the Sonora region, and that's how the 3.8 come up.</p>
          <p>And that includes a molybdenum plant, that includes another SX/EW facility that includes a new concentrator. It is what we call the greater Cananea, if you like, and this is the way that we see the future for that mine, but that's not near term, it's in the longer term. And so totally, no financings now contemplated. As you know, we've raised $1.5 billion in April, and while that is just building <mark type="inaudible" /> it's crucial taking advantage of the right timing of the markets in order to be able to implement all our CapEx needs, but we're prioritizing our $3.8 billion CapEx program which was approved in January.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. And just a quick thought, so basically there is no evidence that workers have actually put explosives on the mine. And then my second question, are there still individual appeals or individual suits by the workers? Not as a union, but as individuals?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, no. First, no confirmation or no evidence of any kind of explosives. And second, now &#x2013; no, all kinds of decisions have been &#x2013; awarded to our favor if you like. So there's no legal, pending issue there.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Let me, let me &#x2013; let me add to what Daniel just said that the company will continue to monitor &#x2013; monitoring the international markets, depending on how the markets evolve. So more decisions will be done regarding capital expenditures. And also that the company will be very prudent in terms of how do we find any new projects. At this point we're focusing on our three-year program that you know, it's $2.8 billion program that made us to look for some funds related to the projects in that package.</p>
