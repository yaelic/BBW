      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much. Hello to everybody. Before starting, I would like to state that Banco do Brasil has initiated studies to eventually come up with a public offering. And before investing in Banco do Brasil's stocks, please read carefully the Offering Memorandum, specially the Risk Factors section.</p>
          <p>Well, the 2009 results was a very strong one and confirms the strategic decisions taken by the company. Looking for the opportunities presented in the year and these strategies proved to be correct.</p>
          <p>In other words, credit ranking was the main drive of our business growth. We have increased our market share and consolidated our leadership in important segments of the banking industry despite the positioning of our peers. Therefore, in the credit market, we have grabbed more than 20% market share surpassing R$300 billion in credit supported by an impressive growth in our funding base.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil has widened its leadership in the banking industry with total assets amounting to R$708 billion. During 2009, in addition to our successful strategy of organic growth, we have made important movements toward acquisitions and strategic alliances such as Banco Nossa Caixa and the 50% stake in Banco Votorantim. Through these partnerships, Banco do Brasil became an important player in the auto loans market. Besides the achievement in the banking segment we had an impressive increase in cars, insurance businesses, and I cannot forget to mention the increasing revenues in the capital market operations.</p>
          <p>Along with devoting our efforts to important business plans, we have been always trying to identify opportunities to increase our productivity gain. We have been able to expand operational revenues and to keep administrative expenses under control.</p>
          <p>Following the trend of <mark type="inaudible" /> Banco do Brasil's cost to income ratio has improved. Banco do Brasil's performance mostly confirms the guidance which we had given to the market. I would also like to highlight the launching of our Level-1 ADR program, which in two months has already more than R$4 million issued.</p>
          <p>And before starting to explain the slides, I would like to highlight that Banco do Brasil's results definitely confirms our retail strength and thanks to the confidence of our customers, we have increased our customer base by more than 9.7% in 2009 achieving more than 52 million customers and thanks to our amazing franchise of more than 18,000 points of services  3.6 thousand municipalities, Banco do Brasil has been able to retain its leadership in the banking system.</p>
          <p>Moving now to the slides, I would like, before starting the presentation, to explain the treatment given by the company to the recognition of actuarial assets from Previ surplus in 2009. According to paragraph 55 of the Deliberation 371 of the Brazilian SEC CVM, Banco do Brasil decided to start accounting faster from the year-end of 2009 on in current and consistent basis actuarial gains and losses related to the defined benefit plan, plan number one from Previ.</p>
          <p>This plan has been closed since 1998. To allow the comparison between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the previous quarters, we have decided not to adjust the recurring net income. However, for the full year of 2009, the recognition of actuarial assets from Previ surplus was considered recurrent.</p>
          <p>With this explanation, let's move on to slide number three where we can see Banco do Brasil's net income and return on equity. In 2009, the net income amounted to more than R$10 billion corresponding to a return on equity of 30.7%. Without the one-offs, the recurring net income totaled R$8.5 billion and the return on equity achieved 25.8%.</p>
          <p>In the fourth quarter, the net income totaled more than R$4 billion and the recurring net income added up R$1.8 billion corresponding to an annualized return on equity of 22.5%.</p>
          <p>On slide four, we have broken down all the one-offs from 2009. Those one-offs added in the quarter represented R$2.3 billion net of taxes and profit sharing. In the year, the one-offs amounted to R$1.6 billion.</p>
          <p>On the slide number five, we have an analysis of our performance in 2009 based on the guidance disclosed at the beginning of last year. As can be seen almost all the targets were reached and just few estimates were missed when we analyzed Banco do Brasil on a standalone basis. Global spread achieved 6.5% in 2009 while our estimates were between 6.8 to 7.2%.</p>
          <p>Total deposits, which grew 5.4% was below the guidance that was a range between 10 to 14% growth. Allowance for loan losses, which tops at 4.6% and that's been 40 basis points above the maximum range of our estimate and the tax rate that ended the year in 33.5% and they've been 50 basis points above the top of the range of our guidance.</p>
          <p>Global Spread performance was affected by the changes in the midst of the loan book in which the share of operations with lower risk increased and by the growth also on the share of interbank investments over total assets.</p>
          <p>Regarding total deposits <mark type="inaudible" /> in the guidance is explained by the consolidation of the Banco Nossa Caixa, which added in 2009 almost R$40 billion to Banco do Brasil's deposit base minimizing the need for raising funds organically.</p>
          <p>The growth of allowance for loan loss above our estimates is explained by the economic scenario, which required more provision and partially by the consolidation of Nossa Caixa and Votorantim.</p>
          <p>The tax rate ended the year a little bit above our estimates due to the recognition of actuarial assets from Previ surplus as in the net income. On the other hand, it is worth to highlight the ROE that reached 24.5% surpassing the guidance. Besides that we can also highlight the growth of our loan portfolio totally in line with the guidance and if we consider Banco do Brasil together with Nossa Caixa and Votorantim, this growth was significantly above the top of the guidance range. Also on this slide, we have the behavior of our expenses, which were close to the lower range of the guidance.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number six, we can confirm the strategy of maintaining the credit granting process during the financial crisis was correct. Once more we want to highlight Banco do Brasil's loan portfolio in the country. We increased our market share from 17 to 20% supported mainly by the growth on consumer finance, which increased historical 88% in the past 12 months. We ended 2009 being leader among others, being faster funding, including time deposits and demand deposits, asset management and foreign trade operations.</p>
          <p>On slide seven, we can observe that in 2009 boosted by the growth of 33.8% in loans, Banco do Brasil's total assets increased 35.9% surpassing R$700 billion. I would like to remind you that the numbers from Nossa Caixa and from our 50% stake in Banco Votorantim already consolidated in Banco do Brasil's results. Any information on Banco do Brasil standalone will be highlighted during this call.</p>
          <p>Here on slide number eight, we can see that besides the challenges brought by the scenario Banco do Brasil kept a solid ROE about 20%.</p>
          <p>In the past year, the recurring net income added up to R$8.5 billion correspond to a return on equity of 25.8%. In the same period, the net interest income, one of the main responsibles for the maintenance of the profitability reached R$33.1 billion and the global spread achieved 6.7%.</p>
          <p>Fee income, which totaled R$13.5 billion in the year and <mark type="inaudible" /> costs, which amounted to R $19.2 billion, improved our cost to income ratio to 40.7% at the end of the year.</p>
          <p>Now talking about the financial results on slide nine, we can observe the evolution of our net interest income which grew 35% compared to the previous year, led by a strong growth in revenues from loan operation of 20.7% increase and also by the drop in financial intermediation expenses, a drop of 4.8%. This drop also reflects from the lower benchmark interest rate in the &#x2013; and also by the appreciation of real over dollar that reduced the cost from dollar denominated funding.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that in the fourth quarter of 2009, the net interest income grew 12% in relation to Q3 '09 totaling R$9.3 billion reflecting also the consolidation of Banco Votorantim's income statement.</p>
          <p>Looking at Banco do Brasil standalone, the new increase of our net interest income would have been at 5.2% when compared to Q3 '09. Once again the expansion in credit revenues was supported by the increase in the average volume of loan operations, which compensated the drop on spreads.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide number 10, we see that the expansion on the net interest income was <mark type="inaudible" /> by the evolution of Banco do Brasil's total funding. Here, we can also observe the behavior of our funding costs over the SELIC rate. While we see an increase of 37.7% in Banco do Brasil's total funding balance in 12 months and a 3.7% increase in the last quarter of 2009, we observed that total funding costs over SELIC rate grew 690 basis points in the annual comparison and 410 basis points when compared to the previous quarter.</p>
          <p>We can also see on the right hand side at the bottom of the slide that the balance of time deposits had a slight decrease of fixed debt when compared to the previous quarter. However, those deposits grew significantly in the past 12 months around 29%. It is important to highlight as well that Banco do Brasil still has a competitive funding cost due to its ability of growing in a higher pace than the banking industry and also due to the size of the institution network and franchise.</p>
          <p>On slide 11, we can see an annually important comparisons the behavior of the global spread in each portfolio and also in comparison over the accumulated SELIC rate. The focus on consumer finance has guaranteed more resilience to Banco do Brasil's spread in relation to the SELIC rate downward trend.</p>
          <p>On the left graph of the slide, we can observe that the behavior spreads for each portfolio was distinct. While businesses and <mark type="inaudible" /> business portfolio had a slight increase when compared to 2008, the individual portfolio kept its downward trend and in the year with the spread of 18.7%, adjusting this spread was the reallocation of revenues associated with loan operations <mark type="inaudible" /> from Banco Votorantim at financial revenues, our global spread would have been 18.9% in the year and 19.4% in the quarter.</p>
          <p>It is important to remember that in the year, we have accounted only one quarter of Votorantim revenues. The reduction of the individual portfolio spread in the annually and in the quarterly analysis is due to the concentration in operations with lower risk and lower margins such as payroll and auto loans.</p>
          <p>On the right hand side of the slide, we can see the behavior of Banco do Brasil's global spread calculated by the net interest income over earning assets. This spread has stayed stable at 6.7% in the quarterly comparison. Another <mark type="inaudible" /> global spread is to compare with the accumulated SELIC rate from the period. By doing that we can see that Banco do Brasil is increasing its financial intermediation results in relation to the accumulated benchmark rate.</p>
          <p>In 2008, when we &#x2013; when the annualized SELIC rate was 12.5%, the ratio of global spread over accumulated SELIC was 55.8%. In 2009, this ratio went up to 67%, the highest level for the past five years.</p>
          <p>Here considering the 50% stake of Banco Votorantim that impacted negatively Banco do Brasil's global spread once Votorantim has the global spread lower than Banco do Brasil. That bank does not have a lower cost funding base and its operations are concentrated in segments with lower spreads and consequently lower risk, mainly car loans.</p>
          <p>Once again, it is important to remind you that Banco do Brasil is being quite successful in compensating the SELIC drop with changes in the asset mix and with volume growth. There is also a time lag between funding growth and private banking which drives funding to lower margin operations such as repos.</p>
          <p>On the slide 12, we have Banco do Brasil's loan portfolio. The balance of R$300.8 billion represents a 33.8% growth in 12 months. As I mentioned on slide six, this performance allowed Banco do Brasil to gain market share achieving a 20% market share in the country. The highlight here is to expansion in individuals loans, which grew more than 88% in the past 12 months and increased its share from 21.7% back in 2008 to 30.5% of the total book in 2009.</p>
          <p>Now moving to slide 13, we can better analyze what was the organic loan growth of Banco do Brasil standalone <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisition. If we exclude Nossa Caixa in the partnership with Votorantim, Banco do Brasil had an organic growth of 15.6% in its loan assets, above the 14.9% achieved by the banking industry and an organic growth of 5.6% in the quarter also above the average industry growth around 4.6%. Regarding the partnership with Votorantim, the addition of R$21.2 billion to Banco do Brasil's total portfolio confirms our expectation on these deals.</p>
          <p>On the slide 14, we have breakdown of consumer finance operations, which grew 88.1% in 12 months and 7.1% in the quarter allowing Banco do Brasil to reach a 22.9% market share. This performance has been boosted by the expansion on payroll and auto loans, which had very strong growth, 12 months to increase the payroll portfolio and 107% and the performance in the quarter was about 7%.</p>
          <p>Banco do Brasil and Banco Votorantim together added to R$36 billion in payroll loans, more than 30% market share. In the auto loans business, this portfolio was boosted by more than 200% confirming once again the success with the JV with Votorantim.</p>
          <p>On slide 15, we have the breakdown of our business portfolio that reached R$125.3 billion. I would like to highlight you the asset need performance that grew 28.7% in one year and 8.9% in the quarter. Our loans with mid-size and large-size companies also increased by 29% in the past 12 month and 6% in the quarter. We must say that Banco do Brasil took advantage of its relationship with business clients in order to supply their credit means during the crisis and this strategy is granting besides the growth in volume and improving the profitability with those clients as we saw on slide 11.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 16. We have here the balance of our foreign trade operations. The portfolio reached R$25.2 billion at the end of '09, a drop of 3.5% in 12 months, but it's important to look at the balance in dollar denominated terms. In dollar denominated terms, loans to foreign trade increased by 29% achieving a balance of $14.5 billion at the end of 2009. It is important also to highlight the leadership of Banco do Brasil in foreign exchange contract and also in FX operations with more than 34% market share in foreign exchange contracts.</p>
          <p>On slide 17, we reaffirm our presence in the agribusiness portfolio as the largest &#x2013; as the biggest partner of the Brazilian agribusiness. We are the largest lender to that segment and we ended the year with the balance of R$66 billion, a 4.2% growth in 12 months <mark type="inaudible" /> in line with our guidance.</p>
          <p>To the 2009-2010 <mark type="inaudible" />, Banco do Brasil expects to disburse R$39 billion to the segment of which R$22 billion has already been utilized. On the slide 18, we bring some information that allows us to be very confident about the fall of the agri book.</p>
          <p>On the left hand of the slide, we have the working capital line contracted in this agri book with insurance. In the 2009-2010 crop from the R$11.2 billion of working capital lines contracted with the agribusiness sector, 67% were insured. It is important to highlight here that 90% of this amount is being reinsured by international companies. And you can see the breakdown of this reinsurance operation in the pie chart at the bottom &#x2013; the left bottom of the graph of the slide.</p>
          <p>On the right hand of the slide, we have a geographic distribution of the rural insurance for all the working capital lines enforced by Banco do Brasil. The Mid West, Southern Brazil and Northeastern Brazil, they have the higher percentile of insured cost with 78.9, 76.9 and 73.5% coverage, respectively. Southeast has the lower percentile insured <mark type="inaudible" /> from that region usually. They are not eligible for rural insurance like sugarcane.</p>
          <p>On slide 19, we see on the left graph that provision expenses dropped by 2.2% in relation to the previous quarter. The ratio between provision charges for the past 12 months over average portfolio reached 4.6%. On the top right graph, we can observe that provision expenses increased more than 70% achieving R$1.6 billion in 2009. This growth was higher than the extension of our loan book of around 34%. A part of this growth is due to the acquisition of Nossa Caixa and Votorantim that ended up adding R$1 billion to the provision charges in 2009, but are also reflect of the economics scenario that increase the delinquency requiring more provisions to be accounted during 2009. Past due loans over 90 days shown in the yellow in the right hand graph at the bottom of the slide came from 3.6% to 3.3%- percentile is still below the banking industry and definitely is confirming that delinquency has peaked in Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>Now on slide 20, we can see that over the last quarter Banco do Brasil's delinquency has been consistently below the banking industry delinquency. When we look at the individual loans at the top left graph, the past due loans over 90 days for the banking industry had been 40 basis points increase coming from 8.2% to 7.8% in December, the same decrease can be seen in Banco do Brasil's delinquency rate NPL ratio that dropped from 5.2 to 4.8% in December.</p>
          <p>Regarding business operations on the top right graph, we see a decrease of 20 bips in NPL ratio for both banking industry and Banco do Brasil.</p>
          <p>However, it is important for us to analyze what is the behavior of vintage in the future's portfolio. On the slide 21, we bring the vintage analysis for our consumer finance excluding year overdraft account, credit cards and auto loans. We can see that improving loan <mark type="inaudible" /> as well as the change in the mix of that operation is allowing the reduction of NPL ratios along the vintages. The highlighted gray boxes here they represent credit assessment during 2003, six and seven vintages.</p>
          <p>Moving to slide 22, we can see that the non-interest businesses, they have added a well significant revenue to the results especially fee income that totaled R$30.5 billion in 2009, an increase of 14.4% in the year. I would like to highlight also in this slide on the left bottom graph the performance of <mark type="inaudible" /> from credit cards. We have increased substantially credit cards and debit cards turnover by more than 33% that and this business line ended up adding a substantial amount of revenues to Banco do Brasil's numbers.</p>
          <p>Also on this slide if you look to the right bottom graph of this slide, you will see the performance of our insurance business. The added value of the insurance business, the insurance net income <mark type="inaudible" /> almost reached R$1 billion in 2009, a 30.8% increase when compared to the same period last year, including this year, in the total net income to 11.7% of the net income.</p>
          <p>On the slide 23, we bring you some numbers about the performance of our admin expenses that is completely in line with the business growth and with acquisitions we did. Total admin expenses, which include personnel expenses and other admin expenses, increased 11.6% in the quarter totaling R$5.5 billion. This growth is explained not only by salary agreement for Banco do Brasil, but also by seasonality. From January to December, the growth in admin expenses was almost 25% due mainly to acquisitions and for better understanding this performance we should move to slide 24.</p>
          <p>We will make an analysis segregating from the amount of admin expenses accounted in 2009. The admin expenses that were added by the JV with Votorantim and the acquisition of Nossa Caixa, if we exclude this effect, we end up achieving a total admin expenses in Banco do Brasil standalone of R$16.9 billion and when compared to 2008, this represents the 10% increase in standalone, perfectly in line with the guidance release at the beginning of 2009.</p>
          <p>On the slide 25, we see that the BIS ratio in Banco do Brasil ended at 13.7%. This level shows an increase of 70 bips in comparison to the previous quarter and allows us to grow our loan book by more than R$100 billion considering the 100% weighted assets. It's important to highlight a year that we received the approval from the central bank to recognize as Tier one capital with almost $1.5 billion in perpetual bonds that was issued last year and also to recognize as tier two of subordinated debt around R$1 billion issued at the end of 2009.</p>
          <p>Now on the slide 26, we have a comparison between the multiples of Banco do Brasil and Brazilian &#x2013; the main Brazilian bank. Start effect that Banco do Brasil shares had outperformed the peers and also the Brazilian Stock Exchange. We continue to &#x2013; Banco do Brasil is still being traded at a discount to our peers. Despite the fact that these discounts has been reduced, we still have a very considerable discount when compared to the peers despite the consistent results that Banco do Brasil has being delivering. And I cannot forget to mention that we had recently issued our ADR Level I program and as I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, we have already issued more than four million ADRs.</p>
          <p>Finally to wrap up moving to the final slide, we would like to bring you the guidance for 2010 performance in Banco do Brasil. The next two slides, the slides 27 and 28 will summarize the main assumptions for our guidance. The assumptions that can be affected by the management of Banco do Brasil and the one that are completely linked to the macroeconomic environment. It's very important that you read these two slides to understand the guidance that we are disclosing officially today, and this guidance is on slide 29. It's important to remember as well that this 2010 guidance includes not only Banco do Brasil as a standalone, but also Banco Nossa Caixa and Votorantim. So it's the conglomerate, Banco do Brasil's conglomerate.</p>
          <p>For 2010, we expect to maintain our recovery return on equity between the range of 21 to 24%, net interest margin between 6.5 to 7%, the growth in total deposits between 12 to 16%. We want to maintain our market share in loans so we expect it to grow our domestic loan portfolio between 18 to 23%, and the bulk of this growth will happen mainly in the individual portfolio, which we're expecting to grow between 27 to 32%. Business loans depending on how corporate bond markets react and will &#x2013; should grow between 16 to 21%, agribusiness growth between four to 9%.</p>
          <p>Allowance for loan losses, we expect it to start dropping, but it will not be a huge drop and we should expect allowance for loan losses as a percentage of the average loan portfolio for the full year between 4.4 to 4.8%, fee income growth higher than the one accounted in 2009 standalone. A fee growth between seven to 10%, admin expenses in line with the growth in our business, around 10 to 12%, and we are increasing the effective tax rate to a range between 31 to 34%. Well, these are the main highlights of our numbers that I would like to share with you. We could now open the floor for the Q&amp;A session. Thank you very much.</p>

          <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin a question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. Your first question comes from Victor Schabbel of Rabbitt.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning. It's Victor Schabbel from Credit Suisse. In fact, I have two questions here. One is related to the guidance just released for 2010. On the recurring return on equity of 21 to 24%, do you already include the Previ's gains for 2010?</p>
          <p>And the second question is related to the administrative expenses in the 4Q '09, so does these administrative expenses include any non-recurring item from the consolidation or incorporation of Banco Votorantim or Nossa Caixa? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, Victor. First of all, the recurring return on equity of 21 to 24% does not include Previ's surplus recognition in 2010. It's recurrent mainly the banking operations.</p>
          <p>And with regard to admin expenses, if I understood your question correctly, this is recurrent. So any extra expenses, like Resignation Programs or something like that is not included here. It's just organic growth of admin expenses due to inflation, due to the expansion of business, etcetera. And it's important to remember that this is consolidated numbers for Banco do Brasil's <mark type="inaudible" /> acquisitions we did in 2009.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions also about your expectations. And first of all, just I would like to understand the Previ surplus accounting a little bit better, is my understanding correct in that going forward, you will be taking into account changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities backing the Previ plan and hence will that create a certain amount of volatility in the results on an ongoing basis, if you can help me understand a little bit how the accounting will work and how we should expect that to go into your income statement?</p>
          <p>My second question is on your loan loss provisioning guidance. I guess I'm little surprised that the provisions were basically similar to the levels we see in 2009 and then we &#x2013; understanding that we are seeing a mix shift towards retail loans; it does seem like credit &#x2013; your credit metrics, your credit quality metrics are improving by a good amount in recent quarters. So, I'm just curious if you feel that that's somewhat conservative in terms of the guidance? I would have expected it to follow a little bit more than what your guidance kind of implies.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Saul, thank you for your question. I'm going to answer these two questions and I would like to ask the help of my Accountant and my Credit Director as well, if needed or if you want to add extra comments.</p>
          <p>With regard to Previ surplus, you are right. You should expect the recognition of actuarial gains and/or losses from now on, on a recurrent basis, and this recognition is completely in line with the loss and the accounting rules that we have in Brazil that are very similar to international standards as well.</p>
          <p>Previ according to our calculations, it's important to read the explanatory note to the financial statement number 28, we ended according to these assessment in order to recognize them in the Banco do Brasil's balance sheet, following the Deliberation 371 of the Brazilian SEC. Previ surplus would have been according to that the actuarial variables around R$57 billion in 2009. Banco do Brasil would be entitled then to recognize half of that surplus something around R$28.5 billion. And so far what we have already accounted as actuarial assets is R$12 billion.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, we believe that &#x2013; we plan to make this assessment to this actuarial assessment instead of making it once a year and to avoid a strong impact and the recurring earnings of Banco do Brasil to do it biannually, every semester, okay? And definitely, these will bring some volatilities. However, since we have been very conservative in accounting the surplus, even if there is a very huge drop in the fair value of the assets, we do not expect negative impact.</p>
          <p>Looking forward, you should expect something similar to what we have already accounted in 2008 and 2009, okay? I don't know if Eduardo, our Accountant, would like to make more comments on the surplus. Is that okay for you, Eduardo?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. With regard to provision guidances, you are right. We are being very conservative. We have decreased the bottom part of the range, but we have increased slightly the top part of the range. But it has also to do with our credit methodologies. I don't know if my Credit Director would like to make some comments about the methodology. Could you also <mark type="inaudible" /></p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. <mark type="inaudible" /> ( 40:07)</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, he is explaining that our methodology continues to be the same and it has a track record of more than 5 million in terms of methodology and it will depend on how the portfolio that we grew significantly react in terms of one big season in terms of delinquencies and also it will depend on the mix. If we grow faster, individual loans, we plan to improve, especially the secured one, adding sense to improve in terms of provision charges. But last not least, this is a conservative approach in terms of guidance that we are disclosing to the market.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just to be clear on the first quarter, <mark type="inaudible" /> by the way. On the first question, in annualized, it is something of a technical question to be asking on a conference call, but to be clear, even if you do see in the market come out given the level of the surplus that you have, we should still expect to see some gains being recognized, we shouldn't expect to see losses even if we do see market conditions weaken because of the fact that you do have a pretty meaningful actuarial gain in the Previ plan, is that correct?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, you are perfectly correct. This assessment is a very conservative one, even when assessing the fair value of these assets who have been conservative and the risk of starting accounting losses due to the reduction in the surplus and the surplus becoming invested is very, very, very hardly to happen.</p>
          <p>We have faced a very strong crisis recently and Previ continues to account surplus. It's important to remember that we are talking about plan number one, that is a defined benefit plan, that is closed since 1998. So there is no newcomers into that plan. So the obligations of this plan, the liabilities of this plan are already debt there, okay, unless something really new that would change the actuarial variable shortly, could change that, okay.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning. I mean the guidance that you provided for ROE is 21 to 24%. I mean, that's a big difference in terms of the net income to the year, so I just want to understand what's behind this range being so wide, does it have to do with the size of the offering that you are planning or is there something else? I don't know if you can comment on that. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We are not adding here in this guidance. We expect the eventual primary offering, okay, it's important to say that. Probably with the primary offering, it is return to change, definitely.</p>
          <p>We would like to offer a wide range usually because we focus on the center of the range usually, but we never know what is going to happen in the environment. We depend on exchange rate, in interest rate, in other macro economic variables that can change that, unemployment rate, increasing in wages, GDP growth etcetera.</p>
          <p>And sometimes, you have to grow &#x2013; you're able to grow faster in lower spread loans. Other times you can grow in highest pesos it varies, it varies. So that we would like to maintain this <mark type="inaudible" /> that level. I don't consider it's a 300 bips range and you should &#x2013; we are going to focus in the middle of the range.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, this is Jason Mollin here with Christopher Hill. My question is also related to your guidance particularly the loan growth for the individual segment. Can you help us understand the drivers, what products you expect to drive this growth going forward, particularly if you can talk a little bit about autos or payroll and/or credit cards, mortgages for instance? And secondly, maybe to follow up on the auto book, if you can talk about, we saw the vintage lines for the individual portfolio, the vintages and the delinquency excluding auto, if you can talk a little bit of the trends you're seeing in the order book? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for Jason for your questions. I would like to ask the help of our Consumer Finance Director, but before changing the word, I would like to mention here that 2009 was the year we did the acquisitions and all the comp synergies from these acquisition, we ended up adding to our numbers in 2009. So we are expecting for 2010 to start capturing the revenue synergies more rapidly from the JV with Votorantim and from Nossa Caixa. And that's why we have created in our organizational structure a statutory directorship that is &#x2013; is going to be responsible for all the businesses carried by Banco do Brasil in the Sao Paulo State.</p>
          <p>In order to boost revenues mainly from loans here in this state using the franchise we acquired from Nossa Caixa, and also the JV with Votorantim. So that's why the guidance we're reporting a stronger focus on individual loans. Of course, that we know that the competition is going to increase this year in 2010 in Brazil and it's going to be very challenging achieving that volume growth. But I think that qualitatively, it's important to understand this guidance. Banco do Brasil will continue to focus its role on the consumer that brings higher yields.</p>
          <p>With regards to what kind of loans we are going to grow, Nilson, would you like to add some comments to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Geovanne. As you told, I spoke that Banco do Brasil expected to increase payroll loans, especially new contracts as in Sao Paulo or in <mark type="inaudible" /> and we expect it to gain with the synergy with Banco Votorantim and Nossa Caixa.  And we expect it to increase our mortgage operations in order to &#x2013; and we expect to build our volume in mortgage loans</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Any kind of guidance or expectations for the auto book on how quickly you think that you can grow your auto lending operations and particularly vis-&#xE0;-vis what you expect to see the market grow in that segment?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't know if Marcelo wants to talk something about, but we know that the vehicles market, the expectation of increasing market in 2010 is around 15% and so we expect that that our JV with Votorantim will be &#x2013; we'll gain market share in this year, gain with the synergies with our operations. I don't know if Marcelo wants to add.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, thank you. Actually that's &#x2013; we have already said the expectation is to grow specifically in the car financing and also in the pre loan financing. Our expectation is to have an important role also in the car financing. Overall, 30% in insurance say that far 2009, we have executed in first semester the capacity of origination of around R$8 billion and on the second semester we have already originated R$12 billion, 50% more. So based on the behavior of the second semester, we are pleased and confident that we are going to have an important role in 2010 in comparison to 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And finally to add, Marcelo, Banco do Brasil will focus also on those agents because so far we have focused a lot on our organic growth through our existing branches, but for 2010 together with Votorantim, we want to reinforce the agents grow on generating more volumes to our individual loan book as well for both auto lending and consumer. I am sorry, we will for instance, besides all the new or payroll account contracts that we have acquired. We have a very low penetration in payroll through retirees. So we expect to focus on that segment as well in 2010.</p>
          <p>Moving on to your next question with regard to NPL ratio in the auto lending business, we disclosed here in the presentation the delinquency for Votorantim's loan book. Banco Votorantim's NPL ratio as of December '09 was at 3.2%. It is important to highlight that this is the overall NPL ratio, of course, that a very important part of Votorantim stock comes from auto lending. In Banco do Brasil as a percentage, our NPL ratio is 5.2%, but I believe that the NPL ratio for Votorantim's book is better than the industry. Right, Marcelo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. We are &#x2013; we've done an NPL ration of 3.2% and it's actually the worse moment was loan orders and we expect trend off improvement from them.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Maybe just as a &#x2013; my question was that asset quality figures, the NPLs are valuable and I did &#x2013; we did go through those, but just on that slide 21 where you show the new vintages and delinquency decreasing would we see similar trends for that in the auto lending operations?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We disclose in our MD&amp;A a vintage analysis, a specific vintage analysis for the car loan book in Banco do Brasil. I would ask the help of Marcelo to talk a little about the vintages in Votorantim. In our case, since the auto lending business was a very brand new one for us, the 2007 vintage was very &#x2013; how I can say, risky. The 2008 vintage had shown improvement and so far the 2009 vintage has also shown improvements with maximum delinquency below 5%. It hasn't peaked, okay. It is still starting, but 2008 vintage is showing a maximum delinquency close to the average delinquency of the book, because it is a very brand new book, okay. But for the case of Votorantim, Marcelo, could you make &#x2013; add some comments about the vintage analysis for your auto lending book?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Well, I don't have with me any specific analysis of the vintage, but I can comment that we have been with a very good quality into the vintage of 2008. By the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009, we've had deterioration in the quality of the growth, mainly driven by <mark type="inaudible" /> and this started to get better after May. We, as a consequence of that, have seen that our provisions <mark type="inaudible" /> in August as I said. And what we're seeing right now is that the quality of the vintages that are being originated right now is much better than in the end of 2008, 2009, it's still a little worse  than in the previous moments to the crisis, but the trend is very good and we believe we can keep the same &#x2013; the same level of quality till the end of 2010.</p>

          <p>Yeah. Hi, good morning. I was just wondering if you could give us some sort of indication of what the impact of the rising of the increase in the <mark type="inaudible" /> that we had about from the Central Bank. Obviously this is not going to impact or start to impact until the end of March. But if you could give us some feeling of what the negative impact of that is on your funding situation, cost of funding which you talk about at the end of the year in the presentation here, also how you might deal with that? In other words, what are you looking to do here? Are you looking to increase lending rates to offset any potential increase in funding rates here?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>To be honest with you we don't think it's going to be a relevant impact for us because we focus a lot on organic growth portfolio acquisitions was an opportunity that was given by the Central Bank to us by releasing reserve requirements on our time deposits.</p>
          <p>And what the Central Bank is doing, it's coming back to the levels before crisis and they decided to do that to help the smaller banks not the large ones. And we ended up profiting, benefiting from this opportunity, okay.</p>
          <p>There is a specific table, table 37 that shows us the amount of portfolios we acquired. It was part of Nossa Caixa strategy last year to acquire many portfolios, but not Banco do Brasil and we have enough funding to support any organic growth that we need. So for us <mark type="inaudible" /> it doesn't matter. Yeah, it will not be relevant and for Nossa Caixa business, it's important to highlight that we have already started to merge the branches and from now on the strategy of Nossa Caixa will be adjusted to Banco do Brasil's growth strategy, so portfolio acquisitions is not going to be the bulk of their growth of the branch network in S&#xE3;o Paulo, growth strategy, okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. But I mean in terms of the cost of funding, I mean this raises your cost of funding presumably as you've got...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we have a very competitive cost of funding, it could marginally increase it, well, to be honest with you, because you would leave some amount of money in the Central Bank being paid by SELIC. So instead of making credit spread, I will make bond yield spread and with regards to funding cost, I don't understand exactly where you want to get to because the funding cost is already given.</p>

          <p>And since 2007, we have increased  perfect  risk mitigation mechanisms in the agri books. So all the new loans went from 2007 on will require insurance especially working capital lines.

          <p>Okay. Having said that, with this outlook, it's important to segregate what is the new agri business portfolio that was created in 2007 and the old portfolio that was restructured back in 2005 and '06. So the write-offs you saw came from this old portfolio. And if you look on table 87 in our MD&amp;A, which segregate what is the new loan in the agri book from the work that was restructured. Okay?</p>
          <p>And with the improvement in the environment, the new loans are performing quite well and just to give you some numbers. We have in the new loan book a R$253.9 billion balance they have. This book has a R$2.7 billion provision. The NPLs for that new portfolio is R$834 million, so the ratio of NPLs for more than 90 days over the balance of this new agri book is 1.5%. And the restructured book has &#x2013; still has a balance of R$11.7 billion with a provision charges of &#x2013; with a provision balance of 2.6 billion, and the loans that are past due for more than 90 days is R$1 billion.</p>
          <p>So the ratio in NPLs for 90 days over this old loan book in the agri portfolio is 8.9%. Having said that, we believe that this clean-up in this old loan book will end this year because it is expecting another charge-off, another write-off around R$1 billion for 2010 as well ending up all this clean-up for this old loans restructure back in the crisis of 2009-2010.</p>

          <p>Your next question comes from Boris Molina of Santander.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have a question regarding your guidance and regarding net interest margin. If you please explain a little bit what is your expectation for the <mark type="inaudible" /> the year, and given that expectation, what would drive your margin to either go up to 7% or decline to 6.5%, what kind of circumstances will lead it to go either ways to get an idea of <mark type="inaudible" />?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Boris, for your question. We're expecting a benchmark rate increase around 200 to 225 basis points at the end of 2010. That's our Chief Economist estimate and this is what we are considering here in this guidance.</p>
          <p>Of course that increasing <mark type="inaudible" /> 100 basis increase in the benchmark rate. This represents roughly extra R$120 million increase in our net interest income.</p>
          <p>But looking specifically on the net interest margin, we think that as long as we grow faster &#x2013; our consumer book, okay, I will be able to maintain our spread close to the middle of the range, okay. And what would drive this spread up, it would depend on the volume of repos, it would depend on the growth of corporate lending, because corporate loans bring that spread down and also agri book. So it will depend on how we develop business and how fast we change the mix. If you are not able to grow faster, our individual book and the funding stays in repos, it tends to bring my spread low &#x2013; to the lower part of the range. Okay.</p>
