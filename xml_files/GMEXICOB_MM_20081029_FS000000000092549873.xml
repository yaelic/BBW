        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for the third quarter earnings conference call of Grupo M&#xE9;xico. I am joined on this conference by Enrique Nava, Chief Financial Officer of Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, Jorge Pulido, Head of Investor Relations and other executives of the company.</p>
          <p>On today's conference call I will first briefly comment on copper prices, next we will highlight some of Grupo financial results, specifically addressing costs and then we will comment on the mining division's most relevant financial results, to continue with a financial highlight of our transportation division, to finally give you an update on Asarco's Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>
          <p>Copper, along with most base metals, has suffered a sharp decline due to the deteriorating global financial and economic conditions. China's slower growth rate threatens to weaken the demand for the remaining 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p>Having said that, we believe that the pressure in high cost operations, labor unrest, energy and water shortages and lower production levels, due to decreasing ore grades across the mining industry, is likely to work positively for a potential copper price recovery.  Overall, we remain positive on copper's underlying fundamentals and expect a price improvement in 2009.</p>
          <p>The average copper price for this quarter was $2.48 per pound, which represents an increase of 1% year-over-year and a decrease of 7% compared to the second quarter. With respect to molybdenum, the average price this quarter was slightly above $33 per pound, an increase of 6% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter.</p>
          <p>In the third quarter of 2008 our total consolidated revenues were 1.7 billion, a decrease of 7% year-over-year.  Accumulative revenues for the year were 5.2 billion, which represents a decrease of 5% compared to last year's. This reduction is mainly attributable to lower copper production in our Cananea mine due to the stoppage, although it was partially offset by higher metal prices and sales of molybdenum, sulfuric acid and silver.</p>
          <p>Our transportation division continued its solid growth trend and posted an important 15% sales increase from last year's third quarter. Cost of sales for the third quarter was 849 million, an increase of nearly 18% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>The main variances are explained by fuel and power cost increases in Southern Copper. The increase was 55 million, out of which 45 million were at Peruvian operations and the balance at the Mexcian ones).</p>
          <p>Purchases from third parties increased by 37 million and to concentrate purchases to feed our Caridad smelter. Transportation expenses increased by five million due to high concentrate sales from our Peruvian operations. Cananea strike-related costs were 18.7 million. From this amount, 3.6 million were for worker severance payments.</p>
          <p>In the transportation division, cost of sales was also impacted by increasing diesel prices. Although, these cost increase were partially offset by worker profit sharing decrease, a favorable exchange variance and because of Mexican and Peruvian currency depreciation and royalty payment decreases in Peru mainly due to lower sales.</p>
          <p>Since the late third quarter of 2008 we are seeing some cost reductions in Per-Am fuel that may ease cost pressure during the fourth quarter. Furthermore, the higher exchange rate will offset local cost increases.</p>
          <p>EBITDA in the third quarter reached 864 million, which represents a margin of 60%. The year's accumulated EBITDA reached 2.8 billion compared to 3.2 billion in 2007.  That is a 12.5% decrease.</p>
          <p>Net income for the third quarter was 342 million compared to 499 million in the third quarter 2007. Earnings per share amounted to $0.045 per fully diluted share. The net income accumulated in the first nine months reached 1.2 billion compared to 1.4 billion in 2007.</p>
          <p>With regard to CapEx, in the third quarter of 2008 it amounted to 186 million.  143 million was spent in the mining division and 43 million in the transportation division.  This represents an increase of 70 million on a year-over-year basis.</p>
          <p>The increase is explained mainly investments in Tia Maria and Toquepala expansion projects in Peru and the repayment of various tracks and acquisition of track machinery mainly at Ferromex.</p>
          <p>As of September 30 the cash position of Grupo M&#xE9;xico on a consolidated basis was 2.7 billion and a little south of 1.3 billion on a standalone basis. These funds will support our operational means and our capital expenditures program. Cash positions are held in low risk instruments with healthy financial institutions.  Our government policy focuses on safety, availability and capital preservation of funds.</p>
          <p>I'll thus brief you on derivative instruments and in this regard the holding company does not hold any type of derivatives. Southern Copper currently holds copper derivative contracts to protect 30,000 tons of copper production for the period from October to December.</p>
          <p>These contracts are mainly zero cost collars within an average floor price of $3.40. The year's accumulated gain in copper hedges has been 29.2 million and as of September 30 the mark-to-market valuation is favorable at 33.7 million. Southern Copper does not hold any copper hedges for 2009 or thereafter.</p>
          <p>In addition to copper derivatives, Southern Copper held exchange rate derivatives to protect a minimal portion of the Mexican pesos denominated costs of our Mexican subsidiaries. These contracts mature in less than 12 months and as of September 30 the value reflected a 14.8 million loss.</p>
          <p>With respect to dividends, the last quarter's dividend was paid in a single installment on August 22. As most of you know, in order to determine the quarterly dividend it is the company's policy to review at each board meeting its capital investment plan, cash resources and expected future cash flow generated from operations.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, the company will evaluate the payment of a quarterly dividend at the board meeting scheduled for the end of this week. I will be happy to provide further information after the board meeting.</p>
          <p>I will now turn to the main developments of Southern Copper and will try to keep this brief, of course, because Southern Copper already had its conference call yesterday. In the third quarter 2008 Southern Copper's revenues were 1.4 billion, cost of sales was 646 million, EBITDA amounted to 784 million, which was equivalent to 54% of net sales and net income was 418 million.</p>
          <p>Third quarter copper production was a little south of the 119,000 metric tons, lower 13% than the third quarter of 2007, but 3% higher than the second quarter of 2008. Southern Copper's cash cost per pound of copper produced in the third quarter '08 before by-products revenues was $2.03. If we include the benefit of by-product revenues, cash cost was $0.18 per pound of copper. We believe that Southern Copper is well prepared to face the current difficult circumstance.</p>
          <p>Our cash cost, although recently affected by power, fuel and steel cost increases, is one of the most competitive in the industry. Our high quality reserve base in assets, as well as our project pipeline, should enhance the cash cost position by adding low cost copper units to our current production base in coming years.</p>
          <p>I will now pass the call to Enrique Nava who will discuss the financial highlights of the transportation division. Enrique?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Daniel, good afternoon, everyone. I will now turn to the main remarks of the third quarter 2008 results of the transport division represented by the subsidiary Infraestructura y Transportes M&#xE9;xico, ITM, its principal subsidiaries being Grupo Ferroviario Mexicano, GFM and Ferroviario Mexicano, Ferromex.</p>
          <p>Load volumes transported during the third quarter of 2008 measured in net tons kilometer moved 10.7 billion compared to 10.5 billion, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Third quarter 2008 net sales amounted to 298 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year despite that load volume was only up 2% due to the mix of traffic and better exchange rate.</p>
          <p>The net sales for the first nine months of 2008 amounted to 827 million, an increase of 12% year-over-year. The cost of sales was 195 million in the third quarter '08, a 20% increase year-over-year and one of the main increases was diesel, which is one of the major components, increase 15% during the last 12 months.</p>
          <p>However, Ferromex was able to cut fuel consumption due to improvements in operations and the favorable effect of new locomotives. These produce a reduction in diesel consumption per ton kilometer of nearly US $6 million.</p>
          <p>Second, car hire reported an increase of 9% or nearly two million in third quarter '08 as the company increased the utilization of cars owned by third party railroad companies.</p>
          <p>The operating income was 66 million in third quarter '08, an increase of 1% year-over-year with a margin of 22%. The operating income for the first nine months of 2008 amounted 200 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>EBITDA during the third quarter '08 increased to 90 million from 85 million a year ago, an increase of 7% year-over-year and was equivalent to a 30% margin of net sales. EBITDA for the first nine months of 2008 totaled 282 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year and was equivalent to a 34% margin on net sales.</p>
          <p>The net income during the third quarter '08 reached 41 million compared with 44 million in third quarter '07, 8% lower year-over-year. The net income for the first nine months of 2008 amounted to 128 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>Total capital expenditures in the third quarter '08 amounted to 44 million compared to 90 million in 2007, a reduction of 51% year-over-year as no new locomotives have been acquired in 2008. It was used mainly for the rehabilitation of rail tracks, enlargement and new sidings and the acquisition of railroad machinery, which have increased train velocity, improved operating safety and produced savings in diesel consumption.</p>
          <p>I will now briefly discuss the results of our subsidiary, Ferrosur, which currently does not consolidate in ITM. In the third quarter '08 Ferrosur's total revenues were 70 million, an increase of 13% year-over-year. This benefit is attributable to increased volumes transported during third quarter '08 measured in net tons kilometer or 1.8 billion compared with 1.7 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>The operating income was 12 million in the third quarter '08, an increase of 4% year-over-year. EBITDA during the third quarter '08 decreased to 17 million from 19 million a year ago at 12% reduction with an EBITDA margin of 24%.</p>
          <p>Income tax was lower because we are recognized in profit sharing paid in the year as deductible during 2008. In 2008 and '07 it was recognized at the end of the year. Therefore, this element will be compensated in the fourth quarter '08.</p>
          <p>Net income during the third quarter of '08 was five million compared with eight million in the third quarter '07, 36% lower year-over-year. Nevertheless, the net income for the first nine months of 2008 amounted to 18 million, an increase of 3% year-over-year.</p>
          <p>I will now return the call to Daniel Mu&#xF1;iz.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Enrique. I would just like to give you a brief update on the Asarco Chapter 11 proceeding. At a recent hearing the bankruptcy judge cancelled the creditors' vote on the two reorganization plans for Asarco and also canceled a hearing of November 17. The hearing was to decide between Grupo M&#xE9;xico's organization proposal and Asarco's plan.</p>
          <p>The bankruptcy court hearing cancellation comes after Sterlite stated that it cannot and will not close the sale transaction under the perilous existing agreement. As a result of the world's financial turmoil and the unfavorable economic outlook, Grupo M&#xE9;xico is carefully re-evaluating what is the best strategy that will facilitate the recovery and the reorganization of Asarco. Providing, however, that the merits of each and every one of the claims against Asarco have been proven and determined by the court.</p>
          <p>Grupo M&#xE9;xico has never agreed with Asarco's independent board paying creditors greater amounts based on negotiations and estimates that are without legal grounds. Given the current economic environment it is essential for Asarco's reorganization that the court conducts a detailed review of each and every one of the liabilities that are actually attributable to Asarco.</p>
          <p>With this we conclude our remarks for this quarter and we'll be happy to answer any question you might have. Pamela, we'd like to open the forum for questions please.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, sir. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> And your first question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Goldman Sachs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, gentlemen, just like to start, first question, with regards to the railroad division, you talked about the potential savings in terms of diesel consumption.  Can you explain a little bit about that and what you think that can do to margins? And then I'll follow-up with another question please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Oscar, how are you? Let me just pass the line to Enrique Nava.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, Oscar, we have been taking advantage of the acquisition of the new locomotives and that has helped us the ratio of usage for diesel consumption. And so that year-to-date we have had a lower consumption of 4.7 liters per 1,000 of ton kilometer against 4.9. So we have had an advantage. On the other hand, negative is the element of the prices that the Mexican government, as you are probably aware of, has lifted some constraints on the prices of both gasoline and diesel. So they have been &#x2013; those prices were lagging significantly against international prices, so they have left those prices been increase significantly. But on the other hand we have Ferromex, a natural hedge as we have agreements with our customers that as the price of diesel hits us we make an increase on the tariffs to them accordingly. So, yes, we have had some increases in diesel somewhat mitigated by the better usage, but on the other hand the increase of a diesel surcharge has also mitigated that element.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and if I can just follow-up on that, so would it be fair to say that the benefits that you may see from a declining diesel price, from diesel prices globally, that would be offset by this lifting of the government? And you also commented &#x2013; can you comment a little bit more in terms of your third party usage of your railroad?  Are you seeing an increase or are you expecting a significant increase or under the current economic environment are you guys looking for a decline next year in terms of volumes?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, just in regard to the comment that you made if the decrease that we have seen in the international prices of oil will benefit us.  Not yet because as you probably know, precisely because of the way Pemex has structured the price of diesel they have continued with up to recently a policy of increasing the prices in Mexico of diesel and gasoline with a subsidy without affecting the prices with the international prices. So what I'm telling you is that now that the prices are declining, that subsidy is lower, so that will be benefiting Pemex or the federal government, not us.</p>
          <p>On your second question on the volume that we expect for the remaining of the year and coming 2009, I think it will not be adequate for us to say that it will not affect us because almost all elements of the economy will be affected. We will see, however, how deep will be this decline of the economic growth or recession. But fortunately, as you know, our segments are quite diversified. One of them is agricultural products, it's 29% of our revenues and that is a segment that has proven to be less elastic to economic downfalls because precisely the consumption remains more or less stable.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right, great, if I can ask just one more and then I'll exit the floor and this probably is for Daniel. Daniel, under the current economic environment, I mean during the Southern Copper call yesterday, Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez alluded to the fact that Tia Maria and the Cuajone expansions are going on. From the Grupo M&#xE9;xico perspective, how are you positioning yourself in terms of your capital structure in terms of are you going to be taking more expenditures in the railroad or other projects? Do you think that the slowdown in the economy will impact your dividend policy, how are you thinking about that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, Oscar. Well first of all, I think what Oscar Gonz&#xE1;lez Rocha yesterday referred to was pretty much to Tia Maria and Toquepala, projects that we believe are more advanced or in an advanced stage, that recently we believe they should carry on and we've committed sufficient amount of funds to kind of keep the ball rolling in those projects. Although we are still thinking about, even in those projects, sitting down with a lot of our suppliers and a lot of the parties involved and contractors to review carefully costs. And I think in this economic environment that it is only prudent for everybody to really focus on costs decreases or kind of like, to really review budget and what have you.  I mean there are some things that could be impacted like steel and what have you that we can still work on. That's on the Tia Maria and Toquepala project.</p>
          <p>I think with regard to all other projects, including Cuajone, we are going to really re-visit them and re-evaluate the cash cost of the project, et cetera in order to see when could they be really starting. So that's how we end up in earnings report coming up to the 220,000 tons in addition to 2011, that's only Tia Maria and Toquepala. I guess from a capital structure perspective, it is very important that we were not levered or at least we have negative net debt and nobody really anticipated this economic downturn, but I think our company is very well positioned with the capital structure that we currently have. Of course we are going to have to re-visit that and it might make sense to re-acquire some of our outstanding debt, particularly the debt that has a larger coupon. But that's something that we're working on. I'm not sure I've answered all your questions, Oscar, can you repeat the last part of it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>No, that was basically where I was going.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The last one was dividends. I think dividends is very similar than what we were doing with CapEx in a way that I mean the Board is going to meet on Friday, that's Grupo M&#xE9;xico's board and Southern Copper's board is going to meet tomorrow and that Board I think there's going to be a lot of discussion regarding CapEx and dividends. I think I will definitely issue a release after the board meetings with the dividend expected for the or to be paid for this quarter.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">

          <p>Thank you.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Rodrigo Heredia with Bolsa [IXE Casa de Bolsa].</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, good morning everyone, two short questions.  I want to know if you have an estimate copper volume sales for the next quarter and maybe if you have any idea of what you are going to sell in the next year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, well I mean we are carefully reviewing that. That, as you know, we have still Cananea on strike or it's been stopped, so that depends.  But for this quarter I can tell you that we are anticipated and yesterday we had Southern Copper in their press release, reveal that we're expecting 130,000 tons of copper for the fourth quarter, which that will bring us a little bit south of 500,000 tons for the full year. With regard to 2009, I think we haven't given guidance yet.  I mean it's important that we meet in the board room and then kind of like issue guidance for everyone. Rodrigo?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay and the other one is if you have a dollar amount estimated to solve the Asarco issue and if you also have a time estimated to this also?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, no, I mean a dollar estimated, no.  Actually, as you know, we believe that damages or liabilities should be as opposed to what Asarco beliefs and creditor's beliefs are very different. There isn't an agreement or a final amount on that yet.  Regarding timing, well it's important that the Sterlite proposal has been canceled and I think as well, given the economic outlook, we are re-evaluating all kind of proposals we are planning to make in order to reorganize Asarco and have it in our way or emerge from Chapter 11, but that is still our plan and we're working on it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rodrigo</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And your next question comes from the line of Markin Muray with Datsun Capital.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thank you for taking my question. I also have a few questions about the Asarco situation. Given that you stated that you need the bankruptcy court to determine exactly what the liability should be, how exactly will that play out and how long do you think that process would take? And then my second question is in taking Asarco out of bankruptcy are you going to be able to do that with your funds on hand or are you going to have to raise outside capital?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you for the question. Well I mean regarding the first, I think it is important to know that the reason we are asking for the court to determine the amount is because they haven't been determined yet, at least not all of them. There's a substantial amount of environmental claims that have not been determined and, well regarding the asbestos the situation is still very unclear.  So we have always trust our intention to recuperate Asarco and to have an Asarco emerge out of Chapter 11 to fully consolidate with our operations, we believe there are synergies.  However we've always stressed also that we're willing to pay in full creditors, but we need these amounts not to be just estimated or negotiated without I mean serious analysis. So unfortunately we don't have an amount yet, we don't have an amount yet and we are not able to disclose their estimates at this point.  But that's what's we mean when I say that we are looking forward for the judge to determine what the liabilities are.</p>
          <p>Regarding the second question is, I mean absolutely copper prices have changed dramatically in the last weeks. So that ordinarily impacts evaluation of a company, no, that's pretty much the reason why the company that was &#x2013; or that had an offer for it has just withdrawn it. But that really has an impact and I think in the last month or two we've seen a different world and we're looking at a different outlook financially. So we are assessing that in order to be able to determine, I mean whatever we could it with our funds or whether we'd need financing. I mean at that point our plan was we included at $2.7 billion back stop and obviously that is being reconsidered and analyzed in terms of the current situation. So at this point it's very unclear to say.</p>

          <p>When you said that the court will still have to determine some of the environmental claims, I understand that a lot of the environmental claims were all ready &#x2013; an order was entered by the court granting the claim status for some of that. Is that going &#x2013; for those particular environmental claims, are those claims that the court has already approved going to stay the way they were?</p>

          <p>Well, Alberto, would you like to answer that?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, those estimations have been or mediation on asbestos have been done and certainly we had asked the court to have some of those estimations be re-considered and that was part of the settlements why an examiner was brought in and placed to evaluate some of these settlements. So far I would say approximately 45% of those estimations have been settled and the remaining are still pending.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the 45% that have been settled, you accept that, that is the claim?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's what has been so far negotiated in the court.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And I think the conclusion here, Rhona is we are really looking into all aspects of those that had suffered a major impact regarding economic outlook and copper pricing.  And as you know, those settlement were made between Asarco and the creditors, i.e., the environmental authorities, not by us and we have some of those settlements being challenged and some don't. I think we don't have the specific details to disclose that now to you.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks a lot for the call. Actually my questions on Asarco were already answered, but I'd like the opportunity to get more information on the bond buyback you just mentioned. More specifically, what kind of bonds are you looking to buy back? And when you plan to do so, if you could just provide me with a timeline please? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right, thank you for your question. Well thank you for the question because it's important that I clarify and I guess that was in response to a question about our capital structures. I think we are happy with the capital structure, the way it is currently and we like that we are not over-levered, although we're taking advantage of some opportunities we could have levered, i.e. acquisitions we could have levered our balance sheet more. However, what I was trying to convey was that it is again an important time to re-visit and re-analyze what is the correct capital structured given the economic outlook. I mean if we were to &#x2013; I mean this creates opportunities also to buy back some of our bonds. We are not, although we haven't done that yet, we've acquired in the past an important percentage of the outstanding amounts of our 2028 Southern Copper bonds, which still have 56 million outstanding. That has a 9.25 coupon.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, gentlemen. Can you explain a little bit, if you have as far as you know any changes in your CapEx plan at the level of Grupo M&#xE9;xico?  Is it possible that with all the cash that you have you may explore acquisitions, even though you are in the middle of this legal situation?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Victoria, thank you for the question. I mean I think now having cash it's very important and it gives you a very important advantage to take opportunity that the turmoils are creating. Having said that, I think regarding the CapEx projects we had and the infrastructure development projects we had, I mean it all will depend not only in our more detailed analysis and more careful analysis given the outlook and the projections we have for copper prices and for cash flow generations. But also on the stance that the federal government takes, for example, in the projects like Punta Colonet. So basically I think this is a time to re-evaluate and have your options open. Definitely I agree with you, a strong cash position gives you an important advantage.</p>
