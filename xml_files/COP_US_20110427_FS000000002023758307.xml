          <p>Welcome to the First Quarter 2011 ConocoPhillips Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today's call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>I will now turn the call over to Mr. Clayton Reasor, Vice President of Corporate and Investor Relations. Mr. Reasor, you may begin.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for your interest in ConocoPhillips. We're here to talk about our first quarter 2011 results. I'm joined today by Jeff Sheets, Senior Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>This morning we'll provide a summary of our key financial and operating results for the first quarter, as well as our outlook for 2011. As in the past, you can find our presentation materials on the Investor Relations section of ConocoPhillips' website.</p>
          <p>Before we get started, I'd like you to take a look at the Safe Harbor statement we've got on Slide 2. And it's just a reminder that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the presentation and the question and answer session. Actual results may differ materially from what's presented today. And factors that could cause actual results to differ are included in our filings with the SEC.</p>
          <p>Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff to take you through our prepared remarks and presentation.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Clayton, and good morning to those on the call and those listening in on the web.</p>
          <p>I'll start with Slide 2, which highlights some of our first quarter results. Well, during the first quarter, our earnings after adjustment for special items were $2.6 billion. That's $1.82 a share, which is up from $1.47 a share in the first quarter of 2010. We had improved financial results this quarter compared to a year ago. However, we experienced more unscheduled downtime than normal in both our E&amp;P and R&amp;M sectors, and that adversely impacted income by about $150 million.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the quarter, we announced a 20% increase into our dividend, and our board authorized a $10 billion share repurchase program. And in the quarter, we returned $2.6 billion of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Annualized return on capital was 12% for the quarter, and cash return on capital was 21%. Our first quarter production was 1.7 million BOE per day, and our global refining capacity was 89% during the first quarter. During the quarter, we generated cash from operations of $4 billion excluding working capital changes and ended the quarter with $8.4 billion in cash and short-term investments.</p>
          <p>So let's turn to Slide 3 and discuss some of the details of our performance. So total company adjusted earnings were $2.6 billion, up $426 million compared to the first quarter of 2010. Both E&amp;P and R&amp;M improved earnings from &#x2013; over a year ago. Our E&amp;P segment improved $282 million due to higher liquids prices, which were partially offset by lower production volumes and higher production taxes. Compared to the first quarter last year, our R&amp;M segment generated $459 million more in earnings this quarter, due primarily to higher refining margins.</p>
          <p>Controllable costs were flat for the quarter compared with a year ago. However, variable compensation expenses related to prior-year performance negatively impacted earnings for the quarter by about $50 million, and that cost was spread out across the operating segments. This quarter's earnings were also negatively impacted the discontinuation of equity accounting for LUKOIL. So if you exclude the $385 million impact of LUKOIL earnings in the first quarter of 2010, our adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2011 are around $800 million higher than our earnings in the first quarter of last year.</p>
          <p>So we'll move to the next slide and take a look at production levels for the quarter. First quarter production was 1.7 million BOE per day; that's 126,000 BOE per day lower than the first quarter of last year. Field decline decreased production this quarter versus last quarter by about 187,000 BOE a day. That's primarily out of the North Sea, the Lower 48, China, and Alaska. But nearly offsetting this decline was 175,000 BOE per day of production from new projects, as well as new drilling and improved well performance around our existing production. The increase in production from projects is primarily from Qatargas 3, Bohai Bay, and the Lower 48 liquids-rich shale plays.</p>
          <p>Downtime also adversely impacted our production during the quarter. The 65,000 barrel a day per day reduction is primarily due to civil unrest in Libya, a several day shutdown of the Trans Alaska Pipeline System in January, a supply vessel collision with our Britannia platform in the UK, and other downtime in the North Sea. The impact to production from asset dispositions was 49,000 BOE per day. Nearly all of this is related to the dispositions we did in 2010 in Canada and the Lower 48. We sold some additional non-operated interest in the Lower 48 in the first quarter, but that only impacted production by about 2,000 BOE per day. If you looked just at North American natural gas, the reduction was about 50,000 BOE per day of this total decrease in production.</p>
          <p>So if you turn to Slide 5, we can talk about E&amp;P earnings. So E&amp;P adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.2 billion, which was 15% higher than the same quarter a year ago. Higher prices and other market impacts contributed $519 million of the increased earnings. The earnings improvement was partially offset by a $294 million decrease in after-tax revenue from lower sales volume. And there was a $57 million benefit from cost and other items during the quarter.</p>
          <p>So if you look at the table on the bottom of the slide, you can see that the improved E&amp;P earnings were driven by international earnings. U.S. adjusted earnings declined compared to the first quarter last year, largely driven by lower volumes, partially offset by higher liquids prices. Our realized crude oil and NGL prices were higher than in the first quarter of last year, while realized prices for bitumen and natural gas were flat to slightly lower, the impact of lower Henry Hub prices being partially offset by higher natural gas prices internationally.</p>
          <p>So we'll move to the next slide and talk about E&amp;P metrics. If you look at E&amp;P income per BOE, both income per BOE and cash contributions per BOE increased, reflecting the improvement in prices for oil and NGL, as well as some self-help in the form of shifts in our production mix. We continue to shift production away from Lower 48 and Canadian natural gas, given our view that natural gas prices are going to be pretty subdued in the near to medium term. And Lower 48 and Canada gas represent a shrinking part of our portfolio. If you look at 2008, it was 28% of our portfolio. It was 26% in 2010, and 24% in the first quarter of 2011. So full-year 2010 E&amp;P income per BOE was $10.56. If you look at the first quarter, it was $14.34, so an improvement of $3.80 per BOE. About 10% of this margin improvement can be explained by the shift in production away from Lower 48 and Canadian natural gas that I just discussed.</p>
          <p>So turning to R&amp;M on Slide 7, our Refining &amp; Marketing adjusted earnings improved significantly over the same quarter a year ago. Downstream market conditions were stronger in the U.S., and U.S. market cracks improved over 130%, driving a $464 million improvement in margins and other impacts. Volumes were a small benefit in this quarter compared to the first quarter last year, mainly driven by increased volumes in some of our specialty businesses and in U.S. marketing.</p>
          <p>Our refining capacity utilization of 87% for the quarter was essentially unchanged from the first quarter of last year. International refining capacity increased to 96%, up from 79% over the same quarter of last year, when we adjust for the fact that we are no longer operating the Wilhelmshaven refinery. Unplanned downtime cost us about 2% of first quarter utilization, and the majority of this downtime occurred at our Sweeny and our Borger refineries. Compared to the first quarter 2010, operating costs were $26 million higher, primarily due to higher maintenance, compensation, environmental, and turnaround costs, partially offset by some lower utility costs.</p>
          <p>As you saw in our press release, we built inventory in R&amp;M in the quarter. Because we're in the market buying crude for our refineries and selling products, both from our refineries and our upstream assets, we have a strong physicals position, which allows us to do some profitable trading around these positions by capturing arbitrage and blending opportunities in the market. Establishing discretionary inventories is a part of that trading operation, and trading contributed about $50 million to R&amp;M earnings in the first quarter. So the working capital impact that we see from these discretionary inventory builds will be uses of cash in some quarters, and they'll be sources of cash in other quarters. But they'll tend to balance out over time.</p>
          <p>So we'll take a quick look at our results from our other segments on the next slide. The Chemicals segment posted record earnings of $193 million in the quarter, up $110 million from a year ago, this increase being driven by higher margins and lower operating costs. Midstream earnings of $73 million were essentially flat with last year. And Corporate costs of $300 million were essentially flat with last year as well.</p>
          <p>So you move on to Slide 9 and look at cash flow for the quarter. We generated $4 billion in cash from operations this quarter if you exclude the $2.1 billion increase in working capital. We generated $1.8 billion in cash proceeds from dispositions. These proceeds included about $1.2 billion from the sale of LUKOIL shares and $600 million from other asset dispositions. With this cash, we funded $3.1 billion of the capital program, which was $2.9 billion in E&amp;P and around $200 million in R&amp;M.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned earlier, distributions to the shareholders were $2.6 billion for the quarter, which included the repurchase of 21 million shares at a total cost of $1.64 billion, and $940 million in dividends. We resumed the share repurchase program in mid-February, following the announcement of our dividend increase and our share repurchase program. Debt reduction was around $400 million for the quarter. And at the end of the quarter, we had $6.2 billion in cash and $2.2 billion in short-term investments. And we expect to use the majority of this cash to repurchase ConocoPhillips shares.</p>
          <p>Turning to the next slide, we'll take a look at our capital structure. On this slide, we just give some history of our equity and our debt levels. Not a lot of change this quarter compared to the end of 2010. Current debt balance is $23.2 billion. Debt-to-cap ratio right around 25%. As we said previously, we're happy with where our debt balance is, and we'll see it drift down a little bit over time as we have debt issues mature. We had $400 million of debt mature in the first quarter, and we see about another $500 million of debt reduction for the balance of the year. But we don't see a need to substantially reduce the debt balances from where they are today. The debt's long-term. It's low-cost. We have a pre-tax average cost of this debt of around 5.5%.</p>
          <p>So we'll move to the next slide and talk some about the capital efficiency metrics. ROCE and cash returns here that we're showing now exclude the impact of LUKOIL to our current and our prior periods. So both our ROCE and cash returns improved in the first quarter, driven by the growth in earnings and cash flow. Capital employed was basically flat for the quarter. We had a slight increase due to some foreign currency adjustments. Upstream ROCE for the quarter was 15% compared to 12% in 2010. Downstream ROCE annualized for the quarter was 8% which is compared to 5% in 2010.</p>
          <p>So this completes the review of our first quarter results. And I'll wrap up with some forward-looking comments before we open the line up for questions. I'll start with some guidance on our downstream business. We expect 2011 turnaround activity to be similar to what we had in 2010. So pre-tax expenses of around $400 million to $450 million. And this is going to be weighted toward the second half of the year. We expect 2011 global refining capacity utilization rate to be around 90%. And our total refining capacity now is 2.4 million barrels per day. That's down 2.7 million barrels per day last year due to the shutting down of the Wilhelmshaven refinery. At our Wood River refinery, we still expect the new units related to the CORE Project to be up and running in the fourth quarter of this year. As we pointed out at the analyst presentation, we expect that this project will increase heavy crude capability by about 130,000 barrels per day, improve our clean product yield by 5%, and increase our realized margins by about $4 a barrel.</p>
          <p>So moving to E&amp;P, we've given guidance that we expect 2011 production to be about 1.7 million BOE per day before impacts related to Libya production or any other additional asset dispositions. Typically our second quarter and our third quarter production levels are lower than our first and our fourth quarter, due to increased maintenance in the North Sea and lower production out of Alaska. The events in Libya negatively impacted our production in the first quarter and will continue to do so at a rate of 45,000 to 50,000 barrels per day. But the earnings and cash flow impact associated with that are around $25 million to $30 million per quarter. Our OECD-focused portfolio is less sensitive to PSC impacts. A $10 per barrel increase in our oil price impacts our production by about 1,000 to 3,000 barrels per day due to the PSC impacts.</p>
          <p>So last month, the UK proposed a tax legislation, which, if it's enacted in the third quarter of this year as they've talked about, was going to &#x2013; which will significantly increase the tax liability to our UK upstream operations. When this law is enacted, we would expect that we're going to report about a $100 million non-cash charge to earnings due to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability. They also announced a second tax proposal related to the tax rates applicable to decommissioning costs. And if that's enacted, that will result in an additional non-cash charge in 2012 from remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities. And we're currently evaluating the potential impact of that legislation to our operations.</p>
          <p>So moving to exploration. In the North Sea we have two wildcat wells planned for &#x2013; to test the deep Triassic prospects. We spud the Peking Duck wildcat in late March and expect to reach target depth late in the second quarter. And we expect to spud the Pelican wildcat in 2012. Also in the North Sea, we acquired two Norwegian blocks from the Barents Sea during the first quarter. In the Caspian, the results of the Rak [Rakushechnoe] More discovery are still being analyzed. And we expect to spud the Nursultan well later this year or early next year. In Poland, we expect that &#x2013; the third well in May to further delineate our opportunities in this area. This is the first horizontal delineation well, and it follows two vertical wells in 2010, which tested the play concept.</p>
          <p>We continue to pursue high-quality unconventional opportunities in North America. This quarter we added 33,000 acres in the emerging Wolfcamp shale play in the Midland Basin. We remain encouraged by what we're seeing from results at Eagle Ford. Early production performance from the wells is better than what we expected. Initial rates are strong, and the production's not declining as fast as we initially premised. We expect to have 14 rigs operating this play during the majority of this year. And production from Eagle Ford in the first quarter was 71% liquids. We're also active in the liquids-rich areas of the Bakken, North Barnett, and Permian, with 10 rigs operating in those areas. We expect to take that up to 12 rigs during this year. And in addition, we are participating in around a dozen non-operated rigs in these areas. In all of the Lower 48, our plans are to have twice as many rigs running by year-end than we had running in the first quarter last year.</p>
          <p>So shifting to Australia, APLNG executed a binding sales and purchase agreement with Sinopec for the supply of 4.3 million tons per annum of LNG for 20 years. As part of this agreement, Sinopec is going to become a 15% equity owner in APLNG. And we are still targeting a midyear final investment decision, at which point we would anticipate that we'll recognize around a $250 million loss related to our dilution of our interest in APLNG. And we still are in very active discussions with potential off-takers for the second train volumes.</p>
          <p>This was the first full quarter of operations for our QG3 project. The project in general ramped up faster than we expected, and we're very pleased with the performance of this project.</p>
          <p>Our 50-50 joint venture, Chevron Phillips Chemical, announced that it's advancing a feasibility study to construct a world-scale ethylene cracker at one of its facilities along the Gulf Coast.</p>
          <p>As we had discussed in our analyst presentation last month, we continue to advance our asset disposition program, and we expect to generate $5 billion to $10 billion of proceeds from asset sales in 2011 and 2012. We had given guidance previously that we expect these sales to impact production by 50,000 to 100,000 BOE per day and take refining capacity down from 2.4 million to 1.9 million barrels per day.</p>
          <p>So on the share repurchase side, so far this year through yesterday, we've repurchased 32 million shares at a total cost of $2.5 billion, and we still expect to spend somewhere between $5 billion and $10 billion on share repurchase in 2011.</p>
          <p>So that concludes our prepared remarks, and we'll now open the line for questions.</p>

      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. <mark type="Operator Instructions" />. And at this time we have a question from Kate Minyard from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi. Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick questions. First of all on APLNG, what are the milestones that we're looking for in terms of gas sales agreements that would enable you to reach an FID? And is there any level of gas price risk that ConocoPhillips would be willing to assume in order to advance the project to that stage?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So we've gotten one train sold now to Sinopec, and we're actively marketing the second train. As we go through the next few months, we'll be having discussions with our partner about exactly what type of final investment decisions we'll take, whether we take a one-train FID or a two-train FID, or a one-train with building infrastructure for the second. Those are all things we'll be discussing with our partner over the next few months as we continue to market the second train. We can't really say today exactly what type of FID we will take. We're very optimistic about our ability to sell the second train, though. The market continues to have a good, strong demand for LNG, both in the near term and the longer term.</p>
          <p>As far as whether ConocoPhillips would take a significant gas price risk to market the trains, we don't view that that's necessary. There is a good strong market out there for sales of LNG from the project.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just quickly on CapEx in Lower 48. At current oil prices, just curious as to whether you'd be looking to increase spending in the Lower 48? And if so, when might we see a production volume response from that? And I'll go ahead and leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So at the analyst presentation, we talked quite a bit about our plans for the Lower 48, and there's nothing new from what we said about a month ago on Lower 48 capital. So we're continuing to evaluate the resource plays that we have there for potential incremental investment opportunities. So it's a potential that we could do incremental CapEx. We haven't made any decision to do that yet. The production guidance that we gave at the analyst presentation, as far as the rate of increase from the shale plays, is about &#x2013; is the same as what we had said before. We're ultimately thinking we're going to get that up to around a 100,000 barrels a day coming out of the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, and the Barnett. And we think by the end of this year, we're going to be up &#x2013; what was that? Do you remember the number there, Clayton? We'll be probably up to 40,000 or 50,000 by the end of this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's right. Yeah, I think the guidance we've given on Eagle Ford, Bakken, and North Barnett is around 50,000 barrels a day by year-end.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay great. Thanks a lot.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Terreson from ISI. Please go ahead.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Clayton and Jeff.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, Doug.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Jeff, the quality of your E&amp;P portfolio has improved considerably over the last several years with success you've had on the development side and the divestitures that are &#x2013; the plan that's under way. And while your cost and on-schedule performance has been pretty good in the past, it looks likely that it's going to be a little bit challenged in the future given the number of projects that you have in Asia, specifically in China, Malaysia, and APLNG. It's a pretty long list. And that's true especially with competitor investment in the region rising. So my question is how is the company preparing to manage this phase while ensuring that you guys sustain this positive project delivery record and the returns that you expect in that area?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think the challenges we have are what you outline, it's &#x2013; well, we're operating in areas where there's significant other activity. So we're being very aggressive about how we're managing the developments in Queensland, for example. Working now with our EPC contractor to make sure that we don't run into difficulties there as we execute those projects. Our heavy oil developments in Canada, we have the same kind of thing. We know that that's a multi-year development, and we really work to schedule those things out to where that gets done. If you look at our resource plays in North America, like how we're developing Eagle Ford, we've made sure we had the rig commitments and the completion commitments in place early as we developed those programs. So, yes, we've got a lot of things going on in terms of developing our portfolio, and there's always schedule risk, but part of what &#x2013; we recognize that going into these projects, and we're putting a lot of effort into managing that, that schedule and cost risk, upfront.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And also on E&amp;P, ConocoPhillips took an almost a $5 billion non-cash impairment in 2007 related to the position in Venezuela, which over the past few years has progressed through the legal system and the ICSID. And so on this point, I wanted to see if we could get an update on the status, the next steps, and the possible timelines, which I know may be difficult, on that situation.</p>

          <p>Yeah, sure. It is difficult to predict the timelines, but as we've talked about before, we have filed &#x2013; we're working through the arbitration process through the international courts, but we've had our arbitration hearings. We expect to get a ruling on jurisdiction and the parameters on which values would be calculated later on in this year and then values as far as the damage calculations subsequent to that. But there's also appeals processes that can be used even after these rulings are achieved, so we're probably still several years away from -</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just wanted to follow up on the slide you had talking about upstream production volumes, and specifically I was curious: Of the field decline bar of 187,000 BOE per day, how much of that is oil versus gas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't have that right off the top of my head. It's a little bit more weighted &#x2013; if you look at our portfolio overall, particularly related to North America, the shift is away from natural gas. So the decline in natural gas in North America is more than the decline in liquids. I think we'd just have to get back to you on a more precise split of how that declined.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But it's a little bit more gas weighted than oil weighted.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And one other question if I could. Regarding Alaska, I know there's been a lot of discussion about potentially changing some of the tax laws there, and it looks like it may get pushed off in to next year. And I just wanted to get your views on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I mean, Alaska has got a very progressive tax regime now, and they're getting to be a relatively high tax cost area for us. We think that there would be opportunity for increased investment in Alaska that is adversely impacted by the tax regime up there. So we'll continue to work with the relevant people in the government there to try to influence things. We're hopeful, but it's hard &#x2013; we don't know &#x2013; it's hard to speculate on what the impact might be.</p>

          <p>Good morning.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>You reiterated your disposal guidance, the $5 billion to $10 billion. I was wondering firstly what the near-term potential news flow would be out of that program. Secondly, whether the issues in North Africa have potentially derailed some of the potential disposals. And, thirdly, any news that you might have on refining restructuring would be gratefully received. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I think as we talked about at the analyst presentation, as opposed to what we did in 2010, where we were fairly specific about guidance on asset sales, we're taking the approach of &#x2013; we have several things we're pursuing, but we're not likely to give a lot of guidance about them until transactions are at an announcement point. So I don't think there's really much more we're going to say other than what we've said so far regarding asset sales. We've mentioned before that we're continuing to work the Wilhelmshaven refinery asset sales process. We've got other things we're investigating and working on the downstream side, but it's too early to try to comment on those specifically. And as far as the events in North Africa, there's not much &#x2013; there's not really a comment that we can make there on the impact of that on our asset sales program either.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. On the pace of the buyback, it was a little bit slower than we expected. Can we anticipate that to accelerate for the rest of the year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So with the buyback, we spent $1.6 billion basically in the first quarter. That was starting in mid-February, after we were out with our dividend and share repurchase announcement. As we talked about a little bit earlier, we spent basically another $900 million in April. So that'd give you kind of an idea of the pace we've been going at so far this year, and we'll continue to evaluate that as we go through the year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so it would be an appropriate run rate then?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Couple of, I guess, a little more granular things from me. Your depreciation in the upstream fell about $140 million sequentially, and I'm guessing some of that related to the unplanned downtime. But can you just give us an idea of what's going on there in terms of how we should think about the run rate on a go-forward basis for &#x2013; I guess both for upstream and group DD&amp;A? And I have a follow-up, please.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So for DD&amp;A, what we guided at the analyst presentation of about $8 billion for 2011 is still what we would say for guidance. Now, that is lower than DD&amp;A levels in &#x2013; last year. Part of that's due to lower volumes. Also part of it's due to a shift in where our production comes from, in that we're having increased production from equity affiliates, where the DD&amp;A number is essentially part of the equity earnings number and not separate as a DD&amp;A number. So that is also a significant part of the change. So guidance of $8 billion for DD&amp;A, $7 billion upstream, $1 billion or so downstream.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got it. Thank you. And you kind of read my mind there, because my follow-up was really on the equity affiliates.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Obviously you don't break out the earnings there, but is Qatar included in there? And can you maybe just give us an update on how Qatar is performing, because obviously that's been a big part of your incremental production this year <mark type="indiscernible" /> (33:13).</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. Right, yeah. Qatar is in there. And it's performed &#x2013; as we've mentioned earlier, it's performed quite well. It ramped up faster than we anticipated, and production's been fairly steady there. So that's been &#x2013; the news has been good coming out of Qatar on the QG3 project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">

      </speaker>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Oh, I'm just saying, just in equity affiliates in general, the big things that go into that, of course, are Midstream and our Chemicals joint venture. Our two joint ventures with Cenovus on the upstream &#x2013; the FCCL joint venture on the upstream, the WRB joint venture on the downstream, and APLNG, as well as the Qatar project.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's terrific. And the last one I have, if I may, is the asset sales on the dollar side, I think the guidance is pretty clear there. But could you give us just a kind of run rate to date as to what you've completed in terms of volumes in the upstream and what you still have set to do? And I'll leave it there. Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the only thing we did that was closed in the first quarter was a relatively small transaction of some Lower 48 non-operated assets. It was around $300 million, $400 million. The volumes associated with that are relatively small, kind of 2,000 to 3,000 barrels a day.</p>

          <p>Well, we've got left to do the rest of the asset sales program we talked about, the whole $5 billion to $10 billion.

      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question for you on the refining downtime in the first quarter. The release seems to suggest there was bit of unplanned downtime, and I was hoping you could kind of address specifically the regions that's coming from and if that's been corrected heading in to 2Q.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, it's really &#x2013; it's different places, but predominantly it was at our Borger refinery and at our Sweeny refinery. So part of the Mid-Continent region, and part of &#x2013; out of the Gulf Coast region. Both those were incidents that occurred which caused us to take portions of the refinery down for a period of time, and those things are both things that have been corrected.</p>
          <p>We have unplanned downtime every quarter. First quarter was a little bit higher than what we would normally expect from unplanned downtime, and we put a number on that of around $50 million impact to R&amp;M for the quarter.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, exactly. Hey, just on the Eagle Ford and the Bakken volumes, can you just talk through how much of that volume already has a pipeline or a rail evacuation route already signed by Conoco, in terms of your targets?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So our current production is a little over 20,000 barrels a day. We have about 5,000 barrels a day &#x2013; wasn't it, Clayton? -that sits, that's curtailed as we're working through evacuation. We have plans in place to cater for the full Eagle Ford production, which we expect will be up at the 65,000, 70,000 barrel a day by &#x2013; in a couple years. So as we go through these next few time periods, there'll be periods where we're a little bit behind on infrastructure. But we're confident that by the time we get to 2013 and the volumes we think we're going to have there, that we'll have infrastructure to take that volume away.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And in the short term, that's more rail, and then as pipelines evolve, or &#x2013; ?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's both truck, and it's &#x2013; I think it's everything. I don't know if we're using rail there. I think it's primarily truck and pipe.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right. And then just on a follow on, obviously we had an announcement yesterday from another pipeline coming from Cushing to Gulf.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>What are your thoughts as a big Mid-Con refiner, as well as the Gulf Coast, that Keystone and the other EPG pipeline will be on-stream by 2013? Or what are the challenges they face, in your view?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, of course Keystone XL faces the continuing permitting challenge to get that done. We anticipate that that will occur, and that the pipeline will be constructed in the next year and a half or so. We get the question a lot about whether we should be reversing our Seaway pipeline, which runs from the Gulf Coast to Cushing. That's something we'll continue to evaluate, but there is a solution planned now between Keystone XL, and the question's whether there'll be incremental capacity required beyond that. And we, along with a lot of other people, are studying that question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>All right. And then my final question on the downstream: You've got better refining margins in Q2. You'll have your refineries hopefully back up onstream from the unplanned downtime. That's good. But what sort of negative impact are you seeing at this point from sort of prices impacting demand and on the retail side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That's a good question. And we don't have as good a window into that as other companies do, since we don't operate a retail marketing system. We're a wholesaler for our refined products. So we don't have any difficulty moving all the refined product that we can produce out of our refineries. So &#x2013; at market prices. So we haven't seen any evidence of decreased demand, but I'm not sure that we would be the ones to really see that, since we don't operate a retail network.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, for us, I guess it would show up in the gasoline margins that we experience at the refineries.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the strongest areas were the Mid-Con refining, with the situation with WTI being what it is. East Coast refining was still relatively challenged. The West Coast refining margins and Gulf Coast refining margins were actually stronger as well in the first quarter. So strength in the Midwest, more strength than we've seen recently in the West Coast, and East Coast was still a more difficult market.</p>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Would you say greater than 50% of your profits came from the Mid-Continent/Gulf Coast area?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, probably so.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I'd say that's a fair comment, yeah.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Got you. And then just looking at your bitumen price realizations sequentially fourth quarter to first quarter, it looks like they were relatively flat for the consolidated company, even though I think the market prices were higher. If you could just kind of help us understand what's going on there or how are you getting your guys' bitumen to market, or how are those realizations going to be impacting what's going on today?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so I think we saw a widening of the differential between bitumen prices and crude oil prices during the quarter, which is part of what benefits refining as well. There's no change into how we get our bitumen to market. There's no &#x2013; we're not constrained by any infrastructure constraints in moving that product to market. So it was just the shift in differentials which was the primary cause for the relatively flat bitumen prices compared to the increased crude oil prices.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think it's a question of if there's a commercial aspect of it or there's negotiation that we're in the middle of, we probably don't want to disclose it. But if it's public out there or part of some pipeline agreement that's in the public domain, I'd be happy to.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. In your presentation, you indicate that the underlying field decline from the first quarter last year to the first quarter this year is 187,000 barrels per day or about a little bit over 10% year over year. Is that a reasonable base operation decline run rate that we should assume, or that there's a number of one-off incidents that make that number higher than that we should use?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, I think that's similar to what we've talked about. So that number is just the unmitigated decline rate. So it's similar to what you heard Ryan Lance and Greg Garland talking about at the analyst presentation in March. That it's kind of 10%, 11% of our production rate. And then you can do things within those existing fields to bring that decline rate to more like 5%. And then with new projects, you can &#x2013; the rest of that decline and have production growth.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So that would be the number before maintenance and exploitation capital.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That is including both the new project as well as the benefit from the maintenance work?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, from exploitation work, is what I think &#x2013; of doing things within existing fields to capture additional production is included in the Projects, Performance &amp; Other on that production chart.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jeff, I was looking at that in your cash flow statement you say the working capital is a use of cash of $2.1 billion. I thought in a rising oil price environment, because you have a longer grace period for the crude purchase than your accounts receivable, the grace period that you give to your customer, we should see working capital be a source of funding instead of a use of funds. Am I missing something here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. So there's lots of different impacts that are happening with working capital that are price driven that will balance out over time as things catch up. So what we wanted to point out in the first quarter, though, is that we consciously chose to increase our inventory levels to facilitate some capturing of some margins in the marketplace that our commercial trading group had opportunities to do. And that was a big driver of the working capital change in the first quarter. And that's something that we could reverse if we chose to, and typically we do allow our inventories to go up and down during the course of the year. So you'll see that that will reverse over time. You could look at previous years, and you'll see a similar kind of pattern where we'll have usually inventory working capital negatives early in the year, and working capital positives later in the year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. Another source of variance on working capital can also be taxes payable. A couple times a year we make a big tax payment, and so that number will be &#x2013; taxes payable obviously is a source of funds, and there's some variation that comes from that as well in a high-price environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>But the big move this quarter was obviously inventory.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. So this quarter is inventory. It's not the tax, even though it could be a fluctuation factor in the future?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>That would be hundreds of millions of dollars. I wouldn't be the magnitude that you're seeing this quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Right.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Jeff, any insight that you can share with us on the Ekofisk redevelopment effort, where we are in the process, what kind of estimated development costs on the actual as well as on the per barrel basis of the incremental reserve that you will be able to recover, and what are production impacts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Nothing incremental to what we shared at the analyst presentation just about a month ago. We do anticipate that sanction of the Ekofisk staff development, Eldfisk 2, will be among the major projects that we sanction this year. They've got attractive, both F&amp;D and rates of return. And it's going &#x2013; that over time those are projects which will cause us to move from having a declining production &#x2013; well, first they arrest near-term decline in Norway and ultimately will get Norway production to where it turns around and see some slight increases.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think the &#x2013; what'd we say? &#x2013; $1.5 billion in capital in 2011 for North Sea.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Got a couple questions about Australia. You're still trying to sell the second train. I wonder if as part of this negotiation you're also going to sell a similar amount of equity in the development like you sold for Sinopec. So could we see it potentially being diluted down to below 40% in this development? That's the first question. Maybe I'll hold on for the second one.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. Yes, we're continuing to sell the second train. The buyers we're talking to, who are the likely buyers on the second train, will probably want perhaps some equity position. Some of the buyers we're talking to do not want equity. Some want a small equity position. It would be unlikely that it would be an equity position of the size that Sinopec came into. So it'd unlikely that we would dilute substantially from where we are today.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And second question is your partner, Origin, seems reluctant to confirm your costs for the overall development. Do you have kind of &#x2013; a harder total development cost going forward from here for the LNG trains and the upstream development?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, yeah, I think you're going to get the same answer from us that you're going to get from Origin, that we're working through that as part of our decision on getting towards a final investment decision in the mid part of this year, and then we'll be able to give you more information on that once we've gotten to that point.</p>

I think the permitting is taking longer than we had hoped, so I don't have a new time to give you right now on when we start the appraisal drilling around that discovery.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>I had a couple things. I just wanted to go back to that decline rate issue for a sec. Jeff, I thought you mentioned China both as a source of incremental production as well as a contributor to the decline. Can you clarify that for me?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so &#x2013; we did. And we have a decline from existing production in Panyu and Xijiang. Well, Panyu. Sorry. And then the way we bucket these things is we have different &#x2013; we have wells and platforms in Bohai which may be in decline and new things that we're bringing on in Bohai as well. So, yes, I did mention it in both buckets.</p>

      </speaker>

        <plist>
          <p>Well, when you talk about &#x2013; this is just a point of clarification. When you talk about declines at something like Bohai, that's ex price-related entitlement effects, I assume?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Not substantial in this quarter. As we've talked about in previous quarters, exactly how physical inventory gets marked compared to how paper positions that are hedging trading positions around that inventory get marked, there can be some noise around that from quarter to quarter.

          <p>Yeah, hi. Following up on Mark's shale question, what was sequential growth fourth quarter to first quarter for the shale plays, volume-wise?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, most of the growth came out of Eagle Ford, and I would say it's probably between 5,000 and 10,000 barrels a day.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. That's great. Any change with Kenai in terms of the shutdown?</p>

      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>In Kenai?</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Yeah. I'm sorry, yes.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Plans for shutdown in Kenai. I think there was additional cargo sold, but I think the issue is availability of gas.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, I mean, we would &#x2013; obviously there'd be a market for that gas if we can produce it. But, yeah, with the decline in the Cook Inlet area, as Clayton says, it's mostly an issue with gas availability and that compared to domestic demand in the Cook Inlet and Anchorage area.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So I don't really see any plans to prolong Kenai.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I mean, if we do prolong it, it's just for a short period of time.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, no, that's fine. Last one from me. Regarding the trading that you're doing on the refining end, how much of a capital commitment is it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So it is all capital that we can choose to deploy or not deploy in that business. So the inventory positions that we have can be taken out. So it's not a long-term capital commitment in that business.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I was just trying to figure out how much you're swinging, that's all.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so the swing in the first quarter was $2 billion in the downstream part of our business. And that's a mix of inventories, payables, receivables, all those kinds of working capital impacts. That's a fairly large swing for a particular quarter. If you look historically, we've probably been more to the $1 billion, $1.5 billion swings in working capital in a quarter.</p>
