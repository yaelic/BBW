          <p>Good morning and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results conference call. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded November 4, 2008.</p>
          <p>Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available in Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.</p>
          <p>In this call, Emerson's management will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about the company's performance, and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is contained within a presentation that is posted in the Investor Relations area of Emerson's website at www.emerson.com.</p>
          <p>At this time, I would like to turn our presentation over to your host of the conference, Director of Investor Relations, Lynn Maxeiner. Please go ahead.</p>

          <p>Thank you, Andrew. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and President of Emerson; and Walter Galvin, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p>
          <p>Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2008 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's corporate website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation.</p>
          <p>Fourth quarter sales were up 11% to 6.7 billion, with increases in four out of five business segments, strong underlying sales growth of 7% led by Process Management, Network Power, and Industrial Automation. Operating profit margin improved 70 basis points to 17.5% of sales, and earnings per share from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.88, up 13%; operating cash flow of $1.295 billion and free cash flow of $1.042 billion in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Operational efficiency initiatives continue and the balance sheet is strong as evidenced by trade working capital as a percent of sales improving to 15.9% from 16.2%, and operating cash flow to total debt was strong at 73%.</p>
          <p>On the next slide, the fourth quarter P&amp;L, sales in the quarter of 6.696 billion, up 11%. We had underlying sales growth of 7%.  Currency added two points and acquisitions net of divestitures added two points of growth. Operating profit dollars in the quarter were 1.174 billion or 17.5% of sales.</p>
          <p>Good margin improvement of 70 basis points, driven by cost containment programs, volume leverage, and favorable business mix. Net earnings from continuing operations were 690 million, up 11%. We repurchased 8.6 million shares for 398 million in the quarter. Diluted shares outstanding were 781.4 million, which gets you to an EPS from continuing operations of $0.88, again up 13%. Reported EPS was also $0.88 in the quarter.  The sale of the European Appliance Motor &amp; Pump business was closed in the quarter on September 30.</p>
          <p>The next slide, underlying sales by geography; in Q4 the United States was up 1%; good international growth, up 13% with strength from Asia which was up 17%, Latin America up 25%, and Middle East Africa up 14%, getting to a total underlying sales number of plus 7%.  Currency added two points and acquisitions net of divestitures added two points, bringing you to the total of plus 11% for the quarter.</p>
          <p>For fiscal year 2008, the US was up 3% and total international was up 10%; again with strength from Asia up 17%, Middle East Africa up 17%, and Latin America up 18%; total underlying sales of plus 7%.  Currency adding four points and acquisitions net of divestitures adding one point, bringing you to the total of plus 12% for the fiscal year.</p>
          <p>Next on page five, income statement detail, gross profit dollars of 2.474 billion or 37% of sales; SG&amp;A as a percent of sales of 19.5% as we leveraged the growth, getting you to the OP of 1.174 billion or 17.5% of sales. Other deductions net was 133 million, the increase driven by a $22 million increase related to restructuring and a $22 million charge related to the Appliance Control business; interest expense of 41 million, getting you to the pre-tax line of 1 billion or 14.9% of sales.</p>
          <p>Tax rate in the quarter was 31%, bringing the full year rate to 31.7%, in line with prior guidance.</p>
          <p>Page six, restructuring; Emerson restructures continuously throughout the business cycle with restructuring programs supporting geographic expansion and best-cost country programs. We have accelerated restructuring throughout '08 as 2009 economy looked tougher.</p>
          <p>Page seven, operating cash flow and balance sheet detail; operating cash flow of 1.295 billion increased 4%, driven by increased earnings. Capital expenditures of 253 million get you to a free cash flow of 1.042 billion. Free cash flow was 151% of net earnings in the quarter; a strong balance sheet with 72.9% cash flow to total debt.  Trade working capital balances at the bottom of the page with the ratio of trade working capital as a percent of sales of 15.9%, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.</p>
          <p>The next page reviews our liquidity position which remains strong and flexible. We have had continuous access to the commercial paper markets, high short-term credit rating, A1/P1, and we've been able to place paper with 30 day duration or longer at normal Emerson rates. We have a $2.8 billion backup credit line which expires April 2011 that has never been drawn against. At the bottom of the page, you'll see we have strong operating cash flow to debt ratio. Our cash position is in excess of our short-term debt and we have a nice debt ladder going out several years.</p>
          <p>Next slide, the business segment P&amp;L; business segment EBIT of 1.086 billion, up 6%. The segment EBIT was impacted by a $22 million restructuring increase and a $22 million Appliance Control business impairment charge, as well as the dilutive impact from acquisitions. Difference in accounting methods of 60 million, corporate and other in the quarter was 105 million, down 19 million, driven by lower incentive share expense; interest expense of 41 million in the quarter, which gets you to the pre-tax line of 1 billion, up 11%.</p>
          <p>On slide 10, we'll review the individual business segments, starting with Process Management; a very strong quarter with sales of 1.888 billion, an increase of 13%. Underlying sales were up 12% with currency adding two points and a divestiture net of an acquisition subtracting one point. By region, you had the US up 9%, Asia up 23%, Europe up 8%, Middle East/Africa up 5%; EBIT dollars in the quarter of 416 million or 22% of sales. We had good margin expansion in the quarter, driven by cost reduction programs and sales volume leverage.</p>
          <p>For the full year, Process Management delivered another exceptional year with sales up 17% and EBIT up 23%. We have not seen an increased level of project cancellations. Longer cycle projects in Process Management still provide favorable business outlook as we enter fiscal year 2009.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Industrial Automation; sales of 1.28 billion, an increase of 14%; underlying sales were up 9% and currency added five points.  By region, the US was up 11%, Europe up 4%, Asia up 22%. We continued to see good growth driven by the power generating alternator business and also the fluid automation and materials joining businesses. EBIT in the quarter of $199 million or 15.6% of sales with sales volume leverage and pricing more than offset by material inflation as well as an increased level of restructuring.</p>
          <p>Fiscal year 2008 was the fifth consecutive year of double digit sales increases for Industrial Automation with underlying sales growth up 7%. The 2009 demand is expected to slow due to slowing global growth fixed investment and tougher comparisons.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Network Power; sales in the quarter of 1.714 billion, an increase of 19%; underlying sales were up 9%. Acquisitions added eight points and currency added two points. By region, the US was flat,  Asia was up 19%, and Europe was up 2%; EBIT dollars of 215 million or 12.6% of sales.  Acquisitions had a dilutive impact in the quarter of approximately 150 basis points. In 2008, we've continued the expansion of our served market through strategic acquisitions such as Aperture. As we enter '09, moderating demand is expected as global growth of fixed investment weakens as '09 progresses.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Climate Technologies; sales here of 1.013 billion, up 8%; underlying sales were up 5% and currency added three points. By geography, we had the US up 3%, Europe up 13%, and Asia down 3%. Europe growth was driven by the increase in heat pump compressor sales, which had an easier comparison to the fourth quarter of '07 European sales. EBIT dollars in the quarter were 138 million or 13.6% of sales.  Price increases were more than offset by material inflation, and we increased restructuring ahead of a challenging '09. The geographic diversity of this business continues to improve in '08 with 45% of the fiscal year '08 sales from outside the US. Weak residential markets are expected to continue throughout '09.</p>
          <p>Next slide, Appliance and Tools; sales in the quarter of 975 million, down 4%; underlying sales were down 3%. A divestiture subtracted two points and currency added a point. By region, the US was down 6%, Europe down 4%, and Asia up 26%. EBIT dollars of 118 million or 12.1% of sales; there was a $22 million charge in the Appliance Controls business in the quarter that had a dilutive impact of approximately 230 basis points. The decision was made not to sell the Appliance Control business, but to create shareholder value by integrating this business with the Appliance Motors business. Cost reduction programs and pricing were more than offset by material inflation and volume deleverage in the quarter.</p>
          <p>In 2008, we improved the mix of businesses in Appliance and Tools segment through divestitures and restructuring of the businesses. And excluding the impact of the charges related to the Appliance Control business, EBIT margins expanded in 2008 in a difficult market environment. We expect market conditions to remain very challenging in 2009.</p>
          <p>So with that, I will turn it over to David Farr.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Lynn. I want to welcome everybody here this afternoon. I appreciate it. We just finished a two-day strategy session with our Board, bringing them up to date on the close of 2008 and then also what we see happening in 2009.</p>
          <p>First of all, I want to thank all the 140,000 employees around the world who really delivered a strong performance in 2008. It was a record setting year on many fronts and that's on top of a tremendous five-year time period. There are people out there that are saying the fourth quarter was weak. Our fourth quarter was extremely strong, a very solid close, high quality earnings, high quality cash flow, and really a tremendous finish to a fantastic 2008.</p>
          <p>If you look at our sales levels, underlying sales growth of 7% this year, 8% for the last five years; we returned record setting OP margins of 16.5%, which we told people we would get to in this cycle and we have gotten there. And we've actually had a tremendous growth in earnings per share the last five years, averaging 19 plus percent with this year's 17% of $3.11; and a historical high ROTC of 21.8%, which is a tremendous performance relative to the profitability and cash flow of this corporation.</p>
          <p>And cash flow, for the eighth year in a row, free cash flow exceeded our net income; free cash flow of $2.6 billion representing 10.4% of sales.  And if you look at the last five years, we have a sales increase of $11 billion, operating profit of $2.1 billion. Employees around the world of Emerson have executed and executed well for our shareholders and had a tremendous fourth quarter up and down the P&amp;L.</p>
          <p>On top of that, the Board has decided today to raise the dividend 10%. We're working on our 53rd year of dividend increase. We can't say for sure until we do it quarter by quarter, but we're one of the few companies that have increased dividends 53 years in a row, and we're proud of that and the cash flow in this company supports that.</p>
          <p>If you look at what's going on in the environment right now, we've had a tremendous year.  And as you look at the last three or four months, it has gotten tougher and tougher and more challenging and we still delivered great results.  And I would say that as we look at the last 60 days, it has been highly unusual, with the financial crisis, with the bailout, with the consumers within the United States and around the world facing loss of market value, wealth, jobs, and uncertainty.</p>
          <p>And the governments within the United States and around the world, just the United States government putting in over $700 billion, more likely going to 1 trillion, maybe even $2 trillion to support what's going on from the excesses that we have seen in the US and around the world for the last couple years.</p>
          <p>So we've had a tremendous performance up and down the P&amp;L in 2008. We are leaving this year very strong and feel very good about it. We have the strength, both from a financial standpoint and a global footprint standpoint to deal with the issues that have been coming at us.  And we will be highly flexible this year because no one knows for sure what's going to come.</p>
          <p>But if we look at our current economic models, our indicators, they're all turning negative.  Our employees, our customers are all telling us that we are facing uncertain times around the world at this point in time, very unclear. It will take time in my opinion for us to have a certainty on what we're facing. But if you look at what's going on with the financial crisis and the pullback in spending, just look at Emerson.  Back in August, September, October, I was telling you we were going to spend somewhere around $750 million for capital for 2008. We ended up at 714. We'll be telling you that we're going to be potentially taking that down to $680 million next year based on what happens in the economy.  What happens to the economy is a little bit uncertain. But we will be flexible in that regard.</p>
          <p>As we look at our business, if you look at our emerging market business, it's still very good. When you look at what we see today with our key markets here in the US, Europe, and the other G7, they have turned decidedly negative. In my opinion, the US economy is in a recession or very close to recession. Europe is right there, coming behind us. Japan is right there too. So we're looking at a situation where the mature markets are facing in my opinion certain recession and the emerging markets are holding up okay and they will weaken but still deliver growth for us as we look at 2009.</p>
          <p>If you go forward and look at &#x2013; what we have is our assessment for 2009. And we look at what I say the uncertain and challenging global economics in 2009, it's very unusual for us to look at and give you the type or level forecast this year early. But I felt in discussing with the Board the last couple days that we should tell you what we see as the range of issues and opportunities that we will be facing in 2009. Again, it's uncertain. It's not positive. The treads are heading down, our forecast in sales somewhere between 23.5 to $25.5 billion in sales. Operating margin of 16 to 16.6%; key underlying issues here would be underlying sales growth of either plus 4% and minus 4%.</p>
          <p>Currency is negative right now. If you look at the euro, 1.28, we will lose approximately $1.1 billion of sales off the top line and probably at a ratable margin somewhere around the 15 or 16% based on the mix of these sales.</p>
          <p>We will complete acquisitions. We're assuming some acquisitions here helping our growth about 4% and we are adding restructuring somewhere between 125 and $150 million in 2009. We've already increased the number of restructuring opportunities within the company in the last 30 days and we'll keep focusing hard on this and dealing with the changing environment that comes at us.</p>
          <p>Our pension expense will be neutral next year, not a big issue. However, we will be funding our pension plan approximately $200 million, which is built into our operating cash flow forecast of somewhere between 3.3 billion and $3.5 billion.  Our EPS will range somewhere between $2.80 to $3.20. And as I said earlier, our capital expenditure will be 680 to 725.</p>
          <p>If you look at the macroeconomics that we see at this point in time and the trends that are happening, it's quite broad but clear to me. US non-residential will be trending negatively somewhere in the negative 3 to negative 5% after several years of being positive. US residential will remain highly negative, down 15 to down 20%. Europe's GFI will be somewhere between plus two and minus one. And Japan will be somewhere between plus one and minus one. China will still be positive. China has decided to invest in the infrastructure, the economy, and they will be putting money into the economy to keep it going. We look at their GFI somewhere in the 10 to 12% growth range and India 8 to 12. Overall, a much more challenging economic environment than we have faced the last couple years.</p>
          <p>But you should know the management team is ready for this. We've been working on this very diligently the last 30 &#x2013; 60 days. We had our top 400 people inside Emerson inside St. Louis about two weeks ago for 2.5 days talking about it. I was in Latin America last week. We will be in Asia in about a couple weeks and then Europe as we talk about what we see happening in the environment and how we will react when things change.</p>
          <p>I'll also tell you that it is very uncertain. We will not know clearly, in my opinion, until somewhere in March or April on what we really are facing in this global economy. We will update our view of this in February when we have our analyst meeting.  But as we look at it today and knowing what we know about our businesses, our customers, and our global reach, this is what we're facing.</p>
          <p>We're entering the year obviously with very strong backlogs, strong order pace in a couple of the businesses, but those businesses in my opinion will continue to weaken as the year progresses and it will cause a weaker second half of 2009 than the first half of 2009.</p>
          <p>If you look overall, we have delivered tremendous performance for our shareholders in the last year and in the last five years. Our businesses and our financial position remain very strong and we finished 2008 with a record year.</p>
          <p>The company is well positioned to move forward in what I call a very uncertain fiscal year 2009. Our global footprint of 54% international, 30% emerging markets, will give us the strength to deal with issues that come at us and able to help us grow where we can get growth. And we have a very good mix of businesses right now and they will obviously deal with the issues that come at us.</p>
          <p>The financial strength of the company is at record levels, extremely strong, and we have the flexibility to deal with what we need to deal with. The global management team is very good at this point in time and also will deal with any issues that come at us.</p>
          <p>Clearly, we would love to have another 2008 come at us with a strong economy, but that's not going to happen.  The financial crisis that has emerged over the last 60 days has changed the economic environment for all of us, for all of us going forward here for at least the next 12 or 18 months. Companies like Emerson need to be flexible.  We need to be able to react and we need to deal with what we have to deal with and that's a fact.</p>
          <p>Now many of the people do not want to hear this and can't handle some of this information, but that is what we're dealing with.  Within this company, we are operating on a plan to deliver value for our shareholders, not only for the short term but for the long term. So that's where we are.</p>
          <p>I will open up the lines now to take the first question. I appreciate your time and I look forward to your questions.</p>

      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I guess it's pretty clear that things are more challenging from the credit crisis, macro environment. Could you give us a sense of where you think you have the best visibility by business and where you think you have the worst visibility and then maybe also give us a sense of backlogs versus the third quarter of '08 versus a year ago?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We gave you the backlog information in the slides we just gave. So that information is on those slides relative to our Process business, Industrial business, and Network Power business, and those are the three businesses you run off of backlog. The rest of the businesses are book-to-ship basically.</p>
          <p>If you look at where our best visibility is, it's clearly in our capital businesses which have held up very well.  And I think they will continue to do well in the first five, six, seven months of 2009. I believe at that point in time you'll start seeing the weakening as companies around the world will slow down their capital spending.  Companies will react and companies already are reacting. If I remember correctly, this morning the numbers that came out, the capital investment numbers dropped significantly. You will see companies reacting very quickly just like we're reacting. Our capital spending numbers have dropped in the last 60 and 90 days internally ourselves.  As I look at the visibility right now, you're looking at Process. You're looking at Industrial Automation.  You look at Network Power, but that visibility is only out four, five, six months, and then I think you're going to start seeing a changing environment; very clear to me.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And I guess with respect to you quantified the FX benefit or headwind as you look at '09.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Negative. It's a negative.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Exactly. So I think when you think about the tax rate and when you think about the contribution of international earnings to driving tax rates lower, how do you guys think about that for 2009 and beyond as you start to see growth flow overseas?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think our tax rate will stay around the 31.5 to 32%. You'll see that a lot of countries around the world are working very aggressively to try and get tax revenues from people and you're going to see the same thing happening here in the United States. There are people in the world that believe that companies like Emerson don't pay their fair share of taxes even though we do pay. Last year we paid over $550 million of federal taxes. I would expect our federal tax rate to be in the 31.5 to 32% range and not really change significantly, even though as we mix our businesses around the world. It's just a function of what we see happening.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just one last one. Could you flesh out a little bit more within Network Power what you saw with Precision Cooling Systems, what you saw maybe by telco, by telecom, when you think about the customer base?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>The customer base for the Network Power on what I would call the Network Power Systems business, the Liebert and the telecom business, was holding up. It's holding up okay right now.  It had a very good fourth quarter. The trends are still okay right now. I would expect them to hold up. Our current forecast is still to have positive growth within that business in 2009, but I would expect that business will tail off as we start getting into the second half of 2009.</p>
          <p>As I look at what's going to happen around the world, you're going to start seeing some of the customers slow down their investments and their order pace. But right now it's holding up and we had a very strong fourth quarter in that area. The weak areas within the Network Power would be what I call the embedded power and embedded computing areas, which are much faster adjustments from our customer base. That customer base adjusts within 30 days &#x2013; 45 days. It's much faster reacting.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes indeed, a couple of follow-up questions. In a couple of the segments, you mentioned that there was some margin compression because material costs outstripped price. I know you worked really hard to get the price. Maybe you could give us some color about whether the materials costs came up more than you thought or whether customers were getting a price pushback. Maybe what's the characteristic of the price/cost issues in the couple of places you mentioned it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We didn't really have any problem in the fourth quarter. What we look at is we price for the material inflation, the net material inflation and we get those dollars but they still hurt your margin because what we look at is we get a sales dollar and we have a cost.  So in effect, we do not cover our margin. That's what's going on.  In the fourth quarter, you have significant net material inflation as the trend went up. So therefore we had a lot of price and we had a lot of net material inflation and that hurt your margin but we still collected the dollars that we needed to collect relative to our net material inflation.</p>
          <p>For the whole year, we did very well. Our chart was green and it's still green right now. As we look at it going forward, you're going to also have a negative coming at you in the corporate world.  If you look at the material inflation right now, we were talking this year, the last time we talked about 5% net material inflation.  I now believe that's going to be closer to 2 to 2.5%. We had underlying price last year of over 2%, net price increases. This year I think you're going to be down to like in the low ones, the 1.1, 1.2, 1.3. From that standpoint, we will have a little bit of a negative impact on our top line and therefore on your growth because of the pricing. The material inflation is still going to be positive and we'll still have positive price, but it will be less than we thought and it will be less in my opinion than we saw in 2008.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I know it's early, but you talked about that in three businesses, you had visibility out the four to six months but then probably weaker business conditions. How should we expect the overall margins to perform in the second half as you start to see some of these weaker business conditions? What actions is Emerson taking to make sure the margins hold? I understand the second half, not the first half, it's a ways out, but maybe what are you thinking?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Bob, first of all, if you remember, when we set a business model, set the new course in the 2001, we said this is not a quarter-over-quarter EPS game anymore. We invest in the long term for above average growth and we invest in technology. So we will protect technology investments and we will protect core investments.  And therefore, if the second half starts deteriorating, you will see some margin degradation. However, we still believe we can run in the 16% range in 2009, even with the slowdown we're talking about. We have taken a lot of actions in the second half of '08. We have done a lot of restructuring the last three years and we're going to have accelerated restructuring in 2009. We're already taking action getting ready for what we think is going to be a challenging second half and maybe midpoint of 2009.</p>
          <p>So as I look at it right now, it's not a game to protect margin.  It's a game to protect our long-term investment and create value and leverage that as we go up and when this thing returns.  And we will be well positioned when it returns for growth again, just like we were in 2003 &#x2013; 2004. So we already know, we've already gone through the analysis of what we're going to protect and what programs we're going to stop, and we are taking those actions accordingly today.  And there will clearly be people reductions around the world as the volume comes down and there will be restructuring and taking out the costs as that happens, too. We are ready and we already have the plans in place to do it.</p>

      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a final thought, Dave; what's the latest on the China and the higher efficiency scroll prospect, 1 million units, that sort of thing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think it will be delayed for 12 to 18 months. The China government will be looking at certain investments and certain things and they will be protecting all of their &#x2013; what I would call their production, their jobs. In my opinion, these actions will be delayed in 2009 because of that.</p>
          <p>But we do also know the Chinese have already made a statement they will invest billions and billions of dollars in infrastructure to keep that economy going at a certain level.  So I do not expect the Chinese economy to get as negative as some people, and that hence our GFI forecast was reasonably positive next year because we see the government already going after and making those investments. I think you're going to see GFI growing somewhere 10 to 15%, 10 to 12% in China next year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good morning or good afternoon I guess. Nicole threw me off.  I applaud you guys on the detail you're giving here and conservativeness as well. The guidance range is obviously wide and needs to be, I suppose, given the visibility.  But, Dave, can you talk about what the biggest deltas between the high end and low end are? Is it emerging markets? Is it US, Europe?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's not emerging markets. The pundits out there say the emerging markets are going to crash &#x2013; wrong.  I hope people pull back on emerging markets because we'll use it to attack. The biggest delta is going to be here in the US and Europe. It's the two largest markets we serve. The US economy will continue to weaken and the European economies are already starting to weaken. So those are the biggest deltas.</p>
          <p>In my opinion, you'll see China growth weakening but still be positive; India growth weaken but still be positive; Middle East growth weakening but still be positive, and Latin America weakening but still be positive.  Our emerging markets are very heavily infrastructure based. They're not consumer based. So you're going to see the next 9 or 12 months will be pretty good, and then what will happen is the weakening will occur within the US and Europe.</p>
          <p>The other thing, you've got to factor in the amount of money that we're talking about on the negative of the currency. $1.1 billion is not a small amount of money. You also need to factor in the fact I just told you what I think is going to happen to price and that will impact in the top line. So you start looking at all these factors here, you will have a drag on a lot of global industrial companies, primarily from the mature markets, not the emerging markets in 2009.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, that's clear. Now, Dave, how do you really &#x2013; you talked about making some smaller acquisitions over the next year. How do you really balance your $35 stock, which the implied return there is obviously pretty high, versus going out and making acquisitions, particularly where private market multiples still seem to be, at least we're being told, pretty unrealistic?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, we bought back $1.1 billion of value of stock last year, and we are en route to buy at least $1 billion this year. What I would call the strategic bolt-on acquisitions that we have been working on and courting for the last two years, the environment's changing for us right now, Scott. It's changing for the global industrial companies like Emerson.  And right now, our deal flow has accelerated because these are companies that we have been courting and trying to convince them to sell and now they will come to us.</p>
          <p>I would expect, to be honest, our bolt-on type acquisitions will be somewhere between 500 and $700 million of value, acquisition dollar value in 2009. And as we look at the second half of 2009, I think you're going to see us push pretty hard in a couple of the what I call strategic marquee acquisitions at the same time. In the meantime, we will invest in our stock like we have been doing. But as acquisitions gear up, we will try to dial that back down. But my gut right now says we'll probably do around $1 billion in share repurchase.  With our 3.3, 3.4, $3.5 billion of operating cash flow, we do have the flexibility to go back and forth, as you know, depending on what happens to us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, and just lastly, the comments. You made some comments I think, certainly about customers adjusting CapEx levels pretty fast, but how about inventory levels?  With the commodity prices coming down, is there any feel for maybe customers moving down to maybe below average inventory levels?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think that we haven't seen &#x2013; the inventory levels at the customer levels are pretty good. However, you're seeing them drop to the levels to what you're saying there. We are starting to see them and say okay &#x2013; I'll make numbers up here.  Rather than keep $1 million of inventory, we're going to take that down to $800,000 or $900,000. So we are seeing that.</p>
          <p>Now, several of our businesses, Scott, have already been in a recession. If you want to look at the appliance components and the residential businesses we have here, they've been in a recession in the United States for quite some time. Those businesses are continuing to weaken and you'll see the inventory levels keep coming down there. But in total, the inventory levels of ourselves and our customers are in pretty good shape. But I think you're going to see them dial it back a little bit and my gut tells me you're going to see when we get into December, it's going to be very much like December of 2001, where a lot of customers decide to shut down for a big chunk of December. That's my bet.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, good afternoon. Dave, I'd be very interested in hearing your comments on restructuring. One of the popular themes this quarter was companies announcing big one-time restructuring charges. You went out of your way to point out the pay-as-you-go philosophy. You did specify 125 million, 150 million for '09. And then two businesses were called out for restructuring, Climate and Industrial Automation. How are you approaching this? Is there more that you can be doing? When do you start pulling the trigger to do more and what type of payback are you expecting?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We've already instituted the plan to do $125 million of restructuring with about 29 facilities. What I call facility can be broad.  It could be a manufacturing, small manufacturing.  It could be a configuration center, but these are facilities around the world. We've already pulled the trigger on these. We have been doing this, as you know, on an ongoing basis. It slowed down a little bit about 18 months ago as our underlying volume got very high. But as we looked at the second half of 2008, we actually started accelerating, and that's where the $70 million came from.</p>
          <p>So we have right now in place geared up and executing $125 million of restructuring. And the payback typically in these programs are usually around 18 months.  Some of them are short.  Some of them are long. But you're looking at some fundamental restructuring of some facilities which could be in high cost locations which take time and the payback is a little bit longer. But we don't &#x2013; as you know, within Emerson, we don't wait until the very end and then say okay, let's take a big restructuring charge. We have consistently gone after this and we've been doing it very aggressively. To be honest, I think we will struggle. We will struggle to get much beyond 125 million unless things really, really, really got really bad out there and right now. So we'll do a little bit more but my gut tells me 125 million is the number that we'll be focusing on. That's what's executed. That's what has started right now.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Very helpful. Just in terms of the comment &#x2013; maybe it's a bit surprising, and we may think it's coming soon, but no cancellations of any sort of size out of backlog?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Can you talk about that a bit more? Are you seeing push-outs? What are your customers telling you about their access to credit? Are you getting any sense that there's another shoe to fall soon here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No, we have not seen any significant push-out. What you're going to see is a slowdown of the order paces. We have not seen any issues from our customers from a financial standpoint. Most of our customers are fairly well capitalized. They have access to credit lines. There's been a little bit but we watch it very closely.  My gut tells me that this will accelerate here in the coming months. It is unusual for us to go out right now and give this type of guidance. But you all are trying to guess right now and you're all over the place. So I felt it was really &#x2013; from my perspective and the Board's perspective, I needed to give you a little bit of help from what we were seeing from the real business world. And not located in New York City, but somewhere in St. Louis, Missouri, in the Midwest where we actually make products. And so that's why we did it.</p>
          <p>My gut tells me that our customers will slow down their order patterns and that the economy will come to a slowdown period here fairly soon, and it's already happening. As I said, I think you're going to see in December many of our customers will make the decision we have enough and let's take some early holidays. So it's not &#x2013; you don't see these big cancellations, but I think you're going to see a slowdown of the order pattern, and we have not seen any push-outs, but you could see push-outs in the coming months.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just if we could focus on Industrial Automation for a minute, as we try to model this now during this pending recession, if you look back, the segment obviously struggled in the last recession. It was down 25% in revenue basically, peak to trough. Can you give us a sense now as you look at the components of that division, what's different this time that we should anticipate good or bad in that segment as we try to model the next two years on the down side?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Mike, we are in a recession. Industrial Automation as you know, we have sold some businesses off and we have bought some businesses. The biggest issue that we have to watch here, and there's still strong demand and backlog, is in what I call the power gen side area, the backup power for the global use of power, the oil and gas, the industrial use, the mining. We have not seen that slow down yet. That's a long cycle. In my opinion, that will start happening within the next six to nine months.</p>
          <p>As we look at this, we're going into an environment with a little bit different mix of business. It's much more international, has more global footprints and especially in emerging markets. The last time we started this, the emerging market sales were probably only around 5 or 6%.  Now it's closer to 17%. My feeling is that this business will trend negative, but not nearly at the same level as before.</p>
          <p>The other thing you have to know is we made the decision during that downturn to also do a lot of restructuring within that business and do a lot of shifting around of capacity.  And that created, I would say, an extraordinary downward margin. But it will be in my opinion, if you look at 2009 as we leave 2009, we'll most likely have negative growth and some deleverage, but not to the same magnitude that we had last time because we have actually done a much better job of globalizing it and getting the best-cost manufacturing since the 2001, 2002, 2003 time period. But still clearly, a wild card from the standpoint you want to watch that one, as you point out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And then just on the business in total, if you look at this quarter, you posted a 7% organic growth number. The guidance for fiscal '09 is plus four to minus four. It implies a fairly steep erosion as we go through the fourth quarter. I'm curious; we haven't seen the October orders yet. But what do you see in the first few weeks &#x2013; or last few weeks of October and early November here that give you or...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slowing.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>...I guess raise those type of fears.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Slowing, slowing. To be honest, the GFI that we live right now off of six months ago. In my opinion, the GFI within the US, the GFI within the G7 will start becoming flat or slightly negative as you get into the first couple months, quarters, maybe the quarter of 2009 on a calendar year basis. But the order pattern right now in our capital related business is definitely slowing. And the consumer you know has basically stopped all discretionary spending. So therefore, if you look at our consumer related businesses, primary drilling here in the US, their order pattern has also slowed down and declined again.</p>
          <p>As I look at October and as I look at what's coming at us and looking and thinking about the last time we faced this, and we faced that negative &#x2013; that December time period, I think that's where I'm coming from. I'm using my common business sense and my business experience. I've been with Emerson for almost 28 years and I did go through the last downturn. And so Walter and I and Ed feel very comfortable saying this thing is trending down and that people need to be thinking about what's going to come at them and you need to get ready. So our message is get ready and get positioned. But we have not backed down in investment in technologies in new products. We actually increased it again, and that's very important to us. But it's definitely trending that way, even with the current order patterns, Mike.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Okay, Dave.  With respect to Process, I've seen some specific end markets that their utilization levels have dropped a little bit. Is there something that the customer does at that point that's different from what he's been doing in terms of MRO or projects or &#x2013; obviously having been very exposed to that business in your past, are there any patterns that change when you go from a high growth environment to let's say a slower growth environment for those guys?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the first thing that they'll change is they'll quickly reevaluate the projects that they had on the drawing board and maybe had gone out what we call for the feed and evaluation, doing the engineering drawing. So that will be the first thing they look at. If they've already contracted and started it and got the contract award out there and are going to work it, they're going to keep going with that because the cost of stopping is pretty high.</p>
          <p>But what they can do is they'll quickly look and if they were going to do a capacity expansion of a facility somewhere, and that's on the drawing board, and they are going through the feed analysis right now, they will stop that. As soon as they see the demand is slowing, you'll see them stop that. You will also see them, they will slow down.  Historically when a slowdown comes, they will also slow down their maintenance and repair and the upkeep. We haven't seen that yet, but that typically will come at us within two or three months of for sure they know that they're going to be hit with a slowdown in demand and capacity needs.</p>

          <p>They maintain the equipment, but they might only do partial shutdowns versus a full shutdown. They will scale back in what they do. You can't [not] maintain equipment because things do blow up. But I don't think you're going to see a lot of that impact until the mid to late next year. That cycle business will be okay for the foreseeable business future. What you'll have to watch there are the new orders and the new projects which will most likely slow down as the demand slows down for the need for materials around the world.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Just a couple of quick ones here. In the past, you talked about there's a multiplier of like two times on GFI growth in emerging markets. Do you think that still holds the next couple years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes. From my perspective and the whole message I've been giving to our people internally is yes, GFI in emerging markets is going to scale down but that two times is still the focal point for us, and we need to drive that. And we will continue to invest in those markets. I'm really hoping people will pull back because I think the emerging markets, yes; they will slow down and are tied to Europe and the US.  But when those infrastructure projects are needed, the governments will fund those and as soon as the US and European economy starts strengthening, whenever that time period is, you're going to see the emerging markets come right along with them pretty quickly.</p>
          <p>The global world is not decoupled. Remember the theory of decoupling a year ago or so? It's tied together very tightly. Just look at the financial world, and the industrial world is the same thing. So you're going to see us moving very quickly, just like we're moving our production very quickly right now as we look and evaluate where the best cost locations are for us to produce products.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, and that's comes around my second question on the FX.  I understand the negative impact of the top line, but you've got a huge international footprint, especially in emerging markets. And as far as I've seen, the stronger dollar would actually help...</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I like the stronger dollar. With our global footprint and the restructuring that we have been doing the last three or four years, a stronger dollar plays into our hands.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So the five point headwind on the top line would obviously be less at the EPS level?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I can't say that. It just helps us keep our &#x2013; helps us deleverage less in the downturn underlying volume. The underlying volume will decline based on what I see in the economy right now, and so it will help us deleverage less, help us maintain the 16% operating margin. That is a very good margin for a company like this. A lot of companies have to bridge to try to get up margins.  We actually delivered up margins.</p>

      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>You got the last one, Chris, before I go talk to the employees.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>It's an honor. Just did a nice deep dive comparing the cyclicality and some of the differences in business and Industrial Automation versus the last downturn. I'd like to visit that on Process.  By contrast, that did very well in the last downturn but we had a very different kind of boom than that business is seeing this time around.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>It's a little bit early to say how the process will come about here. I personally believe the long-term secular trend is that investments will continue to happen in the energy marketplace and given whatever president gets elected, they are going to be making some investments here and you're going to see those investments happen around the world. So I feel pretty good that the growth will happen in the Process world.</p>
          <p>As you said, in the last downturn they were still able to grow. But we're going to be coming from 8, 10, 11, 12% growth, in my opinion. As we get going next year, we'll still be good but the year after that could be either 2 or 3-type percent growth. So I think you're going to see reasonable growth but it's going to slow down to under the underlying growth rate of what we say the long-term growth rate of that sector, which is 6 to 8%. It's going to go down to low single digits, after we get into this cycle which is going to be out sometime in 2010 probably.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And just a few headlines like the Saudis doing a big production cut today.  There are a certain number of headlines we see like that where we start to get a little bit more bearish than what you're talking about right here?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Like I said earlier, you're going to see the projects which have already been set and funded to move forward because they're too costly to stop. That will be okay for the next 12 or 18 months or 24 months let's say. It's the time after that that you'll start seeing those projects really slow down. So you're going &#x2013; in the Process world, the visibility is pretty good and so the growth rate is probably laid in probably for the next 18 months, but it will be slowing. The growth rate will be slowing, to be honest.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>You're welcome. I want to close it. I want to thank everybody for your time. I appreciate it. The one thing I do want to make a comment on. I'm sorry; I should have made this earlier. I don't give quarterly forecasts. But in the first quarter, if you're still out there, last year we're going to have higher restructuring in the first quarter, somewhere around $30 million.</p>
          <p>Last year we had two large asset sales. We sold our joint venture, Commercial Cam. We also sold some property which gave us a significant gain, around $80 million.  And also we sold Brooks, which is in discontinued ops, which had a large gain. So you're going to see a significant loss of other income in our first quarter and also we're going to have higher deductions because of the restructuring. So you need to keep that in mind as we look at the first quarter. Go back and look at what we had last year in the first quarter. That will not repeat and we'll have more restructuring in the first quarter.</p>
          <p>Again, I want to thank everybody across Emerson. It was a phenomenal 2008, record setting across the board. A great close, a great fourth quarter, tremendous fourth quarter, high quality, and we're going into 2009 ready for a very uncertain and challenging year and the employees of this company are ready to go and I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Good night.</p>
