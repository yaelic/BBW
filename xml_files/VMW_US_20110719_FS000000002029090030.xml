          <p>Welcome to VMware's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. On the call we have Paul Maritz, our CEO, and Mark Peek, our CFO. Following their prepared remarks, we will take questions. A press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website, where this call is being simultaneously webcast.</p>
          <p>Statements made on this call include forward-looking statements such as those with the words will, believes, expects, continues and similar phrases that denote future expectation or intent regarding our financial outlook, product offering, customer demand and other matters. These statements are based on the environment as we currently see it and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the press release and the risk factors in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, for information on risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in such statements.</p>
          <p>In addition, during today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures, which are used as measures of VMware's performance, should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Our non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on our GAAP results of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible  assets, employer payroll tax on employee stock transactions, the net effect of amortization and capitalization of software, acquisition-related items and the gain from the sale of our investment in Terremark. You can find addition disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures, including reconciliations with comparable GAAP measures, in the press release and on the Investor Relations page of our website.</p>
          <p>The webcast replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days on our company website under the Investor Relations link. Our third quarter quiet period begins at the close of business September 16, 2011. For your planning purposes, VMworld, the leading virtualization and cloud infrastructure event of the year, will be held in Las Vegas from August 29th through September 1st. As part of VMworld, we will be hosting our Analyst Day on Tuesday August 30th. Finally, unless otherwise stated, all financial comparisons in this call will be in reference to our results for the comparable period of 2010. With that, let me hand it over to Mark.</p>

      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. The financial and business results for our second quarter clearly exceeded our expectations. We achieved record revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP operating cash flows driven by strength across geographies and record ELA bookings as a percentage of total bookings. The quarter also benefited from a sequential decline in unearned license revenue.</p>
          <p>Now for the financial highlights. Total second quarter revenues increased 37% year-over-year and license revenues increased 44%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was a record 31.6%, and benefited from the strong sequential increase in license revenue. We expect margins to return to below 30% in the third quarter. Trailing 12-month free cash flows were $1.6 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash and investments of $3.7 billion and unearned revenues of $2.1 billion.</p>
          <p>Our results speak to the value of our products. vSphere is the most trusted, widely-deployed virtualization platform in the world. Last week, we announced vSphere 5 and a comprehensive suite of cloud infrastructure technologies to not only help customers virtualize their cloud application, but also help them build and operate modern data centers with cloud architectures. With the introduction of VMware vSphere 5, VMware is evolving the product's licensing to lay the foundation for customers to adopt a more cloud-like IT cost model based on consumption and value, rather than physical components and capacity.</p>
          <p>We are extending our focus beyond delivering virtual infrastructure with vSphere to complete our Cloud Infrastructure Suite. We expect these new releases to become generally available in Q3. With nearly 200 new and enhanced capabilities, vSphere 5 will continue to set the standard in virtualization, delivering better application performance and availability for business-critical applications, while automating the management of an increasingly broad pool of data center resources. Paul will speak more to vSphere 5 and cloud infrastructure technologies.</p>
          <p>As I mentioned during last quarter's call, we integrated more than 300 people from EMC's Mozy and cloud services group in April to further strengthen our cloud initiative. We also closed the acquisitions of SlideRocket, Socialcast, and Shavlik during the quarter and welcomed about 200 new employees from these applications to VMware.  Finally, we announced the acquisition of Digital Fuel, which closed in early July. We're very pleased with our results for the first half of 2011 and want to thank all the people of VMware, our partners and our customers.</p>
          <p>Now, I'll walk you through the financial details. Total revenues for the second quarter were $921 million, an increase of 37% from a year ago, or 35% on a constant currency basis. The quarter was characterized by strong demand in the U.S. and across our international markets. License revenues were $465 million, up 44% from last year, driven largely by strong global demand for</p>
          <p>vSphere, record ELA bookings as a percent of total bookings, including several deals that renewed early and a net decline of $11 million unearned license revenue. License growth, on a constant currency basis, was 40%.</p>
          <p>Enterprise license agreements exceeded 25% of total second quarter bookings, and no transactions exceeded $10 million. We were pleased to see a healthy mix in the quarter from renewals as well as new ELAs. In addition, we continue to see stronger demand for our end-user and management products as customers renew their ELAs. Blended ASPs increased during the quarter, driven primarily by good discounting discipline in the field and higher ELA volumes, which tend to include our highest-end SKU, Enterprise Plus.</p>
          <p>Our end-user computing business continues to progress well. In the second quarter, we were pleased to have a solid number of View desktop virtualization wins and follow-on business across geographies and verticals, including our largest View deal to-date with a very large North American retail pharmacy chain and a major mobile carrier in China.</p>
          <p>We're also seeing continued traction for our management products including vCloud Director, and vCenter Operations. Much of the increased interest for our management tools is being driven by the build-out of private clouds within our customers' data centers. U.S. revenues increased 35% year over year, to $450 million. International revenues were $471 million, an increase of 38% compared to the second quarter of 2010.</p>
          <p>Demand in our Asia-Pacific region was particularly strong, led by year-over-year growth in Australia, Japan and China. We are very pleased with our progress in growing our global market presence. The investments we have made and will continue to make in our international market expansion are clearly paying off. Software maintenance and support revenue was $386 million, up 33% compared to last year. Customers continued to buy, on average, more than 24 months of support and maintenance with each new license purchased, illustrating their strong commitment to VMware as a core element of their data center architecture and hybrid cloud strategy.</p>
          <p>Professional services revenue was $70 million, up 17% from last year. The increase was driven primarily by our continued M&amp;A activity and a higher attach rate for professional services with large deals. Total unearned revenues ended the quarter at $2.1 billion, up 5% sequentially and 41% from a year ago. The complexity of our unearned revenue has increased over time as a result of acquisitions, an expanded product portfolio and a broader range of pricing and packaging alternatives. Over 80% of our unearned revenue represents software maintenance that will be recognized ratably, with the passage of time.</p>
          <p>Approximately 12% of unearned revenue is software license revenue, which will be recognized either ratably, upon product delivery or upon product release. In addition, approximately 7% of unearned revenue is the result of prepaid professional services, including training, which is recognized as the services are delivered. Although we are pleased with our record second quarter financial results, our license revenue growth clearly benefited from a good number of ELAs that renewed early. We will not have this benefit in the third quarter and would expect ELA bookings to decline as a percentage of total bookings.</p>
          <p>And, with our recent announcements of vSphere 5 and Cloud Infrastructure Suite, there's also the potential for short-term disruption in the sales process and close rates, as our extensive set of</p>
          <p>ecosystem partners begin the go-to-market transition. In addition, while the third quarter is traditionally strong for the U.S. federal government, growing uncertainty related to the federal budget has caused us to revise our earlier estimates downward for this sector.</p>
          <p>With this backdrop, we expect third quarter revenues to be within a range of $915 million and $940 million, or year-over-year growth of between 28% and 32%. License revenues in the third quarter are anticipated to be down 5% to 10% sequentially from the very strong second quarter. For the year, we are expecting total revenue of between $3.65 billion and $3.75 billion, or growth of 28% to 31% compared to 2010.</p>
          <p>I'll now provide some details on our operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, all references to our expenses and operating results are on a non-GAAP basis, which are reconciled in the press release tables and posted on our IR website. Our Q2 operating profit measured on a non-GAAP basis was a record $291 million, or 31.6% of revenue, compared with 29.9% in Q1 2011 and 27.7% in Q2 2010. The increase was primarily driven by operating leverage on our license revenue growth. Our non-GAAP results exclude the $56 million gain we realized from Verizon's second quarter acquisition of Terremark.</p>
          <p>During the second quarter, we added over 1,000 employees, approximately half through acquisitions and Mozy. We ended the quarter with approximately 10,400 employees, up 1,400 from the beginning of the year. We expect to continue to hire at a brisk pace in the second half of 2011. Diluted non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 a share on 430 million diluted shares. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20%. The GAAP tax rate was 10.6%. We continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20% for 2011. The GAAP tax rate is expected to be 4 to 6 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP rate.</p>
          <p>Taking into account our adjustments to GAAP operating income that Mike disclosed at the start of the call, we expect our operating margins in Q3 to decline sequentially to between 28% and 29%. The decline is primarily the result of increased expenses associated with our increased head count and recent  campus expansion. For the full year 2011, we expect the non-GAAP operating margin to approach 30%. The GAAP operating margins for the third quarter and full-year 2011 are expected to be approximately 11 to 14 percentage points lower than the non-GAAP operating margins.</p>
          <p>Although there is opportunity to expand margins at the level of scale, we fundamentally believe it is the wrong approach at this time and are building our investment model assuming we will continue to hire high-quality engineering talent and rapidly expand our international market opportunity. The  opportunities we are seizing and the investments they require are not trivial. Expect us to continue on a rapid M&amp;A and hiring pace, which can cause lumpiness in our quarterly financial results.</p>
          <p>Now on to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. Our balance sheet remains strong, with cash and short-term investments at quarter end of $3.7 billion. During the quarter, we use nearly $600 million in aggregate for M&amp;A, routine CapEx, the purchase of property related to our Palo Alto campus expansion and our share repurchase program. The expansion of our Palo Alto campus included $225 million for the acquisition of a land lease with Stanford for 70 acres which provides us the opportunity to add about a million square feet adjacent to our existing Palo Alto campus, over time and as needed. Our Palo Alto campus is now 100 acres and provides us with the necessary room to expand for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p>For your planning purposes, the capital expenditures related to our campus expansion will be approximately $50 million in the second half of 2011. This will be a multi-year project and we believe it is a great investment in one of the best locations for engineering and innovation in the world. Non-GAAP operating cash flows, which exclude adjustments for capitalization of software development costs and excess tax benefits from stock compensation, were $539 million during the second quarter, and $1.8 billion for the trailing 12 months.</p>
          <p>We adjust our operating and free cash flows for excess tax benefits because it converts to cash or reduce reduces our tax liability. Free cash flows for the quarter were $443 million. Total capital expenditures were $95 million, of which $53 million was related to our campus expansion. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flows were $1.6 billion. Free cash flow per diluted share was $1.03 for the quarter and $3.64 for the trailing 12 months.</p>
          <p>As we have mentioned, free cash flow per share can be volatile in the short term, so we believe looking at it over a trailing 12-month period is a better indicator of progress. As referenced earlier, in the second half of 2011 free cash flows will be impacted by the planned $50 million in capital expenditures related to the design and renovation work related to our campus expansion. The fully-diluted share count increased to 430 million shares for the second quarter. We expect our share count will be within a range of 430 and 440 million shares for the balance of the year.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we are very pleased with our execution and solid second quarter performance. We continue to manage our resources prudently, while making the key investments necessary to maximize our long-term growth and free cash flow per share.</p>
          <p>Paul will now make few remarks before we take questions.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon. I'd like to give you a update on our product and M&amp;A activities over the previous quarter. As Mark noted, we took a big step forward with the release of vSphere 5 into production. This is a major release in several dimensions. In terms of vSphere itself, the release provides major new functionality in terms of scale and automation. To highlight just a few new features, we <mark type="ph" /> confer (17:30) the scale to handle the heaviest workloads, providing virtual machines with up to one terabyte of virtual memory and up to 32 virtual CPUs.</p>
          <p>We can optimize storage usage and performance with the automatic and dynamic placement of virtual machines. We've significantly improved the ability of vSphere to run workloads in a nonstop fashion. And we significantly improved the automatic installation and configuration of vSphere itself. All of this has been done in partnership with the growing ecosystem of over 500 hardware and software partners who directly interact with and/or certify with vSphere.</p>
          <p>Equally importantly, we announced the creation of the industry's first complete cloud infrastructure suite, comprising vSphere itself, the vCenter Site Recovery Manager, for cross-data center business continuity, vShield, for virtualized security and edge functions, vCenter Operations, for modern infrastructure management and monitoring, and vCloud Director, for multi-tenant provisioning of resources, policy setting and self-service.</p>
          <p>The strengthening of vSphere will enable us to accelerate our customers on the journey to high levels of virtualization and the Suite will allow us to amplify the value they derive from their virtualized infrastructure. We've also increased our focus on SMB. As part of vSphere 5, we will be released virtual storage appliance that will unlock many vSphere benefits for small customers who can't afford the cost or complexity of an external storage array.</p>
          <p>We announced the acquisition of Shavlik Technologies, who had been our partner on VMware GO, which is our SMB-targeted online infrastructure services offering. With the movement of the Mozy cloud storage service to VMware, we can expect to be able to further strengthen our offerings in the SMB space.</p>
          <p>With vSphere 5, we also announced that we are replacing the previous limits on the numbers of CPU cores per license and instead using, as a metric of scale and value, the total amount of virtual memory being actually used across the entire group of physical machines. We believe that this is a better metric for the future as customers move to operating in a more cloud-like way.</p>
          <p>Customers wish to pay for what they're actually using and have the license cost scaled with actual load. There's been a fair amount of debate and comment on this since we announced vSphere 5 last week. A lot it stems from the confusion of physical RAM, which is fixed and we do not use as a metric, with pooled virtual memory that varies with load.</p>
          <p>We believe under the new model, 95% of our customers will see no change to their licensing costs. It's only as customers move to very high levels of consolidation and start driving their infrastructure to high levels of utilization, deriving the associated incremental value that licensing costs will commensurately scale. We are working closely with our customers to explain this, provide background material and get their feedback.</p>
          <p>Moving up the stack in functionality, we delivered two major releases in the dimension of our higher-level application platform and development capability. We released vFabric 5, the next iteration of our middleware collection, further optimizing it for the virtualized environment. We released Cloud Foundry, our next-generation environment for developing and deploying applications written to high-level frameworks in the cloud. Both of these releases have been well-received by the developer community, with over 25,000 developers signing up for Cloud Foundry.</p>
          <p>In the area of end-user computing, we continue to invest in our View VDI solution and, as Mark noted, are seeing success there. We will have more news about View enhancements to share at VMworld in late August. Further in the end-user space, customers are going to need solutions for securely providing capabilities to end users in a world that is increasing SaaS, mobile and social-oriented and is no longer solely dominated by Windows-based PCs.</p>
          <p>In preparation for this, we also announced the standing app of our Horizon App Manager service and the acquisition of Socialcast and SlideRocket, all of which speak to providing new capabilities to fulfill and manage user needs in a post-PC world.</p>
          <p>Finally, I would like to note that vSphere 5 is our third release of vSphere since 2009 and is a testament to the hard work and discipline of our development teams. Putting out these releases on schedule with high-quality in partnership with a large ecosystem is no small achievement. It is their effort that is enabling us to stay ahead of our competitors.</p>
          <p>And with that, we'll open up for questions.</p>

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, and a terrific quarter. My first question is about, I guess, the pull forward of early renewal on some of the ELAs. Why do you think that would happen and do you think there might have been any forward buying in front of the 5 release?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Adam, we've seen a pattern of some forward buying on ELA and ELA renewals, in particular, over the last several quarters. But as we looked at the pipeline for Q3, we had anticipated some renewals that we thought would occur in the July, August timeframe that occurred at the end of June as we closed. We don't think it's fully related to the 5.0 release, but there may have been some anticipation of it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And just a quick follow-up on 5. Historical releases have been, in some cases, pretty significant catalysts. What impact do you expect 5 to have on license revenue over the next several quarters? And if the price increase is relatively small at the high end, does that factor in even at all on your forward thinking on guidance? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>As we look at 5.0 and it's really quite similar to 4.0 with the exception that we haven't added a top-end SKU with Enterprise Plus, and so, we really don't anticipate a big uplift, particularly in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>All of our customers who are current on maintenance are entitled to the 5.0 release and, you know, as a result we expect them to be in test and <mark type="indiscernible" /> (24:40) for sometime before they put them into production.</p>

          <p>And our next question comes from Israel Hernandez of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on the quarter. With respect to the ELA pool in the back half of 2011, is there anything we should be thinking about given that we'll be anniversarying the back half of the 2008 ELAs when the economy just started to fall apart? I'm just trying to get a sense for what that pipeline shakes out in the renewal pool. And also as a follow-up, with respect to Europe, obviously, it's on everybody's minds. Did you see any changes in linearity during the quarter? It seems like sales are pretty solid, but just kind of curious as to what you saw towards the end of the quarter.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>On the ELA pool, it is the three-year anniversary and our ELAs typically run on three-year cycles. We had some very large ELAs that closed in the fourth quarter of 2008 and we don't anticipate that they will be in for renewal in Q4 of 2008. So it's factored into our guidance and why we believe ELAs as a percentage of total bookings, there will be some softness in the second half of 2011.</p>
          <p>With respect to Europe and our linearity, our quarters first of all, continued to be very back end-loaded and particularly with the strong ELA performance in the second quarter, this was even more so. And we continue to be cautious on Europe given the economies and some of the sovereign nation concerns that exist and the fact that, in many cases, the verticals are dominated by the governments. If you think of health care and education, in particular, in Europe those are sectors that the government has a significant influence on.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>And our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Mr. Rangan, your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Sorry for the background noise, I'm on a plane. Looking to make this quick. Paul, I think you said on the vSphere 5 launch that you expect 50% of workloads to be virtualized by the end of this year. I'm wondering how should we look at that relative to the growth rate that the company has been putting up, which has been very solid? What does it mean in terms of the future growth opportunities in terms of magnitude that are still left ahead? Because a 50% cutoff seems to concern some of us, just looking to get your comment on that.</p>
          <p>And as it relates to the guidance, Mark, for you, it looks like you're talking about a few risk factors out there, but your guidance actually sounds very good. And I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on those issues that you might be thinking about in your Q3 as it relates to the pricing, the channel training, the macro, et cetera. That's it for me. Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>This is Paul, Kash. Actually, what I said at the launch was that if you believe the analysts' figures, sometime over the next 12 months or so, we're likely to cross over the 50% threshold. You know that's, we believe, fundamentally good news. Remember that we essentially drive our business out of the applications that are running on virtualized infrastructure.  And as such, we have both the existing pool of applications to address as well as new applications that are coming into the pool all the time. So, that pool is not static, the pool is itself growing.</p>
          <p>Secondly, that with the introduction, in particular, of the Suite now and with other investments we're making, we're seeking to not only accelerate our customers' investment in virtualization, but actually amplify it by being able to offer additional functionality to enable them to get additional value out of their virtualized infrastructure. So, we're seeking to both accelerate and amplify.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, is that we believe that we still have untapped markets, particularly in the SMB space and in new geographies of the world. So, it's for that reason that over the last, as Mark said, over the last several years, we've been investing and will continue to invest, in particular, the developing economies of the world. And with the acquisitions and developments we're announcing now of increasing our focus on the SMB end of the market. Mark?</p>

          <p>And, Kash, on the guidance, a quarter ago we had indicated that we believe the second and third quarters would be very close, from a license bookings perspective.  But given the strong license bookings we had in Q2, we just wanted to highlight a couple of items.  First, we had deferred license revenue decrease by approximately $11 million. We don't expect that to repeat itself in the third quarter. We also had a FX tailwind of about $11 million in the quarter. And so, we've taken that out as we've factored in guidance.</p>
          <p>We also, as we looked at the pipeline and looked at the ELAs as they are playing through and then factored in that this is the U.S. federal government's year end and that there are a lot of questions about the budget and the impact the budget will have on IT spending, internally as we've thought through the process, we've brought down our expectation on the U.S. government bookings. Those are the major influences of our guidance. But overall, it's an increase in guidance modestly from where we were a quarter ago.</p>

          <p>Great. And then, Paul, just on vFabric and vSphere, v5, I'm wondering, you guys have sort of slowly but deliberately been moving towards trying to bring Java workloads onto the platform. And I'm wondering, you know, with the confluence of vFabric, a new release there, as well as v5, I'm wondering if you could articulate, sort of are you at the point now that you think you'll see an acceleration in Java workloads on the VMware platform?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, you're right that we're working towards that end; in vFabric included is one of its features are optimizations for Java running on vSphere, as well as we continue to invest in the Spring framework and the combination of the Spring framework with Cloud Foundry. But I think it would be fair to say we're still plowing the ground there. And we expect those investments to pay off well over the longer term, but we're still in the development phases.</p>

      <speaker id="7" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And then, just a quick follow-up on that. I know you have a partnership with salesforce.com in that area with VMforce, and I'm not sure if it's your business to comment here or if this is a salesforce issue, but wondering where that is from a roll-out perspective and do you still expect now with Cloud Foundry in the market to pursue that partnership on VMforce?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, we had always expected VMforce to be based on the technology inherent in Cloud Foundry and we do still expect to have a partnership and a tie between the salesforce environment and the Cloud Foundry/VMforce environment. So, that's still on the plate.</p>

          <p>Hi, guys. Great quarter. I just have a question on vCloud Director. Just what's been the feedback of that so far? And also, just sort of the acceptance and kind of where that is standing and sort of as it relates to your expectations when it was launched? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as part of the upcoming suite of products we're putting out, we are revving vCloud Director. So, there will be a new version of vCloud Director that will come out and will include some critical functions that we think that will open up additional markets, in particular, it will have a feature called Linked Clones, which is one of the key features that is in our very popular Lab Manager product, which is used for test and development environments. So, we expect to see strong acceptance of vCloud Director in our private cloud solution, particularly in the test and development arena where we've been missing this one feature to-date.</p>
          <p>At the same time, our vCloud partnerships, which are our partnerships with external service providers, continue to grow at quite a strong rate and we have over 1,000 service providers transacting off of our VSP license, which is the special license that we provide towards service providers. So, we see a bright future for that product and we're continuing to basically enhance it and take it forward as part of the overall suite.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks. Paul, just on vSphere 5, what market do you think opens up a new opportunity for you? There seems to be a lot of new storage features. Can you just talk through -- I know there's a lot of features but is there a particular market that you're excited that this really opens that wasn't available to you before? And I had a quick follow-up for Mark.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, it's really a combination of opening up new use cases, which then enables our customers to make, take greater advantage of a virtualized approach to infrastructure across the board. So, what you've seen us do is strengthen features both at the very high end, to allow us to, as I said, address, you know, Tier-I mission-critical loads more effectively than we did in the past. And at the low end, with the inclusion of things like the virtual storage appliance allow us to scale down to even smaller customer environments.</p>
          <p>But, across the board what we're trying to do is to increase the level of automation, because at the end of the day, beyond saving customers capital expense, the bigger goal is to save our customers operational expense. They fundamentally want infrastructure just to be something that, figuratively speaking, they can forget about. And that's where we're working towards.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. And Mark, just back to Adam's question on early ELA renewal. I mean, there's very few case studies we can find the software where people renew early. And I guess one of the reasons can be potentially these customers are expanding their deployments quicker than they thought so they're going to just renew earlier, because they're taking more products. Is that a factor that played in, where you saw them coming in and taking more and said we're going to renew early?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, Brent, it's a combination. One is the need for additional licenses. Second is just adding different products to their infrastructure as they move along the virtualization journey. And so, maybe you have moved from test and dev to low production and now are putting higher level workloads into production and then using our management tools. And then, of course, the sales effort on our part with desktop products as well.</p>
        </plist>

      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, great, thank you, and good afternoon. Paul, I guess I was just wondering what a typical ELA looks like today for an advanced customer versus maybe what the conversation you were having with them maybe last year, the same type of customer and kind of how the conversation has changed and what the products that they're adding on might look like today versus a year ago? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I think you &#x2013; to make a really dramatic difference, you need to go back two to three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Two to three years ago it was purely about vSphere as a technique of saving capital expense, just putting the Hyperviser on the hardware and getting greater server consolidation. Now, it's more about how do we do computing so we're as, Mark said, seeing an increasing percentage of our ELAs including the adjacent products, the Management Suite, the vFabric, View, et cetera. So, it reflects customers looking at this as rather than a simple ingredient into their environment, actually looking at this as a foundation that they're going to do a bunch of things on and that's led to the dynamics that Mark was just talking about in terms of our ELAs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="10" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And, I guess, then the follow-on to that would be when you think of the enhancements that you just announced last week, do you feel like if you were to fast-forward the clock a year that we'll be talking about the same thing, that your expectations are is that they'll be even adding more adjacent products than maybe what they even would be today, given what you've just put out?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, I certainly hope so, and what we're trying to do is to make it easier for customers to do that. You know, we're trying to build out a suite of products so they don't have to go through a very complex &#xE0; la carte integration process, that they can have key products for all the key major functions and get those easily.</p>
          <p>And certainly, as I said, we're moving to both accelerate and amplify strategy. So, we're trying to make it easy for customers to continue to use virtualization, to, you know, use their infrastructure more efficiently, but late make it easy for them to buy the amplification dimension which is really about operational simplicity.</p>

          <p>And our next question in queue comes from John DiFucci of <mark type="ph" /> JPMC (39:43). Your line is open.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you. Mark, you mentioned the potential for disruption due to the consumption-based pricing that you just announced and, Paul, you made some comments about it, talked about the discussion that's happened since then, which was just recently. You also mentioned that 95% of customers should see no change in pricing.</p>
          <p>But I want to make sure I understand that, because you say that as customers start to drive infrastructure at the higher levels of utilization, do you expect customers to benefit once that happens. In other words, are they going to see lower pricing than they would have seen if they had CPU-based pricing or is that when they actually achieve that no change in pricing?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, this is Paul. What we're trying to do is to gradually shift to using metrics that reflect the actual value and usage that the customer is getting out of the software as opposed to just how much hardware they've packed underneath it. And that is the whole direction that we believe, you know, the cloud in general is leading us that it's "pay-by-the-drink," rather than necessarily having to over-provision everything up front.</p>
          <p>So, we'd already announced a step at VMworld of last year, when we announced essentially our adjacent products in the management space, et cetera, would be based on a per virtual machine pricing. And what we're now seeking to do is introduce that same concept into the core underlying vSphere itself. So, it's not so much that we're trying to necessarily give customers either a better or worse deal. We're trying to basically change the metric that we use to measure value.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that makes sense, and if you listen, as I know you do, and I listen to customers, too, and they actually are looking for vendors such as yourself to go towards a consumption-based pricing model. At the same time, I've read some of the discussion out there on this point, and there's a lot being said and a lot of it isn't positive.</p>
          <p>And I'm just curious because when I do talk to people, they want to see this kind of thing. And it makes me think that they think they're just going to be paying more. But your point about 95% are going to see no change, I just wanted to make sure I understood that. Are they going to see no change when they eventually get to these higher levels of utilization, or are they going to see that right from the start?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>What &#x2013; from our calculations, is that the thresholds we've set are such that most customers today with their workloads will see no change. They won't require to pay us any more money. At the high-end of the market, where people move to really squeezing every last drop out of their environments and getting very high levels of utilization out of the infrastructure, that's when the pricing will start to scale up. It's our belief that that is actually a fair bargain to make, because they'll only encounter that once they really start to get value out of the whole approach of a cloud-based computing model.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And that makes sense. I appreciate that. Just one quick one for Mark, just a follow-up to <mark type="ph" /> Izzy's (43:19) question, Mark, on EMEA. And you said business was strong across all geos, but international I think grew 38% versus the U.S. 35%, and you actually called out APAC as being particularly strong. Can you break out EMEA for us on a growth rate or even roughly break it out within that international?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, we don't break it out as a separate segment so that we're not caught in the cycle of calling it out each quarter. And &#x2013; but EMEA had an quarter that was very close to where we had planned, maybe actually even a bit of pull ahead on the ELA front. We just have broader macro concerns around some of the sovereign nation issues that have been frequent in the news.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">

        <plist>
          <p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mark, can you comment on your talk about the market transition as being a risk? I would think with the ELA and the strength you're seeing on the ELA side, the market transition would be a little bit alleviated for customers.  But can you kind of talk to us on how you see that concern and what you're doing maybe to mitigate it? Thank you.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, part of the shift in the license pricing is that we have to train our ecosystem. We're a highly-leveraged business; we still do over 75% of our sales on an indirect basis and so as we &#x2013; we are not only training our own direct field and sales staff, but also training our partners and our customers. And as there has been some debate and discussion about the pricing and shifting from a per-processor model with core limitations to a virtual memory, we just anticipate that it's going to take us some time to work through that transition.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you and congratulations, as well, on a very strong quarter. With vSphere 5, the pricing for Essentials Plus will be, I believe, I think $1,000 higher per CPU than it was under vSphere 4.1. Clearly, that would seem to reflect a lot of optimism around the SMB segments. But, if you could perhaps speak to your expectations around buying behavior in the SMB as well as elasticity of demand and the value prop that you have there, that would be helpful.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Well, as I said earlier, we've been gratified by the success that we've seen with vSphere Essentials, clearly delivering a lot of value to customers and with the new features coming in, we think that the price is justified.</p>

          <p>Okay, maybe just a quick follow-up for Mark. Your sales and marketing costs went up much less sequentially in Q2 than it did in 2009 and 2010, even though generally you had a bigger jump in license revenues and bookings. I just was wondering why that was the case.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

          <p>I'm sorry, Gregg, was it the sequential change or the -</p>

      <speaker id="13" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Correct, Mark, sequential.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Part of it is just, I think, a better balance in the quota setting that we did during the quarter and making sure that we were fairly compensating our reps across the overall distribution, and not having sort of the high over performance in smaller subsectors, and that's really been the primary driver.</p>
          <p>And then, also looking at sales and marketing costs, on the marketing side and how we spread those out throughout the year and we're in a better rhythm, I believe on our sales and marketing efforts.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Hi, guys. You talked about the ELA, someone asked about the ELA pool at the end of the year. Can you just review what you think happens in terms of the pool of backlog of ELAs as it gets to the end of the year? If it does go down into next year and fewer ELA renewals, what's the impact? Is there a potential impact on cash flow since those term lengths tend to be longer than average maintenance contracts?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, if you go back in time, and we've been disclosing our ELAs as a percentage of total bookings, you can get a general idea as to the size of those pools on a quarter-to-quarter basis, and you know, as with many in the industry, and you know, really across the world, Q4 of 2008 was difficult but then led into a very challenging Q1 of 2009. And so, you can get some general sense as to the ELAs, the dollar value of the ELAs that will renew in those periods. We are generally collecting cash within 60 to 90 days after the ELA is closed, so there's also a bit of a lag there. So, there will be some impact on cash flows, you know, out through at least the second quarter of 2012.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>My question is less on collections than on term length, because maybe I'm wrong, but I think the term length tends to be longer and paid up front on ELAs than on non-ELAs.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, the average maintenance length across all licenses sold is 24 months and we require one year with each license sold regardless of the channel. For ELAs, it tends to be three years.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="14" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And if I could have a follow-up to that. You talked obviously, there's a lot more being done outside of vSphere, it's a really, really big range of products.  Is there any way we can begin to quantify how big a piece the non-vSphere products are taking up in terms bookings or product?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Again, as it really relates to overall bookings, vSphere and, really, the suite of products around vSphere are a significant majority of our business and we're not yet at the place where we need to break out individual layers as segments.</p>
