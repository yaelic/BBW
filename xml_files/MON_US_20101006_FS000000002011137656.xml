          <p>Greetings and welcome to the fourth quarter 2010 Monsanto Company earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. <mark type="Operator Instructions" /> As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.</p>
          <p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you, Mr. Hurley, you may now begin.</p>

      <speaker id="1">
        <plist>
          <p>Thank you, Rob, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining Monsanto's fourth quarter conference call. On our call this morning are Hugh Grant, our chairman and CEO; Carl Casale, our CFO; and Rob Fraley, our Chief Technology Officer. Also joining me are Manny Cruz and Reuben Mella, my colleagues in Investor Relations. Given the interest in our 2010 product performance and our 2011 guidance, Hugh will walk through our strategic approach and our status and Carl will take you through practical guidance.</p>
          <p>Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we are webcasting this call. You can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay is also available at that address. We are providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. In those cases where we refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we have provided you with a reconciliation to the GAAP measure in the slides and in the press release, which are both posted on our web site.</p>
          <p>I need to remind you that this call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language contained in our most recent 10k and today's press release.</p>
          <p>If you turn to slide four, I will walk briefly through the core financial results for fiscal year 2010, but save the time for the substance of our outlook. For the full fiscal year, ongoing earnings per share were $2.41. Embedded in that $2.41 was a fourth quarter ongoing EPS loss of $0.09. From a free cash flow perspective, our cash generation came in better than our guidance of 400 to 500 million at 564 million. Fourth quarter collections came in stronger than we anticipated, which reflected the significant source of cash received as we wrapped up collections in our U.S. business.</p>
          <p>As we go through the financial performance, we can begin with the Roundup business. For the full fiscal year, Roundup generated $142 million in gross profit against our projected range of 50 to 200 million. The fourth quarter for the Roundup business was defined by two issues that in turn drove the full year gross profit, notably volume growth following our price reduction and resolution of key elements of outstanding supply agreements in the quarter.</p>
          <p>Including the Roundup GP contribution, our Ag Productivity segment contributed gross profit of 548 million. On the Seeds and Traits side, sales were up approximately 4% for the full fiscal year. Gross profit was up slightly as the uplift we saw in sales was offset on the margin line by the launch year COGS and restructuring moves we have discussed previously. Carl will walk through more detail on seeds and traits as we look at our 2011 guidance.</p>
          <p>On the cost side of the ledger, we ended the year at a total SG&amp;A expense of 2.06 billion, which was essentially the midpoint of our projected range, as we have institutionalized the savings from our restructuring. For the full fiscal year, our restructuring charges were 324 million, which included charges for the supplemental restructuring we announced in August.</p>
          <p>The reported tax rate for the year was 25%. Excluding the impact of restructuring charges, the tax rate was 26%, which reflects the tax benefit we received from several discrete items. On an absolute dollar basis, these tax benefits were virtually the same as what we realized in fiscal year 2009. However, that absolute benefit applied to a lower earnings base magnifies the percentage benefit of the tax rate.</p>
          <p>In terms of cash deployment, we spent 532 million in the year on share repurchases, as we closed out our three-year, $800 million program a year earlier than originally planned and initiated our new three-year $1 billion authorization in the fourth quarter. We also increased our dividend from $0.265 per share to $0.28 per share.</p>
          <p>With that as background on 2010, let me give the time to Hugh.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Thank you very much, Bryan, and good morning. I appreciate you joining us for our call today.</p>
          <p>On the heels of fiscal year 2010, there's no doubt that we're looking forward to seeing the result of the changes that we've made in a new fiscal year. We reset glyphosate pricing, costs and products and we've changed our seed strategy with more products at a wider range of price points.</p>
          <p>With what we've done, I believe we have taken the steps to allow our company to return to growth and create the opportunity in 2011 to demonstrate our mid-teens earnings growth. It will be no surprise that our corn business is a core component of our growth, and to address that meaningfully, we need to consider the U.S. harvest. So I want to address harvest upfront, in particular, the data that we have, what we don't yet have, and how we think about that yield data.</p>
          <p>Simply put, how we think about yield results centers on what it means for our customer, the farmer. And because of that orientation, in the last year we shifted our strategy to create more products and pricing options that reduce the upfront risk that farmers take. That pricing has now largely rolled out to all of our selling regions. That product shift was particularly true in corn. We built our Reduced-Refuge family of products, SmartStax, VT Triple PRO and VT Double PRO. Each product will be broadly available and they line up with the three distinct regions of the Corn Belt.</p>
          <p>This family falls in alongside the proven strong performance of our triples and our base germ plasm to create what I think is the most compelling lineup that we've ever offered farmers. Given that lineup, the early feedback that I'm getting from our customers and how those farmers are talking about DEKALB this year, I feel good about the outlook, even as the data is still coming in.</p>
          <p>So as we discuss yield data today, I want to do it against the context of the products and our strategy. And just as importantly, I want to be clear on the data that we have and where we are still patiently waiting. As you can see on slide five, the harvest has run ahead this year, but it's still not done. Given the relevance of this data and the earlier than usual harvest, we'll do an official yield update sometime in early November so we can take you through the cumulative data and the statistically relevant product comparisons.</p>
          <p>Logically, the data that we have today tracks harvest. So we've projectable results in the South, which we show in slide six. This is the southern Corn Belt, where there's 25 to 35 million corn acres planted annually. Here, VT Triple PRO is our lead product. With more than 75% of our data in, VT Triple PRO has demonstrated a yield advantage of approximately 9.5 bushels an acre versus the competition. That's a particular positive for the 2011 strategy, as it signals a long-awaited shift in this geographic segment for us. Historically our advantage in the longer maturity hybrids hasn't been as strong relative to our competitors, but now our southern sales teams can demonstrate to farmers a distinct product lineup, a yield advantage and a refuge reduction for the southern Corn Belt.</p>
          <p>If you move to the next region on slide seven, we've approximately 60% of the data in our field trials on VT Double PRO. This is our new Reduced-Refuge Double Stack and it will be the lead product for the 10 to 20 million acres of the western Corn Belt. Across our testing, Double PRO is showing an approximate 8-bushel per acre advantage against the competitor's double stack traits. Double PRO now gives us a product anchor in a segment we haven't competed in before. So coming out of the gate, its performance advantage is something that we can build around. So if you consider these two pieces of data together, here's my take, Double PRO and Triple PRO are lead products for a large portion of the new Reduced-Refuge opportunity, and we now have statistically significant data on two-thirds of the products that create this new platform and the results have exceeded our expectations.</p>
          <p>Despite all the speculation, we can't be as definitive as the pronouncement on SmartStax and that's because the data isn't there yet. As we show in slide eight, the data that we have in for SmartStax is predominantly from a small part of the Corn Belt where we had only a fraction of our total SmartStax volume. But what we know from this area does inform our thinking. There, DEKALB sells dozens of hybrids but we only had a couple for SmartStax. And when you contrast this couple against an established portfolio of hundreds of our best triples, the performance of some of the hybrids with SmartStax has been variable. For the growers in this area, we have moved quickly. We sold SmartStax in 2010 as a performance-promised program. So we've been able to make sure that our customers were taken care of as a part of the plan that we had in place this year.</p>
          <p>That's the right thing to do for our customers, as we know from experience it cultivates Monsanto customers for the long run. Even as harvest continues we still have about 85% of the volume yet to be harvested with a majority in the 90 to 105-day maturities in the northern part of the Corn Belt that aren't really harvesting yet. As harvest slowly moves north, that data will roll, in but today it's not just incomplete. It's practically unpopulated.</p>
          <p>In this area, we have dozens of total SmartStax hybrids. A majority of these are new genetics so we expect that the variability that we've noted so far will find context in the performance of this broader portfolio, and, as frustrating as it is, we'll wait on that data.</p>
          <p>And I think that gets to how we define success this year. SmartStax isn't going to win every trial. It just doesn't happen and especially against triples that have got the benefit of some of our best breeding. Farmers recognize that practicality, but as we can show that the average performance in the SmartStax portfolio lines up on par with the average and our much broader triple stack portfolio, our pricing approach creates a logical case for the SmartStax upgrades to farmers who see the step change that they can take with Refuge Reduction.</p>
          <p>With SmartStax, we'd expected a 5 to 10% yield improvement over triples. That was made up by Refuge Reduction, better insect control and the reality that we'll put our newest genetics into SmartStax. As we increase acres in future years, each of those elements will come, but this year those elements aren't all there, because once again, there's not extensive insect pressure and we're limited in the portfolio of hybrids that we offer out of the gate.</p>
          <p>And that actually gets to the heart of how we rolled out our pricing strategy earlier this year for SmartStax. Without perfect insight into what the 85% of the data that remains will see, today I think we can anticipate the insect pressure will be inconsistent this year, and given that, SmartStax performance that's in line with the bulk of our high performing triple stack portfolio will enable our approach with growers.</p>
          <p>In particular, in years where there's limited bug pressure, especially corn rootworm pressure, the enhanced insect control of SmartStax doesn't create pronounced yield advantage. After three years of reduced rootworm pressure, we are telling farmers they don't have to see any increased bug pressure to justify our pricing.</p>
          <p>Simply put, our value proposition only contemplates that SmartStax delivers Refuge Reduction. That's binary, and it's something that we can point to as a direct product feature. Any benefit from a return to traditional rootworm levels will be value that the farmer can keep, and this, we expect, drives their interest and the overall penetration in these new products.</p>
          <p>If I look through our customer's lens, the value that we deliver is a function of performance and pricing, and if we show side-by-side performance that's in line with what farmers are used to seeing across the proven triple lineup, our pricing means that he can justify an upgrade on the basis of Refuge Reduction alone, and that's the conversations that farmers are already having with our sales teams during this year's harvest.</p>
          <p>So that's a lot to cover in our corn strategy, our early data and our outlook, and I know that the critical question then becomes, what does this mean for 2011? Most importantly, fiscal year 2011 is the year that we really roll out our Reduced-Refuge family of products, as shown in slide nine, and across those three products, we're on target to deliver in a range of mid teen million acres for the family.</p>
          <p>Triple stacks will be the majority of our volume in 2011 so the Reduced-Refuge family has room to step up at a logical pace as we deploy these three products where they can create the best value for each of our farmer customers. Our seed supply plan for 2011 was built to support a strong mix of triples, augmented as we scale up our Reduced-Refuge family.</p>
          <p>For SmartStax in particular, the parallels of the first year growing pains that accompanied Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans aren't lost on me or on my team. We've the flexibility with our production and deployment to focus our 2011 lineup for SmartStax around the hybrids that perform best in the geographies where farmers saw the value proposition, just like we did in the buildup of Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybean varieties this year.</p>
          <p>SmartStax takes an incremental step in 2011, a step towards filling out a portfolio of hybrids that farmers can choose from, which will come as we continue to drive ahead with our breeding program. In fact, we plan to ramp up the number of hybrids available next year on a trajectory that will put us around 100 SmartStax hybrids across our channels by the time that RIB is expected to launch in 2012.</p>
          <p>So if that's the context for this year, the next question is, what's the outlook beyond '11? That end point doesn't change. The next benefit that we can bring to farmers is the convenience and the advantage of Refuge-In-A-Bag, which continues to be the long-term game changer in corn. The EPA's expert panel review of our RIB platform is a key in this process, and that's scheduled for December of this year. That timing continues to line up well to deliver RIB to farmers for the 2012 season.</p>
          <p>The platform to deliver a single bag Refuge-In-A-Bag is created by our Reduced-Refuge products, and that's led by SmartStax and VT Double PRO. And given our unique products, we expect to be the first company to offer this single bag solution. With the promise of RIB, VT Double PRO and SmartStax build on the incremental step that we anticipate in 2011. They become a broader platform for gaining volume and converting triple stack acres beginning in 2012.</p>
          <p>I didn't spend any time today talking about soybeans. Here, too, we won't get ahead of the data, but the feeling amongst our customers is distinctly different this year than it was even a year ago on this call. The soybean data is beginning to move quickly and as that data comes in, our product concept is unchanged. We're poised to deliver around 3 to 4-bushels per acre, versus the roughly 44-bushels per year acre average yield that the USDA projects this year. Given how we priced the product, I feel very good about the value that we can deliver to farmers.</p>
          <p>And that gets me to my last thoughts before I turn over to Carl. Going into 2011, we've taken a decidedly practical approach. I believe it speaks better to what farmers are looking for than anything we have been able to offer in some time. The creation of more products at more price points, tips the performance by price-value proposition in favor of the customer. That, in turn, creates more opportunities for to us win with our customers and that's where our business needs to be both in the near term and obviously over the longer term.</p>
          <p>So with that, let me have Carl walk you through the practical elements of our guidance for this year. Carl?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3">
        <plist>
          <p>Thanks, Hugh. I'll focus on translating the fiscal year 2010 end points and the priorities Hugh described into the core operational drivers that create the elements of our expected mid-teens earnings growth. If you move to slide 10, you will see the guidance dashboard that we introduced in the third quarter. I won't go through the line items, but I will give you some detail on what I see as the major factors for 2011.</p>
          <p>Our 2011 ongoing EPS guidance range is 13% to 17% growth, which translates to $2.72 to $2.82 off of the 2010 ending point of $2.41. That mid-teens growth is underpinned by two things. The core growth we deliver from Seeds and Traits complemented by below-the-line leverage as we maintain a focus on operational discipline.</p>
          <p>Before I cover the Seeds and Traits growth, I do want to quickly address Ag Productivity as the other above-the-line item. In 2011, we expect Ag Productivity to shift into its steady state environment. We have right-sized the Roundup business, lowered prices, and will generate our steady state GP contribution on our manufacturing margins. Based on that, we project $250 to $300 million in GP contribution for Roundup. As the remainder of Ag Productivity normalizes off its 2010 strength, overall gross profit for the total reporting segment is expected in the range of $550 to $600 million. With an improvement of the Roundup cost structure, we expect the whole segment to be an EBIT contributor as well.</p>
          <p>The driver of our above-the-line growth in 2011 is Seeds and Traits. Practically, we expect overall gross profit for seeds and traits in the range of 5.1 to 5.2 billion which represents double digit growth in 2010. On an absolute level, our Seeds and Traits GP in 2010 was 4.54 billion. And as you'll recall, we made conscious choices to enable our product strategy which resulted in restructuring and a one-time adjustment to our U.S. hedged corn production, reducing GP by approximately $130 million.</p>
          <p>Our ongoing EPS of $2.41 reflects the portion that comes from the one-time restructuring costs. So our 5.1 to $5.2 billion Seeds and Traits gross profit target is double digit growth off a practical baseline of approximately 4.7 billion. Growth comes from contributions across our portfolio as we expect gross profit lift from corn, soybeans, cotton and vegetables in 2011. If you isolate on the compositions of the Seeds and Traits GP target, there are a couple of fundamental drivers of bridge. First the growth comes from seed unit volume growth and mix improvement. We expect global Seeds and Traits unit volume growth in the single digits in 2011. That will be complemented by trait mix, as there are meaningful upgrades in soybeans, cotton and significantly in corn.</p>
          <p>Likewise, there's a mix benefit as we consistently refresh our germ plasm offerings globally. That means overall Seeds and Traits gross profit growth comes from mix and volume, not price, in 2011. Within the big drivers, soybeans will be keyed off increased penetration of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. As part of our overall product and pricing strategy, we've positioned Roundup Ready 2 Yield so our performance advantage and our pricing approach invigorates adoption. In particular, we expect Roundup Ready 2 Yield to increase from the 2010 base of approximately 6 million acres to mid-teens millions of acres in 2011.</p>
          <p>As you shift to corn, the first area of opportunity is Latin America. Even with a reduction of corn planted acres in Brazil, the margin uplift that we expect as we make more traits available in both Brazil and Argentina creates a significant source of gross profit.</p>
          <p>The final significant factor is U.S. corn product strategy on slide 11. Hugh walked through how we set up the product strategy to give us more products at more price points for our farmers. Like the overall Seeds and Traits target, we expect the gross profit growth from the US strategy to come entirely from mix and volume.</p>
          <p>First, there's a mix benefit that comes as we turn over the portfolio to new, better performing germ plasm. The benefit of the germ plasm upgrade is significant. When new germ plasm enters the portfolio, the products that fall out are several years old. So especially on triple stacks in 2011, we will upgrade the base germ plasm and our average gross profit is higher on a bag because there's been a steady lift on the seed performance.</p>
          <p>Second, we see the three products in the Reduced-Refuge family ramping up to a range of mid-teens millions of acres in 2011. That will be a mix of VT Triple PRO, VT Double PRO, and SmartStax. Within this family, the margin we realize in 2011 on a branded bag of SmartStax and VT Triple PRO are effectively equal, but as some of the launch year costs begin to recede, our cost position on these products is better and there's a year-over-year GP benefit versus 2010.</p>
          <p>Additionally, all three of the Reduced-Refuge family of products allow more non-refuge acres to be planted. Those refuge acres then are being converted from typically lower value single stack products to higher value, higher traded Reduced-Refuge family products. That's an incremental increase that benefits our overall mix, increasing trait intensity and lifting GP per acre.</p>
          <p>The final component is volume growth. In 2010, our DEKALB share was effectively flat while regional brands were down slightly. As we move to 2011, the fact that we have held triple stack prices effectively flat across the portfolio, and we have our Reduced-Refuge family products at adoption-oriented pricing, sets us to return to unit volume growth in the U.S.</p>
          <p>So as we grow volume, whether it's in triple stacks or through the Reduced-Refuge family products, we add GP contribution for both the trait value and the germ plasm. All of that comes together in the strategy that offers farmers more products at more price points, but in doing so, we expect the average gross profit per acre to increase in 2011. Below the line, we have shifted from giving guidance on a percent of sales to providing absolute ranges for SG&amp;A and R&amp;D, because what we need to spend is what we need to spend. It's not linked to revenue.</p>
          <p>Foremost is our SG&amp;A which actually reflects some of the results we have delivered from our restructuring actions. With the cost savings we have realized because of that restructuring, we've achieved a reduced run rate shown on slide 12. While restructuring benefits both COGS and SG&amp;A, we remain on track to deliver the $300 to $340 million in total savings from the overall restructuring. Applying the SG&amp;A benefit of that restructuring, we reduced our 2010 SG&amp;A by more than $200 million from our 2008 baseline run rate, all while establishing a cost structure in line with our steady state chemistry business. That means from the 2010 base of $2.06 billion, we can project a range of 2.06 to 2.16 billion, which is flat to inflationary increase in 2011. This range anticipates that we'll have employee incentives in 2011 but we'll maintain the discipline so that we grow the core of our business without a corresponding uptick in SG&amp;A.</p>
          <p>On the R&amp;D line, we ended fiscal year 2010 with an R&amp;D spend of 1.2 billion which was typical of the 10% per year increase we've had over the past several years. In 2011, R&amp;D will be resourced for success, but our R&amp;D spend rate will be somewhat lower than the 10% CAGR that we've seen. Practically, that translates to a projected R&amp;D spend of 1.25 to 1.3 billion.</p>
          <p>As we walk down the P&amp;L, our focus is on bringing the above-the-line and below-the-line opportunity together. We're a company that is growing in its core operations and augmenting that with leverage below the line. While the ultimate measure of that is mid-teens ongoing EPS growth, we also see a direct benefit in 2011 to EBIT.</p>
          <p>The last portion of our 2011 guidance relates to cash flow on slide 13. Our earnings have to translate into cash that we return to our owners. For 2011, we expect cash generation to rebound to a higher level, with free cash flow in the range of $800 to $900 million.</p>
          <p>That reflects cash from operations in the 1.7 to $1.9 billion range. That year-over-year expansion is driven by our expectation that cash generation grows with the core of our business. That's augmented by heavy focus on managing working capital as given the steady state for our Roundup business, we'll focus on receivables and inventory management. Additionally, our guidance is inclusive of the remaining cash payments for restructuring of approximately $150 million after tax.</p>
          <p>The core growth of our business and the health of our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to reinvest for our customers and owners while returning additional value through dividends and share repurchases. With the new three-year authorization already underway, we see share repurchases as an effective way to offset share dilution, and that will be a continued use of cash for us. Just as importantly, we believe in the value of consistently paying out a portion of earnings to our owners as dividends and then allow you how to decide how to best invest that cash outlay.</p>
          <p>Our outlook on 2011 is practical and focused. Our drivers have not changed. We will see growth from Seeds and Traits and that growth will be driven by the factors we have always pointed to: the upgrade of Roundup Ready 2 Yield; the move to SmartStax and our Refuge Reduction platform in corn; and the trait upgrade strategy in Latin America. Our focus is on execution. We've accounted for the critical variables. We've made the adjustments and we have the plans in place to bring this to fruition. When we execute, we'll see growth in our core business, complemented with leverage from SG&amp;A discipline and that's the path to our mid-teens growth.</p>
          <p>With that, let me turn the time to Bryan for questions.</p>

          <p>Thank you and good morning, everybody. I'd actually like to talk about optimal capital structure, just given that your stock's come in considerably as it seems like the market's very concerned about SmartStax. You guys just gave pretty confident remarks about the future, so Hugh and Carl, you guys bought some stock back back in July, pretty material amount. So you guys are clearly in disagreement with the equity markets about valuation.</p>
          <p>So we just look out and see where lending rates are, maybe about 4.5% for you guys and you pay a 2.3% dividend yield. So your after-tax cost of borrowing to buy back stock on our math would be less than 1%. I guess the question is, as you seek to rebuild your shareholder base here, why not buy back 10, 15, 20, 25% of shares outstanding, still maintaining an investment grade credit rating but really incentivize investors to stick with the stock by providing them a levered return on the upside but also material downside protection because you'd be buying back so much stock? Thanks.</p>

      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Vincent, thank you for that concise summary. I'll let Carl say a few words. I guess the thing I'm particularly proud of is we're a technology company that generates a bunch of cash, and that cash generation, I think, looks strong for the future. And as Carl mentioned in his remarks, not to the extent that you're advocating, but we've been aggressive in our increased dividend policy and our continued commitment to buy back, but more from the perspective of offsetting a dilution in creep. But, Carl, maybe your thoughts, given seasonality and how we look at buybacks or relative to Vincent's larger suggestion.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, Hugh. Yeah, Vincent, as I think about it, we're obviously committed to returning value to our owners in 2010. We repatriated over $1 billion between dividends and share repurchases, as Hugh mentioned. And our Treasury group is constantly looking at ways &#x2013; at how we create value for our owners longer term.</p>
          <p>Relative to the specific issue of leverage, with the change in our business cash flows, with the reduction of Roundup and the seasonality of the Seeds and Traits business, we do enter the commercial paper markets frequently, and our credit rating allows us to have ready access to both quantities of paper, as well as attractive pricing. So if we were to contemplate something like that, I think we'd have to take a pretty considered approach to what effect that might have on our credit rating and consequently our access and pricing in the paper markets. But I do understand the concept that you laid out.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="4" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay. I guess my question was also really if you could just address &#x2013; because over time, you're going to generate a lot of cash flow and it's going to build on the balance sheet, and do you want to have a net cash balance sheet or is there some level of leverage you'd ultimately like to have?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I don't think about it so much as what we want our net leverage position to be. If you think about what we actually did in 2010, we actually repatriated more cash for our owners than we generated. So we actually pulled cash off the balance sheet. So I wouldn't say that we'd necessarily let it accumulate.</p>
          <p>We're not opposed to leverage if we think that it can be put to use to create value for our owners over the long-term, additional cash flows that would benefit the business and the operations of the business. I was just pointing to the consideration that we would have to make because of our use of cash and access to the commercial paper markets, we would just want to be thoughtful as to what the impact of leverage would do to us there.</p>

          <p>Through the nine months, your volume growth in seeds and genomics was negative three, and the fourth quarter is not a large volume quarter, and in rough terms, planted acreage and corn in the United States was up a couple of percent this year. And it's hard to make out the global data, but it seems similar on a global basis.</p>
          <p>So when you look at acreage being up, I don't know, one to two, and your overall seeds and genomics volumes being down three, it looks like you had material share loss, both in corn and in soybeans. And if I had to roughly estimate it, I'd say maybe 4%. Is that correct? And if it's not correct, in order for you to hold share in corn, you'd need to grow a couple of percentage points, isn't that correct? And the data doesn't seem to point to that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Hey, Jeff, thanks very much for your question. So you're right, the U.S. acreage was up. International &#x2013; or the key areas in international were flat to down.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And in particular, Brazil. And Brazil is interesting because the amount of grain that they're growing is up, but they're growing more grain on fewer acres. So for the second year in a row, we saw Brazilian acres skinnying back although their production is up, and that's a function of better hybrids and better technology. So we saw good performance in a skinnier market in Brazil.</p>
          <p>In the U.S., and Carl mentioned this in his comments, you're right. Our branded growth was flat, and our ASI brands were down. So it's our goal as we -- so that kind of balances your math. International was down and the U.S. was up on produced acres. As we're looking at 2011, Carl, and I think you made this point, our anticipation is we will drive volume growth in the 2011 timeframe. And we have to. It's unacceptable it'd be flat again.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="5" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So just to clarify, in your guidance for gross profits next year, do you assume that planted acreage in the United States is flat in corn, or do you assume it's, say, up 3% as many forecasters do?</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">

      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, good morning. Hugh, I appreciate you providing the transparency in the form of the yield data on your website this year. I understand it's early as well, but when we look at that data, there seems to be a significant negative variance between the SmartStax yields and the VT Triples and a more substantial negative variance between SmartStax and Genuity VT Triple PRO. And in that context, I was wondering if could you comment on how much of that variance you might attribute to sort of intrinsic factors like germ plasm and trait performance versus exogenous issues like weather and insect pressure? And looking ahead, should we expect VT Triple PROs to maybe carry more of the load in terms of growth contributors over the next three plus years?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Kevin, thanks. So it's a big &#x2013; I'll try and be concise and I'm going to look to Dr. Fraley for a few comments, but I appreciate the gratitude on the transparency. Frankly, I don't know if the transparency has helped us or hurt, because a lot of projections are made on pretty thin, early data. So let me just kind of try a headline or two and then I'll ask Rob to talk a little bit about methodology and your question on variability, I think is really the heart of your question.</p>
          <p>How we think about SmartStax is exactly how growers play it back to us, and the grower feedback is this is a path to Refuge-In-A-Bag. It's a stepping stone that gets them to RIB and that's where their long-term interest in this is. So fundamentally, the technology works. It kills bugs and it kills them really, really well. So it's not a technology challenge. It's a combination of early days for the genetics and narrow sample size and very low bug populations. That's unfortunate. It's good news for the grower. It's a challenge for us as a technology provider, but that's the hand that we have been dealt this year, particularly low rootworm pressure.</p>
          <p>If you think about this, the task for us is building out that hybrid portfolio. So populating that portfolio, just the way we did in beans between this year and last. And as I mentioned today, we think by 2012 we'll be ramping that portfolio to around 100 hybrids. If you think about the transparency in the data and you think about a lot of the modeling and the work that's gone on so far, I think the piece that gets missed in this is, in a really low bug density year, if we achieve parity with triples, then that puts us in the zone because the piece that isn't reflected in the data that we publish, but it's the piece you hear from the growers is, the swing vote becomes the refuge acre.</p>
          <p>But we're really looking at this in terms of, Rob, I guess would you say average to average or peak to peak.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think the key is we've got roughly 30 plus SmartStax hybrids out there across our DEKALB, our ASI and our licensed brands and we've seen a small amount of data in that's been skewed by the spotty performance of a couple of the hybrids, 6121 and a few others. There's no doubt about that, but I think as we see the data start coming into the north with really the power alley of the SmartStax hybrids, I think the expectation that you targeted in terms of SmartStax hybrids matching the performance of triples in a low bug pressure year is quite realistic.</p>
          <p>There's a lot of work and, as you pointed out, there's a lot of data out this and it's complicated and it's pretty much raw data. We'll be back sometime in early November with a thorough analysis and comparison. But for that data to be used up effectively in the comparisons, we have to correct for and evaluate for grain moisture content, for hybrid day zone length, for the refuge yields and the overall traited acre percentage and then the number of hybrids in trials.</p>
          <p>So I think there's probably about as much confusion regarding the data as there is insight.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="6" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>So a brief follow-up, if I may, related to SmartStax, are the accruals that you've taken for the dealer credit program sufficient to cover expected claims at this point?</p>

We're not going to make our 5 to 10%, but I think parity versus high-performing triples and using the refuge as the casting vote is how we're thinking about framing this year.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I want to discuss the trait integrations for corn and soybeans. What can you tell us to assure that the SmartStax issue this year is a germ plasm issue and not a trait integration issue -- or if you had a good extra rootworm year?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>P.J., thanks very much for your question. I think it is well known. I think it's recognized that Herculex rootworm is more difficult to work with than some of our traits like YieldGard cotton borer because there is an interaction with the germ plasm, but we do two things in how we screen that, Rob, and maybe just a word to P.J.'s point on the methodology and what we have done to accommodate this.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So, basically, P.J., as Hugh said, it's well known that Herculex has some challenges to work with it and we went into this fully aware of that. As a result of that, we really used the broad breadth of germ plasm that Monsanto has across all of its brands and channels and tested and identified the specific combinations that meet our hybrid qualifications specifications. You know, so for us to launch a new hybrid what our team basically looks at, in addition to obviously the overall agronomics is that we won't launch a new hybrid unless it yields better than its isogenic hybrid.</p>
          <p>So when we're launching a new SmartStax hybrid, it has to yield better than the isogenic starting hybrid. So that's how we ensure that in the germ plasm that we select and the hybrids that we launch that there aren't challenges unique to a particular gene. And I think as the season plays out with the distribution of yields we'll see across those 30 SmartStax hybrids, you'll see that when we pull all the data together in November.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And secondly, a bit longer term question on soybeans. At what point do you think you will have enough confidence that you will stop breeding the hybrids into Roundup Ready 1?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think the core question is around the breeding in Roundup Ready 1, which fundamentally we have already put behind us.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="8" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>The question is you're breeding all your new varieties in Roundup Ready 2 now. At what point do you stop doing that in Roundup Ready 1 and switch to Roundup Ready 2?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, P.J., just a couple of points. So we're obviously highly confident with the Roundup Ready 2 Yield performance and, as Hugh indicated in his comments, we're just starting to see the yield data coming in, but so far as the USDA is projecting 44 bushels we're very confident that we'll see the 3 to 4 bushel target that we have for Roundup Ready 2 Yield, and that's been our goal from the start of our transitioning with Roundup Ready 2 Yield.</p>
          <p>And so I think to your specific point, our breeding efforts in Roundup Ready 1 have been stopped, actually, several years ago. So the full force of our breeding engine is now driving forward on Roundup Ready 2 Yield and then obviously, working through the integration of the Dicamba tolerance and our biotech yield traits. So we're gearing towards the launch of the soybean triple a few years from now, based on the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform.</p>

      <speaker id="8" type="q">

      <speaker id="7" type="a">

          <p>A question on pricing and thank you for the discussion of the gross profit per acre and the emphasis on price mix trends for corn. How do you think about price mix trends for both corn and soy going forward? That is, is 2011 to be viewed as a template or should we see an acceleration as we get closer to the launch of drought? And even &#x2013; and as you think about your longer term targets, is there a minimum price mix trajectory that you need to get to, to justify the R&amp;D investment on new traits?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Carl?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, as we think about the business going forward and, as we mentioned in the call, we've now got a business model that's predicated on unit volume growth and mix gains. And a big driver of the mix gains that sometimes aren't widely appreciated is what happens when we incorporate new genetics into a portion of our portfolio every year. And that's going to be the same -- is the same regardless of whether it's corn, cotton, soy or vegetables.</p>
          <p>And then as we introduce the new traits on top of that, we'll continue with the pricing that we've chosen to on a more of aggressive penetration standpoint, and it will be &#x2013; a combination of those two things that continue to drive this going forward. But that model is more than adequate to justify the R&amp;D that's associated with bringing these new traits to market because of the value that they deliver.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="9" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And so we should be thinking about drought probably would have the same penetration discipline -- or penetration pricing discipline, and that would be adequate?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>My answer would be yeah, and that's consistent with how we positioned it before. And part of the reason is farmers haven't experienced the technology yet. So we have to provide the incentive for them to realize and see the benefits that are associated with it.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>I think that's a big piece of the learning in the last year, and that will form our thinking going forward. And then the only other piece I would add to Carl's comments is soybeans is kind of interesting because -- and it ties back to P.J.'s question -- there's an opportunity. I think as we look forward in soybeans, you see a stacking opportunity similar to what we've seen in corn, where it begins with Roundup Ready 2 Yield as a platform that demonstrates yield, but in the future Dicamba-improved oils and ultimately intrinsic yield genes will be loaded on to that platform. So as we do that, I think there's opportunities -- as we deliver that value, there's opportunities to improve the mix and performance in beans as well.</p>

        <plist>
          <p>Hugh, can you talk a little bit about &#x2013; maybe from an entomology standpoint, the issue of bugs and variability in bug pressure? Is there any sense that maybe your success is creating a problem? And then as you try to sell SmartStax in the early stages as a Refuge Reduction benefit, if there aren't any -- as many bugs, does that not moderate that benefit as well? And is my math right that your new SmartStax target for next year is sort of an 8 to 10 million-acre range? Thanks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>So thanks for the questions, Bob. So population dynamics and I don't think the thinness in population is a reflection in our effectiveness. I think the bugs -- you know they oscillate and we've seen three thin years, particularly in rootworm. Rob, I don't know if you can say how this thing ebbs and flow. The key thing for us is rather than praying and hoping for bugs, which is kind of perverse, we've turned this round the other way and we said the benefit in this is Refuge Reduction, we'll price against the Refuge Reduction. We'll drive penetration. We'll share more value and if the bugs turn up, the grower keeps that value. But maybe a few words on just how this works in real life.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I think, Bob, so focusing in particularly on rootworm which is certainly ultimately a key insect. In terms of the improved rootworm control of SmartStax, I mean, the last couple of years have been very low populations if you look at an historical level. Most of the entomologists that I have spoken to on this view that to be directly attributable to the excess of early season rainfalls and literally the drowning of the larvae in the fields.</p>
          <p>There were early high populations that were diminished and I don't see anything that says that the overall population is being diminished. In fact, in many ways the rootworm pest, as you have both the variants that feed on soybeans and the diapause variants that skip generations, is actually becoming more and more voracious and I think most growers realize that. I think as we're looking at the positioning of SmartStax with the way we priced it and have positioned it in the marketplace, the refuge benefit is absolutely real. And if I'm a corn grower already starting to think about next spring, knowing that I'm looking at a market where potentially there's $5 corn, and I'm going to be increasing my acres and I'll probably be planting at least a third of my corn on corn after corn, SmartStax makes an awful lot of sense in that environment.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>And then your other piece, Bob, was the Refuge family, the composition of SmartStax and then the margin effect. Carl, maybe a few words on that.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure. We haven't called the composition of the acres within the mid-teens millions that we expect for the family of Reduced-Refuge products for 2011 and the benefit of having a family of products that are all essentially margin equivalent is we can have that flexibility within the portfolio. The farmers can choose what they want and we're not dependent upon any single product within the family. We feel good about the mid-teens and the flexibility that our lineup gives us to achieve this.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>I'm sorry, can you hear me?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>We can now, David.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Sorry about that, Hugh.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>No problem.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>How do you -- just on SmartStax, Hugh, how do you set the damage to the brand, if any, from the farmers who planted the 6121 and had the poor results and does that have -- does that have long legs to it?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, I'll let Rob talk about the 6121. My experience over the years is if a grower has an issue and you get on that farm quickly and acknowledge that issue, then you got a customer for the following year. The proof of that is in the work we did in soybeans last year, but 6121 and its variants have been good workhorses in the past. So, Rob, maybe a word on reputation and how 6121 -- and its lineage, how it's shown up.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, so just a couple of things there and, as Hugh said, recognizing and certainly we acknowledge there's been a challenge with 6121, and the sales team has really addressed it. The thing -- I guess a couple of points I'd make is we talk about SmartStax and that's the sound bite here, but from a grower's experience, SmartStax is really 30 individual hybrids. And in the particular case of hybrid 6121, the performance has been spotty this year. And that's disappointing to us.</p>
          <p>The precursor genetics to 6121, which is the 6119 family, have performed extremely well in that same geography, both in 2008 and 2009, but, as you know, this year was different. And we had really warm weather in that geography, and particularly we had very high nighttime temperatures, which neither 6121 or 6119 liked, and so both of them were down that year. That type of variability happens and -- but the performance was clearly below our expectation.</p>
          <p>One of the things I always just like to point out from how a grower perceives that, so they know there was an issue with 6121 and 6119. But overall, even as the performance wasn't what we expected, 6121 still beat the competitive hybrids about half the time when you looked at all the trials. So, it was a pretty decent product, and I think as we position our offerings for next year, 6121 will still be a significant component of the pipeline, probably in a little bit more of a northern geography.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>That's very helpful. And just lastly, Hugh, on value capture, is your 50% target still achievable for SmartStax in a reasonable amount of time?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Over time, I think $5 corn helps. $5 corn helps enormously, but, yeah, I think so. The key for us, and it's been a painful process, but the key for us is driving penetration and demonstrating that value on farm. And despite 6121 -- and that's life in a biological system, but despite that, the piece that's got masked in the past few weeks is just the phenomenal performance of DEKALB germ plasm overall. We're winning ties, and it's hard to believe when you read some of the reports, but in the countryside and on the sales team, there's a lot of optimism right now. So we're focusing on the grower, and we'll do this one field at a time, David.</p>

      <speaker id="11" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Okay, thank you very much, Hugh.</p>

      </speaker>
      <speaker id="1" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Rob, with that, I think we probably have time for one more question before Hugh has some concluding remarks.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="0">
        <plist>
          <p>Sure, sir. That question will be coming from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, thank you, a question on market share and actually in soybeans, I know you lost market share in soybeans this year, and I've seen numbers of three to four points down, maybe you can confirm that? My impression is that the growers didn't necessarily want RR2, wanted RR1 and you didn't really have it to supply to them since you had such a high volume of RR2.</p>
          <p>Is there an analogy to SmartStax here that if for some reason they want the underlying -- still want the underlying VT Triple and you don't have it, that you run the risk of losing share and I'm referring to just SmartStax here. I know presumably on Double PRO and VT Triple PRO that that will enable you to gain share in areas where you've been historically below your average. So if you could just comment on soybean and the potential analogy for corn share in 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, thanks for the question. Good to hear your voice. We would be down two to three share points in soybeans. The analogy I don't think translates in corn because as we look at our production plans and we look at what we have, and also the anticipation of what we're going to see in the north, we've got enough buffer between our three Refuge products to satisfy our anticipated demand. I don't know, Carl, if you have anything else to say.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yes, that would be complemented by the fact that the vast majority of our portfolio for '11 is still going to be VT Triples and we're having really, really good performance in the field this year. So we feel comfortable we'll be in a position to supply the farmer whatever they want to purchase.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>And as a follow-up on your soy share, I know you've had much better performance this year on RR2, would you anticipate regaining that lost share in 2011 or what's in the numbers, Carl? Are you anticipating up share in soy in 2011, in your guidance?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="3" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Basically the way we think about it going forward, Don is we talk about unit volume growth across the portfolio globally, basically in the single digits. And so that's basically what our numbers are built on for 2011.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Don, and to your point as I go out and talk to a lot of growers, as you know I do, probably the biggest feedback I hear from soybean growers is they wish they would have planted more Roundup Ready 2 Yield this year.</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="12" type="q">
        <plist>
          <p>Is there another analogy, too, that RR2 shows as you get a new product in more varieties or hybrids that you tend to get a better performance and that opens up the opportunity for share gains?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Absolutely. That's where the analogy that you discussed earlier does apply, because as you get more shots on goal, you get a better chance to score. And I mean, Rob, just rough numbers, what's that expansion been?</p>
        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="7" type="a">
        <plist>
          <p>Yeah, obviously as all the data comes in, we'll cover that in November, but,  I think, Don, maybe a couple of points. First of all, we've got 30 SmartStax hybrids out there competing against probably 300 plus triples and we're  populating a new curve against a really established base. And, clearly, the first couple of hybrids that we've talked in the south haven't performed where we would have liked, but I think as we see that performance shift to the north and we now start to see the large populations, my anticipation is SmartStax will match up, you know, very strongly to triple performance this year and look very good.</p>
          <p>But I think importantly to your point, we'll have, like I said, 30 plus triples out across Monsanto genetics this year. As we go to the future, we're going to ramp up to probably close to 100 plus hybrids by 2012 and that's going to give us the ability to position that genetics and drive the volumes and the performance that -- more geographically and that in many ways mirrors the kind of expansion that we were able to have with Roundup Ready 2 Yield. So we're focused on that approach.</p>

      <speaker id="12" type="q">

        </plist>
      </speaker>
      <speaker id="2">
        <plist>
          <p>I'll be very brief because we've run over the hour a little bit. I think today -- I recognize we spent a fair amount of time talking more and talking earlier than we ever have in the past about harvest results and how that shapes our outlook on our business going forward, but we won't get ahead of the data. For me, the context of these results really lies with our customer.</p>
          <p>So we've focused on giving farmers the most profitable product options for their farm and we're trying hard to back that with our actions from our new products to new price points. So in the near term, the data will come this year, and I believe firmly that it's going to reinforce the value that we are creating for the grower.</p>
          <p>So, as difficult as it is, we'll be patient. In the longer term, we're bringing farmers the best products in this industry and that does create an opportunity for us and for them. As we demonstrate that value, farm by farm, year by year, the growth for our company will follow. So from our end, we remain focused, focused on the customer and focused on delivering, and I appreciate your support and for joining us on the call today. Thank you very much.</p>
